Average player counts are have been cut in half since then, in less than a year.<p>I have almost 200 hours in Beat Saber, but I haven&#x27;t played it for almost a year now, now that it&#x27;s just the same two-dozen songs over and over.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;steamcharts.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;620980#1y" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;steamcharts.com&#x2F;app&#x2F;620980#1y</a>')
