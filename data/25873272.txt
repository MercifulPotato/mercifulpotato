Item(by='slightwinder', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611334088, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25872700, text='RIP.<p>The curse of Babylon 5 strikes again...<p>Not that there really is a curse, but there is an interessting statistical anomaly that an unusual high amount of people involved with bablyon 5 die early. More than half of the maincast has now died (all in the age 40-65). Even IMDB has a page for this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;list&#x2F;ls023048945&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;list&#x2F;ls023048945&#x2F;</a><p>Interessting part is that the production of bablyon 5 already met some unlucky envents at it&#x27;s production. And the series itself had the curse of the babylon-project as part of it&#x27;s lore. Probably from this the meme about a curse leaped over to real world.')
