For servers it&#x27;s a different story, but for a desktop I&#x27;m fine dealing with some instability for better performance.<p>But these days with the RAM density being so high and bitflipping attacks being more than a theoretical threat it seems like there&#x27;s really no good reason not to switch to ECC everywhere.')
