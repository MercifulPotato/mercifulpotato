The first two hours after I take it are a come up. My symptoms are different each time I take it: Sometimes I&#x27;m half cognizant at that time, sometimes normal.  Sometimes I get very sleepy and want to take a nap.  Sometimes it makes me feel like I have low blood sugar during the come up and I start mildly shaking needing to eat something.  Sometimes an arm or my arms will go to sleep during the come up, which happens to me on lsd (but not mushrooms) as well.  But once the come up is over, usually within an hour and a half, I feel completely normal like I took nothing.<p>I&#x27;m probably abnormal.  I imagine if you take it while you do not have a migraine you&#x27;ll get a mild heightened experience that may or may not be noticeable.  It is, after all, a triptan.<p>Oddly, 4-aco always made my mind feel clear the way you&#x27;re describing.  A bit more awareness, a bit more clarity.  On 4-aco I wouldn&#x27;t notice much or any come up.  It was just the effects from the drug getting stronger over the first hour.')
