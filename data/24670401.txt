So the argument &quot;Everyone else does it&quot; doesn&#x27;t hold water. USA still pays the unreasonable rate though, so it seems like they are missing something in their legalization. If American courts refuse to do anything against credit card companies I doubt they will do much in this case either, epic should just have gone to the EU court instead.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;congress-blog&#x2F;economy-budget&#x2F;262142-if-europe-can-rein-in-credit-card-fees-why-not-us" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;congress-blog&#x2F;economy-budget&#x2F;26214...</a>')
