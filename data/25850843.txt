I have been a gear head since I was a teenager and I have used all sorts.  For the last decade I have worked elusively with film because I want to enjoy it while it is here to enjoy.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that for most because it is expensive and can be frustrating when you don&#x27;t get good results.<p>If you want to make the jump to something more capable I recommend skipping all the stuff in the middle like mirrorless, 4&#x2F;3, or high end point and shoot.  Nothing wrong with these if it is what you want.  However, I recommend you get a digital SLR.  Decide on a budget.  If it is small, buy used.  Heck if it is big it still doesn&#x27;t hurt to buy used.  Especially lenses and tripods.  I have never purchased a new camera, lens, or tripod.<p>Prioritize your purchase in this order:<p>- A book about the photo style that interests you.<p>- Lens or lenses.  This is the most important thing.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how awesome your camera is if you are sticking low quality glass on it.<p>- A good tripod you can tolerate carrying for extended periods of time.  The number one thing you can do to take better pictures is to use a tripod.  For most, tripods are an afterthought.<p>- A digital SLR body.<p>I recommend this order because lenses are very long term investments as are tripods.  They can last a lifetime.  Bodies churn constantly and you can always get a better one later.<p>If I were going to buy a DSLR today, most likely I would choose Nikon (but I&#x27;m already invested in Nikon glass).  I would probably go for a D750 (D700 if money is tight, or a newer variant if I&#x27;m feeling flush) and a 50mm f&#x2F;1.4 AF-D.  If I wanted to shoot portraits an 85mm or so would be my next lens.  Otherwise I really like the 35mm f&#x2F;2 AF-D for landscapes and general use.  All of this said, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong choosing from any of the major manufacturers.  Favor full frame over crop sensors.')
