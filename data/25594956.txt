The funnel is typically teachers complaining about classroom behavior and entering that funnel is biased towards specific personality types (and also towards people who get screening because of other learning disorders).<p>I also think there is a socialization problem from a fairly young age.  Many elementary schools have zero-tolerance on fighting these days, but I&#x27;ve observed many preschool environments where the teachers are fatalistic about boys roughhousing, but will take girls to task about the same behaviors.  It&#x27;s certainly likely that there are biological differences as well, but the current environment seems designed to magnify them.')
