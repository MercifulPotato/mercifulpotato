That firewall will of course be default-drop because otherwise why bother.<p>With that firewall in place, nodes on the outside of the firewall cannot talk to nodes on the inside without some configuration. So the fact that the nodes share an address space is moot.<p>My point was that punching a hole in that firewall requires a similar effort or solution that adding a NAT rule does.')
