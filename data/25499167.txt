There are also some competing priorities here.<p>Policy makers set speeds that balance traffic flow, safety, fuel economy, and wear and tear on infrastructure. The infrastructure itself is often built to support much higher speeds.<p>Another thing to consider is that overly wide lanes, very large signs, and relative lack of landmarks makes you feel like you&#x27;re moving slower than you actually are. This is often why you&#x27;ll find place where people uniformly drive 10mph over the limit. It may be a safe speed on a clear sunny day with light traffic, but that isn&#x27;t really how the limits are set.<p>TL:DR Speed limits are a lowest common denominator thing, and can be at odds with built infrastructure under ideal situations. Speed traps also exist.')
