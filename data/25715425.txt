The software running the replication, and the storage backing it, will be local. Insofar you will always eventually <i>want</i> to run this locally.<p>Now, <i>of course</i> some fine folks are working around that with modern web tech (see @arj&#x27;s sibling comment) but the whole idea of this project is that you will locally control your data.')
