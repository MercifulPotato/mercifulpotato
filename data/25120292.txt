Item(by='one2know', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605587730, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25110667, text='Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Hackernews, Reddit, Youtube&#x2F;Google all &quot;came out&quot; this election cycle with heavy far left censoring.  LinkedIn doesn&#x27;t even have user generated comments anymore.  They have editors picks.  Twitter editorialized virtually every comment about the election and covid-19.  Youtube will ban you if you say something they don&#x27;t like, as will reddit and hacker news.  None of these companies can ever say they are a &quot;common carrier&quot; any more.  They are publishers not unlike any other news show and are subject to the law.<p>Secondly, there is no &quot;regulation&quot; of speech.  This is fucking America, and just because big tech has brought in hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals who don&#x27;t really understand our laws, does not mean the law has changed for the other 300 million people.<p>The only thing that is going to work is that publishers like reddit or twitter are going to be regulated.  Americans who enjoy their free speech god given (not government given) rights will find new platforms.  And guess what, far leftist techies will try to follow them there and attempt to censor like they did to twitter and reddit, hacker news, etc.  Users will be continually moving somewhere else.  reddit has very low comment counts compared to years ago and it is a direct result of business killing, un-american far leftist political censorship.')
