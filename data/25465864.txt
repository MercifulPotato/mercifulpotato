Item(by='imtringued', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608288547, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25465113, text='The crafting system does not follow the laws of thermodynamics. You can endlessly loop crafting&#x2F;disassembly to get more common crafting ingredients. Those common crafting ingredients can be turned into epic healing items which then can be disassembled into epic components which you can turn into epic weapons. Handguns are so overpowered that using any other weapon type is pointless since you&#x27;re one shotting even the most powerful enemies.<p>In some cases enemies will get stuck and stay stuck even when other NPCs are shooting at them and whittling down their health. NPCs love to walk through cars. Bikes are sometimes embedded into the road forcing you to get another vehicle. Some sidequest items can be sold for more than a thousand €$ but you can rebuy them for 5 €$ granting you infinite money.')
