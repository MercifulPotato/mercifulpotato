The obtuse part is ignoring all the other multicore tests in the same uArch and then saying that the 5950X is comparing unfavorably and ignoring the fact that single core perf on Geekbench for the 5950X doesn&#x27;t scale like any of the other tests and is much lower relatively to the other tests, then taking this one test were a 105W TDP is actually used as significant to all the other comparisons, then saying that their are comparing it to a chip with a 105W TDP, when in all multicore tests except two it gets compared to the 4800S (which beats it with half the power consumption).<p>It&#x27;s not getting compared, at the scale of the article, to the 5950X in anything but single core performance except for one expection, and the claim that it&#x27;s being compared generally to a 105W TDP part is also false because in multicore comparisons, where the total TDP makes sense, it&#x27;s getting compared to parts with half or 150% the TDP and losing.<p>In reality, it&#x27;s getting compared to a 6-7w core, and to 15-45w chips.')
