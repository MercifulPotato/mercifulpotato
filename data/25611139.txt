I cannot use the cross-platform frameworks to bootstrap since the product primarily aims to solve the current UX&#x2F;UI provided by existing apps.<p>The article pretty much nails what I’ve been doing (and I’m embarrassed to even admit the nature of my success fantasies, they are laughably delusional, but my goto guilty pleasure to indulge in).<p>But, the disliking myself part comes from the fact that I don’t operate like this when it comes my day job. I always tackle a problem with discipline, reduce scope, find some way to a solution with consideration for correctness&#x2F;time-investment.<p>So why am I acting like a jerk-off when it comes to this other thing? I think a little has to do with the fact that I’m envisioning another concept in the most saturated app space imaginable, one that most people (including myself) would say ‘don’t even bother doing another one of those unless you take it up a notch’. The day-job pragmatist in me is talking the fantasist in me out of this nonsense basically (fantasist doesn’t know Swift for example, needs that reality check). It’s almost like being a parent and not having faith in your kids, you will feel bad about this on some level.')
