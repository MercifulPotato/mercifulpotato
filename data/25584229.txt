It forces me to make sure that I understand the PR that&#x27;s coming in, since I&#x27;m going to have to maintain it into the future anyway. I also want to maintain a consistent organization and style in my documentation that is difficult to explain to other people. So it&#x27;s far easier to write it myself, than to ask the contributor to go through review cycles on the documentation.')
