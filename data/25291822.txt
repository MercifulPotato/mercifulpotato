That said, we won’t be able to solve this problem singlehandedly in a day; Stripe Treasury is presently only for businesses serving businesses. As an infrastructure provider, we are also reliant on our users building the platforms their communities need.<p>Fees matter for businesses too, though. Many small business owners are greatly inconvenienced by e.g. the $X,000 minimum to avoid a $15-25 monthly maintenance fee. By bringing large global banks a great deal of deposits at once, we’ve convinced them to not impose maintenance fees on the end-users of these accounts; they’re willing to send the money they’re not spending on customer acquisition (advertising, branch networks, sales reps, etc) back to Main Street.<p>Another thing scale allows us to do is advocate for our users with financial partners. For example, earlier this year we successfully convinced the relevant parties to approve processing payments for telemedicine companies, which was previously not something they were comfortable with. That is something that previously each company would have had to individually negotiate, and e.g. startups in the space or individual medical practices might not have had sufficient reputations with their financial institutions to cause major changes in their appetite. We were able to get it through by emphasizing how our scale, maturity, and robust compliance program allowed us to allay their concerns.')
