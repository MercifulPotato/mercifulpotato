A publisher also provides editing services and so forth but, in my experience, they&#x27;re pretty lightweight. I&#x27;m actually doing a new edition of one of my books right now and I&#x27;m finding more copyedit misses than should be the case.<p>You may well make more money depending upon the sales. But, to be honest, what I make off the book is so trivial compared to what I make indirectly by having written the book that it doesn&#x27;t really matter to me.<p>Deadlines are both a blessing and a curse--especially for the original book. On the one hand, they probably forced me to go heads down when I might have been inclined to work on other things. On the other hand, you sometimes have to do those other things too.')
