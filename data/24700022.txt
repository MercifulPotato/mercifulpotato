The &quot;R&quot; in PR stands for &quot;relations.&quot; It&#x27;s not just sending out press releases.<p>The press tends to be antagonistic toward any big company. Good PR counteracts that, in part by finding and helping the members of the press who like the company.<p>No company was better at PR than Apple under Steve Jobs. They carefully groomed key reviewers and helped build up a pro-Apple ecosystem of media properties.<p>Edit: I should add that Apple&#x27;s PR under Steve Jobs was led by Katie Cotton, and her dept. was famous for rarely responding to direct requests for comment on the news of the day.')
