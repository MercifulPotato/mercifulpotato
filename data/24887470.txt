The hole also makes waterproofing more difficult.<p>All of this would add weight and size, and those trackers are <i>really</i> small and <i>really</i> lightweight. Judging by the photos, the battery is just hard wired to the circuit, and the whole thing is encapsulated with a thin layer of epoxy for waterproofing. That&#x27;s by far the cheapest, easiest, and most reliable way to build something as lightweight as possible.')
