Item(by='Karawebnetwork', descendants=None, kids=[25339278], score=None, time=1607379838, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25337312, text='&gt; I have an Awair unit and it&#x27;s fairly inexpensive.<p>I have an anecdote about the Awair. The air at one of my previous workplace was making me sick, so I asked the management to look at the air quality. They hired a professional who saw nothing - because they asked for the AC to be turned off during the monitoring.<p>I got an Awair and managed to track when the air quality dropped. It was whenever the AC came on. They then called another professional who finally caught it -- turns out the building&#x27;s ventilation ducts had not been cleaned in 5 years AND there was water damage.<p>Without a customer grade air quality tracker, I would have simply believed the first professional. I would have had to either suffer being sick daily at work or having to quit for air quality reason.<p>Now I carry mine around to my friends and family&#x27;s house and let them borrow it for a while. It always come up with explanations about issues people had been quietly enduring forever.')
