Item(by='KMag', descendants=None, kids=[25274913], score=None, time=1606876668, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25271669, text='&gt; I honestly don&#x27;t know why erlang vm is faster than python vm.<p>One reason is that on platforms that support computed goto, when a BEAM file is loaded, the list of bytecodes for each function is translated into a list of machine code addresses that implement each bytecode (a.k.a. threaded code).  Bytecode dispatch then skips one layer of indirection vs. CPython.  CPython looks up each bytecode&#x27;s machine code address in an array every time it dispatches a bytecode.  (Or, if the platform doesn&#x27;t support computed goto, CPython uses a regular switch statement, which hopefully gets compiled to a jump table.)')
