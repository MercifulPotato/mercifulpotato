Item(by='qsort', descendants=None, kids=[25524159], score=None, time=1608764027, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25522381, text='&gt; For myself (a professional data scientist) and every other...<p>The key qualifier is &#x27;from a development perspective&#x27;. Notebooks do have their usefulness. I do some data-science related tasks but I&#x27;m mostly a developer, so admittedly that could skew my perspective.<p>&gt; If you think of a notebook like a tool for literate programming...<p>I mean, that&#x27;s kind of a selling point of notebooks, though...<p>&gt; They don&#x27;t integrate well with text editors<p>They don&#x27;t integrate well with <i>anything</i>, not even other notebooks! From that alone I sense strong Word vibes.<p>&gt; If you prefer using Spyder and RStudio with the console and plot window, that&#x27;s great.<p>My usual setup is pretty much the same as yours with Visual Studio Code, but yeah, that was the point... So notebooks <i>are</i> at least somewhat competing in the same space as IDEs after all? Is there a subtlety I&#x27;m missing or &quot;I prefer IDEs&quot; and &quot;Notebooks are not competing with IDEs&quot; are in direct contradiction?<p>&gt; keeping track of &#x2F; taking notes on what I did, and displaying the results in a way that I and my colleagues can easily understand what I did.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not arguing with that, I was talking about notebooks as a <i>development tool</i>. I can very well see the appeal of notebooks as a presentation&#x2F;storytelling&#x2F;documentation format, and to an extent even I agree they have their usefulness there, and I certainly have no qualms with their usage in that niche. But I just couldn&#x27;t bear to sit in front of Jupyter instead of VSC to code something, hence my strong wording.')
