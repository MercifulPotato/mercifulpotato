I’d love to buy one, but I am not interested in becoming a two-stroke mechanic.<p>One of the big names in the sport has said that his only reservation to recommending electrics is their flight time, currently about 45 minutes vs 1.5 hours for gas.<p>This advance, assuming these motors use lithium batteries, which I haven’t checked, bumps them up to 2h 15m on one charge and makes them more compelling.  I thought I’d have to wait a decade to get this kind of gain, so this is pretty awesome news.')
