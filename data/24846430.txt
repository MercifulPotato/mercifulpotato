If you know that the only part of your program that will touch certain state directly is always running in a single thread, a lot of problems just go away, because whatever you do in response to any given message or other signal is effectively an atomic transaction, regardless of any concurrency or asynchronous behaviour you have going on elsewhere in your system. You still need to figure out how your message passing or other signalling infrastructure is going to work and in particular what will block and what won’t, so it doesn’t answer all of the usual questions with concurrency, but it’s a widely useful strategy and it goes a long way toward keeping things manageable.')
