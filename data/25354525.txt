The Netflix show they are trying to promote had most likely not even been conceived yet by this time.<p>The subsequent monoliths have popped up with increased frequency since the discovery of the Utah monolith. None of the monoliths seem to be made by the same people or with the same techniques.<p>Each monolith also seems to be placed in increasingly more public and accessible locations.<p>Basically, I don&#x27;t buy for a second that these monoliths are all made by the same people or even coordinated with a single group.')
