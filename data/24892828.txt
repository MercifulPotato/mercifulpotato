I recently bought a System76 laptop, in honest competition with a comparable (and comparably priced) machine from a huge corporation. I ended up going for S76 based on better battery life and better design, plus the benefits of open firmware and excellent hardware integration with Linux. No regrets. I also got my employer to buy me a S76 desktop at work.<p>I really want to want a System76 laptop, but I just can&#x27;t bring myself to get one because of the 16:9 screens [1].<p>[1] 16:9 screens are another one of the computing marketplace&#x27;s shitty regressions over the last decade.  General purpose computers should have 16:10 or 3:2 screens, but unfortunately the number of models that have one is very small.')
