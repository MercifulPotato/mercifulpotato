The result is a face that looks like you, but that you donâ€™t recognize. If that turns out to be more persuasive than coarse demographic targeting, is that okay?</i><p>I have wondered if in the future, movies&#x2F;TV shows will be personalized with your name. I have found that when I watch a movie where the main character shares my name (and therefore other characters say the name a lot when talking to&#x2F;about him), it makes the experience more immersive. It would seem fairly trivial to substitute in other names in a pretty smooth way (it would get tougher if you had to also adapt things like a business card that is visible on-screen, however).<p>Of course, this could be taken to the next level if you changed the faces of the actor via deepfake-like technology. I don&#x27;t know how actors would feel about this sort of thing, but hey maybe it would open up the door for a bunch of new actors, who would essentially be a blank slate for customized faces. Imagine a world where Hollywood actors don&#x27;t have to be good-looking!')
