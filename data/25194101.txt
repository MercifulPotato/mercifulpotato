Hopefully you can spare a moment to share some experience. Thank you for the help.<p>I know who my users are:<p>-General or industrial manufacturing businesses<p>-Create ETO or other customized product<p>-Older businesses<p>-Wide variety of product lines<p>-Need quick technical customer service response<p>I currently have users who are really pleased with my software. They use the software constantly every day at work and say that they wish their previous jobs had used it. That seems good on the surface but the only people who give good feedback are already using the software.<p>It is very difficult for me to get a new conversation with a potential user.<p>-Emails go unanswered, even if they have signed up on the website for demo.<p>--the emails are being delivered<p>-Calling them results in either no-one having time to talk, or not being able to get to talk to someone in engineering or production.<p>Do you have any advice on how to get those initial conversations going?')
