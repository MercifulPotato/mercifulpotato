I have also occasionally wondered about this and haven&#x27;t come up with a satisfying solution. I guess it boils down to 1) reference in your message something that didn&#x27;t exist before your point-in-time 2) let a trusted third party publish the hash of the message you compiled.\nA third party seems necessary because time isn&#x27;t a technical concept, but time can be described as a sequence of events - so some trusted event needs to reference your event&#x2F;document(its hash or equivalent). As a comment here mention, blockchain could be used as a solution.\nReally interested to see other solutions in this thread.')
