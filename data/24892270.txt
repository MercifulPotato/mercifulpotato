Enormous in size, yes, but the mass would be a lot less than the mass of the fuel for less efficient rockets like chemical or nuclear thermal.<p>Either way, any vessel travelling beyond Mars or Venus in a time short enough to be safe for humans is going to require in orbit assembly, so size in terms of volume becomes less of a constraint.    But as long as we&#x27;re boosting all of our mass from Earth, that&#x27;s what costs the money.')
