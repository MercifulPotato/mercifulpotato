Item(by='tatersolid', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609895517, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25629583, text='&gt; email is still mostly sent as plain text over the internet, that&#x27;s certainly a downside.<p>Opportunistic TLS for SMTP seems to have been  dominant on the US portion of the internet for nearly a decade. Especially as email is concentrated in a few huge providers who have been using STARTTLS for many years.<p>I say this based on the systems and logs I have monitored in that same timeframe. In fact, many email systems (mostly corporate MS Exchange) appear to be configured to reject or spam-bucket email connections that donâ€™t support STARTTLS with a public CA certificate. (This observation may be biased by covering the financial services industry more than others.)')
