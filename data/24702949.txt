It also doesn&#x27;t mean that they don&#x27;t want to reproduce at all. These types of toys are also not necessarily limited to single, childless people - couples with children almost certainly employ these devices as well.<p>&gt;... intended for somebody else to control (weird)...<p>Just because something is someone&#x27;s kink, but it&#x27;s not your kink, doesn&#x27;t make it weird. People are into what they&#x27;re into. Someone controlling someone else in the bedroom is actually an <i>incredibly</i> common scenario, and chastity for both genders is found quite often in the BDSM scene especially in dom&#x2F;sub play.<p>Your lack of understanding on this subject - which is OK - is coming off as kink-shaming. Just keep that in mind when you ask yourself why you&#x27;re being downvoted.')
