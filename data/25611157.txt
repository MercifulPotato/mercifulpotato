Item(by='moagstar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609573908, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25610289, text='I have been doing something similar this past year and it has really boosted my productivity. I start the day by writing down things I want&#x2F;need to do that day. Generally things like &#x27;fix test on failing pr&#x27;, &#x27;reply email from Dave&#x27;, &#x27;process feedback on design document&#x27;. As the day goes on the list grows, and I rarely finish everything. The next day I start by copying undone items from the previous day. The key for me is to use pen and paper. I had tried various todo, time and project management apps, but it somehow always felt like a lot of overhead and I could never get it into my workflow. Pen and paper is so quick and easy to use, and there is something strangely satisfying about crossing an item off your list compared to dragging an item in trello&#x2F;jira.')
