The vast majority of programmers I meet in the wild simply do not have training in FP and by the time they decide to learn it (if they do), it&#x27;s hard to unlearn &quot;traditional&quot; thinking.<p>If we want to steer programming in that direction, we should teach functional programming before &quot;traditional&quot; programming. However, even if we manage to do that I&#x27;m not convinced that it will make a different. People think procedural and it seems that the abstraction of first order functions is hard.')
