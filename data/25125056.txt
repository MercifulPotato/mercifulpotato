That makes them easier (or maybe my level isn&#x27;t high enough there, yet). The lichess.org ones I often have no idea what to even try, and when I&#x27;m given the solution I still don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s the best move (though looking at the &quot;Spectator room&quot; of the game can help). Sometimes the better move is only marginally better; like the computer assesses black as -3.4 instead of -3.6.')
