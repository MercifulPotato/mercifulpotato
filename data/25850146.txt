Basically faction fight inside Intel - fabless vs. owning fabs. The owning fabs  faction is much more politically stronger inside Intel and they ultimately are forced to let that experiment, and they will make sure that it will have all the obstacles. Basically it like GM&#x27;s EV1 or like Sun in the 200x  when Linux&#x2F;x86 was basically a guerilla effort oppressed by Sparc&#x2F;Solaris, and the Sparc&#x2F;Solaris faction allowed Linux&#x2F;x86 only into a low end Sun&#x27;s market.')
