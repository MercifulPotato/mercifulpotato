I think Swift&#x27;s identity as &quot;compiled python&quot; could make it a very good fit for many use cases where scripting languages are currently being used, due to it&#x27;s clean, high level syntax and powerful type system.  It still suffers a chicken-and-egg problem with respect to broader tooling and library support since it&#x27;s viewed overwhelmingly as a language for making iOS apps.')
