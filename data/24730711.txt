There are so many authors out there that decide they can do memory management manually, write their own thread or process pools, implement sorting in a different way, rewrite basic algorithms for list operations like mapping, filtering, zipping, reducing...<p>Simply counting the number of dependencies isn&#x27;t a great indicator for dependency bloat. There are extremes on both ends : no deps --&gt; I know everything better and reimplemented the world, and thousands of deps --&gt; I put a one liner in a package ma! One should not judge too quickly.')
