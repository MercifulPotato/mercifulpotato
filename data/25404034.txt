There are more jobs but the same number of people - so if a business wants its job done it has to pay more.<p>See also <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Baumol&#x27;s_cost_disease" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Baumol&#x27;s_cost_disease</a> where improvements from high-productivity workers translate into increased wages in other unrelated segments. People get paid more without  even necessarily doing anything differently!<p>Then all that adds up to it being difficult to oppress the human rights of wealthy people. They have the resources to fight back.')
