If people are paying any amount at all they expect it to work and work perfectly.  I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s unreasonable, but it does quickly become unfeasible at scale with users who have no training at all.<p>Then on top of that the skimming the payment processors do makes a large percentage of that $1&#x2F;month go to transaction fees.
