The thing is, where do you draw the line of what is statistically so unlikely that you can deem it improbable?<p>If we run multiple different climate models through some sort of Monte Carlo simulation, I suppose each model would output a different probability of such an event occuring. In the case where all models predict a very low probability, it may be easy to say that it is unlikely. But what if two predict a very low and one predicts a low probability? Is this now applicable and should we build to be able to sustain such an event?<p>These are hard questions and I currently do not see any way to get better data for the future as the different models still do not agree in many points')
