I thought I should share this with you as well in belief that you will get some value out of it.<p>A few years ago we were on Product Hunt for a platform called Evolvr (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;evolvr-io-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;evolvr-io-2</a>). We were too early to the market and iterated the idea till we arrived at Hellonext.<p>Hellonext helps you complete the customer feedback cycle, helping you build better product features based on data. Here&#x27;s what we are good at:<p>- Updates &amp; improvements every 24 hours;<p>- Major features every 14 days;<p>- 100% hosted and operated in the EU;<p>- Trusted by banks, healthcare providers and governments;<p>- Attention to detail in design, performance &amp; customer inputs;<p>- Affordable (basically we priced it at what we would pay for a customer feedback tool);<p>We are bootstrapped (and proud) and independent. Nothing is being tracked, hence the trust banks and governments have on us. The adrenaline is still pumping for me while writing this, and we are committed to Hellonext for years to come.<p>Teams have been using Hellonext for various use-cases:<p>- Collect &amp; manage customer feedback;<p>- Run Customer Advisory Group (CAB) activities on Hellonext;<p>- Internal idea collection and management;<p>- Even publish company policies and have employees vote on them before making them final;<p>- Governments are using it for municipalities to quickly vote on resources they need to handle COVID situation;<p>We are just 18 people building this out and we&#x27;re investing big on Hellonext. Hope you like using Hellonext; if not, ping me with your feedback, I&#x27;ll be sure to push it as soon as possible.<p>Here&#x27;s to a safer future for all of us!')
