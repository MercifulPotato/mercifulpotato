For example, there&#x27;s still a lot of Japanese files out there in SJIS that need to be decoded accordingly. The country of Myanmar officially switched to unicode less than two years ago so if you still need to operate on older data, you&#x27;re going to need to support their old character set.<p>UTF-8 as a fixed encoding only works if you manage to write mappers from and to alternative character set for practically any language outside US English. Instead of breaking compatibility with most libraries, python3 would have broken compatibility with most libraries and a few countries instead.<p>Just like the rest of the world has to deal with three countries refusing to switch to metric, python3 needed to deal with countries refusing to switch to UTF8.')
