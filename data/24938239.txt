Or, for that matter, how it is really different from having to go to another platform where safe space mode doesn&#x27;t exist, to even know it exists.<p>As an aside, the constant bashing of &quot;twitter kids&quot; and allusions to political speech like &quot;all lives matter&quot; being censored (which is not happening, as far as I know) seems counterproductive.')
