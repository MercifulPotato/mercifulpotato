(You&#x27;ll probably make a browser application or an Electron application.)<p>But if you&#x27;re doing something unique, like a utility, or trying to hook into the OS to make it do something new, you gotta work at the lower level APIs.<p>And, yes, I shipped a product that included a Windows driver this year. It required working at the Win32 level in user-mode to communicate with the driver, and to test the driver. Windows recently added a new API to Windows 10 that eliminated the need for a driver, but we still had customers on Windows 7. Even then, that new API is technically Win32.')
