There were a few hundred&#x2F;thousand people who rioted at the Capitol, law enforcement in riot gear fought them with clubs and pepper spray, got overwhelmed, fell back, regrouped, and responded with a lot of force a couple hours later. One of the rioters was shot, dozens were arrested. Not a good scenario, but I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people who I had thought were more measured yelling about how police were assisting with an attempted coup attempt (even supposedly respected news stations were going off the deep end). It feels like the 24&#x2F;7 news cycle has fried a lot of people&#x27;s minds and turned everything into a final battle between good and evil.')
