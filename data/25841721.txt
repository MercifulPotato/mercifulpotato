Item(by='jackson1442', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611108346, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25841553, text='I&#x27;m honestly somewhat surprised with the results of this (clearly iFixit was too!)- I didn&#x27;t expect any replaceable parts beyond the ear cups, but if you get the right screw set it looks like you can replace a good chunk of the components that are likely to fail. Getting a good replacement part, however, might be tricky with such a niche product.<p>The user-replaceable headband is also an interesting design consideration- you&#x27;d think Apple would lead with that by allowing users to mix-and-match the headband and cups (white and black seem like they&#x27;d be a nice mix).<p>$550 is still far too much for them though.')
