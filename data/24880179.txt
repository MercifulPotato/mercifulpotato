I run node-red on RPi via docker and had to do some weird hacks to access certain pins with any reliability (it may have been a permissions issue, it&#x27;s been a while and whatever i did has been solid since).<p>One thing I will say about docker is the packaging is very convenient.  I have one container for node-red, one for InfluxDb and one for Grafana.  I didn&#x27;t have to deal with anything, just fire them up right out of docker hub and point at each other.  Obviously a bit more scrutiny would be recommended for anything important but the overall experience was quite simple.<p>Another possible use case for Firecracker would be ones where folks are wiring up software-defined radios to RPi.  (E.g. ADSB reflectors for FlightRadar24 and the like)  Firecracker might be a more robust mechanism to ensure that the stream processing from the radio has sufficient capacity and priority vs whatever other cruft is happening on the box.')
