Here we were hit hard by virus, however we never had more than 10k people hospitalized. If we, as a country of 7 million have a problem with this weak virus, what would happen if it were couple times stronger.<p>People should be outraged with how healthcare failed, but media and politics are reporting about the virus like it&#x27;s a plague, just so they can cover their asses.')
