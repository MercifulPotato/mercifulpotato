I&#x27;m not claiming that existing RSS aggregators are broken, but this method is certainly better for me personally. Findka&#x27;s meant to make things a little more automatic for those who want to spend very little time on managing their sources. The bandit algorithm makes it so you don&#x27;t need to explicitly mark which sources you&#x27;ve decided are interesting. And the main, non-RSS part of Findka (article recommendations via collaborative filtering) helps expose you to new articles and sources.<p>This new feature is probably most useful for people who aren&#x27;t already using RSS regularly.')
