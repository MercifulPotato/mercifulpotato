And I&#x27;ve seen it all. And yes, bad code in Scala is probably harder to read than bad code in other languages. It can be outright painful. However, good clean code in Scala is easier to read IMO. I think it takes a strong culture and strict standards for an organization to adopt understandable Scala. Unfortunately, those organizations are rare and there will be people who will likely abuse some of the &quot;clever&quot; features of Scala. I&#x27;ve been fortunate to be in those organizations with good clean code (and places with unreadable Scala code).')
