Pinch and zoom is easy to do, atleast on the iPhone. Then you just scroll naturally. The entire page doesn&#x27;t move on you.<p>I agree with you in general, its not great on mobile, but it&#x27;s not <i>terrible</i>. Far better than hamburger menu&#x27;ed UI that I see in the wild that seems to show 1 card at a time and hijacks the scroll mechanism.<p>A lot of &quot;Not designed for mobile&quot; fear stems from early days of smartphones in 2010-era which still lingers today. Things have changed. Screens have gotten much better in resolution, responsiveness has improved and touch experience on modern phones is exceptional.')
