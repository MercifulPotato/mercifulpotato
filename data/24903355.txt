Buyers simply won’t be able to afford to pay as much and prices will plateau or even dip.<p>There are people paying 1M for hones in my neighborhood that sold for 500k ten years ago because their mortgage will be only $2K a month. When it’s $4K a month those buyers are gone. That’s why I’m selling soon.')
