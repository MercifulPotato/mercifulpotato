First, clickbait headline. Renewables aren&#x27;t cheap but they are saying they will become cheaper over time.<p>This yet another use of the trick where you say something that is universally true but irrelevant to decision making. All objects go down in cost when production scales. The key factor is the UNIT cost of renewable energy with scaled production vs UNIT cost of fossil fuels now(already scaled).')
