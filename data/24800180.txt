One of the main advantages of a service middleman is encapsulation, and enforcing rules on what database operations are permitted.<p>The article mentioned that there are many different teams using this service&#x2F;library. With the library approach, each of these teams has full permissions to the database. As long as they all remain disciplined and only ever access the database via the library, this should be fine. But I wonder how long it&#x27;ll be before another bright developer somewhere realizes that they can write stuff directly to the database, in completely unintended ways, by bypassing the library.')
