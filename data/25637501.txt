You completely erase any possibility of separation between workspace and sleep space.<p>With only one bedroom available, your only way to assign a dedicated sleeping space is to use your bed to sleep and a desk to work.<p>Throwing in some anecdotal opinion, I live in a loft style open apartment and have no issue sleeping well in my bed even if I can see my workspace. I however had issues sleeping back when I lived in a smaller apartment and used the bed as my main computer space.<p>Is it objectively better or worst? There&#x27;s no study backing either theories. However, I <i>believe</i> that even working on a small desk next to your bed would be better than working directly from the bed. Otherwise you&#x27;d be effectively training yourself to think about work while lying down in the comfort of your sleeping area, instead of training yourself to fall asleep and relax.')
