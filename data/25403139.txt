Ep383 of the Linux Unplugged podcast [1] also went into detail with CentOS members.<p>What CentOS gave you until Stream was (with some delay) the &quot;same&quot; set of packages that RedHat released in RHEL, which was (hopefully exhaustively) tested by RedHat QA, including making sure that packages interact in a sane way. That&#x27;s what earned RHEL (and by extension CentOS) that designation of stability. By virtue of being upstream, CentOS Stream could have a lot more updates (the kind that would previously be internal to RedHat). I doubt same level of QA can&#x2F;will be invested for each update state (if it could be, RHEL would probably be a rolling distro). If you don&#x27;t have a QA safety net of your own, the risk is higher with Stream vs 8.<p>You could hack point releases into Stream: wait for RHEL release, then dnf versionlock Stream packages to the same release versions as RHEL (assuming you can map versions of modular packages).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linuxunplugged.com&#x2F;383" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linuxunplugged.com&#x2F;383</a>')
