In Las Vegas, of all places.<p>If that was to be an open auction, where essentially anyone could bid, I fail so see how the end result is all that different from these thieves selling them on a black market.<p>Sure, with an open auction there is at least a track record, of where these works end ended up. But access to these works would just as well be on the whims of private owners. To me it sounds like works of such cultural&#x2F;historical value ending up in private hands either way, is the real crime here.<p>Maybe fully legal(ized) in one case, but I think that says rather a lot about the system as a whole.')
