So in essence you are asking your competitors to finance you. If apple wants Apple music or a video subscription service they can&#x27;t charge as Spotify or netflix 30% same for google etc. And I think this should apply to almost all market services&#x2F;stores not just mobile app stores. If you want to be market infrastructure provider you should not be allowed to compete in it or allowed to charge 30% rather it should be a nominal fee.')
