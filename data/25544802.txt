Better pizza = more sales.<p>I wish it were that simple. I mean, you can&#x27;t have one without the other, but that&#x27;s not the only important thing they did. The other really important thing they did was improve customer experience. Being able to order in whichever method has the least resistance for each customer is an important thing that shouldn&#x27;t be ignored. They were the first pizza chain that made it possible to order by tweet, from your digital assistant, smart watch, etc.<p>Then, after you order, they actually gave transparency into the order process, making more customers comfortable that the order had been received and was progressing. At the time, this level of transparency was missing from delivery -- there used to be this black hole between placing the order and receiving the delivery where you didn&#x27;t know for sure if someone had actually seen your order come in. That improvement in trust was game changing and you know it&#x27;s great because it seems so obvious after you see it.')
