It&#x27;s a workshop in sick you get to practice interpersonal interactions dialed to 11 with super fast feedback. It&#x27;s really hard to describe without it sounding ridiculous. In essence one person says something and then someone else will give them immediate feedback on it. It&#x27;s hands down the best learning experience I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s also very, very hard emotional work.<p>There is a class at Stanford graduate School of business that follows this. I understand it&#x27;s their most popular class. At Stanford it&#x27;s stretched over several weeks. The workshop I attended we&#x27;ve from Friday evening to Sunday evening and was hosted by Jana who also is involved with the Stanford class. You can find the Stafford class and links to others who offer this type of experience here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gsb.stanford.edu&#x2F;experience&#x2F;learning&#x2F;leadership&#x2F;interpersonal-dynamics&#x2F;facilitation-training-program&#x2F;intro-tgroup" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gsb.stanford.edu&#x2F;experience&#x2F;learning&#x2F;leadership&#x2F;...</a>')
