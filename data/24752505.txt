But some games have &#x27;perma death&#x27; and &#x27;iron man&#x27; modes.  The former means that you or your pawns etc can&#x27;t come back after being killed off.  The latter means that there&#x27;s only ever a single save file for one playthrough, ie you can save-and-quit to take a break, but you can&#x27;t load an early save game when something inevitably goes wrong.<p>This kind of playstyle is common in rogue-like games.  But can also be employed for strategy games like X-Com.')
