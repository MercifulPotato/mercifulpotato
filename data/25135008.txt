But Sony is not the first company to have a security breach. And under the circumstances, they did the right thing: shutting the service down entirely until it could be fixed was clearly the right call, but it was also clearly a very difficult call to make. This is what we <i>want</i> companies to do when things like this happen.<p>After the incident, they gave every user two AAA games (very good ones too! InFamous and LittleBigPlanet!), and compensation for the downtime (as well as 30 days of PSN free for non-members, even though they weren&#x27;t really affected), which was pretty darn generous. And there has been no verified reports of fraud resulting from the breach.<p>I was also annoyed I couldn&#x27;t play Call of Duty for 3 weeks, but I got over it.')
