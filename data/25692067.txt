Posting on social media isn&#x27;t like chatting with your friends at the bar - it&#x27;s like shouting into a colossal, ear-shatteringly loud megaphone aimed directly into the ears of billions of people.  A system like that probably shouldn&#x27;t even exist, let alone be put in the hands of every person above the age of thirteen [1].<p>You wouldn&#x27;t say I was being censored because MSNBC decided to air Morning Joe instead of my hour-long documentary about how the moon landing is fake.  They simply aren&#x27;t obligated to grant me the power of their massive communications network if they don&#x27;t like my content.  In what I can only call a massive failure of judgment, Twitter, Facebook etc. have outsourced their editorial decision-making to algorithms designed to maximize their profit.<p>This is <i>not</i> the same as making speech a crime.  You still have the right to speak your mind, with your own voice, on any street corner you want.  You can even print out fliers if you can convince anyone to take them from you.  That was true before Facebook, and it will be true after they&#x27;re gone.  Now if the government tries to threaten <i>this</i> form of communication, I&#x27;ll be right there with you protesting.<p>[1] The Simpsons - Bart&#x27;s Megaphone: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Rf_jKzB3SLY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Rf_jKzB3SLY</a>')
