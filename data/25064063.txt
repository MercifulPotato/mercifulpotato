And it&#x27;ll keep working until we don&#x27;t need it. No software updates, no discontinued support, no questionable data storage policies on chinese servers. Just a monitor.<p>And it turns out that once the baby&#x27;s passed ~4 months, the video isn&#x27;t too important anyway. It&#x27;s mostly &quot;Is he crying or not&quot;.')
