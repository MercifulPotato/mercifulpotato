It&#x27;s a novel legal strategy (in case you don&#x27;t think DMCA 1201 is broad enough), but it was never entirely litigated in court as Geohot settled the case. I still don&#x27;t think it would have passed muster in court, as it was akin to arguing that someone had violated the CFAA by hacking into their own computer that they forgot the password to. (Either that, or Geohot was poking at PSN and Sony knew this - I never followed that particular case thoroughly)')
