Item(by='beagle3', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601675019, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24667021, text='&gt; If a Facebook account can be considered a technological barrier protecting intellectual property, they could sue under DMCA anti-circumvention provisions.<p>It would also likely make screen readers, screenshots, and many other things illegal. I don&#x27;t think it can be considered a &quot;technological barrier&quot;, but who knows what courts will decide.<p>That said, I&#x27;d be surprised if that&#x27;s the angle Facebook is taking - because they did (and still do) the same thing with their phone apps collecting (&quot;scraping&quot;) address book records and uploading them to facebook servers -- and that would be an estopple-able admission of guilt if they do (even if the courts decide against them in THIS particular case).<p>I&#x27;ll wait till more details come out.')
