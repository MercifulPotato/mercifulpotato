You can run a jar file on anything that has a JVM.  You can run C code on an 8085 microcontroller if you have a cross-compiler and a way to move the file.  So C code is portable to a whole world beyond the &quot;mixed-platform&quot; world that you&#x27;re thinking of.<p>Now, either you care or you don&#x27;t.  If you don&#x27;t <i>need</i> portability to every CPU made since 1980, then the difference doesn&#x27;t matter to you, and Java, C#, and such are portable for everything that you want.')
