I&#x27;m from the NES - PS1 era of gaming where games would regularly take 60+ hours to play through.<p>FFVII is still one of my all time favorites and is a good example of that.  I think the first real fast game I played through was Metal Gear Solid.  I&#x27;d rent, then buy if I liked it back then, and I played through all of Metal Gear Solid in something like 2 or 3 days.  It was the first game I enjoyed that I did not buy, because I beat it while renting it.')
