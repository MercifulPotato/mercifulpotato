The volume type description suggests &quot;boot volumes&quot; as a use case, but you can&#x27;t actually use gp3 as a boot volume yet.<p>All of my boot volumes tend to be 1GB (and they&#x27;d be ~128MB if EBS had smaller granularity), so gp3 will raise their performance from 100 IOPS to 3000 IOPS. And on top of that, gp3 is cheaper ($0.08&#x2F;GB&#x2F;month, down from $0.10&#x2F;GB&#x2F;month), which will make a big difference for larger volumes.')
