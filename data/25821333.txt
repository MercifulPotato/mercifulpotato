While it won&#x27;t protect you from all attacks, it does make the standard MITM harder.<p>To take the OP&#x27;s example, if by mistake you are tricked into visting githud.com or something, they can get your password (bad!) but if they try and MITM the FIDO, they&#x27;ll send a digitally signed message for githud.com on to github.com. This will not work as intended (except for the user, because their github account isn&#x27;t compromised yet.)<p>Indeed the point of FIDO as I see it is that it&#x27;s less security critical for the end user to validate the identity of the site, which optimistically speaking about 95% of users will fail at anyway.')
