Freedom in computing is a very sharp double-edged sword. On one hand, it gives you control of your device and your computing world and lets you create anything you want. On the other hand, it lets malware and spyware take total control of your machine and steal all your personal data or extort you with ransomware.<p>Security is always somewhat like that. It really wouldn&#x27;t be that hard for a determined burglar to break into my house. I could make it a lot harder, but doing so would come at the expense of a great deal of my own convenience and even freedom. I don&#x27;t want bars on my windows and I don&#x27;t want to have to authenticate against a panel or app&#x2F;keyfob every single time I enter or leave my home.<p>My neighborhood has police and I live in a very civilized place. The Internet is an open war zone overrun with criminals and malicious privacy-invading corporations (and governments, and not just your own government) bent on subjecting you to a total panopticon. Computers must be secure in a much more hostile environment than my house or my car. A computer today must be more like a hardened compound in a failed state than a house in a typical developed world city or suburb.<p>I&#x27;ve been saying &quot;the Internet is a failed state&quot; for a while. Apple with its locked down walled garden is like one of those private mercenary security armies that provide security to the rich in failed states.')
