I only got inside as the programmer on a team delivering a game for the Switch, early after release. We only even got access to the meeting and switch hardware through an executive&#x27;s connections to a seperate major games company. Our taxi drove in after checking in at the gate, we got out, waited in the lobby for 10 minutes, then went to the meeting room for half an hour. In the meantime the only other visitor appeared to be a contractor meeting with his manager, showing off a poster for approval. Meaning even if one directly contracts with Nintendo good chances you&#x27;ll never see more than the lobby.<p>You must have been to the new building. The old building does not have a large Nintendo sign. The old building has almost no space between the compound walls and the building itself while the new one has a basketball court.')
