There&#x27;s no reason to surprise people with the question. I&#x27;d rather let candidates self-select them out, as much for this question as for any other mis-alignments.<p>I did a poor job in my first comment of explaining my role relative to hiring. I&#x27;m speaking from a position of having been a founder and CEO, and likely being one again. The question about how this would play it with HR is understood, but isn&#x27;t applicable to me personally. I believe (as I suspect you do) that in most organizations, this would be a hard thing to instill retroactively or individually and would meet lots of resistance, unless it were a very philosophically aligned company.')
