The article (discussing use of Kafka) doesn&#x27;t seem to have any direct relation to WeWork&#x27;s failure.<p>There is a lot that you can learn <i>especially</i> from businesses that failed.<p>Just because the company wasn&#x27;t successful does not mean you should discount everything related to that company, especially when the content and lessons are technical, and the business failed for non-technical reasons (shady business practices and self-dealing).')
