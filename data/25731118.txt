Both government orgs like NASA and the contractors who support them spread their jobs&#x2F;money across enough Congressional districts to reduce the risk of reduction in funding. Haven’t you ever wondered why NASA designed a naturally inefficient system by spreading the country? Programs in Marshall also stretch their tentacles into Johnson, Glenn, etc. I wonder if part of the blowback is that it makes it less palatable to prioritize big, bold projects (also factoring in how bad estimating these projects is and the fact they will have inevitable overruns). It’s not actually an inability to hold people accountable, it’s that they <i>don’t want</i> that accountability because it puts their districts at risk. Listening to a few talks by the NASA administrator led me to believe political risk is at the forefront of their mind')
