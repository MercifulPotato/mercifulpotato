That is, if I put stuff in an S3 bucket and pre-pay for 100 years, if nobody is around to download it in 100 years then why bother?<p>If you wanted to make a sort of digital time capsule and didn&#x27;t care who discovered it, your next best bet would probably be the Internet Archive or some other archival community.<p>If your data isn&#x27;t appropriate for archival (i.e., can&#x27;t be publicly consumed) and isn&#x27;t interesting enough for your friends&#x2F;family&#x2F;etc. to keep around on your behalf, keeping the data is purposeless.')
