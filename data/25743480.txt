K.<p>I&#x27;d have a decent chance at recovering the audio in the former case, but nil in the latter..<p>For instance, if it&#x27;s gated with a FET, and then hooked up to a SOC ADC pin that&#x27;s multiplexed with other functions, one could use those other functions to provide biasing opening the FET.<p>If it&#x27;s gated with something better-- e.g. an actual relay-- the audio waveform may still be recoverable: it&#x27;s very, very large in magnitude compared to how it is with the device unpowered, and will be consuming variable amounts of power with the audio waveform.  You might be able to recover the signal by measuring power nets AC coupled with lots of gain.')
