But very many hold their noses and vote for him despite thinking of him as a constant embarrassment.<p>Why?<p>My theories:<p>- BLM has been campaigning relentlessly for Trump - despite their intentions. Just think straight through this example: Your local shop get looted or someone you know loses their job or their  house because of this. Will this increase the chance that you vote for the party who doesn&#x27;t condemn these guys? Or the other party?<p>- Mainstream media, who doesn&#x27;t care at all about you, even ridicule you as rednecks, will you vote for or against the candidate that they try to push.<p>- Will you want to support the  party who has still not apologized for their &quot;basket of deplorables&quot; comment?<p>- They band up with none other than Lady Gaga, produces a video perfect for angering these people at release it a day or so before election day!<p>- Even a huge number of black people went to Trump this year. Guess why? No respect for them either!<p>So no, I don&#x27;t like Trump.<p>But I do think Democrats and many HNers have a lot to learn before they understand why Trump is so popular despite his truckload of flaws.<p><i>And no, it is not that everyone who voted for Trump is dumb.</i>')
