I was speaking to the severity to the individual employee.  Opposition to gay marriage is obviously a hugely important issue for a gay person.  There is no way to really compromise on a civil rights issue like that.  Either people have equal rights or they don&#x27;t.  Someone being excluding from those rights can&#x27;t accept neutrality as an answer.<p>Also I want to point out that I specifically called the argument unreasonable and not the people.  I meant &quot;unreasonable&quot; as a synonym to illogical.  There is no real logical consistency to any arguments that there should be added legal benefits for straight couples that don&#x27;t apply for gay couples.  All the arguments fundamentally come down to some sort of bias against gay people which can be ideological or spiritual but are never based on reason or logic.')
