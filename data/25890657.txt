In contrast to school this means the motivation has to come from the students and there is no mandatory attendance.<p>I for one was glad that I didn&#x27;t have to sit in lectures that I can learn in less than half the time on my own. That I could structure my learning the way it best fits me. This however requires that materials are available in sufficient quality remotely.<p>Not attending class doesn&#x27;t mean you have no human interaction, there are tons of other options for human interaction like sport clubs.<p>Your comment reads like attending in person is the only right way, while I think accepting individualism and providing choice is much better. So if after covid there is the option to work&#x2F;study in person or from home, whatever fits the individual that day, that would be awesome.')
