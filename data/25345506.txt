Without one, you won&#x27;t be able to watch movies on planes, which is a pretty significant use case for over-the-ear noise-cancelling headphones.  Probably gaming as well -- I don&#x27;t do a ton of gaming, but StarCraft basically doesn&#x27;t work over Bluetooth (probably due to buffering requirements).')
