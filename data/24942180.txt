There are plenty of recent examples of legitimately fake and (intentionally) misleading content that has been propagated on Facebook, I assume anyone with any right wing friends has been inundated with it. But in addition to that, the simple protection against censoring true notions that annoy the powerful is transparency. Complete transparency with when and why and how things are blocked would be a start. Blocking clearly fake content, banning people who (repeatedly) post it, and being transparent about the reasons seems like a fair progress with a fairly clean line between it and proposed dystopian outcomes.')
