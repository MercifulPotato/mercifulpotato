It was faster than its competition, and also used by Atari, Commodore and, later across the Atlantic, on the Acorn&#x2F;BBC computers. It&#x27;s one of the most popular 8-bit architectures. While Commodore never invested much in upgrading the 6502 into 16 and 32 bits, they invested a lot in other developments. Too little and too late, the 65CE02-derived chip in the C65 was quite impressive for an 8-bit CPU.')
