It&#x27;s how you define custom tags (contains in this case).<p>But it&#x27;s super confusing because ! usually means NOT in any programming context so you would mentally parse that as the message NOT containing &quot;wip&quot; when in reality, the opposite is what happens. CloudFormation does this too and they have &quot;If&quot; defined as a custom function so you end up with !If which is super confusing for a condition where you expect &quot;if condition is true do this else that&quot;.')
