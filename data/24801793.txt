Religion is simply a set of practices and beliefs.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.merriam-webster.com&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;religion" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.merriam-webster.com&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;religion</a><p>I&#x27;m sure some practitioners have developed a philosophical understanding of it just as you can do with anything in life.<p>&gt; <i>You&#x27;re conflating &#x27;people who say they are hardcore believers in XYZ&#x27; with necessarily &#x27;very religious&#x27; people.</i><p>It&#x27;s the other way around. &#x27;Very religious&#x27; people are &#x27;hardcore believers&#x27;.<p>I suspect the root of blind belief is the same in both cases though. Most likely biological in nature.<p>In case it&#x27;s not clear, I&#x27;m not saying religion is inherently bad, and I don&#x27;t think religious people are completely irrational. What I&#x27;m saying is that religious belief is indeed irrational and fanaticism is bad (religious or not).')
