The system y&#x27;=y=Iy has a basis of solutions of the form (e^x 0 ... 0)^t, (0 e^x 0 ... 0)^t, etc. Written column-wise into a matrix, this gives us the Wronskian Y which satifies Y(0)=I, and this Y is exactly the matrix exponential e^(xI).<p>More in general, the equation y&#x27;=Ay has the Wronskian Y=e^(xA) which satisfies Y(0)=1.')
