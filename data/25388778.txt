There are plenty of other platforms that people don&#x27;t think twice about booking on. Booking.com, Trivago, etc.<p>Their real value is that when a lot of people think &quot;I&#x27;ll book somewhere&quot;, they now go to Airbnb <i>first</i>, much like when people think &quot;I&#x27;ll buy something&quot; they go to Amazon <i>first</i>.
