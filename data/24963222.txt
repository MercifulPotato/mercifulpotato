These days things are much better in a lot of games. The use of contextual controls allows the use of the same button for multiple tasks. Tabbed menus mean you don&#x27;t have to have a separate key for each thing, even if many games still provide that option.<p>That&#x27;s not to say all applications have better UX than in the past. The ERP system where I work is truly cumbersome. But there&#x27;s still a certain commonality of UX &quot;language&quot; in lots of newer projects that mean software engineers aren&#x27;t having to figure this stuff out from first principles.')
