I tried posting what I believed was evidence of at least some ballot-counting fraud on HN once not so long ago, and my account was downvoted and flagged straight to hell.<p>Your expectations appear to be out of sync with reality. Go look for the evidence. At least to convince yourself that there isn&#x27;t any, because all of the evidence has been banned.<p>(And in the time it took me to reply to your comment, it was downvoted for having the gall to suggest that evidence could even theoretically exist! JFC. That should change your mind if nothing else.)')
