I have a 220&#x2F;320 grit diamond plate for flattening my water stones, but it does wonders for making sharpening knives non-onerous.<p>Woodworkers might be interested in the Norton water stone starter set of 2 combo stones 220&#x2F;1000 and 4000&#x2F;8000. The 220 wears out of flat so quickly it&#x27;s useless, but I have the diamond plate anyhow. The 1000 and 8000 are great.  The 4000 is a little soft, and you&#x27;ll replace it before the others. Personally, I&#x27;ll be replacing it with the Shapton equivalent in another year or two.')
