That is players that are in the same physical room or on chat (Discord is most common). Nothing is more frustrating than someone accusing another player and having &quot;my friend told me on Discord&quot; as proof. Espcially in a psychological game like this.<p>I think the only &quot;solution&quot; you end up to avoid cheaters will be to gather a collection of trusted friends to play with, as finding good public games is to much hit and miss. Which is a shame as I enjoyed playing with random strangers a lot.')
