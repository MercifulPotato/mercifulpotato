Sitting? Even with expensive chairs, and standing desks?<p>I have been running 5-7km twice per week since May and I loved how it made me feel, but then comes the pain... lower back... hip flexors... hamstring tightness... Not from my runs but from my job.<p>This just really drags me down.  I have been off the runs for 2 weeks as my hip hurts mid way through my run and this leads to breaking my new found enjoyment and after a few weeks, I will be lazy as I break my routine.<p>The only thing that would help would be a seat that is like sitting inside a cylinder that rotates from 0-45 degrees on a second by second basis throughout the working day so that no part of the body is strained.<p>Desks and computers don&#x27;t work for me and I really worry about a day where I cannot stand due to pain or sit due to pain which naturally effects my output.<p>I am 38 and feel like no one else is suffering these problems.')
