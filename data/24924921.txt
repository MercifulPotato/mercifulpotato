Wayland is very good at some niche features like HiDPI or fractional scaling* , but more people (at least two orders of magnitude more) need screensharing these days when companies move to WFH.<p>* Yes, these are relatively niche features right now. e.g. Look at the Steam hardware survey: more people run resolutions below 1080p than above it - and that&#x27;s in a biased sample, since  gamers are more likely to have high resolution monitors! Now, it&#x27;s nice to be future proof, but these features should not be prioritized over basic features.')
