The lack of any market signal means you can never really know if your service is providing a meaningful return on investment, and potential ventures which may improve upon it are prevented from doing so by threat of violence.<p>I find the claim that without the State, cars would explode and bridges would fall very bizarre. There is no basis for this assumption but clouded thinking. Bridges build well before modern governments and regulations are still standing, and vehicles from the 70s function just fine. It has always been in the best interest of product providers to have their products certified by reputable organizations, and they&#x27;ll pay to have it done. The Underwriters Laboratory has been privately certifying products for 126 years. Many of the government regulatory bodies are much younger. There may even be an argument that private certification would improve health and safety because businesses would be in competition to provide the absolute best, rather than merely meeting a minimum requirement set by the State.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t argue against the fact that teachers are essential workers, but the almost state monopoly on provision of this service can&#x27;t possibly face the scrutiny of individual&#x27;s choices and expectations - there is no market. I would take a school voucher system like Sweden has over the public school system in the UK any day.')
