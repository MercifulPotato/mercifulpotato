For things like encrypted password databases, there isn&#x27;t an automated merge strategy that can be applied. I think they support versioning, so if two edits happened concurrently then the losing edit would be recoverable via versioning. Maybe that&#x27;s not really a concern for a password database, as you&#x27;d likely be online when making a change? Anyone see issues with KeePass and sync tools?')
