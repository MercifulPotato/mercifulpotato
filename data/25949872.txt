Don&#x27;t you understand that this license has clause for SaaS providers that impossible to comply with?<p>Even if Amazon wanted to open source every single line of their own AWS code under AGPLv3 or APLv2 it&#x27;s still not enough: the license require everything to be published under SSPL in very fuzzy terms that can even apply to OS kernel.<p>Even copyleft licenses always had a goal to increase amount of copyleft code, but SSPL only goal is to completely ban 3rd-party SaaS from using said software.')
