When I say &quot;Empty&quot; I mean that it doesn&#x27;t really convey anything, what is a serious public intellectual?  How is someone famous for writing and sharing essays about his area of expertise not a serious public intellectual?<p>The term doesn&#x27;t really convey real meaning.  It&#x27;s just a rhetorical sneer.  Like, if I wrote &quot;Zach Tellman is basically Microsoft&#x27;s idea of a smart person.&quot;  It is somehow putting down the author, and Microsoft, and implying that I&#x27;m so much better and smarter.  In the same way &quot;He&#x27;s not a serious public intellectual&quot; implies not only that PG is unserious or non-intellectual, but that the author is some high authority who can cast these judgments.<p>In reality, of course, the author has no claim to judge who is serious or who is an intellectual.')
