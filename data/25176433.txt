In the case of Sony&#x27;s game catalogue I agree that this is a tiny bit contrived example but the general case still stands IMO. The current generation stands too close to things to appreciate the bigger picture (if they even can). That&#x27;s why I think it&#x27;s sad that such kind of information is just deemed useless and deleted, especially if it&#x27;s in an easily archiveable format like static html and images.')
