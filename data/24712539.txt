Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602103672, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24712476, text='&gt; If techies want APIs to be uncopyrightable, the solution is to go to Congress and see a carve-out exception in statute.<p>By the same token, if we are rejecting judge made law that isn&#x27;t expressly in the statute, if technies want APIs (or, for that matter, computer programs!) to be copyrightable, the solution is to go to Congress and get an explicit carve-in put in the statute. As it is, the only things explicitly <i>included</i> in copyright protection are:<p>--quote--<p>(1)literary works;\n(2)musical works, including any accompanying words;\n(3)dramatic works, including any accompanying music;\n(4)pantomimes and choreographic works;\n(5)pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works;\n(6)motion pictures and other audiovisual works;\n(7)sound recordings; and\n(8)architectural works.<p>--end quote--<p>Now, certainly some computer programs <i>include</i> things that fall on that list as components, and some might arguably be described as being interactive forms of one or the other category.<p>But APIs, themselves, don&#x27;t fall into any of those categories, so why would they need an explicit carve-out when they aren&#x27;t carved-in in the first place?')
