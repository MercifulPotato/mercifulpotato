I&#x27;d always ask the maths teacher whenever we started a new subject, and even he had <i>no idea</i>. It was all just so theoretical - seemingly pointless.<p>I found it much more interesting to study things with practical implications, and I also think embedding financial literacy into maths might be a good idea.<p>I&#x27;ll add that I did of course eventually find uses for some of the things I was taught in maths class: path finding algorithms for a game AI, neural networks, genetic algorithms, all sorts. But in class, I didn&#x27;t know any of these uses.')
