Item(by='prewett', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605294295, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25085576, text='&quot;Free market&quot; just means that the prices are determined by the market, not by government-sponsored monopolies, artificial scarcity, regulation, tariffs, restricted information flows between buyer and seller, etc. It is in contrast to England pre-1700-ish where various groups had a monopoly (&quot;patent&quot;) to sell goods, also government-imposed tariffs on some goods.<p>Free market does not mean that the players within the market have liberty other than the price to buy or sell at. So a truly free market under a dictatorship should still act the same way, it&#x27;s just that dictators have a way of not liking free markets.')
