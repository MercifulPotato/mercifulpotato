I&#x27;ve been using that openwrt distribution to do just that for a year and it&#x27;s been working out really great. The nice thing about the approach is that you get a boost in both bandwidth and reliability as there is always a link available for your packets.<p>The drawback is increased latency (about 60ms instead of 40 on each individual links) but openmptcprouter provides a nice tool to easily exclude specific services or devices from using the tunnel. My gaming packets and netflix are both setup to keep using the otherwise adsl link. (Netflix override is because their stupid geo check think my vps is a vpn endpoint used to mask my location).')
