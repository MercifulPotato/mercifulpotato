Legal censorship by governments is only one of its many forms, and private censorship has a very long history. What the ISPs did in Australia was very much censorship, since Internet users in the country were locked out from several websites, even if they wanted to access the content there.<p>I also don&#x27;t think that justification matters all that much - indeed, the whole point is that, just because the majority of the population might want to censor something, that doesn&#x27;t make such censorship any more inherently legitimate. The laws against &quot;gay propaganda&quot; in Russia are similarly supported by the majority of the population, but they&#x27;re no less wrong and oppressive for that. .')
