A huge catalog of apps and games, old and new, that are mostly windows and linux, but all exclusively x86.<p>2. I don&#x27;t want to get locked in to an ecosystem with no variety. For example, if Dell&#x27;s offering laptop has a keyboard I hate or poor selection of ports, then I can switch to Lenovo or HP or go for a gaming laptop with an Nvidia GPU and use it to train NN, etc, the variety is amazing. While if Apple&#x27;s next machine has a flaw I dislike, then too frikin bad, I&#x27;ll be stuck with whatever Apple bestowes upon me.')
