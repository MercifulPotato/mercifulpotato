The tech said as much, that they could upgrade my plan for free, but it wouldn&#x27;t make a difference. The node is literally on top of the pole outside my house and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way around it.<p>The AT&amp;T internet plan seems sufficient for my usage. It&#x27;s capped at 100Mbps, which I understand to be a limit, at least in part, of running over copper phone lines. I get about 20Mbps up pretty consistently, which is enough. Apparently fiber in my neighborhood is right around the corner (literally, my neighbors have it), but we probably won&#x27;t live here when it arrives.<p>On a side note, AT&amp;T threw in free install, $150 in gift cards, and a free 24&quot; Samsung LCD. All for $45&#x2F;mo no contract service. Made it real easy to switch, though I would&#x27;ve anyway.')
