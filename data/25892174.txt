AFAIK dd is not suitable for these purposes (although the original author mentions they wish to create ISO images so presumably they only care about single session data).<p>Windows had a lot of great disc software in the 90s&#x2F;00s which would handle just about any disc format one would encounter, e.g. Alcohol 120%, CloneCD, Disc Juggler. Some of these were capable of backing up the various protections of the time such as SecureROM and Starforce.<p>dd is a powerful tool but I often find it the &quot;wrong&quot; tool, e.g. is it desired to clone a 2GB partition layout to a 128GB usb stick for a live CD and have to manually edit my partition tables myself?')
