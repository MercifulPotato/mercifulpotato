Engineers who don&#x27;t want to get into a budgeting conversation will end up avoiding using key tools, and this can cost you a lot of money in terms of invisible lost productivity.<p>For exactly this reason I wanted to build a developer screening tool from scratch [1]. In all the companies I worked for, I never got the budget to pay for one of the available tools in the market (most have &quot;contact us pricing&quot;). The result is that most teams I&#x27;ve met spend a lot of time manually evaluating coding challenges. This is a waste of time both for the company and the candidate. A custom screening tool allows the company to calibrate it according to the perceived average candidate level, and avoid those algorithm questions that are useless for most small to medium companies.<p>In my previous company it was used in a few hiring processes and it worked fine - both for back-end and front-end development. It is not open source yet because your need some basic Docker and Rails skills to use it - even though the screening test can be in any language(s) you want (that runs on Docker). If it matches your experience and you want to try it out, please contact me.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;skilltest&#x2F;skilltest" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;skilltest&#x2F;skilltest</a>')
