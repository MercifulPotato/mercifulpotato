For a business meeting, I really doubt it&#x27;s that important, and why can&#x27;t I use Uber for this?<p>Not everything needs insurance.  And real insurance has costs that are pretty close to the expected average risk, while buying things just in case could be much more.<p>And the 1&#x2F;10000 calculation was not the chance of huge trouble, it&#x27;s 1&#x2F;10000 to be unable to get a ride to have any trouble at all.  The vast majority of those incidents are going to be worth much less than a thousand dollars.  The chance of an event being <i>that</i> major is another factor of 1% or less.<p>Am I going to pay a thousand dollars a year to avoid a one in a million chance each of missing some important business meetings?  Definitely not.  Especially when other factors I can&#x27;t change are much more likely to make me miss a meeting.<p>I mean, if I had odds that low of major illness I probably wouldn&#x27;t pay hundreds of dollars a month for health insurance either!')
