This is your brain. This is your brain on drugs. I remember when the tv ( aka idiot box ) was attacked for being addictive.<p>&gt;  Would we be so casual in dismissing it?<p>Who is casually dismissing it? There is an entire propaganda campaign against social media. From congress to news to netflix and on, ironically enough, social media itself. Every day we hear about how bad social media is.<p>But what I was responding to was the article itself. The complaints in the article would exist with or without iphones, apps, social media. Staying up all night talking to friends, waking up at 11 AM, losing interest in childhood stuff, pushing back against the parents, etc are all teenage behavior, not iphone behavior.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan of smartphones as they are and I despise social media. But that&#x27;s not what the article was really about. I was just trying to stay on topic.')
