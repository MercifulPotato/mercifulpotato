But they had other architectures on the back burner they could go back to to recover when things didn&#x27;t work and they still had their process lead to keep them in the game.  Recently, though, Intel&#x27;s architecture work has been at fine but their process has been the thing having trouble.  Maybe they&#x27;ll be able to get 7nm working properly first try despite the problems at 10nm but I&#x27;m not sure given the attrition in their process team after the 14nm death march.')
