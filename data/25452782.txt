Then, if needed, reinforce this with natural consequences (when it makes sense). Classic example is taking away possessions or privileges when they&#x27;re misused.<p>Punishments can certainly be arbitrary or disproportionate (which tends to spark resentment - and possibly the mental baggage you mention) so it&#x27;s important to do it thoughtfully.  Done right, it&#x27;s effective and non-traumatizing.')
