They had some boxes on the back with second sorting greens and a box for money. We grabbed 3-4 bags full of tomatoes, left the money and by the time we were home there was only two bags left. They were so good, I haven&#x27;t seen anything remotely similar to that in the store. I wish I knew the name of those tomatoes, I would love to grow them myself.<p>Similar with strawberries, I was asking what sort they had but don&#x27;t remember any more. He told us he selects them for taste, not optimizing for scale. But the plants are slightly harder to take care of and sometimes the harvest fails. But the taste is worth all the hazzle.')
