Over the years I’ve had issues that are shockingly similar to my PC stuff on the Mac. I have concluded this is possibly the underlying architecture complexity. Most of the PC architecture that is shared is a massive stack of sticky tape and string piled up over the last 20 years and I think that leaks out into the OS. I’m surprised it works for any vendors at all. It’s not as if Linux doesn’t have a ton of problems in that space either.<p>The only thing I can say is that with the M1 Mac mini I have it’s the only computer I haven’t found any issues with at all yet and I’ve been using it since November 26th 100% of the time. Absolutely no issues at all.<p>Now windows is mostly reliable from the hardware side of things I’d you are lucky but the software is broken as fuck. Nothing works reliably or consistently. For over a month now Alt-tab on 20H2 has been randomly changing window ordering as an example breaking over 20 years of muscle memory. Their own mail client stops receiving mail twenty times a day. I’m not even going to start the book-sized rant on how unreliable their development stack is. And yesterday I spent an hour trying to delete a file which wouldn’t go away.  It’s just motivational poison at the end of the day. Death by a thousand paper cuts.')
