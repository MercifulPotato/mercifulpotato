My own experience has been that women benefit dramatically from a &quot;being a woman&quot; bias that makes them much more likely to be hired - exactly what this study now quantifies - and in addition be basically unfireable even if they have severe skills or attitude problems.<p>The whole idea that there&#x27;s a competency bias towards men is false. What&#x27;s actually being observed is that women are hired even when they aren&#x27;t competent, to please feminists and diversity advocates, which then by definition would make men &quot;appear&quot; more competent even if they were of only average competency.')
