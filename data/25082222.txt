It seems most ineffective in the case of systems theories, of which complexity research (closely aligned with Turchin&#x27;s work), systems theory, cybernetics, and evolutionary theories and models are several examples.<p>Few of these produce reliable forward-looking predictions, most especially for anticipating specific states achieved at specific times.  Much of this hinges on simple complexity and measurement error (uncertainty over initial conditions).<p>What these models <i>do</i> provide, though, are useful models for drawing associations, predicting or describing specific patterns, and establishing the likely existence of specific features or elements of a system.<p>Darwin predated concepts of genes, chromosomes, DNA, and mutation mechanism.  But his notions of <i>variation</i> and <i>inheritance</i> presupposed these and outlined their general characteristics.  Later discoveries conformed with, and further refined, these predictions.<p>Where humanities and social sciences (Turchin&#x27;s cliodynamics somewhat spans this divide) run into additional complexity is that models and predictions themselves become part of the informational context in which individuals, groups, and societies see, analyse, process, express, and respond to the informational environment.<p>This is often compared to Heisenberg uncertainty, but this is a category error.  Heisenberg is addressing <i>fundamental knowability</i>, where the act of ascertaining system state changes the state itself.  Epistemic interactions affect not the state itself, but the informational loop associated with it.  The model and derived understanding are part of the sensing, processing, learning, memory, communications, and control interactions --- the model operates <i>within</i> the modeled system, endogenously rather than exogenously.<p>How to incorporate this distinction into philosophy of science is an interesting problem, though I don&#x27;t think it is impossible.  Pseudoscience lacks not only falsifiability, but generally, consistency and causality.  Sound systems theories should be consistent and denote causality.')
