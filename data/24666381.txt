Item(by='carapace', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601667982, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24664791, text='Cheers!<p>&gt; It&#x27;s unfortunate that the solution seems to be to just leave—(I don&#x27;t think stopping and trying to make a friend is realistic the vast majority of the time, or even safe sometimes)—and I&#x27;m realizing I&#x27;m at that same conclusion.<p>It works out in my case: I&#x27;m a huge Venture Bro.&#x27;s fan and my dream is to create a 1:1 scale model of the Venture Compound complete with H.E.L.P.eR. and G.U.A.R.D.O..  I&#x27;m even going to make the tunnels underneath and invite people to live there (but only if they stay in character as VH1-imitating troglodytes.)  You better believe the laser turrets will be <i>very</i> realistic.<p>As for everybody else, yeah, I think the average person is already screwed, and doesn&#x27;t care because it&#x27;s comfortable enough.  Maybe the Amish will see an uptick in converts but I doubt it.<p>- - - -<p>I want to point out, because some of the other sib comments miss it, my gripe isn&#x27;t so much with one clueless tourist snapping photos, it&#x27;s that his camera is connected to the world-wide internet and all that entails.  For all I know the video has been seen by millions of people by now, eh?  Keeping chickens in the city isn&#x27;t illegal but I don&#x27;t want to attract attention.  (They&#x27;re not supposed to be on the front lawn, they got out of their run.)')
