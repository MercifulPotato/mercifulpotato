And I make sure to buy items which are as bright as possible.<p>I also strongly feel that the current trend for using &quot;silver&quot; retroreflective fabric for entire products (as opposed to contrast panels) is a really bad one. In my experience as a driver, the light bouncing off, for example, a completely retroreflective jacket appears &quot;flat&quot;. This reduces any perception of depth and means it takes noticeably longer to process and understand what it is am I looking at and react accordingly.<p>Just a random video, but imagine seeing just this jacket from 30 metres away - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gVfUkCSw9Ew" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gVfUkCSw9Ew</a>')
