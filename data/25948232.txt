If you want the easy one, it is a pretty straightforward local analysis. If you want the hard stuff you need a sound call graph and some fix-point computation over the whole program, but it is still achievable.<p>The thing that is valuable here is the existence of pure functions, not necessarily the requirement. For a huge number of real programs written in java or whatever the exact same technique applies.')
