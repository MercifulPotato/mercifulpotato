Personally, I think it&#x27;s easier to write than Python (although people who care very little about correctness will be bothered a bit by the type checker), and the tooling is many times better (single-binary deployments, great dependency management, etc are awesome). Also, the performance is about 100-1000 times better for serial execution, and Go&#x27;s goroutines allow you to take advantage of multiple cores much more easily than with Python.<p>JavaScript and TypeScript are similarly easy-to-use, performant languages with a better-than-Python tooling story. I&#x27;ve also heard similar things about Elixir, Closure, and Kotlin.')
