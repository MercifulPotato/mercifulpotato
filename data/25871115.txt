For starters I&#x27;d like them to stop forcing people to use their <i>bad</i> products just because they were there first to lock down the market and or abused their position. This is still happening today.<p>Then I&#x27;ll be more open to use their <i>good</i> products, and there&#x27;s plenty of that. I want to be excited when MS announces a new technology, not to be reminded of how bad they behave as a company and the negative impact they have on my life.<p>&gt;And do you hold other companies (FAANG) do the same standard?<p>Yes. At least with e.g. Apple and Google I can just not use their products, but with Google it&#x27;s getting harder and harder as they monopolize the web and close&#x2F;lock Android even more. Google removed don&#x27;t be evil from their motto, MS should change theirs to We love open source when it&#x27;s convenient. Nothing wrong with doing manipulative PR like everyone else, but don&#x27;t be surprised when some people don&#x27;t want to drink it.')
