Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=[24794752], score=None, time=1602798439, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24794352, text='<i>&gt; &quot;The earth is flat&quot; is not a claim that&#x27;s false upon closer inspection of the available data, it&#x27;s a claim that&#x27;s prima facie false</i><p>No, it isn&#x27;t. We view the claim as absurd today only because we have the benefit of millennia of collection of evidence and arguments and theory that has established &quot;the earth is round&quot; beyond a reasonable doubt. But for a person who either does not have access to all that evidence and arguments and theory, or who simply refuses to believe them (and, as someone else upthread noted, it can be a valid heuristic strategy for some people to refuse to believe claims by other people that they can&#x27;t understand for themselves, in order to avoid being taken advantage of), the claim that the earth is flat is not absurd, which means it&#x27;s not prima facie false.')
