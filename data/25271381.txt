At Feedback Loop, we change the way companies develop products for their customers by providing a platform that lets researchers and non-researchers alike learn faster and innovate smarter. We work with some of the largest B2C companies across industries including finance, insurance, healthcare, and media.<p>Weâ€™re looking for engineers who are curious about product development and consumer behavior, want to work on related challenges, and value opportunities to explore new technologies that execute against a robust, collaborative product vision. We use Typescript&#x2F;NodeJS, Ruby, VueJS, Postgres, Mongo, Redis, Kafka, GraphQL and many other technologies, but we don&#x27;t think it matters if you&#x27;ve used similar technologies on a different stack. Our engineering teams tackle a diverse and evolving array of challenges; from architecting and scaling our microservices to handling real-time data streams with Kafka and using machine learning and natural language processing to empower real world business solutions. This position is full-time and remote (within the US), though remote engineers may be asked to visit our NYC headquarters occasionally when it is safe to do so.<p>Senior Full Stack Engineer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;643cb2fe2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;643cb2fe2</a><p>Full-Stack Engineer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;e94adfdd2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;e94adfdd2</a><p>QA Engineer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;2a52a5172us" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;grnh.se&#x2F;2a52a5172us</a>')
