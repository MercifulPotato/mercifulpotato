You do the procedure for each of the 15c5 = 3003 groups of 5.<p>Each person is part of 1001 groups and has a separate 256-bit number for each group. To recombine the numbers, each of the 5 needs to select the number corresponding to that group.<p>I think this works just as well as SSS for small&#x2F;moderate sized groups. It&#x27;s a little less elegant because you need to know which group you&#x27;re participating in at decode-time, and because it&#x27;s not scalable (but there are few serious applications that need the scalability).')
