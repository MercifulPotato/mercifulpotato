I mean, I know you said &quot;we&#x27;re still small&quot;, but:<p>&gt;The total gross revenue during Q3 was $16,134, which after transaction fees is $14,972.\n&gt;The monthly revenue from all subscriptions is, accounting for credit card fees and amortizing yearly payments, is $5,952.\n&gt;SourceHut has $13,858 in cash at the time of writing.<p>Those figures are tiny!
