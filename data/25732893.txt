There&#x27;s no balance between a message that&#x27;s acceptable in terms of time to be able to send for a user (say, 10 minutes of proof of work), that would reduce spam. If someone sends me a message every 10 minutes the service is unusable, but making the proof of work more expensive means it&#x27;s unusable as well. This is why the original proof of work for email was broken as well.')
