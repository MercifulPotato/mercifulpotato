The game creator lost the license to use Marvel characters and shut down rather abruptly.<p>If there is no practical distinction in ownership and licensing the right to play the game, should Marvel be forced to renew the license with Gazillion. Should Gazillion then stay in business to provide me with something I own indefinitely? Or should they be forced to provide me with the codebase so I can spin up my private server?<p>I&#x27;m not trying to be glib. I&#x27;m honestly curious as to how far your rights should go.')
