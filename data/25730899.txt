That is extremely valuable information that you can use to build other features on top of. For example, there&#x27;s no need for a &quot;raise hand&quot; button anymore, since pushing the talk button clearly signals your intent to speak. The UI can highlight your square, make it larger, whatever, which can make the whole experience a lot smoother.')
