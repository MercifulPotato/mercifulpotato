It was under a hundred bucks and unlike my old APs it doesn&#x27;t get angry at certain devices and deauth them randomly from the network.  Or other APs I&#x27;ve used that start disconnecting users once you have more than 15 devices connected at once.  The configuration software is a bloated Java daemon that I have to manually start then connect to with a client.  It&#x27;s not all that user friendly, but I&#x27;ve been around networks enough to get it working.<p>So it&#x27;s basically the cheapest AP that isn&#x27;t regularly malfunctioning consumer garbage.')
