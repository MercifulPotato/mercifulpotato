It is very slow and challenging work to find new drug molecules that are both safe and effective.<p>But, there are hundreds of disorders, we can&#x27;t test all safe drugs for effective actions against all disorders. If we have great repurposing, probably through mass automation of tests and computer modeling, then we can make a gold mine of already existing gold nuggets.<p>This was true of dexamethasone for covid, seems true of loperamide, and could be true for dozens of other compounds already in our pharmacy and medicine cabinet. This is the biggest opportunity in drug development, and HN has technical, computational talent, so consider this area!!!')
