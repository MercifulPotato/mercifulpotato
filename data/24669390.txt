So while consumers may have a nominal choice, they do not have a real choice about a decision facet that matters. I&#x27;m curious about any anti-trust precedent here, and how this was handled in the courts. (i.e. two separate lawsuits against the companies in question, some sort of unified legal plea...?) How is (implicit) collusion handled?')
