At most I&#x27;ve also hooked up a projector to my computer, but never needed to deal with any setting changes really (just for gaming or rarely for a presentation).<p>A little off topic, but I&#x27;ve run into some weird issues with Display Port&#x2F;Nvidia&#x2F;Dell monitor where the monitor is not recognized on unplug&#x2F;replug. In the past I know there were some issues with older Nvidia drivers and this particular monitor (P2715Q), though this seems like a weird problem that I&#x27;ve seen others have with different configurations online. It led to me needing a weird set of steps (I wrote about this in my Valve Index impressions [0]), using xrandr to add the display mode and switching to a virtual console too. I&#x27;m guessing this is mostly due to the older Dell monitor which has always been a bit wonky with Display Port. I assume things are better these days more broadly.<p>Relevant part of [0]:<p><pre><code>  xrandr --newmode &quot;4K&quot; 533.250 3840 3888 3920 4000 2160 2163 2168 2222 +hsync -vsync\n  xrandr --addmode DP-0 4K\n  xrandr --output DP-0 --mode 4K\n  # switch to virtual terminal, i.e. Ctrl-Alt-F2\n  # switch to DisplayPort input on monitor which should display the terminal\n  env DISPLAY=:0 xset dpms force off; sleep 5; env DISPLAY=:0 xset dpms force on\n  # switch back to X, i.e. Ctrl-Alt-F7\n</code></pre>\nThe modeline to add can be found ahead of time with xrandr --verbose or using a tool like cvt or gtf (see the Arch wiki). Sometimes, though, I just need to power cycle the monitor or unplug and replug some cables. I hope this is just this older hardware, and probably solved, like everything else here, with a new GPU that has more DisplayPort outputs.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boilingsteam.com&#x2F;the-valve-index-on-linux-on-a-min-spec-machine&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;boilingsteam.com&#x2F;the-valve-index-on-linux-on-a-min-s...</a>')
