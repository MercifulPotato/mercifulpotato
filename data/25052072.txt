The military is <i>patriotic</i>, yes, as are its members (it is difficult to imagine how they could be effective were they not), but the military tries very, <i>very</i> hard to be apolitical.  Yes, individuals in the military have strong political opinions, just like many other individual Americans.<p>It seems to me that any country at a point where the combination of its flag together with an oath of office, oath of enlistment or commissioning oath is seen as political rather than patriotic cannot be in a good place.  It is not too far from that to one where calling for fair and unbiased administration of elections is considered political rather than patriotic.<p>Thank you for assisting in the election, and thank you for your excellent software projects, but in this case I think that you were incorrect.')
