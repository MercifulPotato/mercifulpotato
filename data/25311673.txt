So Lupas set a special challenge: a membrane protein from a species of archaea, an ancient group of microbes. For 10 years, his research team tried every trick in the book to get an x-ray crystal structure of the protein. “We couldn’t solve it.”<p>But AlphaFold had no trouble. It returned a detailed image of a three-part protein with two long helical arms in the middle. The model enabled Lupas and his colleagues to make sense of their x-ray data; within half an hour, they had fit their experimental results to AlphaFold’s predicted structure. “It’s almost perfect,” Lupas says. “They could not possibly have cheated on this. I don’t know how they do it.”</i>[1]<p>So you have experimental results, but still don&#x27;t know how it folds. You aren&#x27;t trying to avoid the all the experiments, just understand them.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemag.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;game-has-changed-ai-triumphs-solving-protein-structures" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemag.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;game-has-changed-ai-...</a>')
