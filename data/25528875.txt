Item(by='Trasmatta', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608827291, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25526272, text='&gt; I think that dance is actually a very universal human thing and that thereâ€™s a strange alienation from dance and our bodies going on in western culture, especially for men.<p>This is kind of what I mean. Humans are very diverse, and I don&#x27;t think dance is actually a universal thing. (You could probably argue it overall as a species, but not for every individual.)<p>Because of this, too often the attitude is &quot;well you WOULD like dancing if you just loosened up and stopped worrying about what people think!&quot;. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s true for some people, but definitely not all.<p>I realize, based on your last paragraph, that you&#x27;re not the type of person to try to force someone into dancing. It&#x27;s just similar to the line of reasoning I&#x27;ve encountered when other people can&#x27;t seem to understand that I don&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s like they can&#x27;t compute the idea that it&#x27;s just not something I enjoy. So many people seem to assume that the only possible reason is &quot;a label you&#x27;ve internalized as a quality of yourself&quot;, and it comes off as condescending.')
