In the future, these types of AI-girlfriend programs might actually make that a somewhat harder problem.<p>For myself, honestly if such a program existed that actually had human-level AI and was designed to follow my interests, I might talk to it a lot.  Especially if it could actually help me with my personal training or research.<p>Then combine that with sharing my worldview, and having a realistic appearance according to my idealized whims..<p>But I have tried what I believe to be the best of these AI programs in English like Replika or the new AI Dungeon engine, and they are obviously not yet intelligent like humans.  But there has been quite a bit of progress recently.  Especially for example in the latest Dragon AI Dungeon engine, although the memory and time scales it operates on effectively is limited.  Along with obviously not having a deep model of physics or psychology.<p>It seems like at minimum we need kind of a breakthrough in integrating spatial-visual data with text processing to get true natural language understanding that incorporates physics and psychology.  But if someone does manage to do that, maybe with some kind of new Mega Multi-Modal Captioned Video Transformer trained on half of YouTube with 100 trillion parameters or something.. we might get there within less than three years.  Kind of a long-shot but who knows.')
