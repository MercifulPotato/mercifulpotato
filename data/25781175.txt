Google interviews test for very specific things so it&#x27;s unlikely every engineer in Fitbit would have passed.  Fitbit&#x27;s big enough that I doubt you&#x27;d re-interview every engineer and doing that would scare engineers away, but Fitbit&#x27;s not big enough where you&#x27;d let Fitbit continue to do their own thing for a long period of time.  Would you just convert every engineer into the Google leveling system best you can and see how it shakes out over time in performance review?  Do these things get talked about during acquisition talks?')
