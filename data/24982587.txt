I am annoyed by that. So I am &#x27;party pooper&#x27; when it comes to unit testing. But I would like to have unit tests for something that has calculations or non trivial logic only.<p>Other thing I would really like &#x27;risk based&#x27; approach, like what is the worst thing that can happen with that code. If it can drop half of the records in table, yes do checks and unit testing. If it is going to be something in the interface not displayed or displayed incorrectly then meh.')
