A good graphic is its own summary. Especially since apparently the sentiment values are in an incredibly narrow range:<p>- what do the colors represent?<p>- are marginally higher numbers marginally better&#x2F;worse sentiment, statistically significantly better&#x2F;worse sentiment, etc?<p>- what does &quot;sentiment&quot; actually measure? (&quot;sentiment related&quot; adjectives in posts, vs. &quot;objective&quot; adjectives?)<p>This is basically just detached data that&#x27;s getting upvoted because... it&#x27;s... pretty? The page as posted has literally no information, it just shows uninterpretable data that no one can draw any conclusions from.')
