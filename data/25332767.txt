Sure the web wasn&#x27;t really a thing yet, but all the fundamentals were there. The concept wasn&#x27;t new; we had hypertext and interconnected networks. I don&#x27;t know enough about deep learning to say whether the concepts were unknown then or just waiting on computing speed to catch up. AI research was certainly well underway long before 1990.<p>At least for the work I do, I don&#x27;t think much has <i>fundamentally</i> changed since 1990. Convenience and speed is way higher, yes. Storage and processing power is immensely cheaper. And obviously we&#x27;ve got 30 more years of development of things we can build upon. But I think if a good developer from 1990 could be teleported to today, he&#x27;d be productive with today&#x27;s technology in short order.')
