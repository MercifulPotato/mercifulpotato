The OP&#x27;s post is about measuring a life according to behaviors (activities) and with that data the OP is thinking out loud about how he wants to change things. This is an artifact that describes an analytical mind observing and addressing the daily animal&#x2F;mind hybrid that actually lives in and experiences the world.<p>I tend to agree that &quot;productivity&quot; is an unhealthy obsession linked to vain status chasing, and (among many circles) a vaguely sinister implication. It is too often used as a euphamistic criticism by employers who inevitably want more out of the workers. <i>Produce or die</i> is the default law of the capitalist jungle, so the &quot;productivity number&quot; is the number that a system would use to fire you.<p>But the OP&#x27;s situation is quite different. There is no misalignment between &quot;the boss&quot; (his current analytical mind) and &quot;the worker&quot; (the daily mind&#x2F;body cyborg beast). The boss <i>really wants the best</i> for the worker; the worker <i>really wants to do his best</i> for the boss. (And to me it seems like the boss has his priorities straight, and is doing right by his worker with this analysis and recommendations).')
