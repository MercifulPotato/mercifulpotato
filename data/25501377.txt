Item(by='zug_zug', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608595950, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25500219, text='&gt; Did you assume that, and avoid clicking the link? It doesn’t suggest a universal rule for productivity, and even starts by predicting your reaction: “It’s not a clickbait title, but I understand why it looks that way.”<p>No, I read it, and regretted reading it, and figured I should save others the trouble. I specifically called it out as baity because it claims not to be, which is ludicrous, because it&#x27;s a meandering piece that isn&#x27;t really saying much (&quot;try boneheaded solutions&quot;) of anything, seems like a mix of generalities, caveats, and self-promotion.<p>I&#x27;d challenge you to ask yourself this -- Is there even the slightest chance that anybody who reads this article is going to become 10x as productive from this &quot;technique&quot;?<p>If not, then that seems the definition of linkbait.')
