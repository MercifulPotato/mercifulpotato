Yes, you need a lot of knowledge, but the rules and outcomes are still clear. Compared to writing a novel or painting, it&#x27;s very clear when you&#x27;ve reached success and it&#x27;s hard to argue that you&#x27;ve been successful.<p>The same goes for poker, you know when you won a hand. However winning a hand doesn&#x27;t mean you learned something, similarly successfully debugging a large performance issue doesn&#x27;t mean you learned something either. The learning we actually care about in software engineers isn&#x27;t kind at all.')
