There are&#x2F;were also autoplaying loud video ads &quot;while you wait&quot; on top of all the tracking. They load pixels from Facebook explicitly.<p>Is there a simple-ish alternative for the direct link occasional image upload, ideally one I can just Cmd+V into a web page?<p>I do this so rarely it&#x27;s not worth setting up a webserver. It would be helpful to offer a few recs for non-technical friends too; it&#x27;d be ideal if it strips timestamp&#x2F;EXIF data too as a side effect like imgur did.<p>Most of my uploads are demonstration screenshots via Snipping Tool, so they usually don&#x27;t exist on the filesystem, just clipboard.<p>some I&#x27;ve tried:<p>- ibb.co tries their hardest to not give you a direct link, only thumbnail w&#x2F;link to their site.<p>- photobucket and tinypic no longer exist.<p>- dropbox requires account and can&#x27;t easily be uploaded to; requires files<p>- flickr, requires account, difficult to direct link; not sure if this has changed since smugmug; requires files<p>- deviantart, not meant for this purpose; requires account and file upload<p>- google photos, no direct link, requires g account')
