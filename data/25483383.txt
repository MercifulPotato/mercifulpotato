Honestly I think the Synology NAS even has a bigger and more helpful community for running these kinds of applications than the RPi does. There are also some more tinkerer-oriented NAS products such as the Kobol Helios machines that even offer GPIO - but also USB-C direct-attached storage and 2x gigabit (or better) ethernet interfaces, in the most recent model. When you consider the additional pain point of dealing with USB SATA controllers, I&#x27;m not convinced the RPi would ever be a good choice for a NAS or home server unless you were choosing it strictly for price reasons - NAS features like a good enclosure and drive management are unfortunately very steeply priced compared to the RPi, with commercial products often running $600 and up... although the Kobol products are very attractively priced, at the cost of very long fulfillment times since they run on preorders.')
