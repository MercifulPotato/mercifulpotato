Just as importantly, <i>who</i> gets to decide what&#x27;s appropriate&#x2F;inappropriate?<p>And to whom would this apply?  Section 230 applies to <i>everyone</i>, including you, me, HackerNews and your great aunt Sally.<p>If we limit section 230&#x27;s applicability, who decides where it should apply and where it shouldn&#x27;t?<p>I&#x27;m not objecting to your suggestion, I&#x27;d just like to understand how you see such a &#x27;compromise&#x27; being implemented.<p>I&#x27;d welcome your thoughts!')
