Even the American Bar Association observed that Mueller found no evidence that Trump colluded with the Russians[0]:<p>&quot;The special counsel found that Russia did interfere with the election, but â€œdid not find that the Trump campaign, or anyone associated with it, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts, despite multiple efforts from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.&quot;<p>Obviously &quot;things were uncovered&quot;. People were charged. But their charges were obviously not related to Trump-Russia collusion, given Mueller&#x27;s findings. So why is it that half of the country believes that he did? The answer is so, so obvious.<p>But hey, maybe you have a better handle on this whole thing than the ABA. I&#x27;d be glad to hear your thoughts.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americanbar.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;abanews&#x2F;aba-news-archives&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;mueller-concludes-investigation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americanbar.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;abanews&#x2F;aba-news-archives&#x2F;2...</a>')
