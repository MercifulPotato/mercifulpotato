I use all three unordered bullets to differentiate things in plaintext.<p>The opinionation that removes synonyms will kill any chances of this working with legacy IMO. Any significant doc base will hit myriad issues that come down to &quot;I didn&#x27;t like that form of it.&quot; I was initially OK with the idea of a parseable subset, which would be useful, but this goes too far with a &quot;one way only&quot; attitude. No thanks.<p>That said, someone should do what the project <i>claims</i> to do, without gutting the language. A formalized subset of CommonMark that only skips formally indescribable specs but otherwise preserves everything else would be useful in some situations. It might even become the defacto CommonMark spec if it&#x27;s easier to implement.')
