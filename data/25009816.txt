That’s why gentrification is a dirty word in many communities.  However, like most things it’s complex.<p>One often overlooked benefit is the knock on effects of gentrification are real improvements in local school systems.  Looking across decades you often see gay communities which care less about local school systems acting as a catalyst by increasing local revenue while reducing the demands placed on local schools.  The improvement in local schools precedes people’s awareness that the schools have improved.  Similarly, many people can leverage the improvements in the local economy to keep up with the transition.<p>That said, relatively few people can keep up with significant changes and those people are simply worse off having lost an affordable community which they had social or economic ties to.  A restaurant for example is generally different to relocate.  A local handyman may have a steady stream of existing customers, which don’t follow them etc.')
