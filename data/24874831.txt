You&#x27;ll need to use LiveCode version 6, since the HyperCard import functionality has been broken in LiveCode 7 onwards, but you can import a HyperCard stack using LiveCode 6, save the project in LiveCode&#x27;s file format, and continue in a recent version of LiveCode.<p>HyperTalk and LiveCode aren&#x27;t 100% compatible (probably around 80%, less if you used a lot of XCMDs since they aren&#x27;t supported), but if you have an old stack you want to modernise, LiveCode is a great and affordable (it&#x27;s GPLv3, with a commercial offering if you need to publish closed source projects) way to do it.<p>The best resource[1] on converting a HyperCard stack to LiveCode is by Jacqueline Landman Gay of HyperActive Software[2]. I believe HyperActive can also do consulting and conversion work for HyperCard stacks to LiveCode.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hyperactivesw.com&#x2F;mctutorial&#x2F;rrintro.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hyperactivesw.com&#x2F;mctutorial&#x2F;rrintro.html</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hyperactivesw.com&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hyperactivesw.com&#x2F;index.html</a>')
