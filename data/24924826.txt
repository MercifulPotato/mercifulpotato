Atheists, in all cases, are paradoxical. They fall into two categories.<p>1) I am an atheist because I don&#x27;t <i>believe</i> in God.<p>2) I am a atheist because I <i>know</i> God <i>does not exist.</i><p>The first sense is not ontological, but based on what they believe. They are, in fact, the reciprical of an agnostic.<p>In the second sense, they claim the unknowable.<p>So if atheists exist, they are either mistaken about what they are or they claim knowledge they can not possibly have.<p>Atheism is somewhat impossible, and atheists, all of them, at best, are agnostics. So perhaps atheists do not actually and legitimately exist.')
