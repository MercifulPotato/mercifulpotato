Their own store, their own hardware, their own OS, their own services? Every business Apple is in has large alternatives. They make money selling you things, not from ads. Everything Google and Facebook do is designed to ensure they make ad revenue or sell your data in some way for money; they need to control every thing in their supposed business (search, android, social media, etc) to ensure they dominate in collecting ad&#x2F;data revenue which is the only business they make money on. Apple only wants to sell you more devices or device related services which is their business. You can live quite well without any Apple product at all, many people do. Try living without Google.<p>Amazon on the other hand is worse, as they want to control all business segments they get into, even totally unrelated to their business of being a store that sells things. Using your dominance in one type of business to force everyone to also support unrelated businesses with no alternatives is one common definition of monopoly; think dominating railroads to force everyone to use your oil (Standard Oil).')
