On the internet any casual comment about anything is up for the attack “oh so now you claim to be an expert on X do you, well let me put you in your place...”.<p>&gt; “<i>The Twitter account you followed to understand politics now seems more focused on their mindfulness practice.</i>”<p>What a &quot;hellscape&quot; it is when you’re reminded that other people are <i>people</i> and not service-providing objects that exist for your one-sided extraction of value. Just because you pigeonhole someone as “the politics person” doesn’t mean they do that to themselves, and just because they tweet about mindfulness doesn’t mean any claim to being a polymath, and just because you want to &quot;learn about politics&quot; doesn&#x27;t oblige someone to &quot;know their place&quot; in your life and stick to it.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s something more interesting and deeper to be brought up about how it fundamentally doesn&#x27;t seem to <i>matter</i> if you know a lot or a little, outside the lense of maximising capitalist money acquisition, but it&#x27;s too hard to get past the rest of it and get to it.')
