A &quot;law and order society&quot; that uses the police for law enforcement is a descriptor of both the US and Germany.<p>It&#x27;s a cool statistic, but it only says that whatever the US is doing must be worse than whatever Germany is doing. You would also have to say that the two countries are sufficiently representative of law and order vs. extrajudicial, which I don&#x27;t think is true.')
