Imagine if your contacts magically stayed up-to-date with no effort on your part.<p>is this a joke? how can that <i>possibly</i> be the intro sentence for anything? even an actual product, much less a pre-product manifesto, or whatever this is.<p>honestly, magically syncing contacts sounds sounds pretty sweet. it is a problem i have. i don&#x27;t know that it is mundane, nor that it&#x27;s solution must be magical; but maybe that is what it necessitates. but what a half-assed way to try exude apple-ness, or whatever you would call that. it reads like a child&#x27;s description of the super awesome pillow fort they&#x27;re gonna build this weekend.<p>&gt; When your contacts are organized and truly work, they create a flywheel where scheduling, planning, organizing, and being thoughtful about your relationships becomes infinitely easier.<p>wow, what an evocative analogy. a flywheel! &quot;infinitely easier&quot;? wow! (you get my point.)<p>seriously, i hate to be so harsh, but it&#x27;s at least 50% because i&#x27;m jealous of the idea of writing a manifesto as a company &#x2F; product announcement, and i strongly feel like the effect would have been way stronger with just a little heavier editor&#x27;s pen.')
