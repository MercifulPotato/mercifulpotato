Here, I&#x27;d either have to do them on top of the bed, or do them in the 2 foot space between the bed and the wall, or in the 3x4 foot shower.<p>The bedroom, toilet, and shower in total area of 8 sq. m. &#x2F; 86 square feet.  That&#x27;s 8 by 10.5 feet, with a double bed taking up most of it, and a pair of glass walls separating the toilet and shower areas.  I haven&#x27;t measured it, but it&#x27;s advertised as 8 square m, and looks roughly 8 by 10.5.')
