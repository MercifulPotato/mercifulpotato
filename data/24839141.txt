Why would developers have to maintain a website that&#x27;s not hosted by them?<p>If the issue is maintainability once the website has been extended (i.e., with custom code and integrations), then it&#x27;s all about _that__ experience. I think in those cases, the mistake is to come up with some sort of bespoke abstraction that the developer now has to learn and that is different from everything else they&#x27;re used to.<p>With the way we&#x27;ve designed Makeswift, once we open up extensibility, you&#x27;ll just use regular old code (e.g., React, Vue, Angular components, or plan HTML and JS), in a repository that&#x27;s version-controlled, that lives with the rest of the code.<p>To make that a bit more concrete, today, Makeswift components are just React components. So Makeswift&#x27;s API is just passing props to your component. That&#x27;s what we plan to open up eventually.')
