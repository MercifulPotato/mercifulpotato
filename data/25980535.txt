So many stars it was hard to see the space between them.<p>When I got home, I ended up lying on the grass for a bit in the dark to try and look at some stars the street lights ended a couple of blocks away, so the yard&#x27;s still relatively dark at night.<p>Then when I looked up and tried to watch the stars...all I saw were satellites zipping around everywhere.<p>When I was a kid, seeing a satellite was a fairly rare phenomenon almost as exciting as seeing a meteor. I honestly found the satellites to be more depressing than the light pollution. There wasn&#x27;t a section of sky that didn&#x27;t have a satellite in it.<p>I was still somewhat in that mushroom state of mind, so I got kind of unreasonably sad about it. But it really bothered me. I ended up not wanting to look at the stars and just went to bed.')
