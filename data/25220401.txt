On the flip side, if you&#x27;re getting an iPad Pro, you should really be planning to buy the Pencil with it to take advantage of its strengths.<p>Agreed, the big thing about the iPad Pro is the pencil and note taking&#x2F;markup&#x2F;doodling abilities. However even so chances are that someone has the keyboard attached most of the time and is still a heavy user of the pencil on iPad. Meaning that the iPad is the right form factor.<p>Extrapolating further, even if the Air supported pencil, the form factor would mean that using pencil on the upright screen would always be compromised. Then the added  appeal of the iPad + Magic Keyboard is that itâ€™s the perfect form factor for note taking&#x2F;annotations&#x2F;doodling &#x2F;drawing and it has this powerful processor and keyboard when you need it to.<p>So to me, even if the Air and iPad Pro start to have overlapping features, the form factor difference alone gives them enough differentiation, both being useful.')
