Are you aware of a good up-to-date write-up of the differences of git submodules and mercurial subrepos by any chance?<p>Whilst I can live with mercurial having lost the VC war (and prefer git on the whole) I am a bit annoyed that few of the good features that hg has over git seem to have been adopted by the latter, even where conceptually compatible (I believe git bundle is hg inspired, but it&#x27;s pretty fringe to start with).')
