I&#x27;ve kept in touch with people for 15+ years using IRC nicknames.  In a few cases I don&#x27;t know the other person&#x27;s real name at all.<p>Sure people can change their nicknames, but people change their real names too.  I&#x27;ve gone by three different &#x27;real&#x27; names throughout my life.  That may not be super common, but people getting married and changing their name at least once is certainly not rare.   The way I see it, a &#x27;real&#x27; name is only more real than the others insofar as it&#x27;s the name the government uses for you.  But that sort of realness isn&#x27;t relevant for social purposes.  For social purposes, the &#x27;realest&#x27; name is the name people call you.')
