Ardour&#x27;s given me a lot of value over the years when other options were out of reach and now that I can, having the option to pay a reasonable price or what I can or am willing or able to pay for it is an easy choice to make.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of FOSS software i&#x27;ve used over the years that have helped me in times when I could never afford proprietary alternatives and as i&#x27;ve gotten older and made more money i&#x27;ve tried to go back and donate or buy prebuilt binaries of that software when I can.<p>Honestly, the existence of such software has helped me so many times in life when I would have either had to fork out unreasonable amounts of money or pirate things.<p>I wish open source maintainers and devs got more credit for the work they do. I bet it would be hard to figure out just how many lives have been enriched and bettered by their work.')
