KDE is amazing. It is used by airbus for analyzing sensor data test results, others in astronomy, and myself in commissioning power plants. KST is so good for zooming and scrolling around plots generated from live and historical datasets really quickly. It outshines all the analysis software on big SCADA systems like osi pi, factory talk, wonderware, etc.')
