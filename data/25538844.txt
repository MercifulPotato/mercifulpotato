It’s entirely hypothesis and speculation.<p>We have seen strains quickly accelerate because of founder effect several times in 2020, and particular strains dominate in particular regions. The experimental studies that are needed to confirm a claim of evolutionary advantage have not been done, and the observational evidence is weak.<p>Those who would panic about this should be just as circumspect in their their claims as those who would dismiss it.')
