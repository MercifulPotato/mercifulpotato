The trick is that the js is built automatically based on components. Devs rarely have to touch js.<p>It&#x27;s lightweight on the frontend and a pleasure to develop for since forms are entirely coded on the backend with components. On rare exceptions more complex pages have some sprinkled lodash.js.<p>They have around 400 CRUD pages with complex business validations. Up to 1.5k concurrent users. At that point MySQL starts to sweat a bit and p95 increases above 200ms. All running on 2 machines: a nginx+phpfpm and a MariaDB.<p>The instant no-compilation feedback loop of edit-save-refresh is orgasmic. That system opened my eyes to a lot of preconceptions and buzzwords I once held sacred.')
