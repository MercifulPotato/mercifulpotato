There are exceptions of course and people fall into them. But the energy that will go into trying to create your own exception is likely to be greater than the energy that goes into a PhD and the odds of winding up in a research position are lower than with a PhD.<p>Think about it from the perspective of a person hiring for a research position. How would not having a PhD be a positive? Not having a PhD doesn&#x27;t correlate with anything positive. It correlates with less training, less commitment, and less experience. And it correlates with the candidate not valuing these things.<p>The PhD is more in your control than finding a research position without one. Good luck.')
