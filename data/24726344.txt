Some of that is probably due to e.g. reduced automotive mortalities under more stringent lockdown, but I don&#x27;t think the data you posted indicats that CA is e.g. worse than the other 3 states at reporting COVID deaths (otherwise we would see a much higher excess death count in CA compared to those 3 states).')
