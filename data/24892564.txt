Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[24892801, 24893763], score=None, time=1603682478, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24888234, text='If circumvention falls outside of the safe harbor provisions (which seems to be the plain text of the law), that just means that the ISP liability, if any, begins immediately on hosting it, and their liability for hosting it isn&#x27;t negated by taking it down in accordance with the safe harbor process.  OTOH, while the mental state required for a 1201 violation is not explicit, the most reasonable reading is that it requires knowledge of the circumventing purpose, which would mean liability would not attach to an hands-off distributor of material supplied by a third party until they had notice, which, is essentially equivalent to the safe harbor for infringement. So, from a liability perspective, it&#x27;s at least plausible that there isn&#x27;t a big difference here between circumvention and safe harbor provision.<p>And, on top of the circumvention, this article tries to argue against infringement that the RIAA allegations, beyond circumvention, only involve “incidental copying&quot;, but any copying <i>not</i> either licensed or protected as fair use (which even the article here does not claim applies) is infringement. So, the article makes the infringement case while attempting to deny it. The infringement may only be contributory rather than direct on the part of youtube-dl’s creators, as well as anyone knowingly distributing it, but contributory infringement is still infringement, and so governed by the infringement safe harbor directly.')
