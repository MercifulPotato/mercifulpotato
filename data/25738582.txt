I don&#x27;t __think__ he ever actually said &quot;Storm the capital and break down the doors&quot;.<p>So if I say on Twitter that Google is hiding Elvis in their Mountain View office and people break down the doors of Google to go see, did I just insight violence?  If any idea leads to violence,  should the author of the idea pay the price for the violence created by others?')
