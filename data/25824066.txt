If yes, please elaborate on how you see that happening in the real world.<p>&gt;<i>The fact that they are saving it as json by default seems more to be laziness by the developers than a well thought-out solution, that could be just a straightforward serializer.</i><p>So, how would that well thought-out solution in the form of a &quot;straightforward serializer&quot; work?
