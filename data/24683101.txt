With no traction control or <i>advanced</i> aerodynamics and less regulations on engine power, it was a real arena for drivers.<p>It was so fierce that Senna decided to hit his rival in the first corner of a race, taking out both, solidifying Senna&#x27;s championship.<p>It was exciting too. Since drivers need to take risks with 750+ HP beasts, Senna battling Schumacher, Villneuve battling Coulthard was fun.<p>Pit-stop tactics was the cherry on top, not the secret sauce. Engines and drive trains were not regulated. After some deaths, non rational gains (Mercedes 7G-tronic was so quick when paired with their engine. It just accelerated uninterrupted so it got banned. Renault&#x27;s Open Injection engine was so powerful so it got banned a year later) and <i>hey, it&#x27;s getting too expensive</i> cries (and Ferrari-Gate), it lost its luster for the audience.<p>Now the war is behind the scenes. Homologated parts, limited testing and <i>simulation</i> (they have yearly CPU instruction limits!) and some good people rule the sport.<p>It&#x27;s no longer about the drivers. It&#x27;s about the car you drive and the people behind it. If you have the season&#x27;s best engine and Adrian Newey in your car design team, you can just win.<p>So it feels like the movie &quot;Death Race&quot; if you have a good car, you have advantage and if it doesn&#x27;t break down, you win. That&#x27;s it.<p>I left watching it the day Ferrari admitted that they&#x27;re basically financed by FIA (by getting 23% more advertisement revenue cut at the end, every year).<p>Some more points: Standardized ECU just killed a lot of excitement by limiting remote engine tuning. Ferrari&#x27;s domination slowly eroded excitement for most people. Drivers being immature and getting away with it eroded its prestige for me. I still miss Jaguar&#x27;s green&#x2F;gold cars. Boy, they were handsome.<p>So its golden era is long gone. No wonder Honda is leaving.')
