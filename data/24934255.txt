I would even argue that psychological foundations like a horizon, and a sky above, and space that one can roam with one&#x27;s own two feet, are essential to human thriving.<p>There are so many things we take for granted that probably don&#x27;t exist, exactly this way, anywhere else in the universe.<p>We could probably satisfy our basic survival needs on a planet like Mars. We could make water, and nutrients, and oxygen, and shield ourselves from radiation. But it would mean living inside a box, possibly underground, forever, in constant precarity because if our artificial biomes ever have problems, we&#x27;re out of luck. We can&#x27;t fall back to nature; there <i>is</i> no nature. The world outside doesn&#x27;t have a life of its own, it&#x27;s fully dead. Even the very most optimistic version of this scenario is a bleak shadow of the life that can be lived on Earth.')
