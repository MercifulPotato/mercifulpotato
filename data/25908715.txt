I used to feel more stressed out in the mornings, and I was sure it was because of jaw clenching I would do at night which is now largely gone.<p>And this is going to sound weird, but I&#x27;ve taken it even further by buying some baby chew toys off Amazon and chewing on them for maybe an hour a day. The benefits I&#x27;ve seen since starting about six months ago are 1) less teeth stress&#x2F;pain at night and in the morning, 2) less nasal pressure&#x2F;stress (pretty sure I have more breathing capacity through my nose now), and 3) I feel my face has widened ever so slightly but that may be the jaw positioning alone.')
