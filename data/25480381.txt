No one is entitled to your time or energy. Choosing to spend that energy on another person, without thought of reward, is a form of kindness.<p>We can and probably should be polite to people by default. That is a way of showing kindness. If the other person decides to be a blackhole, leave them. If they are harming someone, you are free to (and probably should) warn other people.<p>Kindness does not require you let people take advantage of you.')
