The current dweller&#x27;s. Those who want to come to the city can&#x27;t, plus now it automatically makes every new development a fight club about subsidized housing (affordable&#x2F;low-income units).<p>Obviously a community prioritizing protecting their members is not surprising, but since members change, it can eventually lead to a stagnant community.<p>Sure, smoothing out supply and demand imbalances is useful, but this means rent control must not be (cannot be) a long term solution.<p>It leads to megacorps settling in neighboring suburbs, puts a lot of tension into the tenant-landlord relationship (which is already usually a delicate one, see the usual neglect of units to extract maximal profits in a non-competitive market), detaches housing prices from prices of other goods and services (and thus the price of those increase due to the available disposable income, which is not particularly bad, but yet another imbalance).<p>And the usual big problem is that it decreases the incentive to increase supply. Which means, unless the regulator steps in it just leads to even longer duration of imbalance. (Eg. city population growth capped.)')
