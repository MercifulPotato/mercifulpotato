When we had less (de facto) transparency.<p>Agreements bargained out in a dark room, with everyone announcing the compromise and expressing support for what&#x27;s agreed, are how American politics worked best.<p>Radical transparency poisons compromise. By which I mean, non-comprehensive but absolute transparency: everyone knows details, but no one understands the greater picture.<p>In a largely uneducated democratic electorate (relative to our elected officials, their staffs, and professionals, and leveled as a <i>non-partisan</i> charge against all parties and independents), why do we try to completely usurp our elected representatives&#x27; ability to bargain on our behalf?<p>We, as voters, should judge our politicians on what they <i>do</i>, not what they <i>reject</i>.<p>The former results in functional compromises we&#x27;re not thrilled with. The latter results in ideologically pure paralysis.<p>More depth: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;president.upenn.edu&#x2F;meet-president&#x2F;Mindsets-Political-Compromise&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;president.upenn.edu&#x2F;meet-president&#x2F;Mindsets-Politica...</a>')
