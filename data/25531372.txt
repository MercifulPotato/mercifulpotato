At every company where I&#x27;ve worked with data scientists, every piece of &quot;data science&quot; code is written twice -- once in Python, and again in another language. We had to hire at least one software engineer for every data scientist. There is an entire industry that targets &quot;productionalizing&quot; things written in Python by data scientists, because Python code <i>is not production-ready code.</i><p>Python for education? Absolutely. Python for whiteboard interviews? Great. Python as a DSL for data science? Obviously. Python as a scripting language? Sure.<p>Python as a production-ready language for a growing company? I have spoken to people at lots of companies that started with Python, and then had to dedicate months or years for a full rewrite. And if they have people writing Python code, they have hired more people to rewrite that code immediately so it&#x27;s not in Python anymore. I say &quot;bye&quot; to every interviewer who pitches me on a job writing Python: every time I have looked into an opportunity like that, it was an attempt to throw fresh meat at rewriting a creaky, unmaintainable Django monstrosity. This isn&#x27;t me being an armchair philosopher, this is the industry around me.')
