Most startup interviews are 100% based on merit. I have worked at 2 startups where we have people writing code that never finished a CS degree and they where some of the most valuable members of the team.<p>I am not telling you to smile and be happy. I was just trying to understand your thoughts in your comment. At one point in my life my wife and I had our cars repossessed and were a month from being on the street. I had a job for 9 months where I drove 300 miles a day to get to because we lived so far away (with family) and it was the job I could get that paid the bills for my family. We all do what we have to do. The world is not fair.')
