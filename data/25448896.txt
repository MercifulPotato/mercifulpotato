Everyone I knew in my friend groups had their masks up. N95s and P100s we all had for California wildfire season. It was the perfect use of knowledge over argument from authority: we were all masked up and we knew we were right.<p>Other things people said:<p>* N95s have a short shelf-life. Complete bullshit. The real first POF is the elasticated band. If that&#x27;s fine, your fit will probably be fine. We knew this wasn&#x27;t true so my 10 year old masks were still legit.<p>* N95s require a lot of training for fit. The fit test is trivial to do. We knew this but lots of people on HN and authorities claimed this wasn&#x27;t the case.<p>* N95s cannot be reused. This was highly likely to be nonsense. The virus doesn&#x27;t survive on surfaces for very long and that was the high probability event. After all, viruses rarely mutate so  that they&#x27;re terrible in all ways. i.e. this virus likely behaves like other coronaviruses except for a few variations.<p>And of course those with our half-mask respirators printed our exhale valves and placed our P100s in them and were full protected.<p>There was a lot of misinformation going around by people who just didn&#x27;t know very much and were very eager to sound authoritative. They were all about &quot;sources&quot; and &quot;citations&quot; that are just parrot views (i.e. single primary source, many secondary sources giving the impression of consensus).<p>People made fun of the tech industry for how they handled it, too. Techies (being coddled millennial snowflakes) shut down before any government, stopped business flights to&#x2F;from China, and started working from home and wearing masks earlier.<p>Honestly, my biggest mistake was that I was one of the few in my group of friends who believed the US had competent bureaucrats and so I stayed in the market while my friends sold ahead of the crash.
