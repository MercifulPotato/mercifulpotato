I was using tensorflow 1 (1.14 maybe?) just a few months ago (once I realized tensorflow 2 was running twice as slow for some reason). I think there are some really big projects that still can&#x27;t use tensorflow 2.<p>But I certainly agree with the frustration with google breaking everything. If I wanted to use Chainer (or for that matter Keras) I would just use that. I don&#x27;t need tensorflow to imitate it for me and break the alternative approach I was using.')
