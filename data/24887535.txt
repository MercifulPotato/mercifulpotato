Item(by='ryukafalz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603643784, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24887041, text='&gt;I&#x27;ve repeatedly heard exposure therapy described as the single most effective treatment in psychology. If true, our approach to microaggressions may be backwards. Protecting people from them may be exactly the wrong treatment for people that are stressed by such behavior. Exposure therapy may be the best.<p>Exposure therapy may be highly effective, but I still don&#x27;t think this follows in the general, public case (e.g. on internet forums). This SSC post puts it quite well, I think:<p>&gt;They say that “Confronting triggers, not avoiding them, is the best way to overcome PTSD”. They point out that “exposure therapy” is the best treatment for trauma survivors, including rape victims. And that this involves reliving the trauma and exposing yourself to traumatic stimuli, exactly what trigger warnings are intended to prevent. All this is true. But I feel like they are missing a very important point.<p>&gt;YOU DO NOT GIVE PSYCHOTHERAPY TO PEOPLE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT.<p>&gt;Psychotherapists treat arachnophobia with exposure therapy, too. They expose people first to cute, little spiders behind a glass cage. Then bigger spiders. Then they take them out of the cage. Finally, in a carefully controlled environment with their very supportive therapist standing by, they make people experience their worst fear, like having a big tarantula crawl all over them. It usually works pretty well.<p>&gt;Finding an arachnophobic person, and throwing a bucket full of tarantulas at them while shouting “I’M HELPING! I’M HELPING!” works less well.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;30&#x2F;the-wonderful-thing-about-triggers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;30&#x2F;the-wonderful-thing-ab...</a><p>Now, in a private session with a therapist, with the patient&#x27;s consent?
