Some differences are:\n1. logseq works directly with plaintext files (it support both org mode and markdown for the record, we plan to add more markup formats like asciidoc in the future).\n2. logseq can be used on the web and can be synced using Git.\n3. logseq draws a lot of ideas from org mode, tiddlywiki instead of only Roam Research.<p>Athens is working on a desktop app (which we&#x27;ll start building soon). It&#x27;s always great to have multiple implementations so that we can learn from each other.')
