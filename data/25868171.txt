Item(by='denismi', descendants=None, kids=[25869281], score=None, time=1611288123, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25862184, text='Last.fm tells me that in the last 2 years I&#x27;ve listened to songs from 2,015 different albums (almost exclusively via Spotify). That goes up to 4,238 in the last 5, and increases by a few hundred per year thereafter.<p>The top 50 albums over those 2 years are a quarter of my listens, the top 100 are just over a third.<p>Even if two-thirds of that album count is bad metadata (e.g. the same song counted against multiple different albums&#x2F;compilations&#x2F;etc.) it would still be prohibitively expensive to consume anywhere near the same breadth of content if I had to acquire perpetual rights (from Bandcamp&#x2F;iTunes&#x2F;etc.) for everything rather than effectively renting them out for a single play (from Spotify).<p>The other thing I like about the streaming model is that artist remuneration correlates to how impactful their work subsequently is to my life (i.e. how many times I listen to it both during discovery and then over the subsequent years&#x2F;decades) rather than how effective their marketing is at convincing me to buy the album up front.')
