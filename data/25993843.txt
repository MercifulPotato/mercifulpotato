(Chart titled &quot;Import dependency by primary energy source 2008 and 2018 for Germany.&quot;)<p>The 2008-2018 deltas were:<p>- Natural gas +1<p>- Oil -15<p>- Hard coal -17<p>- Lignite -3<p>- Nuclear -27<p>- Renewables +23<p>Maybe you&#x27;re saying that Germany could have reduced natural gas use too if they&#x27;d invested in nuclear instead of renewables? Possibly, but France started building Flamanville 3 at the end of 2007 and it&#x27;s not going to enter commercial operation until after 2022 [1]. If Germany had started building new reactors 10 years ago it&#x27;s possible they would still be waiting for the money invested to generate <i>any</i> new energy, just like France.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;world-nuclear-news.org&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;EDF-warns-of-added-costs-of-Flamanville-EPR-weld-r" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;world-nuclear-news.org&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;EDF-warns-of-added-c...</a>')
