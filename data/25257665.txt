I once posed a question at chess.com, which attracted many comments answering the opposite of my hunch, but after lots of analysis of games I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m right:<p>Looking at the computer-calculated advantage score during a game (e.g. &quot;white is at +1.0&quot;), is it possible to make a move that increases your advantage?<p>My belief is that, no, as a human it is not possible (at least, virtually impossible) to make a move that increases your calculated advantage. Your advantage is the score calculated with the assumption you make no further mistakes. The best we can do as humans is to keep that score, or (more frequently) lower it.<p>The game is then won by whoever lowers their advantage the least over the course of the game.<p>What cemented this for me was watching AlphaZero play against Stockfish. AlphaZero was playing so far outside the realm of what Stockfish could do that it was the only game I ever saw where a player increased their score. Basically Stockfish would say &quot;you made a bad move, you made a bad move, you made a ... wait a second, that&#x27;s a great move! How did I not see what you were doing!?&quot;')
