If you get in an accident unless the other driver admits fault insurance companies negotiate and settle. If you aren&#x27;t an insurance company they will stick you for the whole cost or the cost of litigation and time wasted will far out weigh the benefits of not buying insurance. Only time it makes sense to not insure is when you car value is close to the deductible.')
