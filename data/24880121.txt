You&#x27;re entitled to an input. Not to skewing the structuring function to optimize for  voter population density, neither directly via tinkering with the effective representation calculation, or indirectly via the change you suggested.<p>It&#x27;s not a terrible idea to be honest, but there is a degree of simplicity to the way we do it now, and I have the feeling yours would be a hard sell to the average American, or even the above average ones without substantially more in detail analysis.')
