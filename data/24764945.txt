Item(by='colanderman', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1602592204, title='Google Slides “mention” spam', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Spammers have now discovered that you can &quot;mention&quot; someone in Google Slides, anyone at all, and it will pop up a notification on their Android phone with no recourse. I get a few of these every week now.  Has anyone else been seeing these?<p>I can&#x27;t find any way to disable such garbage in Google Slides itslef (it doesn&#x27;t seem to have settings), or restrict it only to my contacts. I don&#x27;t want to disable Drive notifications entirely since I actually do get shared things by friends on occasion.<p>This seems to be the new iteration of Google Calendar spam and Google Drive spam.<p>Hoping to make enough noise here to get Google eyes on this problem, since there&#x27;s no other way to notify Google of this issue.<p>(I guess I could always put together a Slides deck and &quot;mention&quot; some Googlers...)')
