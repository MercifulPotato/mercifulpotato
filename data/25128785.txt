Bitcoin as a short term (and maybe even long term) investment is a horrible idea in my eyes as its value is all over the place.<p>But from the definition on Wikipedia, a Ponzi scheme is a form of fraud, which itself Wikipedia defines as &quot;intentional deception&quot;. I wouldn&#x27;t say that Bitcoin or the Bitcoin project itself is intentionally trying to deceive you into using it as an investment. Maybe all the companies that are advertising Bitcoin as an investment are though.<p>I also do believe Bitcoin is overvalued currently. It makes sense to me that the value of each Bitcoin would grow over time, just not at the crazy speed it&#x27;s currently growing at.')
