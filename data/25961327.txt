It&#x27;s closer to a permanent exhibition recreating major ecosystems, w&#x2F; live animals.<p>Gotta disagree with the pricing thing though. A quick Google search tells me San Diego zoo is about USD$60&#x2F;day. NY Botanical Garden is USD$22 (~CAD$28) for the day. The Biodome is CAD$21 (~USD$16.50).')
