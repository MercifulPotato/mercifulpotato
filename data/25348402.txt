They bought them for the recently-launched Beats Music streaming service, which is what became Apple Music, and the added music industry connections that came along with Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre.<p>(It&#x27;s also my impression that Beats products released after the Apple acquisition have been getting somewhat better reviews in terms of sound quality, but it&#x27;s not a brand I really keep track of, so that could be wrong!)')
