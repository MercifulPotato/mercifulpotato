For software in general, that&#x27;s not my experience.<p>The only software I can think of for users that doesn&#x27;t use an API is maybe on an embedded microcontroller.  Everything uses APIs.  File system APIs, GUI APIs, timer APIs, network APIs.  Even standard output is usually exposed via an API in most languages.<p>&gt; The ellipses suggests a natural conclusion, but none come to mind. Do you mind completing the thought?<p>The conclusion is that software <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> always built with web APIs, in contrast from APIs in general.')
