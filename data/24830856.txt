Item(by='Spivak', descendants=None, kids=[24830888], score=None, time=1603140558, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24830761, text='It doesn&#x27;t matter since your fingerprint isn&#x27;t secret. It&#x27;s not enough to have a picture of my fingerprint, you have to produce a convincing enough fake of a real human with the right fingerprint.<p>Take this to meatspace for a second. If you had a security guard sitting at a desk inspecting your hands and taking fingerprints you couldn&#x27;t trick them with pictures. You can&#x27;t hold up a picture of my face to a guard and expect that they&#x27;ll suddenly think you&#x27;re me. Biometric auth systems are trying to the same thing but without the human.<p>&gt; They are famously defeatable.<p>And most locks in wide-use today are also defeatable by amateur locksmiths, that&#x27;s not really the point. There are sophisticated biometric auth systems that aren&#x27;t fooled by pictures. FaceID is one example.')
