Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604235579, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24959088, text='&gt; Apple has offered this service to their developer customers<p>This is unfortunately a complete misunderstanding of Developer ID. The program isn&#x27;t a &quot;service&quot; for developers, it was imposed on developers as a requirement for security purposes. We can&#x27;t opt out! The intent of Developer ID is to allow Apple to remotely disable malware. That&#x27;s the one and only purpose. Almost all publicly known Developer ID cert revocations were for malware authors.<p>When a Developer ID cert is revoked, every piece of software ever signed with the cert is disabled on every Mac in the world. Revocation cannot be used to disable specific builds.<p>Moreover, Apple has never used Developer ID for the purposes you claim it is used. You&#x27;re just making up stuff with no evidence. It&#x27;s clear you&#x27;re not a Mac developer yourself, and you&#x27;re just speculating about what you believe might be true, but you don&#x27;t have any first hand knowledge of the situation.<p>It&#x27;s truly astonishing to me, as one of the few or maybe only people in this thread who is actually a Mac developer and has a Developer ID cert, that I&#x27;m getting systematically downvoted by people who have no direct knowledge of Developer ID. Getting tired of this, and HN entirely. It&#x27;s incredibly discouraging, and makes me not want to be on HN when people with expertise are downvoted by people without.<p>I&#x27;ve been a professional Mac developer for over a dozen years. I was around before Developer ID was introduced, before code signing was introduced. I was around for the announcement of Developer ID. I&#x27;ve been distributing Mac software for all these years, I know what I&#x27;m talking about.')
