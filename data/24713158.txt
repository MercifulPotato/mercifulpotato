I&#x27;ve heard that there&#x27;s a lot of intrusive garbage in the home-oriented editions: is that accurate?<p>(I sysadmin, so dog food Linux on my workstation.)<p>Edit: why the downvotes? As someone who runs an Helpdesk&#x2F;IT-managed Windows laptop I have no idea what the state of the consumer Windows sphere is. The parent lists many good things: are there any bad things worth mentioning?')
