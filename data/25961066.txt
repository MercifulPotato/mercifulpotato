Item(by='chipotle_coyote', descendants=None, kids=[25961309], score=None, time=1611947477, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25958444, text='From the spec:<p>&gt; No double symbols, i.e. <i>strong</i> not *strong*.<p>I understand the rationale. <i>But,</i> this is immediately no longer Markdown. &quot;It&#x27;s &#x27;Markdown, Refactored!&#x27;&quot; If &quot;refactored&quot; means &quot;incompatible,&quot; sure? I guess? But still: incompatible.<p>&quot;So what?&quot; Good question, imaginary interlocutor. Here&#x27;s so what: one of Markdown&#x27;s defining features, love or it hate it, is that it <i>deliberately</i> doesn&#x27;t make you choose between emphasizing with * characters or emphasizing with _ characters, other than being consistent with the start and end. Use a single * or _ character, get emphasis&#x2F;italics; use double, get strong&#x2F;bold; you don&#x27;t get underlines because you don&#x27;t use those in typography.<p>The same is true for lists: only &quot;-&quot; is acceptable, not &quot;+&quot; or &quot;<i>&quot;. Fine, but there are a lot of Markdown documents that are out there that use &quot;</i>&quot; as the list character, and I am sure there is at least one weirdo inexplicably using &quot;+&quot;.<p>So StrictMark breaks <i>every</i> Markdown document that uses boldface, and probably about half the Markdown documents that use italics. (I don&#x27;t know about other Markdown users, but over the years I have <i>not</i> been consistent with how I markup italics, for a variety of reasons.) And, it probably breaks about half the unordered lists in the wild, too.<p>I understand that this is being done for well-intentioned and noble reasons, but: it ain&#x27;t Markdown. It&#x27;s a new, incompatible plaintext markup system. This creates a bit of an uncomfortable point: if I&#x27;m going to have to redo all my documents (or just do things The New Way going forward), then why not switch to AsciiDoc or Textile?')
