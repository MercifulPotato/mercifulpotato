Nothing serious so nothing to pay. She was very worried and they even managed to make her smile.<p>This was in Verona, Italy some years ago, in the ER of Borgo Roma. It was late night and just a short queue to wait. It has been a great human experience and we will be always grateful to the doctors there.')
