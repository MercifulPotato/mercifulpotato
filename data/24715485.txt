You canâ€™t have multiple annual flights to vacation destinations, large vehicles, and quarter acre lots per family.<p>Not only can the tiny proportion of the world enjoying the above not have it anymore, but to mitigate the damage already done, we probably need to come to a near stop rather than just slow down from 80mph to 40mph.<p>All while a few billion people in the developing world are looking forward to their children being able to fly to destinations for vacations and  enjoy a backyard and nice car.')
