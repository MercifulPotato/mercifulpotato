I&#x27;ve got two laptops docked and connected to external monitors. Synergy lets me use just one keyboard and mouse for all three at the same time. Makes it feel like they&#x27;re just three adjacent screens on one PC. But because they&#x27;re not I can maintain strict separation between personal and work, and between internal&#x2F;corporate and client data.<p>Then, like others have said, I have a fair amount of filtering on the network level.')
