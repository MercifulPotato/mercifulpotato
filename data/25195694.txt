Yes it&#x27;s a lot more invasive, but also:<p>A) the results are more natural (moving tissue from one part of the body to another) and theoretically good forever. No need to worry about the state of your implants a few decades down the track.<p>B) In our case at least, it&#x27;s a form of reconstruction that is a little bit leading edge, and exciting to the surgeons. I feel that&#x27;s a good thing as there was a lot of focus by a lot of people on the surgery going well.<p>Instead of just &quot;least invasive&quot; I would suggest considering the long term maintenance as well.<p>FWIW we are super happy with our choice, mainly because it puts everything in the rear view mirror forever, and as just a single breast involved, from memory the surgery was more like 9 or 10 hours, not the 18 you are quoting.')
