The website tried to get you to phone with your quote so that sales reps could bump your price up for basically no reason. If this was too much then they&#x27;d pretend to talk to their manager for a few mins to &quot;see if they could get you a good deal&quot; come back on the phone and make up another price for you. Worked on old people best. Lovely.')
