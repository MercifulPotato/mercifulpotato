My understanding, not working in the space, is that they will many times upstream improvements they develop. But I wasn&#x27;t aware that they were hitting oss authors with a deluge of unpaid change requests.<p>Now I know that reviewing an upstreamed change is also work. That&#x27;s a big part of my job at work so I could hardly fail to recognize it. It would be completely reasonable to apply this policy even to code reviews. Of course in that event forking the project might be exactly what the companies would do, and I&#x27;m not sure if that would be a preferable outcome from the perspective of oss authors either.')
