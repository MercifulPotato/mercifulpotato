It was hard for the first year. What helped me:<p>1) no elastic hours - work from 8 to 16. Otherwise my private stuff mixed with work, I was working to late hours and was never satisfied with progress.<p>2) Talking with people. Even if I am 100% sure what to do, I call sometimes someone or write to talk about it prior to code review. I bond with team and it is just beneficial for everyone, not only project.<p>3) Finding the right flow. It means at work you have to work because there is not much anything else to do. At home you have plenty of better things to do. So it is about finding a right mental spot, thinking about what I will do next, what I will do tomorrow, build enthusiasm about it.<p>4) Finding the place. It means the proper chair, desk, standing desk, to the wall or against it. Little changes can make a great difference. However I don&#x27;t believe it is about spending too much money on stuff. I have bought a standing desk made of paper for 10 dollars. And it is great, does not take space.<p>5) Taking breaks. Sometimes I just have to take a break and do anything else. I have learned it is better to recognize it early on, and just go for a walk or do anything else. Taking care of mental health is one of the greatest skills human can learn. I am still learning it.<p>6) Taking vacations. Even if there is nothing to do, or nowhere to go. Taking some time off is essential.<p>7) A hobby. There are some things possible to do at home. For me it was designing fantasy programming card games - Summon The JSON.<p>8) Excercising - yoga, stretching, and even running in a place with treadmill videos on my TV. It helps a lots.<p>9) Going out. Even to the forrest, also helps to keep the spirit high.<p>Most of all I always think about others, that everyone has the same or worse than me. So maybe I am a little bit less productive, but I wake up every day, and do what I can.')
