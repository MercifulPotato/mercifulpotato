Not legally or in the common use of the word.<p>If I kick an abusive troll off my message board that is moderation. If a judge orders someone not to use a computer for two years, that is censorship.<p>To conflate the two is to make the term &quot;censorship&quot; almost meaningless. Platforms all over the web filter spam, pornography, abusive behavior, off-topic posts, etc all the time. It&#x27;s not censorship.<p>Similarly, if Twitter was legally forbidden from marking tweets with their fact-checking tags, <i>that</i> would be censorship.')
