Bitcoin was a compromise because it seemed like the only viable alternative to a rapidly unraveling monetary system. My guess is that your grievances are due there, and not to Bitcoin, which simply stands by and accrues value through systemic failure. The idealists wanted something you might find much more amenable, and yes, capitulation has made many of them rich, but only in worthless paper and bits. Maybe a car. Maybe a yacht. All worthless. We still don’t have a functional economy. You still can’t buy peace and freedom with Bitcoin.')
