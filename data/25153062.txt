Yes a library may feat your needs but if you need an old Java application deployed on premise that only has a VPN connection to datacenter A with a private connection to datacenter B a service mesh will help you make everybody talk to each other nicely without to make tricky configuration with NATs, route tables, BGP, etc.<p>The logging, authentication, circuit breaker, etc. is nice to have on top of that but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the main advantage, or at least not the only one.')
