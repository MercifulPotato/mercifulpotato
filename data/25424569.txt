This is especially true if you take extra strength tylenol. It is recommended to stay below 3,000 mg of tylenol within 24 hours, which is only 6 extra strength pills. If you take a bit extra and get over 4,000 mg per day for multiple days, you can get major issues. There just is not much margin for error with tylenol.<p>I think people often get confused because you can typically take a bunch of ibuprofen pills for pain and there are rarely serious side effects. But ibuprofen and tylenol are much different in this regard, despite the fact that both relieve pain and both can be easily bought in a drug store.')
