I expect Steam VAC and Xbox cross-platform multiplayer will take note of this someday, too.<p>This relates closely to the likelihood of future PCs with Microsoft Pluton^ firmware as well. I assume that Microsoft saw the writing on the wall about secure OSes and remote education and online testing and is repurposing their Xbox anti-tampering system for Windows before they get locked out of that market by Apple Silicon.<p>It’s not about disallowing you from tampering, or about blocking third-party operating systems — it’s about attesting whether or not you are able to tamper, in scenarios where a remote third-party has no physical access to your system. The Linux secureboot shims probably will not be sufficient to earn ‘tamperproof’ as they boot arbitrary unsigned code with tamper-capable privileges via &#x2F;sbin&#x2F;init or whatever.<p>^ via crypto-signed attestations by the Apple firmware+OS, working in tandem to attest that the stack is not and cannot be tampered with as currently booted.<p>^ <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25123990" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25123990</a><p>EDIT: Apologies, the missing paragraph connecting to the parent comment is —<p>IT departments will begin updating SSO&#x2F;MFA systems to require, when deployed hardware permits it, the tamperproof attestations. This will protect them from the liability risk of employees turning off key security protections such as SIP, and may result in Apple Silicon being widely adopted by sensitive industries such as banking and IT once they realize they can reduce their risk <i>and</i> liability insurance costs by doing so.')
