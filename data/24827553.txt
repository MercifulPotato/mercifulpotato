It is true that it is not logically possible for a system of two objects to fall faster than both of its constituent parts, but that does not mean that it is a priori logically impossible for heavier objects to fall faster than lighter objects - the lighter object would slow down the heavier object somewhat, so the new &quot;combined&quot; object would fall slower than the heavier of the two objects, but it would fall faster than the lighter of them.<p>In fact, the fact that heavy and light objects fall at the same speed is a profoundly special property of the gravitational interaction. No other fundamental force behaves this way: in an electric field, objects with more charge will accelerate more quickly than objects with less charge (and the same is true for the weak and strong forces).<p>In fact, the acceleration of an object or particle in a field is proportional to its field-specific charge divided by its inertial mass. The really interesting thing about the gravitational interaction is that the &quot;charge&quot; associated with the gravitational field is exactly equal to the inertial mass of that object, so all objects accelerate at the same rate because of the gravitational field.<p>This truly special property of the gravitational field had no explanation until Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity, which discarded the idea that the gravitational field is a field at all, and described the motions of objects only in terms of rectilinear movement in a curved space-time (the reason why inertial mass curves space time is still unexplained though - it seems to simply be a property of the universe).')
