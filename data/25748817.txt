As the OP showed, median housing prices is determined by the amount the median income can afford a house based on the interest rates. This means that to the CPI, a $500k house is equivalent to a $210k house was in 1990 as they both have the same payment. They will therefore have the same owner equivalent rents. And therefore even if prices have more than doubled in 30 years, the CPI will not show it.<p>And so we can reframe the argument from above as:<p>When the government calculates inflation, they look at prices of common goods, but not housing. Housing is based on monthly payment. That&#x27;s why inflation is artificially low.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;cpi&#x2F;tables&#x2F;relative-importance&#x2F;1990.txt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;cpi&#x2F;tables&#x2F;relative-importance&#x2F;1990.txt</a>')
