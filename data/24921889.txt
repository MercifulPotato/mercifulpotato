The most direct contra-framework to the utilitarian approach is negative utilitarianism - challenging whether the goal ought to be to maximize pleasure or to minimize pain as a priority.<p>If you maximize pleasure as a first priority, you can either say that &quot;As long as human life is in general good, I should make the choice to create one&quot; or &quot;As long as a human life produces any good, I should make the choice to create one&quot;.<p>This gets into an interesting sub-point with respect to animal experiments - most people would argue that animal experiments produce some good (Advances in human health).  Moral critiques of animal experiments, thus, can rely on either &quot;Hurting animals is bad&quot; (Negative utilitarianism, more or less) or &quot;The pain we create does not outweigh the value they produce&quot;. The later point is particularly poignant because the species experiencing the pain does not receive benefits of the pain (Thus there&#x27;s no &quot;community sacrifice&quot;).')
