Item(by='Kusoneko', descendants=None, kids=[25842691], score=None, time=1611076039, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25833716, text='Aside from the obvious marketing attempt at the end, they are correct in stating this, no matter how you feel about [whichever is the latest thing the 2 app stores decide to remove], the fact that they can practically prevent near everyone from accessing any services that are provided as apps by simply agreeing to remove the app from both stores is way too much power in the hand of a few huge corporations. The duopoly of app stores is the issue here, not so much the removal of something the app store owners find objectionable. I am aware that there are other app stores (f-droid, other android phone companies having their own app stores that they sometimes&#x2F;used to shove in phones as bloatware, not sure about Apple&#x27;s phones if there is any such thing), but you need to go out of your way to get them, and most people don&#x27;t bother, so the reach they have is tiny as opposed to the combined reach of 100% of the market share of app stores the Google&#x2F;Apple duopoly has. Something that is removed from both app stores effectively doesn&#x27;t exist for most people.')
