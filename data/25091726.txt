I&#x27;ve been stuck with Dynalist, which is like Workflowy but better in most dimensions (multiple documents, lower price, more features, wonderful developers from the interactions I had with them) ... but still proprietary SaaS I don&#x27;t want to have to rely on for something so important.<p>I haven&#x27;t yet thoroughly tested, but on first look it seems like it supports the basic bullet point features I need (collapsing with the state saved, dragging around) and maybe more (embedding of media, other node trees?).<p>Super exciting! Thanks for developing this!')
