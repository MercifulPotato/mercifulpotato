Isn&#x27;t that the point of a &quot;free market&quot; anyway? To let the market decide what is valuable? It&#x27;s hard to accept any claim that constructing barriers makes social safety nets more effective.<p>Giving people money and raising minimum wages is indistinguishable to me. The only way they can be different is if you think economic output would be significantly different if people weren&#x27;t &quot;forced&quot; to work by making wages the only avenue of income. That is the Randian perspective I am referring to.')
