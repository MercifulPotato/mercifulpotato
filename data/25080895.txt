We tried many thing and this kind of advertisement didn&#x27;t work very well for us. We tried several things in this area, with varying degrees of success.<p>The main differential factor here is the price of what they&#x27;re selling. In this case it&#x27;s a high-value, pretty unique item sold to a highly targeted audience, that 1-2 items sold already make up for the investment. Good for them!<p>Also beware of confirmation bias: we know this particular campaign worked and was extremely successful, but we don&#x27;t know the other things this company tried and didn&#x27;t work, nor if this team had experience in a very similar market that saved them some experimentation.')
