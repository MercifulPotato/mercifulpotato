Whether the risk is worth it or not is a fair question, but we can&#x27;t just pretend there is no risk in letting your kids play without supervision.<p>This is the same argument that anti-vaccine people make... we survived as a species for thousands of years without vaccines, we don&#x27;t need them now!<p>Yes, we survived as a species but a lot of individuals did not survive.<p>Every safety and health improvement we make can suffer the same argument (we survived for years with lead paint! Asbestos has been used in a ton of buildings and we are still here!)<p>Of course, not every safety improvement is worth it. Some risk is acceptable when the gains are high. I just think it is important to be realistic about the risks when we are talking about the benefits.')
