But it&#x27;s not straight forward for Android (Parler users were trying to explain how to do it to each other with hilarious results), and I believe on Apple it can&#x27;t be done.<p>There have been called for regulating how Apple and Google protect their app stores after Parler was pulled, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the solution. The solution is getting them to integrate PWAs into their ecosystem. They don&#x27;t want to, because it draws from their app store revenue.')
