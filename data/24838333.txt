(you need n-times the life time of the universe to have a working bruteforce, and as much overwhelming mathematical proof of non-applicability of non-bruteforce approaches as possible.)<p>And it was actually found to be extremely hard to make crypto algos which are only &quot;slightly&quot; unreliable. Either they are a complete mathematical iron wall, or their deemed weakness is too glaring to be hidden.')
