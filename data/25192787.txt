Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=[25192916], score=None, time=1606171035, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25192320, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve had college classes in things like Social Psychology and Negotiation and Conflict Management. I know something about best practices for dealing with difficult group dynamics.<p>And it shows!  That&#x27;s a big part of why I&#x27;m a fan.  That, and that you are an independent thinker (no small feat these days), and lots of other things.<p>&gt; And in my experience and opinion, it will go better if you actually follow the guidelines and don&#x27;t start complaining about downvotes. As someone who attracts a lot of negative reactions on HN, my firsthand experience is that if you actually follow the guidelines and say nothing about the voting and wait and see, things will be less negative and a few hours later you may feel differently about how people are perceiving your comment because it may no longer be in the negatives and there may even be constructive engagement.<p>I have more than enough first hand experience to know that your intuition is off in this case.  Certain ideas (perspectives on reality, even though they are accurate) are not acceptable here - and that&#x27;s ok, it is phase that Western culture is going through, what can you do.')
