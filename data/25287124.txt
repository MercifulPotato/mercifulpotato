A big part of my job is doing code reviews. However, I find that I have a lot of trouble staying awake when doing code reviews, especially when reviewing TypeScript + React. I might have less trouble staying awake when reviewing Python code because Python is a language that I <i>get</i>. In contrast, I don&#x27;t <i>get</i> React. It might also be easier for me to stay awake if I had somebody to rubberduck to while doing the code review, but there&#x27;s no one for me to talk to.')
