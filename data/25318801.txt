Most TVs also have all sorts of image processing algorithms. At least a scaler, but most have other, sometimes questionable features. Plus overlays, recording, picture-in-picture, or whatever the manufacturer thinks will improve sales... TVs are already &quot;smart&quot; to begin with. You can just thing of internet connectivity as the antenna connector of modern times.<p>Thankfully, I don&#x27;t know of any TV that <i>requires</i> internet access yet. AFAIK, they all can be used as dumb monitors. If you really want a dumb monitor, you can either buy a PC monitor or a commercial one, like those used in shops to display ads and stuff like that. Some are even as dumb as a monitor can be (like the one I am using right now), with only a single input, a single resolution, no OSD, and only an on-off switch and two buttons to control brightness (which is just a dimmer for the backlight).<p>But dumb monitor tend do be more expensive. First, they tend to be of higher quality, and second, &quot;smart&quot; features are often a profit for the manufacturer. For example, if your TV supports Netflix, Netflix most likely paid for it, and the amount is most likely more than what it cost the manufacturer to implement that feature. It results in a lower purchase price for the end user, the idea being that whatever partner will make up in subscriptions.')
