In such cases producers should be happy that someone wants to give access to them despite loosing money while doing it.<p>One notable example of such unprofitable movie is &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, which, after 40 years, has not provided any net income. Not even one cent. I am really impressed by heroism of all those movie producers that keep working so hard even though they earn nothing.<p>Or maybe it is not true that those movies are not profitable, maybe, for some strange reason, law enforcement is able to track all those pesky pirates, fish them from New Zealand hideaways, but is and was not able to retrieve a single tax dollar from movie studios for the past 70 years.<p>That&#x27;s a puzzle which is apparently somehow missed by venerable members of US Congress and Senate.')
