If so, humor me for a moment. Imagine that you&#x27;re wearing a pair of ski boots with thumbtacks packed in around the ankles. You shift your weight too far forward or bend it, the thumb tacks cut into your ankle. Not to mention now they&#x27;re super stiff; you can barely bend them at all without the tacks digging hard into the skin.<p>Now imagine getting into a Honda Accord sedan. You have to bend down to get into the car, so your back is going to lean over and your knees are going to bend down...naturally causing your ankles to have to bend forward. Except ski boots and thumbtacks; Ow!! To get in you have to more or less turn your back to the car, splay your legs out and kinda fall back with your arms holding the sides of the frame of the car. Not a big deal but now imagine doing this times a day, every day, for the next 5 to 8 years. And I haven&#x27;t even talked about trying to get out.<p>In an SUV at the right height, you turn your back, brace your butt atop the seat, lift your legs up and pivot into the car. No fuss. Barely any bending needed.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of older people out there with chronic issues in their backs, spines, hips, knees, and&#x2F;or ankles. Thing is, older people that are later in their careers tend to be the ones with the most purchasing power, and don&#x27;t mind trading a slightly higher operating cost for more comfort.')
