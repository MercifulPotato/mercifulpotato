To be more blunt, it is not my responsibility to prop up a business model that I disapprove of.<p>I prefer to eat at restaurants where I know they will not compromise on quality, so I accept that I have to pay extra for that, hence I eat out less often than I otherwise would have. On the flip side, every time I do eat out, I get amazing food.<p>On the occasions where I do eat fast food, my preferred places also fit the quality criteria outlined above. If a place doesn&#x27;t do things in a way that agrees with me, I refuse to support them.')
