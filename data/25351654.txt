The &quot;only if&quot; seems likely in the modern environment but not guaranteed.<p>Even the &quot;if&quot; half doesn&#x27;t quite seem guaranteed, though.  If it&#x27;s always easy to know which choice maximizes utility, then having more options is clearly better.  But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case often enough to be confident in it.  If someone is skilled at pretending to be &quot;good&quot;, but finds themselves with choice paralysis in situations where genuinely &quot;good&quot; agents would proceed with dispatch at only a slight penalty to the average quality of the ultimate choice, you might be less successful for having the &quot;dark traits&quot; despite covering them up.  And even that is ignoring the cost of doing the covering.')
