At least, from my comfy chair nit picking someone else&#x27;s work. Of course, by not filtering the acceptable bands allows them to do all of the ad tracking&#x2F;rights management things they are allowing to occur. The fact that Alexa&#x2F;Google is able to do these ad tracking&#x2F;rights management is just another example showing that the mic is listening 100% of the time.')
