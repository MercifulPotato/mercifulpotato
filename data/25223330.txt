In these cases it can be much more important to reach some people in your small niche, as opposed to a mass of a generic audience. Applying the same growth hacks as generic Youtubers may not be fitting in one&#x27;s specific use case. Perhaps you could clickbaitify your content, and increase the raw numbers (makes sense in case of an ad-driven Youtuber) but if you&#x27;re hoping for high quality feedback or getting to know other interesting people, you may better spend your time on catering to your special audience even when it&#x27;s small. And instead of promoting it left and right, target it specifically through niche channels, like email contacts, etc.<p>This may seem obvious, but sometimes people can get caught up in cargo-culting the established trendy marketing strategies that are actually designed for another use case than yours.')
