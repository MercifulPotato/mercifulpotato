So all the essential sounds on the road, like sirens or horns or impact or sudden tire burn, will be heard perfectly fine, while all the annoying constant noises (like the road or engine) will go away.<p>Try it next time with ANC headphones: ask someone to play a siren sound on speakers. I can guarantee that you won&#x27;t hear the siren any less than usual. In fact, you will hear it better, because it won&#x27;t be overlapping with all the other random background noises. Similar, but to a lesser degree, with speech. I was able to have full-on conversations with people while wearing headphones with ANC turned on (in the office), zero issues. Which is kind of a scenario that ANC cannot currently handle when it comes to using them in an office, since it won&#x27;t cancel out the sound of someone randomly kicking their desk or slamming something on it.')
