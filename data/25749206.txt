No collective bargaining, no workplace issues<p>Collective bargaining for contracts (e.g. compensation) are only one possible role a union can play. It&#x27;s the most <i>common</i> one in the US for legal and historical reasons, but it&#x27;s not the only one permitted.<p>Incidentally, the structure of the AWU is actually much more similar to how unions operate in Europe, where unions are not required or expected to have exclusive representation over a bargaining unit, and therefore quite commonly focus on a range of issues, rather than centering mostly on collective bargaining for contracts.<p>The perception that &quot;it&#x27;s not a union if it only represents a small number of people&quot; or &quot;it&#x27;s not a union if it doesn&#x27;t engage in collective bargaining&quot; is a very American perspective (and even then, a perception which is inconsistent with the actual rights granted under the NLRA to minority unions in the US).')
