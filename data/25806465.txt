I think the issue it&#x27;s so much the technology but the people who use it - when you see UE4 projects labelled &quot;Blueprint only!&quot; what that usually means in my experience is unmaintainable, unsearchable, no version control etc.<p>They&#x27;re great for animations, but for anything vaguely structured they&#x27;re just slow and RSI inducing.')
