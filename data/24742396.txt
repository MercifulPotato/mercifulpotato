That said, people are different, and some people can hear the difference.  My ears are probably only average, but my eyes are (or were) significantly &quot;faster&quot; than average: Until I was well into my 30s (fortunately, this has faded with age!), fluorescent lights were pretty much just like a disco strobe to me - as a teen I could literally see them flashing, even though the phosphors moderated it a bit. (The 2000&#x27;s flirtation with those wretched CF twisty bulbs brought this roaring back, as almost all of them flashed enough to be really annoying to me.)  Just like there are some (very rare) women who are tetrachromes, it&#x27;s reasonable to expect that there are some with &quot;golden ears&quot;.<p>The cool thing about Bob Carver was that he didn&#x27;t just rely on his (obviously very good) ears, but also on his knowledge, intuition&#x2F;insight, and equipment.  Just amazing.  Thanks to OP for this.')
