You can start with some Youtube videos, read a few blog posts, heck you can even spend a couple of weekends writing your first smart contract and deploy it to Ethereum to see how it works. My first side project on Ethereum was writing a decentralized poker game, I wrote a series of smart contracts based on the theory of Mental Poker [1] and deployed it to the test net, and then wrote a web front end for it that waited for a new block to get published, parsed it and displayed it. It was pretty cool, once you deploy your smart contract to the blockchain, it&#x27;s kind of magical seeing a completely decentralized system of computers bring that code to life. Like once you deploy your code, that&#x27;s it, it&#x27;s entirely out of your hands from that point forward and there&#x27;s this engine that takes it and keeps it chugging literally for as long as there are miners willing to operate the Ethereum network.<p>Everything is a mystery until you take the time to learn it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mental_poker" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mental_poker</a>')
