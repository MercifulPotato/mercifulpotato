Somehow way cooler than an Atari 2600 cart. My uncle had some variant of the Apple II in his basement. One night while the adults were visiting, I was down there excitedly playing the various games (The Dark Crystal, Loderunner, and Olympic Decathlon are the ones that come immediately to mind). I&#x27;d take one game out of the driver, drop it on the desk, and insert the next game. By the end of the night there was a sloppy pile of floppies that had previously been individual sheathed in a nice &#x27;rolodex&#x27;. My parents called down and when I tried to spend the time to clean up my mess they made it pretty clear I needed to be up there &#x27;right now&#x27;. So I foolishly left the pile rather than face my parents&#x27; wrath. I&#x27;m sure my uncle was furious when he found the pile; those things were fragile and I had treated them like they were Duplo. The next time I was at my uncle&#x27;s house I wasn&#x27;t allowed to play. :(<p>For floppy swapping madness, Wasteland is the game that comes to mind for me. The game was split across two floppy disks, each covering roughly half of the map. When you&#x27;d enter a section that was on the other disk, the game would ask you to swap disks. The game state was saved on the disk on which the action occurred, so you could enter an unaltered world just by putting in a fresh copy of the game disk. This was useful for continuing to play after you&#x27;d beaten the game, as well as leveling up your characters to extreme levels and collecting multiple copies of rare or hard-to-get items.')
