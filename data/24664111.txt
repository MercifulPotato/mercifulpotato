Probably my article was a bit unclear on this point.<p>Maybe, maybe not: it always also depends on your reader how your message is read :) I only wanted to point out that the broad freedom of speech debate is by itself very complex nowadays. People have different stances, even if they think themselves broadly liberal (in the political science sense). I think there&#x27;s some value in keeping the cause of privacy mostly unbundled from all this mess in the public conversation. This is a strategic opinion, not some profound philosophical disagreement, I think.<p>(I certainly see the problem that it&#x27;s hard to show to many people convincingly, in their face, the importance of privacy. It&#x27;s an abstract thing, like freedom or equality.)')
