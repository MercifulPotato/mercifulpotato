I&#x27;ve heard people complain that the cashier at the grocery store asks &quot;How are you doing?&quot;. &quot;They don&#x27;t really care, why do they ask!&quot;<p>This is more of an expectations thing; certainly in Dutch, asking &quot;how are you doing&quot; is something you do when you ask when you really want to start a conversation, and you expect a somewhat serious reply in return, whereas in some other cultures it essentially just means &quot;hi&quot; with no expectation of a real answer beyond &quot;good&quot; or some such.<p>When I worked for an Irish company I had some coworkers say &quot;how are ya&quot; when meeting in the hallway or some such; I started replying serious (&quot;yeah, I&#x27;m good, last night I [..]&quot;) but they didn&#x27;t really expect an answer so continued walking leaving us both confused; me as they didn&#x27;t stop, and them as I started a conversation. It led to some awkward-y situations before I figured this out haha<p>At any rate, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s &quot;sensitivity&quot;, it&#x27;s just that these words are taken to have a different meaning. These are the kind of subtle things about learning a language; you can know all the words and grammar, but you also need to learn what&#x27;s <i>meant with them</i>, and that can actually be pretty hard. Translating a simple sentence such as this is easy, but really understanding what&#x27;s intended (which may differ on the tone of voice, location, context, etc.) is really hard, and even Europeans who speak good English but haven&#x27;t spent a lot of time in English-speaking countries tend to fail at this (I certainly did) as it&#x27;s not really something you can learn from communicating in English over text either.')
