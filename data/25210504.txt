Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606319617, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25208890, text='&gt; You&#x27;re not wrong, but on the other hand has &quot;the market&quot; shown any serious signal that it cares about privacy? From what I can see people seem more than glad to trade privacy and personal information for free services and cheaper hardware. Take Samsung putting ads on their &quot;smart&quot; TV&#x27;s UI and screenshotting what people are watching for profiling, that&#x27;s been known for a while now. The market seems fine with it.<p>I&#x27;d guess that most of that&#x27;s due to information asymmetry.  Privacy losses aren&#x27;t advertised(and often hidden) and are more difficult to understand, but price is and is understood by everyone.<p>Take that Samsung example: it&#x27;s not like they had a bullet point on the feature list saying &quot;Our Smart TVs will let us spy one what you&#x27;re watching, so we can monetize that information.&quot;')
