HK was returned to China in accordance with a previously signed contract.<p>After it became part of China again, it is not possible to interviene militarily  in Beijing - HK relationship - that would be an invasion of China and violation of international law. You could not phisically station an army in HK.<p>Even if China has violated an agreement with UK regarding HK autonomy, thay does not give you legal grounds to start a war.<p>In cotrast, you could deploy the entire US military in Taiwan tomorrow, it would be legal and peacefull (provided Taiwanese Gov.
