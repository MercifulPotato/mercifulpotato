Apple&#x27;s main focus has always been about creating an amazing experience for humans via Apple computers and devices. Thats it. The hardware is secondary and the expandability is secondary. How that has played has changed over time and depending on the context (ex: the original Mac Pro or even the first Macs), but allowing someone to add all the ram and storage has never been at the forefront of apple&#x27;s vision.<p>There are clearly billions of people who are okay with giving up &#x27;control&#x27; over their devices and data, whether its apple or amazon or google. I know my windows machine nags me every time I restart to phone home to MS and setup some account, and that&#x27;s not even a reinstall. My android device asks for a google login at like step 3 of the setup process. Sure, I can bypass it, cuz I don&#x27;t care and they aren&#x27;t my primary machines, but most people will not.<p>Most people don&#x27;t care if their laptop or phone phones home when it needs to be reset, as long as it works and makes them happy. Most people (I would guess 99%+) don&#x27;t repair their devices beyond fixing a cracked screen or maybe adding RAM or a new GPU to a prebuilt gaming PC. How many folks can even dismantle and work on a modern phone with any success, whether Android or iOS?<p>Some people think about privacy and ads and surveillance wrt technology. I know I do. I see that Apple does things that can serve multiple interests at the same time, and it isn&#x27;t so black and white:<p>* they want to sell a shit load of services and hardware and continue to make crazy amounts of money<p>* they see that privacy is slowly (but surely) becoming a thing people want, especially those w&#x2F; the dollars and more tech savvy. So they are focusing on privacy with their products, and that is real. No matter how much apple haters love to call out counter examples, they are making a real effort - look at Siri and iMessage and Apple Maps.<p>* they also want do deliver an amazing experience to people - I know I don&#x27;t need to explain how security and user experience are often in conflict.<p>Ignoring all these factors at play here is missing the bigger picture.')
