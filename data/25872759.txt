Mac OS is <i>vastly</i> more extensible and programmable than any desktop environment from that era.<p>That said...<p>I do agree that we live in a world where people who create OS’s have vast power over the experiences of those who use them, and this is not where we should be.<p>The real step down this path came when both Apple <i>and</i> Microsoft copied the desktop metaphor superficially from Xerox but <i>left behind</i> the end user programmability of the Smalltalk and Mesa environments.<p>Their goal was to create an environment for the delivery of shrink wrapped software.
