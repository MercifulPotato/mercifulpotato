So, this felt somewhat validating of the perspective that I should learn about git more deeply so I can have enhanced practical knowledge, which could translate into more economic value for the company I’m working with after graduation.<p>Once a decision is made in this regard, I then have to figure out the best way to actually learn it. I’ve considered trying to follow the mailing list[0] and contribute code to the git project, thinking that would force me to learn it very deeply. But at the same time, I feel like trying to go that deep might have diminishing returns and might stress me out. I like the idea of being an open source contributor to such a huge project and gaining more experience that way, but I also worry about the potentially high time cost.<p>I imagine I could alternatively read the Pro Git Book[1], the git documentation[2], and&#x2F;or some other specific git internals resource someone has curated, but I haven’t decided what would be best yet.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.wiki.kernel.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;GitCommunity" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git.wiki.kernel.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;GitCommunity</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-scm.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;en&#x2F;v2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;git-scm.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;en&#x2F;v2</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;git&#x2F;git&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;Documentation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;git&#x2F;git&#x2F;tree&#x2F;master&#x2F;Documentation</a>')
