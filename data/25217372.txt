Often I will open a new window to search for something and start typing my request right away, since the address&#x2F;search bar should be focused on new windows. If the window takes a little bit of time to appear for some reason, the first few characters will be dropped. Frustrating. Chrome on the other hand does not exhibit this defect, even if I start typing before the window actually appears, my input is preserved.')
