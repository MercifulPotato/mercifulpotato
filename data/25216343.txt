It&#x27;s not like the tones drop for a call and we say &#x27;gee, I wish I could go help that person, but I still have this chart to write...&#x27;.<p>That wasn&#x27;t how I read it. I may be incorrect, but my interpretation was that the 250ms didn&#x27;t make the software too slow to be <i>effective</i> but rather too slow to be user friendly.<p>The idea isn&#x27;t that it directly killed people by being slow, but rather that it was not adopted because people didn&#x27;t like using it, and on the paper alternative, mistakes were made that would have been impossible to make on the computer.')
