I’m thinking of the Python vis package Bokeh’s community forum.<p>The second place-for me-was a Discord group. Since the pandemic the local Python Meetup (Meetup is another resource) group started having its weekly project meeting on Discord. And funny thing happened, there are participants from all across the Eastern US—don’t have to be ‘local’ on Discord.<p>Recall from years ago (Usenet era) some groups would say you could find them on IRC. I think Discord scratches that itch today.<p>Discord&#x2F;IRC is its own beast— a dynamic social experience.<p>IMHO, for the ask-and-wait the only non-owner forum is STackExchange. I naively divide the successful items at SE as either succinct and simple Google search questions where no answer is on the web, or which enough people create good answers before the mods clamp down (give the mob what they want).<p>Or, the questions have to reflect deep-knowledge in an active and engaged  community. You can call it _what’s hot_ moderated by little Neros or what I’ve started to call the Mod-Walled Garden of moderated SE sub-groups.<p>These days all the simple questions seem to have been asked before—everything is a duplicate. SE worked because people wanted to take the time to demonstrate their knowledge and get get community kudos for when they were clever or succinct, right? Now it seems the _ground is saturated_. Where are the most engaged and interested parties? For me, a weekend programmer&#x2F;forever ‘newbie’, it’s in the channels I mentioned.<p>Remember that word, ‘newbie’? A friend who introduced me to Usenet gave me the instructions that I had to use this term in my question for the social signaling that I knew I was an idiot, and to please go easy on me! Haha')
