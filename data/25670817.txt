All the people in my (real life) social circle are using WhatsApp. All of my friends are calling me crazy that I don&#x27;t have Instagram, so talking about alternative messaging apps is probably not going to work. I think this is true for most people in the western culture. I value my privacy, but the struggle is to big for me.<p>Maybe an open-source protocol, like how e-mail works, could be a solution for this problem. That you can choose your messaging apps and that they can interfere with each other, like email clients.')
