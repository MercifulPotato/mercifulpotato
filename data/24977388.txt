It introduced me to a possibility I haven&#x27;t considered, and it&#x27;s followed by an interesting debate in the comments. Thank you for sharing.<p>The most important caveat I can think of is the ability to inform irregular users about something important, either for legal or ethical reasons. For example, my note taking app is shutting down, and users might have important things stored there. I could also message them about a deprecated feature, a change to the ToS, or ironically a data breach.<p>Nonetheless, it&#x27;s still a good idea and I&#x27;ll keep it in mind.')
