Removing the information from YouTube isn&#x27;t removing the information from the internet. They are just making use of their right to decide what they give space to on their platform. I can still go to a specific conspiracy theory website and read about it there if I&#x27;m feeling like it.<p>The &quot;government&quot; has nothing to do with that as we are talking about a company applying their own policies to their website not a government mandated take down of content.')
