Item(by='BLKNSLVR', descendants=None, kids=[24929109, 24928935, 24929020], score=None, time=1603966832, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24928306, text='I foolishly purchased an album or two from Google Play Music, which will be defunct by year end.  Maybe the &#x27;ownership&#x27; license will transfer over to Youtube Music if I migrate my subscription, but what if I don&#x27;t?  It doesn&#x27;t seem logical that I lose the ability to listen to music that I purchased just because the intermediary that I purchased it through has gone.  Do not the rights holders keep track of who owns licenses to listen to what?  Shouldn&#x27;t they be tracking this information on the other side of their business than the one that sends questionable DMCA(-ish?) take-down notices to github for potential copyright infringement usage?<p>I won&#x27;t be migrating my subscription to YT Music.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing any more music, movies, or TV shows that I can&#x27;t store locally and backup via simple scripts with tools like rsync and robocopy.<p>Purchasing a license to stream a specific item via a specific service is, literally, buying nothing.<p>The Internet remembers everything.  Except your digital copyright licenses.  It&#x27;s anti-consumer turtles all the way down.')
