A $80 G-Force will do all of that and better.<p>Now, if we include &quot;sociatal value&quot; (seen as rich, sophisticated) there are also not much returns from going above $300. At that level people wont know what you wear and wont care.<p>If you want to make an impression to those who do know, and can tell, you&#x27;ll need to go above $10000. And if you have that kind of money, you probably don&#x27;t need to make an impression.')
