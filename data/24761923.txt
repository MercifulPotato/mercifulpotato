The thing that worked for me was to compute out the total cost I was spending per month on the car and set that as the cap on my car rentals and zipcar. I never even come close to that limit, and knowing that limit lets me feel free to spend.<p>When I did the math the insurance was close to 50% of my cost. Rest was depreciation, then gas, and maintenance.')
