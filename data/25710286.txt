Not even close.<p>He was elected because conservative opinions have been given so little credence versus liberal opinions on the biggest platforms that they turned to someone who would fight those platforms head on.<p>Liberal voices and opinions have been lauded, applauded, and promoted more than their fair share by most media and social media platforms for decades. That has created deep resentment in large areas of the country.<p>Donald Trump is a symptom of the disease that American politics and the associated media outlets have contracted. \nHe is not the disease itself.<p>The way he is acting is not that surprising to anyone who pays attention to his personality. And the response in the last week by media and social media and big tech companies has also not been surprising, although I think they should have been more measured.<p>But the underlying problem still remains. De-platforming Donald Trump will not fix the broken and biased system. And every move and countermove escalates the resentment.')
