It seems to apply less to women than I remembered. The source [4] is more scholarly and tells the same story.<p>The BBC article [2] is unfortunately just anecdotal.<p>At [3] they cite the CDC, saying<p>&gt; between 12-14 percent of adults aged 20-24 have never had sex. This number drops to around five percent for adults aged 25-29, and by age 44, only around 0.3 percent of adults report never having had the type of sex that could end in somebody getting pregnant.<p>which are much lower numbers than I remember from another survey.<p>What I remember is that, although on the one hand there is still a bulk trend of decreasing age of sexual debut, on the other hand these average&#x2F;median statistics hide a large cohort of more-educated women who have never had a sexual partner. But my impression may not be supported by national data, and may involve social selection effects.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;29&#x2F;share-americans-not-having-sex-has-reached-record-high&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;29&#x2F;share-ame...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;stories-44143003" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;stories-44143003</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;health.howstuffworks.com&#x2F;relationships&#x2F;love&#x2F;how-many-people-die-virgins-never-have-sex.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;health.howstuffworks.com&#x2F;relationships&#x2F;love&#x2F;how-many...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jamanetworkopen&#x2F;fullarticle&#x2F;2767066" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jamanetwork.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;jamanetworkopen&#x2F;fullarticle...</a>')
