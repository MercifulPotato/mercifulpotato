Very frequently the intermediate values represent nothing in particular and naming them simply results in visual noise.<p>I think this is comparable to SQL or LINQ statements. Consider what those would look like if you had to name every intermediate values instead of being able to filter and group on-the-fly.<p>Of course you can make a mess out of those too, by building huge unreadable expressions, but that&#x27;s also an extreme, similar to naming every intermediate step.')
