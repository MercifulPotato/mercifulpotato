Does that sound like a standard procedure to you or does it just happen to people like me who are constantly dehumanized?</i><p>Taking a dispute with your management chain re: feedback that said management chain felt they had to take actions like a private, hr-involved feedback session, and broadcasting that dispute to a mailing list of peers, downlevels, etc.<p>&gt; <i>But now there’s an additional layer saying any privileged person can decide that they don’t want your paper out with zero conversation.</i><p>This was, from the perspective of google management, probably very much <i>not</i> a reasonable characterization of the aforementioned circumstances.  Managers represent the company, including publicly.  Timnit was obviously in an awkward position where she seems to have been a player coach, ie a manager also doing IC level work (in this case, research). It feels like she expected her actions as an IC not to be viewed as actions that also came from a manager.  That&#x27;s a very hard dual role to have.<p>Third, maybe shouldn&#x27;t get you fired in a perfect world, but prolly will in ours:<p>Public internal criticism of DEI efforts on the part of your management chain.  Imagine how that reads to a line-level employee at Google.  Particularly an URM.<p>Fourth, same vein -- auguring on an internal mailing list\n to get the CBC to criticize your employer<p>&gt; <i>I believe that the Congressional Black Caucus is the entity that started forcing tech companies to report their diversity numbers</i><p>I&#x27;m only paying attention because I&#x27;m curious if Timnit was hired to -- if you will excuse the phrase -- whitewash google&#x27;s policies, and she didn&#x27;t understand what Google was buying; or if there genuinely was some conflict here.  I suspect both from different players in the executive ranks.')
