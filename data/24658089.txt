They used to have a fair amount of cancellations&#x2F;delays that would cause you to be stranded.<p>I have never flown Spirit, and I will continue to avoid it in the future because the low fares aren&#x27;t enough to justify potentially getting stranded and having to book last minute at extreme cost on a competing airline.  If your plans are flexible and you just want to travel for the lowest amount possible, it&#x27;s probably a good option to consider.')
