My sister and I interviewed my parents in 2005 about how they met.  Now that my dad&#x27;s passed, the video has become an heirloom.  It&#x27;s an hour-long raw video though - editing it down into a tight story with an arc would be incredible.<p>At his eulogy I talked about how great it is that hundreds of awesome people came to say nice things about him.  But it would be even nicer if he heard those things when he was alive. I encouraged attendees to go tell their loved ones how they felt before they were gone.<p>Artifact seems like it can help with that in a very polished way.<p>I can also easily imagine spending a few hundred $$ on this once or twice a year for various people in my life. It&#x27;s on the high side (e.g. &quot;meaningful gift&#x2F;memorable occasion&quot; pricing), but given your audio samples it seems price indicates quality.<p>Good stuff. Will be following your journey and will become a customer at some point.')
