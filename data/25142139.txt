I don&#x27;t know if the same is true for new hires.<p>New hires generally have their existing compensation as part of their negotiation. So if I&#x27;m already living in SF and am negotiating with a new employer for salary, my current high CoL salary gives me leverage to expect higher pay regardless if I&#x27;m working remotely. Remote work allows for flexibility but it doesn&#x27;t erase CoL concerns.')
