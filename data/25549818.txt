Item(by='graderjs', descendants=None, kids=[25558477], score=None, time=1609059582, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25543127, text='I looked up culturally normative. I think it&#x27;s something to do with &quot;cultural norms&quot;, so to say something is &quot;culturally normative&quot; indicates that it&#x27;s one of a culture&#x27;s &quot;norms&quot;. If I don&#x27;t get that right, feel free to correct me, I&#x27;m interested to learn about this terminology.<p>Definitely my view is subjective. It&#x27;s my personal feeling about it. I&#x27;m not pretending to tell other people how they should feel about it. Nor would I expect them to tell me.<p>I agree we are Apex Predators and that&#x27;s a good thing. I just think we can use our brutality responsibly and considerately. Hunt for food in a way that respects and maintains ecological balance, to me, is different to hunt for trinkets and sport.<p>If the elephants are attacking villagers indiscriminately and stomping children, and the 3 tribes eliminated were genetically predisposed to that behavior, I&#x27;d be there with you all carrying my pitchfork (or musket, or whatever), ready to &quot;keeell those darned demonic elaphunts!&quot; But if it was just gratuitous violence for trinkets against a large, caring, intelligent and sentient species, I think that&#x27;s horrible, and that the people who did it, and that side of our nature (gratuitous cruelty) makes us terrible, and I feel it&#x27;s terribly sad for us and the elephants.<p>I&#x27;m not attacking you personally, nor saying eating meat (or killing animals for some reasons) is terrible. But if you feel people aren&#x27;t terrible in some ways, I get that perspective, I just think and feel differently about it!')
