Do you think that Google was going to refuse to license Widevine and then Brave made the migration to CEF and they said, &quot;now we know you&#x27;re serious&quot;?<p>It&#x27;s not <i>user security</i> that&#x27;s causing Google to refuse to license Widevine to this project. The response Google gives is not, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry but we&#x27;re not supporting an Electron solution like this&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m sorry but we&#x27;re not supporting an Open Source solution like this.&quot;<p>In fact, if you read the full email exchange, the suggestion that the Widevine licensing team gives is to move to a proprietary Electron fork that will be even slower to receive security patches than the upstream codebase would be. So it&#x27;s definitely not the Electron&#x2F;security part that Google is upset about.')
