I understand that Emacs doesn&#x27;t feel as &quot;modern&quot; as PyCharm or VS Code in a sense, but I don&#x27;t think the &quot;it&#x27;s not an IDE&quot; argument holds. It can be (if you want and take the time for it) a very powerful IDE, customized to exactly <i>your</i> needs. It can also be a lot of other things in addition. It&#x27;s a difficult to classify tool, in a category of its own.')
