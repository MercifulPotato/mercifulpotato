All renewable power is used, so every extra (marginal) kWh used comes 100% from COÂ² producing generation. A price high enough to affect consumer&#x27;s usage will reduce the carbon footprint.<p>I disagree; itis a rather backwards view and a misunderstanding of how cheap and plentiful energy has made the human experience less harsh and more meaningful for billions of people.<p>In Denmark it means that many Danish homes are being heated with wood stoves, wood pellet boilers, natural gas or even old oil furnaces. Neither of these have any meaningful filtering and emit CO2, whereas cheaper electricity would make heat pumps and other electric heating much more meaningful.<p>Remember: Cheap energy is not the problem, unless the low price point is due to political legislating, not requiring the producer to pay the entire &quot;bill&quot;, e.g. by not compensating for emitting CO2.<p>Vestas and other wind turbine producers have done some clever lobbying by getting legislators to buy their &quot;cheap&quot; power, while leaving the issue of baseline stability to somebody else.')
