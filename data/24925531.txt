I’m sure there’s a reason for that, but I always loathe hacking around in the source for that reason. Finding which cpp file belongs to which CMake file is an annoying and often frustrating task. Their CMake scripts also make some assumptions on Windows, making it impossible to build LLVM with LLVM without editing CMake files (at least, last time I checked). To me, the whole value of CMake is to allow you to swap in different toolchains with ease.<p>So I wish someone smarter than me would go clean up the current CMake setup instead of using another build system altogether. But I guess any improvement to build usability is a good thing.')
