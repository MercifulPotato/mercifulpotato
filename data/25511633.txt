I noticed that too and this is coming from someone who listens and watches everything at 2x speed.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of DHH&#x27;s talks and demos and never had a problem listening to them at 2x. This is the only time where it feels like he scripted out the entire video word for word and then talked over a screen recording that was recorded separately from his voice. This video sounds nothing like what he normally sounds like (both tone and speed). I really wonder if he recorded this in a booth.')
