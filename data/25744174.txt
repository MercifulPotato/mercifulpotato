What people really need right now is a new-age Information Service which is not an &quot;internet service provider&quot; at all, or is only such in the loosest sense of the term; a service that gathers up useful data and information from the internet and other sources also, datamining and collating it and presenting in a convenient form for the customer, minus all the ads, Javascript, malware, etc. Sort of like a CompuServe&#x2F;AOL&#x2F;DMOZ&#x2F;BBS renaissance. Limited direct access could be provided to certain whitelisted internet sites, with the vast majority of the cruft excluded.')
