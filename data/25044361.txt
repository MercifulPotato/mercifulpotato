If you go to jail for promoting some information, that&#x27;s censorship.<p>Twitter and Facebook are part of &quot;the public&quot;. You are even using right now a website very heavy on &quot;censorship&quot;, or how I call it &quot;moderation&quot;. If you don&#x27;t follow HN guidelines you will be silenced.
