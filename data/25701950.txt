The majority of lab, semi field, and field studies report negative implications of neonicotinoids. Of four field studies investigating bumble bees [23-26], three report such effects [23, 25, 26]. These bees are about 2-3 times more sensitive than honey bees to neonicotinoid toxicity [13, 27, 28].')
