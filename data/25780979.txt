This is software not biker gangs. I&#x27;m not judging you. I hope you understand that. One or two other people maybe, but not you.<p>I&#x27;ve not called anyone a Nazi. I didn&#x27;t commit Mein Kampf twice. I didn&#x27;t put an Auschwitz joke in the manual. Neither did you.<p>It was this[1] that convinced me to spend time with Plan 9. I&#x27;ve spoken to some really nice 9Front users and contributors. I&#x27;ve read and watched cool things by people like mycroft, Sigrid and yourself. Then at the other end of the scale there&#x27;s this:<p><i>ahem</i> <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.9front.org&#x2F;hg&#x2F;fqa.9front.org&#x2F;log?rev=rails.jpg" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.9front.org&#x2F;hg&#x2F;fqa.9front.org&#x2F;log?rev=rails.jpg</a><p>And for shits and giggles, this:<p><i>ahem</i> <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.9front.org&#x2F;hg&#x2F;fqa.9front.org&#x2F;rev&#x2F;2c6ef22d5a74" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.9front.org&#x2F;hg&#x2F;fqa.9front.org&#x2F;rev&#x2F;2c6ef22d5a74</a><p>For every person you explain to, there are many more who just call you all a bunch of Nazis. People have slid into my DMs and just outright openly called everyone in 9Front nazis for over a week now. The idea is ridiculous yet it persists. That&#x27;s obviously not the association you want for yourself, but it&#x27;s one you&#x27;re aware of or you wouldn&#x27;t be here.<p>It&#x27;s happening right now here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mastodon.social&#x2F;@Ludonaut&#x2F;105555232277945673" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mastodon.social&#x2F;@Ludonaut&#x2F;105555232277945673</a> - that&#x27;s just one place, there are plenty others. My Signal&#x27;s full of it, Telegram too. Memes, some pretty personal, the lot.<p>You can&#x27;t whack-a-mole that association. All you can do is choose to change it or choose to own it.<p>EDIT: Seems I can&#x27;t reply to Ori directly so here it is: No I&#x27;m not insinuating you&#x27;re a Nazi sympathizer. I wouldn&#x27;t. The whole point of my reply is that you are not and I know you are not but lots of others won&#x27;t draw that conclusion and you won&#x27;t be able to correct them all. If I thought you were involved in that sort of shit I&#x27;d come straight out with it.<p>Ok Ori, you believe what you want to believe. I&#x27;ve been 100% up-front about everything so far. If you&#x27;re relying on insinuations then you&#x27;re reading into stuff that just isn&#x27;t there. You&#x27;re the third 9Front guy to come at me, and I&#x27;m done trying to be polite about it so I&#x27;ll withdraw.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=6m3GuoaxRNM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=6m3GuoaxRNM</a>')
