I&#x27;ve owned ~6 laptops over the last 10 years, all Intel Macs. Each year you get about ~20% ~performance increase for the same &quot;costs&quot; (weight, battery, price).<p>This year you get about 100% performance increase <i>and</i> the costs are <i>all</i> halved. Ok, so... we&#x27;ll call it a &quot;huge&quot; evolution. All I know is I&#x27;ve been waiting <i>since the air came out</i> for this laptop to exist: fast enough to handle all my work, with decent battery life. It&#x27;s been almost a decade of waiting, and not only did it finally come, but it somehow is much faster than even the biggest of last generation and super cheap.<p>If you made a graph showing (price * perf * battery-life * weight) you&#x27;d see a nice evolutionary curve over the last decade, and then this generation you&#x27;d see a huge jump - way more than double. You&#x27;re ignoring the fact this is a 10W CPU doing more than 28W, fanless! And the diff in subjective performance isn&#x27;t small, it feels bigger than any previous generation jump by quite a lot...')
