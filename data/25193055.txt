I guess that&#x27;s becoming pretty common though.<p>Older tools might support technologies like SCEP but not ACME. These older protocols can&#x27;t be used (on their own) to get certificates trusted in the Web PKI because the whole point of ACME is to do the proof-of-control step needed to get those certificates. But in your private PKI you likely don&#x27;t need or even want that feature.<p>I guess it can make sense for new software that is at least sometimes for public access to just do ACME, but it does feel like maybe Smallstep should have a legacy SCEP mechanism available. I see there is a GitHub ticket for that so no need to raise it again.')
