My only problem with that implementation is the fact it is non-typed. Heads are generic, and the code using them has to use container_of() macros to recover the containing type.<p>I&#x27;ve since discovered bsd&#x2F;queue.h [0], which is very similar in purpose, but is not &quot;good taste&quot; (which I don&#x27;t mind at all) on the other hand it is type safe, has quite a few variants for single and double lists, and oh also, it&#x27;s not GPL.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;freebsd&#x2F;freebsd&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;sys&#x2F;sys&#x2F;queue.h" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;freebsd&#x2F;freebsd&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;sys&#x2F;sys&#x2F;queue...</a>')
