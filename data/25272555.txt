I have recently purchased a DOCSIS 2.0 CMTS for it (as these are the only affordable ones) and want at least one modem I know will work correctly.<p>Are there any modems or even companies known to manufacture modems that all relatively accessible as in they provide me with a shell that will allow me to explore, get verbose logs information, configure, etc. so that I can get this thing to work with my new CMTS. I don’t care about whether is accessible over SSH or if I have to hook onto a bus on the board to get to it. I’ve just had modems before where I have difficulty getting anymore than some log output off a UART and have killed some modems poking around too much. Ideally something I can pick up cheap as I just dumped a ton of money in this and some other projects.<p>Alternatively if anyone knows a more appropriate forum to ask this sort of things, please by all means let me know.')
