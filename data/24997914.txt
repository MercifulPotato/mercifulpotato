In other words if your heat pump is working between two environments with very close temperatures then the heat transfer is very efficient (for example 19 degrees C outside, 21 inside). But if you are trying to heat your house to a livable temperature while itâ€™s -20 outside, your efficiency is terrible.<p>This is why for example you see heat pumps installed all over the place in homes in the southern parts of the US where you also need little heating all around, while places up north where you do spend quite a bit on heating cannot really take advantage of heat pumps due to winters being too cold.')
