Embrace (new OS that does everything Unix does, and free!), extend (Linux has features not found in classic Unixes), extinguish (Linux is now the de facto standard, so anyone who wants to use Unix is laughed at).<p>Microsoft gets mocked for embrace&#x2F;extend&#x2F;extinguish, but really, it means just do a better job than the competition. Embrace: &quot;do what others are doing&quot;, extend: &quot;do a better job at it, have more features than the competition&quot;, extinguish: &quot;sell customers on those features and improvements&quot;. How anyone could be against competition, simply because it&#x27;s framed in a cheesy phrase, is beyond me.')
