Even naive rate limiting schemes tend to permit a certain number of concurrent requests (as they well should, since even browsers may perform concurrent requests without any developer intervention).<p>Rate limiting and pagination aren’t (necessarily) about making full data consumption more difficult. They’re more often about optimizing common use cases and general quality of service.<p>Edit to add: in certain circles (eg those of us who take REST and HATEOAS as baseline HTTP API principles), parallelism is often not just expected but often encouraged. A service can provide efficient, limited subsets of a full representation and allow clients to retrieve as little or as much of the full representation as they see fit.')
