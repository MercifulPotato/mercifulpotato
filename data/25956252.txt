Weird and dodgy, and they spend every second of your use of their app trying to sell you shitty addon services like mobile phone insurance.<p>Starling, however, has been magic. I swapped my primary banking over to them and the only issue I&#x27;ve had is their dislike of rooted phones. That&#x27;s only a minor inconvenience every few months when I forget to upgrade Magisk before the Starling app, though.<p>Transferwise I&#x27;ve used many times to transfer money for larger purchases in Europe. No complaints, but haven&#x27;t tried the banking side of it.')
