It costs about $500&#x2F;mo.  It took maybe 100 hours to set up the basics and $6000 for the way I built the hw (which is similar to servethehome&#x27;s rack).  I run everything on FreeBSD.  I get to directly talk BGP and get bandwidth at .12c&#x2F;gbit.  Nothing else can come close to this level of low cost, control, learning, and autonomy.')
