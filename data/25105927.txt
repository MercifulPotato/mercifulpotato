It was not my intent to defend them.<p>I do not consider nuclear energy a viable alternative to the hydrocarbon economy. I have considered it and I have dismissed it. You will not change my mind unless you can produce it off planet. I have dismissed it as a non-viable option (apparently the &quot;non-viable&quot; part is inconceivable to you.) This dismissal is not tied to my need to coddle and protect my identity as an activist.<p>&quot;It highlights the very important point that activist groups will quite often ignore viable solutions.
