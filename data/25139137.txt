Item(by='analog31', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605718645, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25136258, text='Something you&#x27;re interested in, but don&#x27;t have the self discipline or resources to learn on your own. For instance I loved math and science but would not have been disciplined enough to organize and follow through with my own course of study. Those became my college majors. On the other hand, I found it trivially easy and effortless to learn things like computer programming and electronics (after the basic intro courses got me started), and have not received any further training in those things, though I use them every day.<p>So, without identifying a particular subject, match something you&#x27;re interested in, with a way of teaching&#x2F;learning, that you&#x27;re unlikely to be able to provide for yourself. Also, some of those things such as courses at your nearby college, or a conference, have the added benefit of removing you from the daily hurly-burly with your supervisor&#x27;s blessing.')
