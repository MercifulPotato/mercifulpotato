There is no pure government out there that meets the academic definition of the market they espouse.  It&#x27;s just not possible, never has been, never will be (I usually don&#x27;t speak in absolutes but feel pretty 99.999% comfortable with this statement).  There will always be gray outside the academic setting.')
