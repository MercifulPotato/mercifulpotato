Years back I though of taking something like the OP app, and using it as input to an... ambient interactive implicit curriculum of science and engineering.<p>So imagine you type &quot;cat&quot;.  Then maybe you get a picture of a cat.  Maybe from ancient Egypt.  Or maybe tiles of labeled behavior videos, sleep, walk, eat, etc.  Or a yowl.  Maybe with a scrubbable intensity plot.  Or maybe that intensity is shown as a fast spreading sound ripple, overlaid on a top view of your own neighborhood.  Maybe with a draggable microphone, to play with volume, and delay, and doppler.  Or back to cat, maybe you get video with a 200 bpm cat&#x27;s fast heart rate.  And maybe an order of magnitude animal mass slider.  Slide up to human, to whale, and get the word &quot;whale&quot;, video of swimming whale, and a whale&#x27;s 20 bpm heart swishing.  And similarly down to mouse 600 bpm.  Or back to cat, ... it&#x27;s a high-dimensional densely-woven tapestry of possibilities.<p>When the most popular introductory astronomy textbooks can&#x27;t even manage to get the color of the Sun right, there seems a need to explore new ways to deliver an understanding of the physical world.  Pity child automatic speech recognition is still so poor.<p>Back down towards MVP, might &quot;type a word, get a picture&quot; be interesting?  Not so much?  Way too distracting?  Other thoughts?  Thanks for input.')
