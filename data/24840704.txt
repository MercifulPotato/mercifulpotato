Yes Google is a monopoly, but IMO Amazon is much worse.<p>I&#x27;m not thinking about the cloud business which has plenty competition, but the retail stuff. They undercut the competition until it dies then they&#x27;re the sole business around.<p>Case in point: a couple weeks ago I bought a 16 TB hard drive for my personal server. It was something like 420€ on Amazon and about 600€ on my local Newegg equivalent. While I would have bought it locally for a couple dozen euros more, there was no way I would spend almost 200€ more for the same thing.<p>I know that long term it&#x27;s bad for me and I hate myself for it but I still went with Amazon.')
