You can choose to keep them to facilitate dual boot with Secure Boot on, but you can also choose to eject them from the trust store.<p>Sure, they&#x27;re loaded by default, and you can argue that we can&#x27;t prove the board isn&#x27;t gonna trust them behind your back -- but that applies to older non-open hardware too.<p>My bigger annoyance is Intel Boot Guard. I want Intel to let us control the firmware more directly -- even if it requires some physical authorization&#x2F;kills some DRM component in ME or something. But that&#x27;s not happening anytime soon...')
