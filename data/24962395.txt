Flat out lying and keeping secrets from the people who are tasked with the civilian oversight of the FE should be punished with prison time to make it clear, at all levels, that this will not be tolerated.<p>I don’t have much faith in any serious reprocaution though. At least two ministers of justice have told telcos to continue provide mass survilance to PET ( Internal police intelligence ). It’s clearly against EU law and EU courts have made rulings telling the Danish government to stop. They just don’t care. The police won’t even say how often it’s used. The general consensus seems to be basically NEVER, and it’s never the main intelligence source, still they refuse to stop.')
