This is best case for us, because we will make a lot of money. Unfortunately for you, you don&#x27;t have any shares, so you will probably just be fired or prodded to leave&quot;.<p>I think I was the first one to realize what was going on: we were the developers in Belgium, and we had some cheap developers in Eastern Europe. They had developers in US. They were going to continue developing their own product, and would &quot;keep us all as developers&quot;.<p>But from their point of view, it didn&#x27;t make much sense to me that &quot;We have devs in EU, but those guys from Belgium are 4x more expensive than those from another country&quot;. I quit shortly after the acquisition, and my colleagues all left a year later. They kept the developers in Eastern Europe.<p>It makes total sense to me, and I&#x27;m not resentful about it, probably because it&#x27;s so easy for developers to find a new job.<p>One other thing I want to mention: they were very transparent on the strategy when they were acquiring various smaller companies. Very insightful.')
