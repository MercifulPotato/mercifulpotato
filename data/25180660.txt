But the process is similar: gain a majority stake in a company by whatever means are available, appoint yourself as the chief executive, and manage the company with the goal of enriching yourself, rather than with growing the company.<p>The structure of the Sears deal was really interesting and suspicious. Sears bought a small number of Kmart stores for an enormous cash price, which sent Kmart stock into orbit, then Lampert used the inflated Kmart stock to acquire Sears. Pretty shady.<p>Another difference is Lampert is a black sheep, but Mitt Romney is for some reason still socially accepted despite having wrecked dozens of American companies.')
