The government has repeatedly used Section 144 to deny the right to assemble and protest. During Hathras gangrape, not only did the government deny such rights to those who wanted to express solidarity with the victim and victims family by using Section 144. It turned a blind eye when the perpetrators milleu openly violated the section to assemble to show support on behalf of the accused. Why, because those are BJP&#x27;s (the ruling party&#x27;s) vote base.<p>The party IT cell head (Malviya) divulged the identity of the victim of rape although this is against the law. No charges have brought against Malviya or those who assembled in support of the gangrape accused in violation of Section 144.')
