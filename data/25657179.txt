If you want to implement an alphazero-style training pipeline, you&#x27;ll immediately discover that pytorch does not ship with an MCTS and a board game rules engine, and the only way to accomplish your task is to write these components yourself in C or C++.<p>More appropriate tools for the job exist. The state of the world we are in is largely dictated by what languages developers are forced to use because companies want hires to be highly fungible, because of library ecosystems, or because they want to ship code that runs on platforms that ban almost all languages.')
