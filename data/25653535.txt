Its more like, knowing random stuff sometimes comes in handy.<p>For sockets &#x2F; pipes &#x2F; terminal stuff in Unix, I ultimately just had to skim over &quot;Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment&quot; cover-to-cover.<p>There&#x27;s just a lot of things the UNIX dudes have already implemented with regards to inter-process communications, files, threads, processes, signals, and the like.<p>Once you know what UNIX (and Linux) have to offer, then you can start leveraging it. You don&#x27;t really need to understand everything, you just need to know things to a level that &quot;I can look it up later when I need it&quot;.<p>Again: you&#x27;re going for breadth, not depth. Skimming over concepts and &quot;remembering them for later&quot;. You&#x27;ll know when you need it, and can come back to the book for depth later on.<p>---------<p>For &quot;Tee&quot;, and &quot;Awk&quot;, and &quot;expect&quot;, and stuff... I followed blogposts at Linode and Slicehost back in the day which covered a lot of interesting sys-admin tricks. I&#x27;m pretty sure the Slicehost pages are lost (the company was bought out by Rackspace years ago. I don&#x27;t know if any of that stuff was archived)<p>I never was a professional sys-admin. But knowing about Awk, Tee, or various other &quot;standard command-line tools&quot; that web-developers use all the time allows me to script up a lot of things related to testing code, Makefiles, and the like.<p>I basically got that experience from just messing with servers: trying to run my own mail server or web server on the side. Cronjobs, automation, etc. etc.')
