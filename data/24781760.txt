Half of that time is summer, when teens normally aren&#x27;t in school anyway.<p>So if being able to socialize with friends and peers is an important part of teens&#x27; mental health (I think it is), then this study doesn&#x27;t really cover that very well.<p>Also, July was a few months ago. It&#x27;s possible things get worse over the long haul.')
