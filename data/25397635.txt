Thanks for your reflections; they are extremely valuable to me (us), and I can now tell you that the pricing will be changed because of your input.\nOur pricing problem is this: We are moving from direct sales to online sales, so our model has to cater to both target groups. Direct obvious is the more expensive version. But it is clear to me that:\nThe model has to be more simple\nThe entry price will have to be much lower<p>This will be implemented shortly when we have had more time to finetune the model and its business consequences.\nCheers,\nPer')
