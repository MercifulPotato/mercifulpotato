It&#x27;s not like they don&#x27;t have the industry contacts to source more powerful stuff if they want. They just want to have a positive profit margin on selling console hardware. They want hardware sales (and sales of first-party &quot;killer app&quot; software enabled by the hardware) — not third-party software license fees — to be their main revenue stream.<p>Each console or handheld Nintendo puts out follows a formula:<p>* Choose key components (CPU cores, screens on portables, etc.) that are two-to-five year-old, one-or-more generations-behind tech at design time, such that they&#x27;re in wide manufacturing and easy to source as parts &#x2F; cheap to license to build themselves.<p>* Add in novel in-house-developed IP cores&#x2F;ASICs, which allow developers to build games that &quot;do&quot; a lot more than the key components would seem to allow.<p>* Wrap the whole thing in a novel interaction method that makes the console&#x27;s hardware performance relative to its &quot;console generation&quot; kind of illegible (e.g. the Wiimote, the two screens of the DS, the portability of the Switch, etc.); which de-facto locks in games developed to target the hardware, making them much harder to port away; and which acts as a neato whizz-bang selling point in the form of enabling new &quot;killer apps&quot; (e.g. 3D first-person games with the N64 analog stick; Wii Sports with the Wiimote; Brain Training and other pre-smartphone &quot;apps&quot; with the DS stylus.)<p>Nintendo are at their best (i.e. most profitable) when they double down on this strategy, releasing a seemingly-new hardware &quot;generation&quot; that&#x27;s really just the same existing hardware but with new&#x2F;updated IP cores. The Gameboy Color is just an overclocked Gameboy with a better PPU. The Wii is just an overclocked Gamecube with an ARM coprocessor embedding wi-fi&#x2F;bluetooth&#x2F;SD card support. Etc.<p>The Switch is a departure from this strategy, in that the Tegra X1 wasn&#x27;t actually all that old at the time of the Switch&#x27;s release, and so likely bit into Nintendo&#x27;s profit-margin on the Switch pretty heavily. I&#x27;m sure Nintendo would rather have used a slightly-older part. But there just wasn&#x27;t anything like the Tegra X1 (in terms of GPU power per watt) until the Tegra X1 — no viable competitors, and no previous generation of the chip to lean on. <i>And</i> they were constrained by wanting to port Wii U games to the Switch, which demanded basically the X1&#x27;s level of power.')
