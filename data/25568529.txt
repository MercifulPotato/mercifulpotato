TypeScript (TS) fans call this &quot;poor mans type checker&quot;. It has however several benefits over TS. Like more simple then extended type declaration:\nif(arr.lenght==0) throw new Error(&quot;expected arr to be not empty&quot;)<p>Vs<p>type NonEmptyArray&lt;T&gt; = [T, ...T[]];<p>Or if you need to check if the array has exactly 3 items. How would you do that in TS?')
