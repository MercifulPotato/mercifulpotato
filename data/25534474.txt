That doesn&#x27;t mean that ethical company would employ such tactics in a pentest. There&#x27;s a limit of how far you can go in simulation. Surely, real criminals could do it - but the company can maintain vigilance without resorting to essentially replicating the villains and causing almost as much harm to the victims as the real villains do.<p>I&#x27;m astonished how nobody at GD could predict what emotional harm would such a trick cause. There&#x27;s a lot of ways to test it without such a cruel method. Even reviews - that you mentioned - would work as well without being cruel.')
