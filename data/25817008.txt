Had an appointment the other week with a customer, and had to resort to dial-in with audio-only. I guess you need a corporate account or something, but Teams wouldn&#x27;t say. When I wanted to start a video call, an error message would flash up briefly, like 100ms, so you can&#x27;t read it - typically MS, I thought, shrugged, and deinstalled the app, for it to be never installed again. That was for a .deb-based package; a snap wouldn&#x27;t even install. Regular Skype, OTOH, has worked for like 15 years.')
