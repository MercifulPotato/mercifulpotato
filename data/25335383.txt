It&#x27;s not as if remote options haven&#x27;t been available for a long time. The wages in San Francisco aren&#x27;t determined explicitly by cost-of-living, they are determined by the scarcity of availability of the right resources.<p>Businesses found it necessary to exist in Silicon Valley because it provided certain benefits, and businesses found it necessary to have on-premises employees because it provided certain benefits. Since California won&#x27;t allow any on-premises anything, the cost-benefit of being in the Valley and having people in the office is being reset. But if your skills and aptitude are scarce, there&#x27;s no reason to believe wages won&#x27;t continue to reflect that. And if your skills and aptitude aren&#x27;t scarce, you were overpaid in the first place.')
