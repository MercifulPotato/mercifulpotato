You can rent an entire droplet along with the additional bandwidth that comes with said droplet for 50% less than just buying the extra bandwidth (and even with that 50% discount it&#x27;s still prohibitive for bandwidth-intensive apps).<p>More off-topic: I still generally like and use DO, but I dislike the policy of billing for one thing (e.g. 1vCPU) and adding hidden, fuzzy terms and conditions like &quot;don&#x27;t consume excessive CPU cycles.&quot; IMO the marketing ought to make it crystal clear that you&#x27;re allowed to _burst_ to 100% use and also put in a well-defined threshold on any other resource limits like total CPU cycles so that people can plan accordingly and not be hit with surprise outages. It&#x27;s similar to the complaint people have with Comcast selling XX00 Mbps packages and then tucking a miniscule bandwidth cap in the terms and conditions. That&#x27;s potentially a fine policy, but it&#x27;s extremely misleading to sell one thing and use fine print to shape it into a completely different offering.')
