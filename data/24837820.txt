That makes a good barometer of the economy as it can describe if job losses are accelerating or not.<p>You can pick any of the alternate measures and they all say pretty much the same thing.  But by overlooking those who have dropped out of the labor market, the U-3 focuses more on what is happening with the labor market <i>now</i> not several years ago.<p>You can try this for yourself by plotting the U-1 through U-6 rates on the same graph and picking the one you think is most useful as a snapshot of the labor force.  You&#x27;ll probably land on the U-3 as the U-1 doesn&#x27;t show upticks in unemployment very well and the U-6 muddies the severity of upticks in unemployment.  The broad strokes will be the same, but the nuance is missing.')
