This is like two not-random siblings both calling in sick in the same week. The case of two large Google outrages where the whole service gets conked has much more potential to have a shared or related cause than two birthdays happening at once. You&#x27;re right that it&#x27;s not astronomically small, but the odds of them being related seem healthier than the odds of them being unrelated.')
