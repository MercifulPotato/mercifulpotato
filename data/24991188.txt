Or while moms worked as nannies for someone else. That was whole day job too, meaning there are two kids not having attention of parents.<p>The 10 years old kids who also used to work in factories were not &quot;raised&quot; by any contemporary meaning of word.<p>Back to small villages and families with many kids, all adults had to work very hard to just create necessities for everyone. Once the kids were past toddler plus a bit stage, adults simply could not tweak them individually people do with kids now.<p>Aristocratic kids were routinely sent to boarding schools.<p>I could continue on and on as I go through time periods, but kids spent a lot of time literally raising themselves. They also died a lot and were beaten a lot.<p>&gt; we put so much less effort [...] See how many people are baffled by what to do when they actually have to be around their kids for most of the day because of the pandemic.<p>This is definitely not true. And yeah, I found out during pandemic that school teacher is significantly better teacher then me. Triple so while I cant send the kid just outside to play alone as was completely normal generations ago (with exception of isolated periods).')
