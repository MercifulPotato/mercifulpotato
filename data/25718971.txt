I&#x27;ve heard of Windows emulation on Mac before but this is the first time I&#x27;ve heard of Parallels.<p>&gt; Now you can download Steam and basically install anything and it will probably work. Microsoft really did some amazing magic in getting both 32-bit and 64-bit x86 programs running on arm64.<p>The author makes it sound like you can run basically all Windows software on Mac without issues with Parallel, including more demanding software like games you&#x27;d find on Steam.<p>Does anyone here have experience with Parallels? How does performance compare? My assumption with this kind of emulation was always that performance would typically suffer too much for it to be worth it.')
