It&#x27;s like stumbling on a displaced brick in a sidewalk. If I read &quot;a good programmer will work to understand the problem they are trying to solve&quot; I will mentally trip over that and be distracted from the point being made.<p>If I don&#x27;t know whether my subject is a male or a female person, I will use &quot;he&quot; as the singular. &quot;A good programmer will work to understand the problem he is trying to solve.&quot;<p>I learned that &quot;he&quot; refers to a male or is neutral, but don&#x27;t mind when writers use &quot;she&quot; as long as they are consistent about it. In a paragraph about the habits of a good programmer, flipping from &quot;he&quot; to &quot;she&quot; every other sentence is also distracting.<p>Also OK if the writer avoids the issue: &quot;Good programmers will work to understand the problems they are trying to solve.&quot;<p>Yes I realize that the usage of &quot;they&quot; has evolved, as language does, but for me it&#x27;s hard-coded in ROM at this point.')
