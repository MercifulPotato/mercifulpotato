It also sets up the XBox as some sort of patriotic push to defeat the agressors that attacked us without warning.<p>I&#x27;d be offended if I was working for the PS2 division at Sony at the time, I think. I also think I&#x27;d be offended if I was working on games for the XBox - it&#x27;s entertainment, not war!')
