Google can bring your entire business to a halt with no explanation, costing you potentially your livelihood.  You may never get the opportunity to escalate to a point where a human will reconsider the matter. They do this as a matter of routine.<p>A restaurant can bring you cold soup or something, and you can complain at a waiter right there on the spot (if you&#x27;re so inclined). They&#x27;ll probably give you a free meal for it.  Absolute worst case they can give you food which is poisoned and there is strong precedent that in this case, if you escalate sufficiently, they will be shut down.')
