We&#x27;d play wiffleball very seriously in our neighborhood. To the point that we kept summer stats. The pitchers in those games, those leagues, were little brothers throwing full speed. Because us older boys (10-13) threw too hard. My brother and my friends brother were the main pitchers, at like age 7-8, and went on to be very successful baseball players.')
