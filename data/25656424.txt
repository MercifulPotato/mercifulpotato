Going forward it will become really easy to reproduce the voice of anyone! It seems not a lot of training data is required to achieve reasonable results (e.g. Spong Bob is just 27min of voice, Half Life Black Mesa Announcer is just 1.9min!!). This stuff could be easily leveraged for scams and deep fakes (along with deep learning models that could also tweak lip movements to match the voice for example). Thankfully, there is also a very active area of research that leverages similar tech to detect deep fakes.')
