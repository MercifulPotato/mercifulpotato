Some of what you have outlined about the process of getting to an MVP looks like solid info to my eyes (granted, that may just be announcing my own naivete).<p>I will note that there is a danger that sharing the process could interfere with success of the product for various reasons. The big two are &quot;conflict of interest&quot; -- people may be hesitant to sign up knowing in advance you are likely to talk about them -- and that blogging about it may be more rewarding (in terms of positive attention and feel good experiences) than actually making the product, which could end up being counterproductive (if you let it).<p>I&#x27;ve looked your landing page over and I will suggest that good guidelines for how to socialize well with co-workers will be a critical part of making this work.<p>I was a homemaker for a lot of years and not understanding social norms for the corporate world was an uncomfortable experience for me when I had a corporate job. I have about six years of college and yadda, but I just have different life experience from the norm so it&#x27;s been personally challenging for me to parse certain things.<p>So I think you will need to help people with that piece of it because a space of this sort can potentially go sideways. If this were my product, I would be gathering together good articles about how to do business socializing well, what are the pitfalls you most need to avoid, what are some best practices, etc.<p>I would also put together whatever articles I could find about the importance of making social connections and building trust to business success. That will be the value position: That your work force will be more effective if they can connect socially and sort out things people need to sort out that can impede effective communication, etc, at times at work.')
