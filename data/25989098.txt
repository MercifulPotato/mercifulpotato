I believe that the crypto market is just taking bets on a financial war. The only currency that will have any value is the one that supports the most productive economy. The most productive economy will be the one that offers the best chance for <i>new</i> entrants to build <i>long-term</i> wealth. This is a balance. There must be new supply available for low-capital work. There must also be price stability for capital investment. Mining is not perfect, but it works. It has tight margins and a huge downstream economy such as semiconductor fabs, and hydroelectric dams. The new supply is the core of value creation activity. Without that, decentralized crypto will never have its own economy; it will only exist as a collectible to be traded for goods produced in the fiat economy.')
