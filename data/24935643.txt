Climate scientists talk about the conveyor systems of the ocean, that literally keep the ocean flowing around the world. It&#x27;s not spoken of very much, but the threat really does go up to &quot;the ocean stops circulating&quot; (is drastically drastically reduced in circulation). The ocean acidifies, runs out of dissolved oxygen,... dies.<p>Meanwhile we&#x27;re already in an era of mass extinction for the animals. How many more shocks can the animals take?<p>Maybe the rich can get by on a deadening husk of a world without really noticing, maybe human life goes on. Who am I kidding, of course it does, but my general gist is that the current pattern of extreme weather &amp; disasters being localized is knitting together as the crisis marchs into ever more dire territory into something truly globespanning &amp; globe-wrecking, where earth itself will visibly no longer support the same everyday vitality of life, and where we have to find new means to artificially sustain the ecosphere &amp; pollenate our farmlands.')
