Electric cars by their nature are fast.  People have been putting electric setups in drag cars for a long time and getting ridiculously fast quarter mile times.  There are entire racing leagues based around electric drive trains.  From what I&#x27;ve read, the Porsche Taycan has better performance than any Tesla.')
