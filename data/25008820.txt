If you believe (or claim, which is a different issue) that &quot;some folks with low credit scores really are credit worthy&quot;, then you&#x27;re free to take on that risk and profit from it if you&#x27;re lending your own money.<p>However, if you&#x27;re playing with someone else&#x27;s money, then you do not get the privilege to make arbitrary calls on what&#x27;s risky and what&#x27;s not; the society has to presume that you may be mistaken or lying (especially because there&#x27;s an incentive to lie), we have to discard and ignore your novel, innovative evaluations, and evaluate the risk according to some conservative measure that other people trust. I mean, it&#x27;s not about being allowed or disallowed to make the loans, it&#x27;s about capitalization requirements to cover the risks i.e. the need to back up your assumption that these people really are credit worthy with your own funds.<p>Innovation on better credit evaluation can help you lose less money on bad loans, which directly impacts your profit as a lender; but it can&#x27;t (or at least shouldn&#x27;t) be used to justify that you deserve extra leverage so that you&#x27;d have lower capital costs; the capital requirements are there to  protect others from your risk-taking.')
