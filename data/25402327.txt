But some publishers pull out rather than reveal them to the western markets too.<p>As for an analysis I remember reading this for Genshin Impact which implied the rates are averaged and don&#x27;t add up to what the publisher says. Anecdotally players say they often hit their mark at around 70 rolls so it&#x27;s suspected the rates increase over time (and maybe not linearly). The 90th roll is guaranteed and taken into account for the published rates 1.6% rate to get a 5-star reward on a given roll. If all this is true then together this would mean early rolls in a set of 90 are largely dead and you&#x27;re paying to reach the higher chances.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Genshin_Impact&#x2F;comments&#x2F;ja7c0b&#x2F;gacha_rates_listed_in_details_are_wrongmisleading&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Genshin_Impact&#x2F;comments&#x2F;ja7c0b&#x2F;gach...</a><p>Note: this is fairly old, I stopped playing so it could be outdated.
