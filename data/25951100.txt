Most of what goes on on WSB dances right next to that boundary, so much so that people like you and the OP seem to have forgotten it exists.  The comment above is crowing about &quot;signal boosting&quot;, which is absolutely not the kind of thing you would say about purely neutral information.<p>Obviously WSB posters haven&#x27;t been prosecuted in the past.  But the reason for that is that WSB activity hasn&#x27;t so far been responsible for large-scale distortions in the market.  Clearly that&#x27;s no longer true.')
