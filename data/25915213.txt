During WWII, IBM produced a lot of bombsights and rifles, strangely enough.<p>One interesting thing about the Depression is that IBM weathered it better than most companies because it rented equipment rather than selling it. Companies weren&#x27;t doing any new investment, but they mostly kept renting the IBM equipment they had. Plus, IBM was selling millions of punch cards per day.')
