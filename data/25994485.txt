When he ran out of money he was willing to mug old ladies to come up with the cash for more. If heroin were instead legal... why wouldn&#x27;t he just steal directly from the legal distribution source now that the threat of violence is no longer there?<p>That seems like more of a net positive IMO. Theft of institutions must be less deadly&#x2F;detrimental than the alternative. Even if people were to steal <i>more</i> from (say) Walmart than rob grandmas, it&#x27;d still be positive.<p>&gt;And a net increase in usage will cause some % increase in DWI rates, overdose rates, health care impact, etc.<p>This might not be the case because of increase purity&#x2F;social and institutional support because of destigmatization&#x2F;re-invested profits taken from taxing the product.')
