Training a neural network is literally nothing but the network&#x27;s model being updated one batch of training examples at a time. You can stop, restart, extend or change the data at any point in the process. There&#x27;s whole fields of transfer learning and online learning which extend that to updating a trained model with new data.<p>edit: Also in a way reinforcement learning where the model controls the future data it sees and updates itself on.')
