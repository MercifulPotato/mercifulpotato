In all honesty, Reality got off easy, after the Snowden and Manning&#x2F;Assange sagas it beceome clear the US has will not hesitation to chase people to the ends of the World, and in apply what the UN has stated to be torture in Assange&#x27;s case, and outright inhumane pressure in Manning&#x27;s case that has forced her to attempt suicide. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if many of these leaks don&#x27;t eventually end up with trips to a rendition camp under the guise of &#x27;national security&#x27; the way some of the most jingoistic in Washington speak and vote and this goes for both R&#x2F;D parties.<p>I honestly want to see Laura on a massive platform like Joe Roan so she can go in depth on OPSEC and INFOSEC for the common non tech user told from her very relevant position and elaborate on the many misgivings from the Intercept--it&#x27;s very telling that Glenn, Laura and Edward have all departed from it and there seems to be a common theme here.<p>I&#x27;d also like to hear what Laura has to say about Jacob Applebaum&#x27;s departure from the TOR Community for so long now, she touched on her relationship with him in her last documentary about Assange. I really miss Jacob&#x27;s State of the Onion speeches at the CCC and him being a general thorn in in the side of most Nation states security apparatuses. Something never really felt right about his rape accusations, as they tried to get Julian on similar charges in Sweden with nearly no evidence and just a massive media campaign, but succeed in making Jacob a pariah as he is no where to be seen--even when his close friend and possible mentor Assange was wasting away in jail.')
