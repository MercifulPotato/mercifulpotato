(open source, decentralized, privacy oriented etc.) I might of course be exaggerating a bit here, keep that in mind.<p>- Element and Matrix are growing but still not equipped to fight back at large against this, so it is unlikely to create too much negative press<p>- If Google starts to catch too much critique for this decision they can put it back and always blame $error<p>I believe Element will be back soon, the problem I see here is that it will be framed as an &quot;honest mistake&quot; and then become forgotten until they pull another stunt like this.<p>Even if these removals are temporary, they can still hurt growth.
