Call it $12&#x2F;month, because you&#x27;ll want to setup two accounts:<p>* The admin-user.<p>* The daily&#x2F;real-user.<p>In my case I have my real account &quot;steve@steve..&quot;, and &quot;admin@steve&quot; which is the gsuite administrator.  I only login to make changes to the domain setup, never to send&#x2F;receive email.<p>It&#x27;s annoying to have to pay for that second user, but I feel happier with the privilege separation in place.')
