Item(by='loceng', descendants=None, kids=[25766330], score=None, time=1610561576, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25763758, text='A downvote is behavioural nudge with no guidance - it&#x27;s a nudge in a pitch black cavern that you&#x27;re somehow expecting them to navigate and learn from? &quot;Oh, maybe I said something bad or wrong or they didn&#x27;t understand me or ??????&quot; Even worse maybe emotionally they&#x27;ll start thinking people hate them or something is wrong with them without knowing why, and then they&#x27;ll disengage. Is that really how we want to treat people?<p>Likewise, how do you determine if it&#x27;s a quality downvote - as in, is the downvoter actually interpreting what&#x27;s being said adequately? Maybe the downvoter is biased somehow, e.g. suppressing anti-CPP commentary seems to be more common even when they are thoughtful and critical responses. If the downvoter is forced to actually reply with a qualitative response, then the OP would be able to either realize they didn&#x27;t explain clearly enough - or we&#x27;d all be able to determine the would-be downvoter isn&#x27;t reasonable or with incongruent logic.<p>I&#x27;d say the cost of spending time to think through enough to respond with writing is a fair, good cost, in order to participate vs. getting a quick hit of dopamine with a downvote click; everyone grows then and refines themselves and help to refine others.')
