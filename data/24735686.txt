I am an absolutely terrible when it comes to skateboarding and ice skating, and they&#x27;re also not big aspirations of mine. I&#x27;ve opted to pursue other things that I enjoy, like problem solving, system administration and cost analysis!<p>That being said, when I was a kid I didn&#x27;t have a skateboard. I had an old DOS box to play on. Then Windows 95, then 98, ME&#x2F;2000, XP etc. I&#x27;m fully aware of how good I am at what I do, but I genuinely have no objective&#x2F;provable reason to believe that I&#x27;m of a &quot;class&quot; of person that&#x27;s good with computer touching. I&#x27;d assume that I would need a machine that displays alternate realities in order to establish what &quot;class&quot; of person I should be assigned to, objectively.<p>The idea of &quot;classism&quot; inherently (to most) relies heavily on stratification. There are (for a made-up example) The Indispensable, The Useful and The Expendable.  In your definition of classism  as applied to software engineering, are people born into these classes? If not, what process creates objective classification? How is it standardized and applied?<p>And further, how does a group of software engineers, that doesn&#x27;t include you, choosing to unionize hurt your prospects or experience?')
