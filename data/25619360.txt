Much of today&#x27;s status quo exists precisely due to that liberty, so for the status quo to turn around and deny it to others they dislike is extremely hypocritical.<p>As a concrete example, let&#x27;s stick with YEC.  There are very successful scientists with credentials from top institutions that believe the evidence supports the YEC position.  They argue for YEC not for religious reasons, but for honest intellectual reasons.  It is worth giving such arguments a fair hearing, regardless of whether they are flawed.')
