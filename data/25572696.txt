The paper talks about more specialized training sets so it&#x27;s quite possible something like onigiri could end up under-represented (though I suspect it&#x27;s common enough in manga that it would be something more obscure). Naturally the &quot;jelly donut&quot; part would only slip in if they used untrustworthy data like forum posts or 4kids localizations, but that&#x27;s exactly the kind of data that Google Translate and similar algos scrape from the internet for training.')
