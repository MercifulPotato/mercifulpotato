His M.O. has been so consistent.<p>When the cables came out, it was what I expected from the organization I read about years prior on slashdot back in highschool - back when it was new and only a curiously to the tech press.  I remember very well listening to NPR in 2010 and struggling to understand why NPR struggled to understand who this Assange guy was. And how they took the scraps of his personal history they managed to find, and were so bewildered that they weren&#x27;t able to create a more romantic story about his motivations than the plainly expressed ones.<p>When the emails came out in 2016, I had smartened up to the way the media could only ever understand him as a power broker, and wasn&#x27;t surprised by the confused coverage.  But wikileaks actions were still within my expectations from the organization I read about on slashdot back in highschool.<p>I like to think I know better than to be suckered in by an official line, but the quality of unprovable explanations can be judged by their predictive accuracy.<p>Wired Magazine, 2016: Want to Know Julian Assange&#x27;s Endgame?

Even if Team Edward has worse policy than Team Jacob, that doesn&#x27;t mean choosing not to expose Team Jacobs&#x27;s flaws when the opportunity presents itself.')
