When you give a company gross profit (price higher than what it took them to get you the product) you are <i>literally</i> paying for them to spend some of that on getting their next customer.<p>Anyone who is paying a ransom is <i>literally</i> paying a ransomer to do that to someone else.  Not in a metaphorical sense.  You are literally transferring the ransomer money which the ransomer will literally use to finance the next ransom.  They will pay out of pocket for the person doing the next ransom to go and do it.  It should be totally illegal to finance this.')
