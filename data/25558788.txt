Really useful to see how the experience went, and what worked as a speaker. I find the same issue with no audience feedback, but it is good to hear that you&#x27;ve already received mail directly. I guess the loss of in-person spontaneous questions is one downside - was there any &quot;live Q&amp;A&quot; time via chat questions? I&#x27;ve seen that work quite well sometimes in past in-person CCCs, and imagine that it could work if people were watching synchronously.<p>Perhaps in the world of async, we now need to focus more on the Q&amp;A via email in slow-time, but therefore be able to have more meaningful interactions.<p>All in all sounds like a pretty good experience, and interesting to see their approach to Jitsi in making this work! thanks')
