What I meant was it&#x27;s unclear to me why it&#x27;s a good thing that corporations look out for their best interests instead of the best interests of society&#x2F;customers&#x2F;people.<p>If an individual does it, their known for being selfish, egotistical, maybe even narcissistic. There&#x27;s a natural push back from society to this behavior.<p>Corporations should be disincentivized from doing this as well. Society would benefit as a whole. The fact that people expect selfishness out of corporations and see it as a good thing is concerning.')
