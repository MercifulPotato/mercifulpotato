Even my preferred resources such as seriouseats or America&#x27;s Test Kitchen.<p>A teaspoon of vodka in the dough makes the pie crust flakier? At the very least it seems like one could say &quot;we cooked 5 pies each way, and a blind taste test found that 4&#x2F;5 tasters rated the batter with vodka as flakier&quot;.<p>That seems like the minimum amount of effort to call something scientific. It doesn&#x27;t require any specialized equipment or training. We&#x27;re not even getting into detailed methodology, or significance testing. Yet still, even the best sources I see make completely opaque claims such as &quot;we found reverse creaming makes the cake more dense and buttery, while traditional creaming results in a traditional fluffy cake&quot;.')
