The Senate polling in particular was bad this year.<p>Sara Gideon was favored to win the Maine race in the polling, because there hadn&#x27;t been a single poll showing Collins in the lead since July. She lost her race by 9 points.<p>It&#x27;s also strange to see the region makes a difference in the poll error. The polls in Minnesota were basically spot-on, but in Wisconsin (demographically very similar), the polling average was Biden +8, with one ABC news poll showing him +17, the kind of outlier result you&#x27;d expect with a +8 average. He&#x27;s gonna win there by ~1 percentage point.<p>There&#x27;s something wrong with how a lot of these pollsters determine samples, or how they judge someone&#x27;s likeliness to vote.')
