The odds of me dying in a car crash is lower than the average as a result of precautions I take to be safe. For me 1,000 deaths&#x2F;year <i>might</i> be a improvement (or it might not) but to say it&#x27;s a 30x+ improvement just by looking at the total number of deaths is just false.<p>The focus on potential glitches is because it&#x27;s something the driver has no control over. Is there a similar measure for number of completely accidental deaths (eg. someone swerving into your car or t-boning you at an intersection)?<p>Finally, until we have better laws that ensure companies are liable for their mistakes, companies won&#x27;t take all the precautions to ensure vehicles are safer than a good driver (not just the average driver). Does anyone remember the Ford Pinto explosion issues because the company decided to use a cheaper gas tank and figured they would save more than they would pay from settling the few lawsuits that might emerge as a result?')
