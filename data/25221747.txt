This idea is encouraged by the fact that ‘match’ branches can’t continue across multiple lines: although technically ‘match’ could mutate some complicated global state, the intended use case is a constant or a simple function - easy to understand, and relatively gotcha-free. Gotchas should go in a ‘switch’ statement.<p>Seasoned PHP devs aren’t going to accidentally use the brand-new ‘match’ statement without careful study, and I don’t think the inconsistency is too big of a deal for newer devs: the overall principle is that ‘match’ is safer than ‘switch’ but less powerful.')
