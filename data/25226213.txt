One which gave the musician more creative freedom of expression. A large part of what is considered mainstream North Indian classical music today is Khayal.<p>P.S:\nAmir Khusrao&#x27;s role in development of Qawwali, Tarana and other forms of Islamic Sufi music making sounds plausible. Anything beyond that is venturing into speculation.')
