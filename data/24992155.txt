If they try to use it to develop a product that interferes with licensed RF and that they plan to sell, they won&#x27;t get very far.<p>Similarly, some person in their garage won&#x27;t be stopped from violating this law as long as they&#x27;re careful about it. This law stops facial recognition products from being mass deployed and being made ubiquitous, though.<p>The same logic applies to someone cooking meth in their garage. They&#x27;ll probably get away with it if they&#x27;re careful, but good luck turning that into a legitimate business.')
