(I know you&#x27;re saying that, but I want to confirm.) It&#x27;s one in a line of several journals that have undergone similar reconstitution. Compare for instance to AlCo (Algebraic Combinatorics) which was formed primarily by the previous board of Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics, in 2017. AlCo has been successful, as far as I can tell (maybe I&#x27;m biased). There is some overlap of boards with this new journal Combinatorial Theory, so they know how to do it by now.<p>The consonance in the naming conventions alone gives a signal to the community what&#x27;s up.')
