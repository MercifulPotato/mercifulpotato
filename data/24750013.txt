If this is to be banned in Google&#x27;s case it should fairly extend to all sites operating on that model, which would essentially demolish the entire search engine infrastructure as it has been understood to exist since the days of AltaVista.<p>Targeting Chrome by contrast seems a <i>lot</i> more reasonable. It also enjoys a clear precedent viz. IE.')
