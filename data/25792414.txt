Not so much - `change-directory` and `list-directory` would probably be better. It&#x27;s the same with regular expressions `^[A-Z0-9]{0, 3}$` is perfectly readable once you&#x27;re reasonably familiar with the syntax.<p>It&#x27;s also true in other fields such as mathematics or music - the notation is quite good once you&#x27;re proficient in it.')
