In fact, Gnome in general has always been rough for me on bluetooth; the bluetooth connection app still needs some love, but I&#x27;ve noticed it being more reliable with recent versions. I particularly noticed this when I was running a newer version of Gnome on Fedora 31, but then running an older version of Gnome on Ubuntu 18.04 (for work). The older version of Gnome&#x27;s bluetooth was considerably worse.<p>For about the past year, however, I&#x27;ve been using Fedora &#x2F; KDE on desktop and OpenSUSE &#x2F; KDE on my laptop. This has been by far the best bluetooth experience I&#x27;ve had on Linux. Thank you to whoever wrote the KDE bluetooth code, because it is consistent and reliable.<p>So I don&#x27;t think it is totally a kernel problem. YMMV depending on what cards&#x2F;adapters you&#x27;re using (I&#x27;m using a mix of Intel and some USB sticks from a fly-by-night vendor).')
