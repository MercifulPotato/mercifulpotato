CEO disappears from the company, that marginal benefit is lost and the costs disappear.<p>2. Where a &quot;Low Level&quot; employee disappears.<p>I don&#x27;t know the answer for which one is worse for the firm, but World 2 sort of actually happened when Corona started. &quot;low level&quot; employees with very little costs started to disappear and it turns out the value of these employees was much more than their costs - as shown by how badly the economy tanked from these people not being able to work. That is, it seems the value these employees bring is quite high compared to their costs... yet for some reason they are paid much less. And from just a general economic sense, that seems not okay to pay too little.')
