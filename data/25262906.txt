Deposits can get delayed&#x2F;withheld, and withdraws can be moved up unexpectedly. Leaving zero days between a deposit and a withdraw is just asking for trouble.<p>I&#x27;m not sure you understood the example that GP gave; there was no mention of withdrawals. The idea was that you have $20 in your account, you buy something for $10, then later buy something else for $10, and then later buy something for $20, and the bank reverses the order of applying the transaction and says that you made two purchases after your account was empty, so you get charged two overdraft fees.')
