They are still good, and I let my hearing aids be programmed so that the lowest gain setting was the most comfortable, with two directional microphone configurations for different circumstances. But still, the extra noise coming with the additional gain is wearing me out. Perhaps it&#x27;s some another condition I&#x27;m not aware of. I am quite sensitive to noise <i>despite</i> being half deaf with ~50% loss.')
