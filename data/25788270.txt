The encounter occurs slowly enough for the crew to get a long look at the Reaver ship as it passes. The closing speed seemed to be about 100mph at best.<p>Whereas with the Apollo mission to the moon, the capsule was traveling 25,000 mph, or ten times the speed of a bullet. And even then it took three days to get to the moon.<p>And even 25k mph is slow if we&#x27;re talking about crossing actual interplanetary distances.')
