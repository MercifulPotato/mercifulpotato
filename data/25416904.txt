This has the unwanted side effect of <i>also</i> being able to still continue accelerating quickly past the target zone (&lt;= 85mph). Some street legal cars have governors because of how exceptional their acceleration is.<p>The acceleration in cars are designed around pretty much one extra horrible edge case: accelerating up to freeway speeds, up an onramp that is entirely too steep (yet legally designed), from a standstill (ie, gridlock conditions), <i>while also</i> carrying max cargo capacity. Cars <i>must</i> be able to do this to be considered safe by any meaningful definition.<p>Also, there are no laws <i>against</i> going fast. The laws are purely against the law on public roads, as per the posted limit; there are many private racetracks that are completely legal. Not all countries even have limits comparable to America&#x27;s, so being able to safely go 100+ mph is worth it if you were to, say, drive on the German Autobahn.')
