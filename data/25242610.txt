Learned it from my grandmother while I was growing up, but she did the super old-school wax seals. A game changer for me are Tattler reusable lids: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tattlerproducts.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tattlerproducts.com</a><p>I bought some big bags of both the &quot;regular&quot; and wide-mouth lids&#x2F;gaskets several years ago and have never worried about the metal lids that come with the jars when they&#x27;re new (got them saved in a separate box &quot;just in case&quot; and also use them occasionally when I&#x27;m gifting canned goods).  There is a slight difference in the way to tighten the lids during processing, but the occasional &quot;didn&#x27;t seal&quot; is usually my fault, and we just eat the contents of that jar sooner rather than putting it on the shelf.<p>If you do any volume, or don&#x27;t want to get stuck without metal lids, I cannot recommend the Tattler lids enough!  Be sure to get the originals; there are some knock-off brands which are not made with the BPA-free plastic, don&#x27;t last as long, etc.')
