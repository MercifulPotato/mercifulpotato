This is incredibly ergonomic compared to existing monetization schemes.<p>This also separates the hosting of the content from the payment system for the content.  Example:  If you&#x27;re a podcast creator on patreon, patreon can ban you, and you just have to hope that your fans will follow you to your new platform.  With MintGate&#x27;s solution, it seems like you could change your content hosting at any time without impacting your token holders.  This makes creator&#x27;s relationship with their fans more resilient to censorship, and reduces the creator&#x27;s reliance on any single platform.<p>Holding a creator&#x27;s personal token v.s. paying them a monthly subscription on patreon is an interesting proposition.  It changes the relationship between fan and creator from &#x27;customer&#x27; to &#x27;investor&#x27; and gives token-holding fans a monetary incentive to promote the creator.<p>I think we&#x27;re still in the early days of seeing how indie creators can make money on the internet, and projects like this are leading the charge towards new monetization schemes - very cool!')
