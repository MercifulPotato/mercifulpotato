Misinterpreted your comment.<p>Can you elaborate on how Tor is a threat to the open internet? That&#x27;s a non-obvious statement to me. I&#x27;m aware that it&#x27;s compromisable via controlling exit nodes (NSA, various nations) but that&#x27;s not really the threat profile for the average person. Are there any other reasons?<p>Because despite its flaws, afaik TOR is an attempt to make the internet _more_ open to those who are being surveiled.<p>What am I missing?')
