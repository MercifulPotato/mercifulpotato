Covid is barely worse than the average flu for healthy young people, yet even those with no contact with at-risk groups must still disrupt their lives for seemingly no reason. IMO this is unfair to them and also prevents herd immunity from developing. Furthermore outbreaks are happening in places even with more strict protocols. Overall I think the damage from the reaction to the pandemic is worse than the disease itself.')
