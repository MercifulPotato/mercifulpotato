Depending on the laws on the state, she needs to find a way to authenticate her worries about his cyber-stalking. If she has enough to validate the concern (not just speculation; won’t need much), she should seek a civil protection order precluding him from use of all electronics. The judge probably won’t do that for a number of reasons, but considering the DV cycle and pattern here, there will be a secondary civil protection order issued which will specifically consider the danger imposed by the cyber stalking. At that point if there’s even a whiff of improper use, he’s going back to jail.<p>Of course this will depend on the state. I can’t give general advice in the US.')
