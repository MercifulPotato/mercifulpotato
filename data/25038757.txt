In languages like Agda or Idris, you can prove things exist by compiling the program, not running it. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it takes a million years to run, so long as you have a guarantee it won&#x27;t loop forever.<p>For ordinary programs that we run because we want the result, if you want a guarantee that it will finish then you need something like real-time programming, because it&#x27;s not enough to know that it terminates. You want to know that it will meet a deadline.')
