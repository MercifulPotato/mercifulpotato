Open loop systems will <i>always</i> miss steps, and most hobbyist aimed gear is open loop because it is super cheap.<p>FWIW I designed and built CNC equipment for a living.<p>As for the Tormach machines, they use 3 phase, not 2 phase steppers, and use current sensing on the stepper outputs to give them a feedback mechanism, and an encoder to close the loop completely these drivers and stepper motors are better than the ordinary two phase kind that you find in regular hobbyist aimed gear.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.damencnc.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;nema-34-closed-loop-stepper-system-4-0nm&#x2F;a1243" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.damencnc.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;nema-34-closed-loop-stepper-syst...</a><p>They are properly classed as a hybrid servo system rather than just a stepper on account of that feedback mechanism.')
