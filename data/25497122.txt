If a company wants to screw you, they likely already have the language in the option grant agreement to do so. It is not reasonable to pretend like you can fight hungry investors and executives who want to screw over tiny employees.<p>I&#x27;ve never taken options seriously. That isn&#x27;t to say that I haven&#x27;t taken them, I just see them as worthless, and I am fully supportive of negotiating all other aspects of employment as if they are worthless. There are too many horror stories to see options as anything but. Congratulations, greedy leaders, you are ruining the very mechanism that keeps an employee engaged and &quot;bought in&quot; to the company&#x27;s success!')
