I cannot get students interested in lexing\nand parsing, because they hear all day how exciting deep learning and\nbig data are. Lexing and parsing are  deemed solved in the 1960s, a\nsentiment I disagree with. In addition, classical theoretical\ncomputer science (e.g. automata and languages) is rarely taught with\nenough depths in many universities, so students lack the technical\nbackground. You can cover this in a compilers course (I do) but it\ntakes time, and the students see it as an ordeal.  Compilers as a\nsubject is <i>not</i> helped by the most widely recommended book being the <i>Dragon Book</i> which is dated and way\ntoo long to be useful for beginners. Compare the <i>Dragon Book</i> with\nthe material available as introduction to machine learning ... Many of the existing textbooks are also not covering modern compilation themes, in particular JITs, and compilation for multi-core and GPUs. I&#x27;d say there\nis currently no good undergraduate textbook on compilers. I could probably, with a lot of work, cobble something reasonable together from my lecture notes, but I don&#x27;t believe in <i>books</i>, I&#x27;d like to do a good MOOC, but building suitable software infrastructure requires more work than I am currently willing to put in.<p>My department tried hard to remove the compilers course, as &quot;no\nlonger relevant&quot;, and &quot;too hard&quot;. I threatened to resign if it was not\nkept as a mandatory course. For now this worked.')
