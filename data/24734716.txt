For such an old (and one would think, stuck in their old ways) institution, they keep up quite well technologically and consumer relations wise. Their website and apps are updated thoughtfully and regularly. The very few times I have had to deal with customer service, it couldn&#x27;t have gotten smoother or quicker. One time, it was my fault (infringed SEC trade settlement rules and got put on probation required by law) and a knowledgeable man called to very politely explain what had happened and to clear up any confusion going forward. You&#x27;re not going to get that from Robinhood.')
