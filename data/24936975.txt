On the scale of geologic time and the level of inherent randomness and epistemic uncertainty, predicting things within a few decades is amazing.<p>&gt; I rarely see climate change projections tempered by probability.<p>Honestly, if this is true, then it seems like the only thing you have ever read about climate are popular press articles. The error bars on every single prediction are on every graph or study that climate scientists produce. Mean sensitivity itself still has large error bars, but beyond that the amount of emissions we produce is inherently unpredictable. It is not possible for a climate scientist to say with any certainty how much coal we are going to be burning in 40 years.')
