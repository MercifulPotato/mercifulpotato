With a finger you can follow the code as it runs and know exactly what is going on and when exactly.</i><p>This has not been true in many years.  C appears to be such a language, but optimizing compilers have learned how to find and optimize undefined behavior in code that most C programmers don&#x27;t realize is unsafe.  As a result there can be a considerable gap between the code as clearly intended, and the code that will be generated.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.regehr.org&#x2F;archives&#x2F;213" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.regehr.org&#x2F;archives&#x2F;213</a> for more on this.  Including real world examples of things like validation checks being elided by the compiler, leading to real-world vulnerabilities in programs which clearly have checks to avoid exactly those vulnerabilities.')
