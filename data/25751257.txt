You&#x27;re being extremely disingenuous, and using terms like &quot;guilt&quot; and &quot;crime&quot; which do not apply to the current situation. The current situation is: Twitter as a corporate entity believes that Trump&#x27;s tweets directly led to the events at the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the election and directly incited violence. The vast majority of Americans agree, but Jack Dorsey&#x27;s opinion is the only one that matters.<p>By your logic a mafia don who says &quot;it&#x27;d be a lot better if [enemy boss] wasn&#x27;t alive&quot; resulting in an assassination didn&#x27;t incite violence, and the responsibility should lie with the &quot;people who did the crime&quot; because people make their own decisions. This is a colossally stupid take.<p>Your post is full of straw man arguments and I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re being intentionally disingenuous, or just have a very poor understanding of political events in general and Twitter&#x27;s ability to moderate their own platform.
