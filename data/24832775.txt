Item(by='woodruffw', descendants=None, kids=[24832884, 24832961], score=None, time=1603154338, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24832696, text='&gt; To say good isn&#x27;t subjective is to say there is some part of the universe at some fundamental level that defines good.<p>Not especially: there is an abundance of immanent ethical theories that define the Good (or Right) in terms of basic things in our grasp: the number of people who go hungry, the number of people who die of preventable diseases, &amp;c. These don&#x27;t require some spooky or transcendental universal fundamental: they&#x27;re about seeing people suffer <i>in ways that we can measure</i>, seeing that many patterns of suffering are <i>generalizable</i>, and taking actions to countermand that.<p>(There are also plenty of ethical systems that are both immanent and non-consequentialist. I follow one of them. But it&#x27;s maybe beyond the point of the original comment to explain them.)')
