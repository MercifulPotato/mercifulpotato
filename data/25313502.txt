Anything which didn&#x27;t integrate would be marked red by default, effectively &quot;breaking the build&quot;. By doing that consistently before merging you&#x27;d have many fewer opportunities to land things which break other branches.<p>The &quot;integration&quot; part of CI appears to have largely been lost - CI pipelines now tend to just build branch tips and confirm tests run. Performing the proposed merge and checking that combination still runs is still pretty rare IME.')
