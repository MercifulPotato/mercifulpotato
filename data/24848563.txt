It that may be because I do have a background in computational dynamics, but I&#x27;m no expert in either field.<p>If I understood correctly, what the article is trying to explain is that the software&#x2F;hardware architecture optimized for neural net processing is equally suited for many-body simulation of quantum equations. The architecture allows to broadcast the intermediate results among all individual particle simulators, which is untractable in other architectures: Monte-Carlo simulations lose accuracy and coupled cluster simulations can only solve stable lattice configurations.<p>Personally, I like the observation they made that the fitness constraint for their training is determined by physics: whichever solution yields the lowest total-system energy wins.')
