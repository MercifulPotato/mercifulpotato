I could imagine him also using the dice as a jumping off point for compositional suggestion but disobeying the dice for a round if he wanted to follow an idea in a different direction. Because he could hear the composition as it was being generated, I can just as easily imagine him deviating from the dice-scheme if he saw an opportunity for something interesting. Who knows.<p>A similar thing happens in Schoenberg&#x27;s twelve-tone system. For melodic writing, the composer is locked into using the next pitch in their tone-row, but the art of it comes in them exercising their ability to repeat that prescribed pitch or change it&#x27;s register however they see fit to get the best possible musical effect.<p>It&#x27;s quasi-algorithmic in that the pitch sequence is prescribed, but the writer is allowed to get creative with the other musical dimensions to make it as compelling as possible.<p>That said, it generally doesn&#x27;t make for very enjoyable listening. At least, it&#x27;s an acquired taste. 20th century classical music got pretty far up it&#x27;s ass with the &quot;games for games-sake&quot;.')
