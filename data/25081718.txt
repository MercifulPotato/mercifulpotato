It&#x27;s a defence. You&#x27;re still infringing copyright, but this is an infringement that they cannot punish. Importantly, law makers see fair use as a restriction of the rights of the copyright holder, not as a right granted to users of that IP.<p>People have always known that DMCA interferes with these defences. See for example this from 2001: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repository.uchastings.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?article=1567&amp;context=hastings_comm_ent_law_journal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;repository.uchastings.edu&#x2F;cgi&#x2F;viewcontent.cgi?articl...</a>')
