A big problem is information asymmetry.  Consumers must be experts on every product they buy while producers only have to be experts on the products they sell.  Some consumers do not prioritize being experts on food and so undervalue nutritional&#x2F;dietary properties and overvalue appearance, flavor, and convenience which require less expertise.  A related effect is the paradox of choice making it difficult to judge the best value from a selection of seemingly identical products and this may also play a role in poor nutritional choices.<p>The problem is excaserbated by mass advertising that promises foods are healthy or meet certain dietary guidelines while eliding the fact that the products should be eaten sparingly and not as a staple, or by directly advertising that a cheap food is shiny and yummy.')
