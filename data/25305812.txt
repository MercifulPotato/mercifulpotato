There&#x27;s a kind of beautiful freedom about it, too.<p>A number of people (myself included) seek to align work and passion all in one, which is fine, except it&#x27;s certainly not the only (or, indeed, even <i>close</i> to &quot;best&quot;) way to live and work. I&#x27;ve been lucky because my passion is in a field that now actually has applications in both theory and practice, after 50-or-so years of lying in relative academic obscurity.<p>The point is: if you care primarily about things that <i>aren&#x27;t</i> your work (and this is true for literally 99.9% of people in the world, and is probably much healthier than the alternative) then FAANG is phenomenal in every possible way. The perks, compensation, and freedom to do pretty much anything are incredible. Quant (which nets around the same, if not slightly more profit) certainly does not fall in this category, due to its insane hours, and most other jobs with sane hours and good work-life balance don&#x27;t pay nearly (read: really even close to) as much, or aren&#x27;t as secure, or have anywhere close to the perks. It really is about the best gig you can get, if you can swing it.<p>On the other hand, for the weird, obsessive .1% of people (e.g., me) who would be happy to work all day in their mother&#x27;s basement so long as it&#x27;s interesting work, then FAANG (or, at least, many teams within it) can feel almost beside the point. Which is also fine!<p>I guess the point is that it all depends on what you want out of work and out of, well, not-work!')
