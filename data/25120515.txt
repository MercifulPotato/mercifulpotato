As long as the vaccine is effective enough to slow the spread of the virus it will save lives -- the more people we vaccinate, the fewer potential spreaders there will be, and that should help us protect people who have not been vaccinated yet.<p>Today, we would probably be better off with an A grade vaccine that is easier to store and ship across the country than we would be with an A+ vaccine that is more picky about storage temperature.<p>Of course, we can probably have both vaccines at the same time once the manufacturing capacity spins up.')
