Item(by='StavrosK', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607101155, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25304581, text='&gt; and have been thinking of how the share the notes out publicly, while still keeping the informal, private, low-friction note taking.<p>That&#x27;s exactly what I want to do too. Increasing the friction makes people less likely to share, so I want the community to feel very casual, so people aren&#x27;t afraid to post even single-sentence brain dumps.<p>&gt; For those who share their notes&#x2F;kb publicly, whats your strategy?<p>You mean those who have already shared them? The advantage of a centralized site would be improved searchability, so you&#x27;d help more people.<p>Since I don&#x27;t really aim to make money from this, it&#x27;d be open source, sort of like a Neocities vibe.<p>Would you like to email me at hi@stavros.io if you&#x27;re interested (and whoever else reads this comment, please feel free). If I do end up making this I&#x27;ll make it invite-only so I don&#x27;t have to worry about spam (at least at first), and this would be a nice way to have a few early testers.')
