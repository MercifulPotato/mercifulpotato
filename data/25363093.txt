I believe the media harmed its own cause (and also my cause) which is getting Trump out of office (which is to say I think--though I can&#x27;t <i>prove</i>--Biden could have won more easily if the media simply let Trump discredit himself), but it also harmed our collective political health, and I hope Karma lays low those responsible.<p><i>However, that doesn&#x27;t excuse conspiratorialism</i>. We still have a responsibility to find reliable trust channels and to sift through evidence, and when it becomes apparent that we&#x27;re incorrect (e.g., when evidence is presented that weakens or invalidates our claims), we ought to admit our error and critically evaluate our sources who led us astray.<p>To put a fine point on it, the media should have to answer for its sins, but those sins don&#x27;t license the rest of us to behave badly.')
