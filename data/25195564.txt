I have never experienced more than one migraine in a 24-hr period.<p>For treatment, I&#x27;ve always used a combination of early identification (sudden awareness of own body temperature gradients) plus quick caffeine and marijuana supplementation.<p>When I was younger, the aura was short and the primary issue was the debilitating, long-lasting headache.<p>For the last 5 years or so, I only get the headache-part maybe 25% of time.  In exchange, the auras have become instantly debilitating, nauseating, and almost incapacitating.  My vision goes from normal, to mangled, to &quot;I can see-but-not-comprehend&quot; what I&#x27;m looking at.  After some time, the aura lightshow slowly moves offscreen and then I feel fine again.')
