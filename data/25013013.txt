A couple of replacement bus lines started up prior to the pandemic, but I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ve survived.<p>I never had a problem with the depots, though they definitely weren&#x27;t classy places. If you knew the towns along the route, it was usually easy to walk to a better restaurant, store, etc.<p>I continued to ride the bus long after my economic situation improved, because I actually enjoyed it. I met a lot of interesting characters taking the bus. I&#x27;ve heard a lot of &quot;Greyhound stories,&quot; smoked a bit of weed with strangers, and found myself in some unexpectedly cool situations. Always an adventure. Air travel is so sterile in comparison.')
