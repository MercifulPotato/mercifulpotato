They&#x27;re free to avoid me if they want.<p>Many things we selfishly do endanger others. Ever driven a car?<p>But honestly, in my gut, I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m endangering people. I&#x27;m doing the thing that I think will most likely make me healthy, and that will most likely result in best outcomes for others, too.<p>I may have some bias here because the only 2 times I&#x27;ve gotten the flu as an adult are the two times I got the the flu shot, like you&#x27;re supposed to do. So maybe that&#x27;s just coincidence, but my operating theory now is, no more flu shots until I get the flu again. If I do, then I&#x27;ll reconsider.')
