However, it still sounds complicated. Granted it&#x27;s open source. But I feel that the fundamental reason why we are in this social media conundrum is the on-cloud platform-wide message feed manipulation. What if matrix and other social media were just channels that didn&#x27;t manipulate the feed in anyway (no filtering or sorting)? What if the feed manipulation was per-user? On client-side like a personal rspamd, or as per-user on server profiles like sieve? There could be several competing filters, all of which could be adjusted by user to varying degree. Some filters could be learning ones and some could be for special cases (like child filters). There would be no single point of attack, and therefore harder to do social engineering by manipulating the feeds.')
