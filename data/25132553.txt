In all the betting markets I participate in, the fees are charged on <i>profit</i> - so it isn’t related to how much of my money I bet, it’s just related to profit.  Win a 3:1 bet with 10% fees?  You’re losing 10% of $3 if you bet $1 (ie: 30c).  Win a 30:1 bet with 10% fees? You’re losing 10% of $30 if you bet $1 (ie: $3).  I’m still trying to work out how the fees are “higher” for high probability bets - they’re always the same rate.')
