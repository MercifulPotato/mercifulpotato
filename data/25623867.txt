Parenthesis might mitigate this somewhat to the human eye (at the cost of some clutter and compromised immediacy), but unlike a LISP the Python interpreter doesn’t really understand what an expression is.<p>By contrast, I never have these kinds of semantic issues in whitespace significant languages like F# - I make mistakes that I might make less often in Scheme, but the compiler usually sets me straight since it realizes a branch isn’t returning a value, etc.<p>In my view parentheses versus whitespace is really a judgment call based on how your eyes read the source code. The crucial thing is having something like s-expressions.')
