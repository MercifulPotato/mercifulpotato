(Though it took years.) Hit me up if you want to just TALK with me on the off chance that it is moderately useful to you to some degree.<p>I don&#x27;t like giving advice per se. I don&#x27;t like saying &quot;You should do X!&quot; But I&#x27;m happy to talk about some of our experiences and some of what I think about neurological stuff (and possibly life, the universe and everything because help may end up being in some seemingly unrelated topic).')
