He took the idea of selling shoes and somehow morphed it into spreading happiness including touring it to markets that Zapos didn&#x27;t operate in (like NZ where I met him), which obviously had limited direct benefit to his company. Only really visionary people would be able to pull off something like that and connect those dots.<p>I also met someone who grew up with him, he said that Tony was always looking at everything with an entrepreneurial eye. Anything and everything would be a business, even bringing in a grill to sell burgers to his class mates at lunch.<p>Big loss of a visionary.')
