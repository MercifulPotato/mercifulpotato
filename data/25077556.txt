Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=[25078157], score=None, time=1605229418, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25076240, text='The post discusses nuclear winter briefly, but I&#x27;ll cover that in more detail here:<p>The theory of nuclear winter is predicated on a specific chain of events:<p>* The mass use of nuclear weapons causes massive firestorms in large cities.<p>* These firestorms pump soot in unprecedented amounts into the stratosphere.<p>* The stratospheric soot causes massive, persistent climatic cooling.<p>If any of these claims fail to be true, then the entire thesis breaks down. And there is some reason to doubt all of them, especially the hyperbolic versions of the hypothesis (e.g., &quot;going like 100 years without being able to grow food&quot;).<p>Let me tackle just the last one. Volcanic eruptions are the most effective stratospheric soot pumps we know of: the eruptive columns of even smallish eruptions (like the 2018 summit explosions of Kilauea) routinely reach the stratosphere. In modern history, the most powerful eruption would be the 1815 eruption of Tambora, which is calculated to have erupted about 41 kmÂ³ of tephra. The result was a well-documented global cooling (the Year Without a Summer). Now ask yourself how likely it is for even <i>several</i> simultaneous nuclear explosions to inject that into the stratosphere. Now also consider just how much impact the eruption had in history: it doesn&#x27;t merit a mention in many history books--a far, far cry from &quot;100 years without being able to grow food&quot;.')
