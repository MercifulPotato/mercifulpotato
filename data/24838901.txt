Item(by='freedomben', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603209479, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24833947, text='You aren&#x27;t wrong, but I do think it&#x27;s worth pointing out that Red Hat writes a metric ton of FOSS code also which it contributes upstream (or the upstream is entirely RH owned&#x2F;controlled).<p>For example, Red Hat is the number two contributor to Kubernetes (behind Google).  Red Hat extends K8s with OpenShift which makes K8s a PaaS, and that is also open source and freely available as OKD[1].  RH doesn&#x27;t get paid directly for that work but funds it with support contracts (which in turn enable landing more support contracts).<p>I know that doesn&#x27;t contradict what you said, I just don&#x27;t want to leave a reader with the impression that RH just tacks on a support contract and makes some money.  RH does a huge amount of dev on it too.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.okd.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.okd.io&#x2F;</a>')
