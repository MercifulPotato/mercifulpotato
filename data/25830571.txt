Extremists don&#x27;t advertise like normal people, extremists advertise in echo chambers. If a terrorist tries to create converts in Walmart it takes 10 minutes until the police shows up.<p>When extremists plan attacks they go to the central spots, when extremists recruit and build up followers they go to the places that aren&#x27;t under surveillance. The latter is relevant for social media.<p>A decentralised internet would be a dream for extremist recruitment. It&#x27;s equivalent to having an ungovernable community of millions sitting in your country.')
