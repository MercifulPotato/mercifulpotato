Not a lot but it is risk free. Isn’t the idea that banks make the money flow by circulating it around a good one? A saver who doesn’t need it now can park it in a bank and when their time to retire comes they get their actualized money plus some profit. And since the interest compounds, with a nice rate it could be both safe and profitable.<p>I agree that this is not feasible now but that is only becaus of the low interest. That dynamic would change if the interest is dialed up.')
