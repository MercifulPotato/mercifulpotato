Instead, you can reason equationally, which unlocks some nice benefits regarding refactoring, reasoning about correctness and concurrency, testing (e.g., property based testing), debugging and reproducibility, etc.<p>(2) Functional programming is based on well-behaved mathematical foundations and so is more stable than the other programming paradigms. Object-oriented programming is a constantly moving target because it doesn&#x27;t have a principled formal foundation (despite many attempts to establish one on an ex post facto basis).')
