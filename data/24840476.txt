Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603216933, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24838461, text='&gt; I find Wikipedia is increasingly relying upon meta-circular authority.<p>It also relies upon authority <i>by fiat</i>:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Biden%E2%80%93Ukraine_conspiracy_theory" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Biden%E2%80%93Ukraine_conspira...</a><p>&gt; The Bidenâ€“Ukraine conspiracy theory is a series of false allegations which assert that 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden engaged in corrupt activities while the former was Vice President of the United States and the latter worked for the Ukrainian gas company Burisma. The conspiracy theory centers around the allegation that then-Vice President Biden withheld loan guarantees to pressure Ukraine into firing a prosecutor so as to prevent a corruption investigation into Burisma and to protect his son. Although Biden did withhold government aid to pressure Ukraine into removing the prosecutor, this was the official foreign policy of the United States government as it believed the prosecutor to be too lenient in investigating corruption; this position was also supported by American allies.  A New York Post article published in October 2020 brought renewed attention to the allegations; its veracity was strongly questioned elsewhere.<p>These statements are &quot;problematic&quot; in a number of ways, and the whole situation (of which this is just one example) is that most people seem to believe that what is recorded on Wikipedia is <i>necessarily</i> factual.  It&#x27;s bad enough that we have this same problem with the media, but at least some people realize that the media is biased.  Wikipedia on the other hand, is more of a &quot;record of history&quot; and is typically considered (despite &quot;official&quot; (unread) policies advising otherwise) to be an unbiased ~authoritative snapshot of the state of reality.<p>The fact of the matter is, the complete truth of what has occurred here <i>is unknown</i>, and it&#x27;s quite interesting from a psychological perspective how otherwise logical people are very uncomfortable with that truth.  &lt;NULL&gt; in a database column is accepted by the mind with no resistance - &lt;NULL&gt; in the real world is very often rejected <i>extremely strongly</i> by the very same mind.  It would be interesting to see what mankind might achieve if we were able to find a way to not turn our eyes (and minds) away from such phenomena when they manifest.')
