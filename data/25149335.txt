Whether a document or a GUI, behavior (how it works) and presentation (how it looks) are still separate concerns.<p>&gt; (Multiple styles)&#x27;s not a thing I&#x27;ve ever needed to worry about.<p>Yeah, others have though - both as consumers and as integrators. If you are okay with the idea of re-inventing wheels every time you want to have a different color, plenty of people are not.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not afraid of touching the HTML<p>It&#x27;s not a matter of being afraid to touch HTML. It&#x27;s a matter of not being <i>able</i> to! Whether in terms of ability (some marketing person that is putting together a wordpress or Shopify store and can only go with different artifacts provided to them) or from the nature of the source code (e.g, imagine you want to make a RSS&#x2F;Atom feed reader, embed a Tweet on your site with a custom styling or use an OSM tile editor), if you are not able to touch the code but you can select different styles, then it is fundamental that the data is separated from the style definition.<p>You might not think that this is important for you to do your job, but I think that is extremely short-sighted. What made the web as interesting as an application platform was the idea that the user agent could be extended. It is in our interests as users to keep the web open and able to be tinkered with, and the easier it is to separate the layers that people want to improve, the better.')
