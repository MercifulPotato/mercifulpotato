I&#x27;ve also dabbled in Java, and some other languages here and there for one-off work and side-work projects. I haven&#x27;t found anything to match C# &amp; .NET&#x27;s productivity. I gravitate towards strongly-typed languages which I know excludes a large swath of productive languages.<p>.NET Core is fantastic.  I recently bought an M1 Macbook Air (which I really hadn&#x27;t wanted to do but my Intel Macbook died and I wasn&#x27;t about to buy another Intel Mac given they are being phased out.)  There&#x27;s one issue in that debugging is broken at the moment, but it&#x27;s being addressed by Apple&#x2F;MS. Docker (M1 Preview) works great.<p>If you&#x27;ve never given .NET a shot because you weren&#x27;t&#x2F;aren&#x27;t a fan of Microsoft&#x2F;Windows - I recommend you give it try, you might be pleasantly surprised.')
