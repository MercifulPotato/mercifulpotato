To the right cell type, not immediately degraded, not accidentally integrated into a critical part of the genome, with a payload that is actually effective, etc.<p>The original gene therapies (early 2000s) were essentially RNA therapies (adenovirus).  And their unethical rush and subsequent failures caused a bit of a &#x27;gene therapy winter&#x27; [1]. We&#x27;ve since made enormous progress on both the ability to safely deliver genes, but also our ability to generate&#x2F;design new useful genes.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.labiotech.eu&#x2F;in-depth&#x2F;gene-therapy-history&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.labiotech.eu&#x2F;in-depth&#x2F;gene-therapy-history&#x2F;</a><p>&gt; In 1972, a paper titled ‘Gene therapy for human genetic disease?’ was published in Science by US scientists Theodore Friedmann and Richard Roblin, who outlined the immense potential of incorporating DNA sequences into patients’ cells for treating people with genetic disorders. However, they urged caution in the development of the technology, pointing out several key bottlenecks in scientific understanding that still needed to be addressed.')
