For an example, you can turn on unattended upgrades and not have to think much about it. The Debian maintainers work hard to keep the package repository stable.<p>Obviously, this is a biased opinion, since I use Debian. I have used Arch in the past, and had some mishaps where I broke things by installing updates. On Arch, you need to vet updates more carefully. I don&#x27;t want to have to be careful, because I want things to &quot;just work&quot; (as much as is possible in the realm of linux), so I use Debian.')
