I use Python, and it has spread to the rest of my team. However, I&#x27;ve tried to share tools that I&#x27;ve written in Python with the engineers. The problem is that I have to hand-hold them through the process of getting Python working on their computer at the level of detail of: Here is how you find the Python editor. Double click on it. Click on &quot;open.&quot; Find the Python file. Click on &quot;run.&quot; Click on &quot;Run Module.&quot; Or you can press F5. No, you have to be in the editor when you press F5. Now do you see that a window just appeared? Look at the entries and buttons in the window...<p>It&#x27;s really quite harrowing. Whereas if I put the same thing in an Excel file, they can bring it up themselves and I can quickly walk them through using it.<p>And I don&#x27;t think my UI&#x27;s are <i>all that bad.</i> But going from throwing together a simple Tkinter GUI, to something that is totally user proof and self installing is actually quite a lot of work.')
