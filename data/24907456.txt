But at a glance I think people don&#x27;t have a good sense for sales. I&#x27;ve seen maybe a dozen small-mid size company sales operations. Many sales cultures are pretty insane. Many hires don&#x27;t have much experience or just kind of end up in sales. Sales groups tend to be run extremely competitively against themselves, with high compensation that would likely surprise outsiders, especially for people with no paper credentials that say they&#x27;re skilled. It&#x27;s common to find yourself with a bunch of 20 year olds suddenly being told their gods gift and it&#x27;s not really that surprising when they go cocky with their power, not unlike tech bros in  similar situations.')
