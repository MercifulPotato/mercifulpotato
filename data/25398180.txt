It reminded me that &quot;vim&quot; is actually a word: &quot;with <i>vim</i> and vigor.&quot; It&#x27;s an appropriate word. Sort of like a retroactive nominal determinism, because it&#x27;s &quot;vi-improved&quot;, so the Mooleanaar probably didn&#x27;t name it because vim means energy, but, basically that&#x27;s what it means for a lot of programmers (including me). All these years, I never recalled the connection between the word and the name of the tool, until reading this story! Great!')
