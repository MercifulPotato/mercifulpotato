Unions used to be the best way to protect yourself from a bad employer...but the employer is the government (and to some extent the people).  It used to be that public sector workers made less in exchange for better benefits, but in the last few years the war was waged on the public to increase wages to that of &quot;private companies&quot;.  Now teachers in my state make more than an average BS degree and work 9 months of the year...along with better medical and retirement benefits.  They still claim they are underpaid and taxes just keep going up.')
