The large Macs are sort of uncommonly good at being used on the lap as a result of lacking the numpad and centering the keyboard&#x2F;trackpad.<p>My experience with trying to use my 15 inch Dell w&#x2F;numpad on my lap is a bit more miserable, because I either have to position it off-center and hanging off my right leg, or type with my <i>hands</i> off-center, which becomes really uncomfortable quickly.<p>I am tiny, though, so perhaps this would be less annoying to someone with bigger legs where it wouldn&#x27;t be teetering off constantly.')
