If you write your program in C, then you use a C compiler like gcc and most developers have not read the whole source code of gcc. Same is true for the C library you use, including standard library, you rely on others developers code you have never seen.<p>Therefore, I think the IKEA effect holds true in software development, because you rely on &quot;pre-assembled&quot; items, but I agree that you have much larger degree or freedom on how you build your application in e.g. C compared to a IKEA build. Maybe, this higher degree of freedom even strengthens the effect.')
