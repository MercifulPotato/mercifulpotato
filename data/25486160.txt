It’s work and play both.  You have to change their diapers.  You have to make sure they get their shots.  You have to feed them.  You also get to play with them.  It’s the most basic human activity- even if all manufacturing could be done by robots, we would still I think choose to raise our own children.  But it is a lot of work.  Only changing their diapers when the mood hits you is child abuse.  There is a sense of duty involved.<p>I do think that taking a hard look at the nuclear family is a good idea- I think you can make a good case that biologically a newborn baby is supposed to be cared for by more than one person, more like 5 or 6.  We are terribly cruel to young mothers, making them wake up once every hour all night long and then asking them to go back to their day jobs in addition after only a few days.  Having the experience of raising a few myself has so far taught me that parents especially of babies need to be surrounded by support, and that young children should be surrounded by other young children.  That points to community child raising.  But someone still has to change diapers.')
