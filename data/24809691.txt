But that&#x27;s just my impression.</i><p>Mine too. I still dislike the lack of Unicode strings by default, and the somewhat confusing tooling (initially) but outside of that I quite love the language. It has a huge potential and I can only hope that the arrival of Multicore to the upstream language will kick it forward and put it in the same league as Rust (although due to GC it can never be that fast I&#x27;d think; but who knows).')
