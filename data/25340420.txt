If the absolute dead-last system, a system that most would view as shameful and many an unconscionable deathtrap, is an order of magnitude better than best-practices in commercial software, it is probably not a good idea to learn from commercial software vendors or use any knowledge based on their inexperience as they can not even consistently make systems as unreliable as an unconscionable deathtrap, so there is no reason to believe they actually know how to make systems of higher reliability than that.')
