It&#x27;s partially successful (in that you effectively get &quot;a sticker&quot; that you can show-off if your supply chain doesn&#x27;t use children as miners). It would be nice if, AT LEAST, a similar half-measure could be done for &quot;forced labor&quot; (or whatever you want to call what they&#x27;re doing to the Uighurs).')
