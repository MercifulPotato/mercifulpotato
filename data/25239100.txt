Allan [2] (the best engineer I personally worked with so far, way better than anyone I encountered) wrote that system. The Java code quality shows itself after the first glance. Not mentioning the humbleness and openness in sharing his knowledge during early design meetings.<p>I am not sure what protocol is actually used now. But I would be surprised it&#x27;s different, given the protocol&#x27;s simplicity and performance.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.cornell.edu&#x2F;home&#x2F;rvr&#x2F;papers&#x2F;OSDI04.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.cornell.edu&#x2F;home&#x2F;rvr&#x2F;papers&#x2F;OSDI04.pdf</a> \n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;allan-vermeulen-58835b&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;allan-vermeulen-58835b&#x2F;</a>')
