We have a clean energy one. With abundant energy we could simply boil sea water to get drinkable water. The biggest problem of the various desalination methods are their energy cost, and this method to reprocess the brine is meant to offset it by extracting commercial value from the desalination residue. While it&#x27;s great to make desalination commercially viable, we also need to remember our energy needs will not drop.<p>I have the nagging feeling that the &quot;commercial&quot; part is what we&#x27;ll need to solve if our species is to survive long term. In some matters, whether its commercially viable should not be a concern.')
