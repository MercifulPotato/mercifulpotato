Unless a party has some overarching values that you care about (say you have a strong opinion about abortion either way, and your local candidate is trustworthy on that issue).<p>Instead you focus on individual candidates. Nationally (if you&#x27;re in the USA), guys like Rand Paul, or Ron Wyden have worked across the aisle on these issues.<p>You have to look at individual cases with care, even when they vote the same. Justin Amarsh appears to follow his conscience and voted against Trump in the impeachment and I respect him for his coherency. Romney also voted against Trump, but that was pure opportunism and the old very neo-connish GOP trying to wrestle control back from the &quot;pacifist&quot; wing of the GOP.<p>But what if both your candidates suck? Well, politics is local. Make sure you pay attention to the primary and refuse to back a neo-con&#x2F;lib, be they Pelosi, Romney or whatever.')
