I find the most useful strategy mixing in some &quot;non-mainstream&quot; sources like RT, CGTN, Telesur, PressTV, etc., that are coming at the news from the a totally different perspective.  Of course they have an angle, and sometimes it&#x27;s rather crudely presented, but if your spectrum is Fox News to MSNBC they&#x27;ve also got a lot of shared assumptions you might otherwise not think about.<p>But this gets back to my point; you could think about it from different axes like geopolitical ones, closeness to military&#x2F;intelligence sources, and so on, in addition to favored political party.  Even if we&#x27;re going pretty narrow, I think you might see pretty different ideas from, say, the American Conservative and the Daily Caller, even though they&#x27;re both conservative publications.')
