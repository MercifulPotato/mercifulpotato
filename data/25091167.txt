I&#x27;ve ran into problems, especially where you depend on a third-party library that&#x27;s difficult to build from source or isn&#x27;t very portable, like JavaFX, some popular Python scientific libraries that are optimized with C code, some GUI packages on Julia behaved weird. I&#x27;m happy that Apple is moving to ARM, because it will invigorate the consumer ARM space.')
