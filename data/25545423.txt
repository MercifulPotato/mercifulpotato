Every school seems to interpret the brief slightly differently.<p>Some school have Computer Science as a spin off of the mathematics department. You can graduate without writing a single line of code. As Knuth said in one of it&#x27;s memos: &quot;Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it.&quot;[0]<p>Others have Computer Science as a spinoff of EE (MIT and Berkley are like that) where CS is the skills you need once the circuits are reliable enough you don&#x27;t have to care too much for their implementation.<p>Lastly, I&#x27;ve seen &quot;Software Engineering&quot; courses at some places that are almost trade-school-esque discipline (beware of some masters degrees [1]) that&#x27;s basically what would have been called data processing or IT&#x2F;Information System.<p>Other places consider it double major in CS and Engineering where there&#x27;s dedicated courses on software design. As a rule of thumb, if the OS class is about mutex and semaphore you are at the right spot. If there&#x27;s group policy involved, look at transferring.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;staff.science.uva.nl&#x2F;~peter&#x2F;knuthnote.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;staff.science.uva.nl&#x2F;~peter&#x2F;knuthnote.pdf</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.alinelerner.com&#x2F;how-different-is-a-b-s-in-computer-science-from-a-m-s-in-computer-science-when-it-comes-to-recruiting&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.alinelerner.com&#x2F;how-different-is-a-b-s-in-compu...</a>')
