Phone in a tip to ARM and get those Apple scoundrels rounded up!<p>Or, you know, you&#x27;re some random guy on HN pretending that Apple, a $2T technology company and a founder of ARM, with the most liberal ARM licenses possible, just doesn&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s doing. Humorously, if I do a search for evidence that Apple can&#x27;t add extensions, I keep finding comments <i>by you</i>, on here, going back months, claiming this. No one else. What a weird hill to die on.<p>Tough to know which horse to back here.<p>Further, you seem to be misunderstanding ARM compliance. If Apple has 100% coverage of the ARM test suite, it is 100% in compliance despite having a <i>superset</i>. Having additional instructions -- you know, being an architectural licensee -- is completely irrelevant to the test suite. My car is road legal even if I have a leather cupholder and a disco ball hanging from the roof.<p>And the thing about the embedded processors is for low level subscribers, with a <i>built-in</i> mechanism for decoding the extension and delegating it to the custom block. e.g. stock cores, low license. Apple is using neither stock cores or a low license.')
