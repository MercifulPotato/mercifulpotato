I think of them as different contexts. What I see is that, at the moment, we&#x27;re designing, permitting, allowing, creating, constructing, &amp; securing only for one angle, only for the pure-consumerism mode, the mode where we assume the user is in &quot;don&#x27;t care&#x2F;don&#x27;t know&quot; mode.<p>This mode, however, is such a denigration to humanity. All the spirit of augmenting the human intellect, computing being servant to the human psyche, harnessed by human creativity... it&#x27;s a way-more-than-tacit admission of defeat, a brazen retreat. It just seems... unaccounted for. We don&#x27;t talk about this loss, this turning around. We trumpet security &amp; chalk up wins for helping each other, but there&#x27;s no mainstream dialogue that supports the deeply enriched angle, the immersive, expert computer user, the post-training-wheels life. Everything is centered around the dumb consumer, all of computing focused around a consumerized applicationized &quot;just work&quot; mentality.<p>I think we&#x27;ve been drinking poison.')
