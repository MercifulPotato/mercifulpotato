Developing on a laptop is often a requirement especially when dealing with touchpad&#x2F;touchscreen input and animations. Realistically one cannot do that over a remote desktop. It just adds too much latency. Plus most remote display clients suck at forwarding complex touch gestures. And when the sources include a copy of Chromium, one better get 32GB. For example memory usage during linking may hit at least 12GB.<p>Similarly developing mobile apps is more convenient on a laptop as one can interact with an emulator with proper touch input. But then ide and emulators take memory.<p>On the other hand developing a web-related code on a laptop locally can be even harmful, as opposite to using ssh or remote extension in vscode. Things are too fast locally and one may become aware of performance problems only after fixing those requires a big refactoring.')
