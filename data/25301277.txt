These things are a bit like stripping off a few nines from service availability vs shutting it down completely.<p>Preventing these imperfections is extremely important in a very high infectivity environment like a hospital&#x27;s Covid ward, but they don&#x27;t really change the masks&#x27; impact on the epidemiologics of supermarket trips.<p>A protection level that only shifts the average time to infection of a Covid ward&#x27;s staff from Monday to Thursday would be terrible, but the same level of protection added to otherwise unprotected supermarket goers can easily reduce the supermarkets&#x27; contribution to the R value from heavy to insignificant.<p>Yes, of you do not impeccably follow the procedures required by medical staff in high infectivity environments the small remaining risk of defense penetration will rise by a high factor, no, the remaining protection will still be much better than no mask.')
