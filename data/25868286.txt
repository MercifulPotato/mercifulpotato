If hosting is ever on the table, this has to be part of the plan from the beginning. For every customer that says &quot;your hosted solution won&#x27;t work for us, we&#x27;re thinking about deploying on AWS&quot; they have to be able to translate that into profit. This seems like a lose-lose for Elastic as they have effectively ceded all that away to this fork. The use of SSPL also seems like nonsense here that won&#x27;t result in them seeing a dime from Amazon.')
