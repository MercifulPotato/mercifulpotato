Nobody notices, and even if they do you will likely not get anything out of it. Do your job, but don&#x27;t kill yourself over it. Work-life balance is king.<p>Exactly this.  Unless your manager has a history of giving raises and&#x2F;or promotions to YOU for doing your JOB then do not assume, ever, that they will give you anything for overworking to chase a carrot on a stick.<p>That said if they have a history of recognizing and appreciating your work, and compensating you for extra effort, then by all means feel free to put some sweat into the work.  That&#x27;s a good relationship.<p>My rule of thumb whenever starting a new job is -  Work hard for the first year, but almost never overtime.  Do my job, and do it well, but don&#x27;t kill myself.  If manager recognizes the good work, and gives me a raise, I&#x27;ll talk to them about incentive based objectives, and that I&#x27;m willing to work over time if there&#x27;s a reward structure.  Or, that I&#x27;m happy to continue at my 9-5 pace if that&#x27;s working for them.  Point is - always wait for them to make the first move.  If they don&#x27;t, either accept the 9-5 work for the pay, or move on to another employer that does value incentive based (bonus) salaries.')
