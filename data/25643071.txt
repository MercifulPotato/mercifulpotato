I&#x27;m not arguing for the US, in its current state, to adopt the Taiwanese strategy. Once community spread is such high as it is now, another strategy is needed. And I&#x27;d say the current lockdown &amp; reopen has been proven inefficient in sufficiently many places now.<p>Michael Mina has a much different idea: Cheap mass testing at home, regularly, for the whole family. Even with less sensitive quick tests it should be possible to suppress ~50% of new transmissions this way, which could bring case numbers down to traceable levels in 1-2 months. The key would be cost and availability of these tests - that&#x27;s a problem that can be solved, as production is simple and is already currently costed at $1 a pop. From a regulatory standpoint it should be treated more like toothpaste and less like a medical good (i.e. certify the efficacy but don&#x27;t go overboard).<p>After all else has pretty much failed, all western governments are now just betting on the vaccine. This is a dangerous proposition - all you need is a resistant mutation and we&#x27;re back at square one. Plus, vaccination at current rate will take 1-2 years - I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a good place to be in both in health terms and economically. There needs to be a backup plan put in place, as well as lessons learned taken for the next pandemic.')
