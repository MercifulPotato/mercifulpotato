Item(by='SulphurCrested', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607644114, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25372973, text='Originally, an &quot;internet&quot; was a network which linked together other smaller networks, for example two university campuses which each had their own, incompatible, in-campus networking technologies. You might have University U1 running IBM and University U2 running Decnet. IP protocols had nothing to do with it.<p>From there, we got the later backformation &quot;intranet&quot; for a network within an organisation.<p>When the TCP&#x2F;IP suite became ubiquitous, some people concluded the distinction between &quot;the&quot; Internet, as defined by the root DNS servers, and &quot;the internet&quot; was superfluous, as there was essentially only one internet. There are no doubt internets running factories that are not &quot;the internet&quot; but for practical purposes the term is not ambiguous, as one would normally mention if such a network was disconnected.<p>The article is wrong in its definition of lower-case &quot;internet&quot; as an instance of any network running the IP stack.<p>For what it’s worth, the most recent Australian government style guide changed &quot;the Internet&quot; to &quot;the internet&quot;. (But it’s not actually published by the government, and this edition has been controversial for other reasons.) I might personally use the upper case version if I thought there might be some ambiguity in the context, which would be almost never.')
