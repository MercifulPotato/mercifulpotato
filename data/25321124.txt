Sure you make end up with 50% more code, but you could have anybody up and running reading and understanding the code within 3 days.<p>IBM have done studies of this and found that fancy code is not all that valuable. It ends up falling in disuse over time as people don&#x27;t get it. I have seen my fair share of C++ code which simply had to  be tossed because nobody at the company could understand what the previous whiz kid had written.')
