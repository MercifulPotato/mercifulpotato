Do you people realize that you are not the exclusive bearer of Truth, and that maybe, <i>just maybe</i> people that use Telegram <i></i>chose<i></i> to do so for a reason and are not poor clueless persons that need to be indoctrinated?<p>To be extra clear, my complaint is about whoever insists on spreading the falsehood that Signal is <i>objectively</i> better than anything else [and maybe also adds a bit of compassion on top (&quot;it&#x27;s a shame&quot;) for the rest of us unenlightened].<p>I would have no problem, and would actually be more inclined to switch to Signal, if you tried something a bit more modest and honest. Dunno, for example something along the lines of &quot;If you would like an alternative to Telegram that has E2E enabled by default and on all chats, you could maybe be interested in Signal!&quot;.\nBut what kind of discussion can we have if the argument is always &quot;Signal is so much better, it&#x27;s a shame that you people don&#x27;t realize it&quot; ?')
