One thing is that prices in the US often get advertised without VAT, while in Europe it&#x27;s included and once you factor that in many things are not that different. But in some product areas there is a huge discrepancy, and it&#x27;s often US-based companies who have very big differences between US and European pricing.<p>I often notice it when US people complain about some price for a European product and I then look up the prices in the US out of surprise, because the US-company competitor is the same price in Europe. It then shows that the US and European prices of the European product are the same, while the US-company product is a third or more cheaper in the US than Europe (I have recently seen this with bicycles and trainers). Not sure if there are some tax or duty type reasons for this?')
