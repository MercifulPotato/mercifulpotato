There&#x27;s no separation of concerns here, builds aren&#x27;t reproducible, it hijacks logging for its own setup, appears to allow RCE of php files on another host in the event it is compromised (does it make sense to store&#x2F;bundle php files in this container if it&#x27;s not meant to handle php?)...
