Can anyone point to real-life example of this happening?  Where competitors were driven out of business only to have the perpetrator &quot;jack up prices&quot;?  I&#x27;m not a believer that the market is perfect, but I have more faith in it than that.  From my view, it looks like most companies who attempt this strategy end up going out of business themselves.')
