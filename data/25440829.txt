Item(by='zrav', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608113120, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25434865, text='RAW naturally doesn&#x27;t make you a better photographer, but there are clearly benefits that can result in better looking pictures than what the in-camera JPEG conversion is capable of. Not only that, I even see one of RAWs promises fulfilled: That over time, RAW development programs will improve, resulting in better looking images developed from the same RAW. If I develop a RAW taken 15 years ago with a current development program and compare the result to what I got back then, this is clearly the case.')
