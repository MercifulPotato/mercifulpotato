I don&#x27;t think he would have committed suicide, but they really could and would have smeared him in the press and wrapped him up for years standing trial for one tiny infraction after another.<p>Did they ever figure out who turned on the lawful intercept capability on Greek phone switches to illegally wiretap Grook politicians?  (I think it was Greece, in the early-to-mid 2000s.)  Edit: it looks like the NSA[1], but I remember reading speculation that it was organized criminals.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;COINTELPRO" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;COINTELPRO</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Greek_wiretapping_case_2004%E2%80%9305" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Greek_wiretapping_case_2004%E2...</a>')
