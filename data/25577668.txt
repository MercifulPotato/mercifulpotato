Most of the internal walls, and even the dividing wall with my neighbours are drywall. The only brick walls are the front, back, divider with one neighbour and a wall that was formerly an exterior wall prior to an extension 50 years or so ago. The doors themselves are pretty solid but the doorframes and hinges would give way long before that mattered')
