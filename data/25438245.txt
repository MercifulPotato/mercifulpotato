It only occurred to me to look into it after I got past a point where the devs had previously advertised all the hacking opportunities and I realized my character might be underdeveloped there somehow.<p>Not that I&#x27;m complaining much. There&#x27;ve been tons of bugs and wonkiness for me, but I&#x27;ve been enjoying the heck out of the game anyway (wonkiness is par for the course in a AAA open-world game anyway). But it definitely has lots of room for polish. Given how above and beyond they went on TW3, I have no concerns it&#x27;ll receive it eventually (hopefully -after- a well-deserved Christmas break).')
