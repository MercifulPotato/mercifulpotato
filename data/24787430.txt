A few weekends ago I did my annual attempt and had a go at Elementary OS (live USB wouldn&#x27;t boot, gave up), MX Linux (couldn&#x27;t get sound, wouldn&#x27;t boot after installing nvidia drivers), Manjaro XFCE (kept locking up, requiring a power cycle) and Pop OS.<p>Pop fared best, but even then I had all kinds of showstopper problems with monitor power saving, resolution, crazy window repositioning, and some behaviour where the desktop workspace randomly becomes far larger than the monitor and sort of pans around. If I leave my computer for 10 mins then have to spend 20 mins fixing it when I come back, that is a deal breaker.<p>I persevered though... Tried playing a game, alt-tabbed out to do something else, machine rebooted. Tried to use their tiling window manager functionality, but it had all kinds of weird bugs making it virtually impossible to use for anything except simply switching focus (and even then, their theme does not visually distinguish between focused and unfocused windows, which is problematic!)<p>Anyway... rant over. Short version: I disagree with you. :)')
