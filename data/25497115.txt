Once we&#x27;re at the point where stacking 10 exposures works reliably even in challenging conditions (and we&#x27;re pretty nearly there with the latest phones) then many of the advantages of a larger sensor are moot.<p>As far as glass &quot;quality&quot; is concerned, smart phone manufacturers benefit hugely from economy of scale. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily assume that smart phone lenses are manufactured to lower quality standards just because you&#x27;re paying less for them.')
