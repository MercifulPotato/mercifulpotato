We&#x27;ve seen ammo dumps being ignited by drones carrying thermite loads. We&#x27;ve seen long-range drone attacks on oil processing facilities, getting through expensive anti-air defences simply by sacrificing many cheap drones. Etc.<p>The currently ongoing Azerbaijan-Armenia conflict in Arcah&#x2F;Nagorno-Karabah (in some aspects, a proxy &quot;test&quot; of Turkish tech vs Russian tech) is worth looking at, since drones&#x2F;UAVs are a key part of military activity there.')
