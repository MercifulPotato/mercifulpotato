Most compilers are not written in the C language (indeed, even the major C compilers are all written in C++ now!). Alternatively, most languages compile down into a bytecode language, or into native assembly, without converting into anything that is or looks like C in the process. Indeed, for languages targeting native assembly, C is an unwelcome intermediate step precisely because its semantics can be too constraining.')
