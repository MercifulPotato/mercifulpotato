I at any rate find that I don&#x27;t really have the mental capacity to simultaneously follow instructions and think too deeply about whether this instruction seems to make sense or not. I assume this is at the root of people doing dumb things because the GPS told them to.<p>If I didn&#x27;t have a GPS in an unfamiliar area, I&#x27;d have a map. And if it were a remote area, I&#x27;d have both in any case. Although when traveling in normal times I do tend to depend on having my phone or at least access to a computer, the further I get from my home area, the more I try to have backups--including paper-based ones. But I expect that is increasingly uncommon.')
