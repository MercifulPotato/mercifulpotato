At this point in the unhinged circus show that the US has become, I&#x27;m really looking forward to it just to watch the spectacle that will be the deep state meltdown and media tantrum (&#x27;one of his final actions as President will be to demonstrate just how lawless the Trump Administration was&#x27; - or something like that).<p>I&#x27;d put money on Assange having a very slim shot at a pardon and Snowden having zero shot (Trump ultimately leans toward being a big government, big national security type).<p>Snowden, Assange, Ulbricht, Manning, Kim Dotcom - all under the Obama &#x2F; Biden Administration, and now Biden is about to be President (the guy that took direct orders from Hollywood &amp; Co. to go after Kim Dotcom).
