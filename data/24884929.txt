A bad explanation would be some mumbling about taking down the 2, ... , f&#x27;(x) =-2x +4, so x=2, f&#x27;&#x27;(x)=-2, is negative, done.<p>Better: We know that at a maximum the slope of f has to be zero (otherwise we could go left or right to get larger), so let&#x27;s find such points first. We thus compute the derivative function as f&#x27;(x)=-2x+4 and find that it is zero if x=2. But that does not give an answer yet, because it could still be a min&#x2F;max or saddle point. .. draw a small picture of each. We thus compute the second derivative to see in which of these three cases we might be. f&#x27;(x)=-2 is negative so we locally look like a parabola opened downward, so this is indeed a maximum.')
