However what this describes is not moderation, it is filtering.  There needs to be some form of moderation.<p>Imagine a scenario in which a revenge porn image is posted to the site.  Is the victim&#x27;s primary recourse simply to block the image on their end?  That would leave them without any power to prevent the poster from sharing that image with anyone and everyone the victim knows.  The victim might not even be immediately aware of that harassment if they block the image.  Putting the burden on the end user to control what they see is not moderation.  There needs to be some way for that content to be removed from the system globally for moderation to be effective.')
