I went to my county&#x27;s covid page to sign up for the vaccine wait list. It could have been one page of about 10 questions and radio button (and other basic controls) and a submit button. But nope, it had 500k of god knows what javascript being downloaded for transitions and fancy buttons and 5 pages of really nice looking questions. All I wanted to do was register for a wait list! Imagine older people (who I&#x27;m all have surely filled out simple online forms) with older computers going through this stuff. Or someone who is blind. It&#x27;s ridiculous.')
