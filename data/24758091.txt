Because that was what my original comment was about.<p>In some ways yes, in some ways no. The best part about nuclear waste is it&#x27;s easy to detect, with a geiger counter and a dosimeter. That&#x27;s not true of environmental contaiminants. In some ways its safer, in some ways it&#x27;s not. It really depends how it&#x27;s handled. After all, we can agree, you shouldn&#x27;t be licking either. A few well placed geiger counters is all the alarm you need, but constant environmental testing and monitoring is needed when you&#x27;re managing things like cadmium waste.<p>&gt; So? It still needs to go somewhere.<p>The existing stash can stay where it is, the next 40 years can go into Yucca, which gives us 40 years to find new places to put it. Also, as I mentioned, fast breeders produce orders of magnitude less waste.<p>&gt; Except it&#x27;s already more than filled by existing waste. And except that&#x27;s at the current level of nuclear power usage which people here are saying should be massively expanded.<p>Which is something we can do with fast breeders, without compromising storage.<p>&gt; Wait, no: the state that actually contains it has not agreed:<p>We&#x27;re talking about technical feasibility not nimbyism.<p>&gt; That is not how you do risk assessment for a storage site for waste that will be hazardous for thousands of years, my dude.<p>Yes, it is. Have you read the risk assessment? It took years to complete, and if you are interested in anything other than a quick win on the internet in an inconsequential argument, I&#x27;d suggest looking at that instead of taking my word for it.')
