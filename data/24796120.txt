You may have had right and left leaning media outlets, but they were typically closer to centrist views.  This is more due to them having to maintain their reputation by checking facts than censorship, so the main thing that differed was their spin on a story.  That pretty much left word of mouth and fringe publications.  Fringe publications are just that, they had limited distribution.  Word of mouth was pretty much restricted to social circles.  Anything too far from reality (or people&#x27;s perceptions) quickly died off.<p>Online business models changed that.  Fringe publications are no longer fringe, at least not in the historic sense.  Word of mouth is no longer word of mouth, since people have access to publishing platforms.  Reputation is no longer a restraint, so fact checking is irrelevant.  Rather than settling on more centrist views, we tend to focus upon the extremes.  A lot of disagreeable stuff is being said at those extremes, which is why (I suspect) that a lot of the old-time free speech advocates have reevaluated their positions.<p>(And all of that is before considering how some people are actively manipulating what we are exposed to.)')
