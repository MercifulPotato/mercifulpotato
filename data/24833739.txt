I would counter the idea that homeschooling&#x2F;unschooling is like a religion by turning it around. The orthodoxy of public education in the US is a borderline cult. The institution is unassailable. Where I live levies are passed that raise taxes and the community has nothing to show for it. The union Is like the mob and once you are a “made man” it is nearly impossible to be fired. Administrators are paid more than senior engineers. People that work in this system absolutely abhor the idea of citizens having a choice over their own education. Returning tax money to the tax payer to fund their own education, even if it is a fraction of what the public school receives, is a source of vehement objection by the teachers union.')
