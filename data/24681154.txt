They had to go in and clean it out with equipment. You can see the large scale erosion on the hillsides. This was 100% caused by the fire.<p>But, it was a massive uncontrolled fire. A lower temperature controlled burn may (probably?) not have caused that. Also if it had not occurred on such steep slopes maybe erosion wouldn&#x27;t have been such a problem.')
