The real intent of those messages probably has more in common with Steve Jobs&#x27;s claim that FaceTime was going to be an open standard that any serious commitment to openness: all of the hype, none of the deliverables.<p>So considering all three of (1) the platform, where years of Kickstarter campaigns have failed to produce what was promised, (2) the history of Sciter itself, and (3) the author&#x27;s claims that it would be delivered approx. 2 months after funding (er...?), it seems very unwise to hitch any hopes to this campaign.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if these exact factors are what has led to the campaign&#x27;s poor reception.')
