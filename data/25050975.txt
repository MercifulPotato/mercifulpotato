If you include taxes, it&#x27;s closer to $8k and then you gotta get insurance (which is going to vary wildly by thousands based on where the home is located). If you&#x27;re unfortunate with taxes + insurance, your monthly payments could end up being as high as $9-10k&#x2F;month.<p>&gt; Not only that, but we&#x27;re talking about salaries for ONE SINGLE PERSON. Married in tech? We&#x27;re talking a $900k annual salary. Calling this lifestyle &quot;very economical&quot; is so insanely out of touch with how most people live their lives, it&#x27;s no wonder tech people are hated as completely out of touch.<p>Sure - if you can manage to get two 1%&#x27;er people together then you&#x27;ll be living the high life but that&#x27;s not something you should take as common place. Same with assuming that they&#x27;ll both be working for their entire life before 65. That&#x27;s like saying, &quot;Imagine if you were Mark Zuckerberg and then married Mark Zuckerberg!!! You&#x27;d be doubly rich!&quot;<p>Btw - if you&#x27;re at that income - you have to save at least 25% of your net income for retirement and hopefully you do that at a very early age (like 30-35, if you&#x27;re starting that savings rate at 45 then you&#x27;re fucked). Social security won&#x27;t even pay your property tax when you&#x27;re retired. So, if you expect to live anywhere near your current lifestyle in retirement... you have to save a lot more (percentage wise) than most Americans.<p>I&#x27;m not saying you&#x27;ll be poor but go look at what house you can get in a decent peninsula neighborhood for $1.5mil. You won&#x27;t be impressed. You&#x27;ll have a nice car and can afford some niceties but what you come home to will be a piece of shit compared to your income. e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zillow.com&#x2F;homedetails&#x2F;856-15th-Ave-Menlo-Park-CA-94025&#x2F;15568667_zpid&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zillow.com&#x2F;homedetails&#x2F;856-15th-Ave-Menlo-Park-C...</a>')
