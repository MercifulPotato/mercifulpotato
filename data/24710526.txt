A flat tax could have an arbitrarily high rate and be used to fund programs (e.g. UBI) that result in net transfers from the rich to the poor.<p>In practice what would likely happen, as happens today, is that people would make the case for tax exemptions for things like housing, medicine and education, arguing that they tax the poor, but then the exemptions in practice enrich landlords and drug companies and university athletics departments and lead to transfers <i>from</i> the poor because the portion of the exemption not going to the customer is also not going to fund the UBI.')
