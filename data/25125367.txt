JS is a great language for building UI, but it is much slower than JVM. Wasm can be fast but implies C++ or Rust.<p>&gt; The second is the DOM. It is a horrible collection of hacks that make simple things hard and hard things impossible. I have thought many times “if only was I drawing this control&#x2F;layout directly, I would’ve finished hours ago.”<p>&gt; That means there’s a very low ceiling, performance-wise and quality-wise, of what a web app can do. I believe we can, and should, do better.<p>&gt; Electron taught us two good things, though:<p>&gt; People crave for native apps. Nobody wants to work from the browser. People don’t care if apps don’t look native to the platform as long as they look good.<p>Regarding Electron, I think we &quot;should&quot; start to talking about more like &quot;Browser Apps for Desktop&quot; instead of just &quot;Desktop Apps&quot; which is broad term.')
