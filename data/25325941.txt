Item(by='jMyles', descendants=None, kids=[25326857, 25326306], score=None, time=1607282824, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25324823, text='&gt; Why would it be good to free currency from government regulation?<p>Obviously this is a huuuuge question, but it&#x27;s such a good one.<p>The simplest compact answer, at least to me (and it may in fact be an oversimplification) goes something like this:<p>* Nearly invariably (and with a decreasing number of exceptions as technology advances), states which have control over both sides of the economic equation (ie, monetary concerns as well as national finance) find themselves unable to resist devolving into empire, and a specific type of empire called a &quot;welfare-warfare&quot; state, where the money supply is carefully controlled in such a way as to produce just enough support (often through pseudoscientific &#x27;macro-economic&#x27; analysis and  &#x27;unemployment&#x27; prevention) to preclude revolution, while also projecting military power on poorer parts of the world in order to capture resources in a misguided effort to service the never-ending debt that accompanies the fiat money system.<p>In this view (and to be clear, it&#x27;s one I hold), states with these powers (a clear conflict of interest, IMO) will continue to plunder the earth and attempt to enslave its people indefinitely, and can only be practically stopped by the economic adjustment that comes from the introduction of a hard currency (which causes the cycle of debt service to become impossibly onerous, even for an empire state).<p>* For a less oversimplified version, I might recommend Ron Paul&#x27;s book &quot;End the Fed&quot;, which is an introduction to the history of hard-money economics and can be read in a day or two.<p>* For an even less oversimplified version, you&#x27;ll need to delve into the &quot;Chicago School&quot; and &#x2F; or &quot;Austrian School&quot; of economics.  Milton Friedman and Ludwig Von Mises are probably the best known scholars of each.')
