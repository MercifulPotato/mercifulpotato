Great, they take security seriously! Except for the fact that the only 2FA they offer, is via phone number or Authy (which also requires phone number and can be recovered via phone number).<p>Since most of the industry has caught on with the advice to avoid 2FA via SMS except SendGrid&#x2F;Twilio, I&#x27;m now looking for alternatives, as it seems they security teams might not be up to speed on the latest security information.<p>I send a low amount of transactional emails. Would prefer if the service is located in Europe and that I can send emails via encrypted transports and SMTP.<p>Any advice for services&#x2F;platforms to use? Your advice would be most welcome! Thanks')
