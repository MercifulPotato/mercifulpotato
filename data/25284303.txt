It&#x27;s like this random batch job that triggers when some conditions are satisfied and does its own thing without regard for anything else, sure. Not integrated with the auto-pilot, does not display anything in the panel.<p>We have plenty of aircraft (even though most are military) which are aerodynamically unstable, and require fly-by-wire software to even be flyable. We don&#x27;t think those are kludges. That&#x27;s not too far from what Boeing has to do.<p>It could have been either a fancier fly-by-wire software in the Airbus philosophy that wouldn&#x27;t let pilots exceed parameters(retrofitting it might have been a challenge, and possibly even more dangerous). Or it could be this non-elegant solution that behaves like an old-school stick pusher. Both could have worked.<p>The problem is that they did this while trusting a single sensor. And not informed anyone.')
