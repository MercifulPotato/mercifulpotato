Pretty much every industry and piece of critical infrastructure comes into play here. It won&#x27;t matter if western fabs can produce something &quot;good enough&quot; if every piece of technological infrastructure from the past 5 years was built with something better.<p>As for moves again at Taiwan, China hasn&#x27;t given up that prize. Brain drain would be moot if China simply prevented emigration. I view Hong Kong right now as China testing the waters for future actions of that sort.<p>Happily though I also view TSMC&#x27;s pending build of a fab in Arizona as exactly that sort of geographical diversification of industrial and human resources necessary. We just need more of it.')
