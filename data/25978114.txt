A friend of mine had told me about rnnoise, describing it as &quot;very good&quot; at removing noise, so I decided to test it. My initial testing started by me piping raw PCM from arecord through rnnoises denoiser demo into aplay. The results frankly shocked me. When not speaking, there was no noise (or sound) at all (this is due to rnnoises voice detection system, which essentially mutes the microphone when there&#x27;s no voice), and when I was talking, the sound of my keyboard was a lot quieter without it affecting my voice, this lead me to decide to develop alsa_rnnoise to have good real time noise cancellation.<p>alsa_rnnoise is a very simple ALSA filter plugin that runs its input through rnnoise before outputting it back to ALSA. It operates in real time, adds very little latency (the amount depends on what size frames ALSA delivers, but is nominally less than 10ms). After enabling it, any annoying background sounds were gone. My intended use cases for this were VoIP, screencasting and streaming, and, as far as I can tell, it works great for all three.')
