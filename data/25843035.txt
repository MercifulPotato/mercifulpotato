Only very well-run tech companies like Stripe [0] and others in its class understand this.<p>0: Stripe’s Patrick Collison correctly characterizes the issue of friction that plagues products that start out as B2D (business to developer) but grow into becoming a B2B:<p><i>“So many B2B companies end up with homepages for which the only CTAs are annoying variants of &quot;read case study&quot;, &quot;download whitepaper&quot;, and &quot;request a call&quot;. All stock photography; no product imagery.\nStripe&#x27;s growth thus far has been fueled by individual developers and founders signing up and growing with us to billions of revenue. As we scale, the &quot;impatient developer&quot; will remain the focus of our product development.\nOver time, however, we&#x27;ve been increasingly finding that large organizations (like Zoom&#x2F;Atlassian&#x2F;Maersk) want to adopt Stripe -- Stripe now has a lot of functionality that they can&#x27;t get elsewhere. So, we&#x27;re very eager to continue to grow this side of our business with Mike.“</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24067211" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24067211</a>')
