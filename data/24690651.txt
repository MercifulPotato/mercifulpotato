On the back end, state changes propagate electronically over old and hoary roads (FTP, as another poster mentioned). The businesses that operate these strange constructs are old and powerful, and jealous of their position of authority. And the modern information age has vastly increased their power, as never before has so much information been available for so many transactions! Money is action is state, so the banks know, modulo cash spending, what literally everyone in the world is doing.
