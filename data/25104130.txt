It is obvious that a right-wing institute that also advocates against climate change can&#x27;t be trusted to produce objective data, especially not in a propaganda lettet. If you want an unbiased opinion you need to look at the WHO, NHS, and similar institutions, which are all in agreement on the actual science and policy recommendations. Opinion pieces like that letter are simple propaganda.<p>And while the majority of the population will lockdown anyway, especially if they are presented with the actual data, not propaganda about how the disease is not that bad, there are enough fringe groups who refuse that a law and explicit enforcement are necessary.')
