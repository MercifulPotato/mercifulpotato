You don&#x27;t know how &quot;toxic&quot; people really are. Some of them are nice, but just put no time&#x2F;understanding into their internet communication. They write and forgot what they wrote a minute later.<p>A bit of a cop-out, IMHO. That&#x27;s also true of real-life interactions: most people you&#x27;ll talk to, you&#x27;ll forget about 5 minutes later. I honestly don&#x27;t remember if I said anything in particular to the corner store lady just yesterday, and I see her every other day. If I was a jerk to her, putting in thought or not, I was the asshole, final. Seriously, it&#x27;s not that hard not being an asshole, just... don&#x27;t be.<p>&gt; 2. If they really need to learn something, talking to them politely &quot;Thanks for the suggestion but...&quot;, &quot;Could you please...&quot; etc. will help over time. Not doing something in the fear of rewarding their behaviour is way too complex to understand.<p>Sure, treat people with respect. However, I&#x27;m not convinced it would be that guy&#x27;s responsibility not to hurt someone&#x27;s feelings, especially when that person was a jerk in the first place. I don&#x27;t think we owe respect to someone who was disrespectful. The whole point is that dealing with it is a chore; having to take the time to educate people on their own behavior doesn&#x27;t make it easier. I just think it shouldn&#x27;t be _expected_ of maintainers to have to deal with it at all: simply closing the issue or ignoring the request should be seen as a fine response to asshole behavior.')
