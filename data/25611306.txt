E.g. how schools are handled in most western nations (&quot;There are no infections in schools, the scientific papers which say otherwise have to vanish in some drawer&quot;).<p>A lot of pandemic response is about reducing contact. What surprised me about the people in my vicinity at the start of the pandemic was how many (otherwise intelligent) people where like: &quot;If a measure isn&#x27;t 100% scientifically sound or 100% effective than it ahouldn&#x27;t be rolled out&quot;. When I asked these people what they would do instead they didn&#x27;t have an answer. They all didn&#x27;t understand that the measures where about <i>reducing</i> contacts (as opposed to 100% preventing) and tried to do so while leaving some individual freedoms. That the resulting rulesets will have a ton of counterintuitive edge cases is pretty unsurprising: teatchers that are expected to work with each other in school aren&#x27;t allowed to meet outside of school etc.<p>I think rules are one thing, but the local mentality has a much stronger influence. If you e.g. observe how each of the nations in Europe is doing even when the rules are comparable, any person who knows the local mentalities isn&#x27;t surprised by which nations fare well and which don&#x27;t. Just like that it didn&#x27;t surprise me that asian nations like Taiwan or South Korea dealt well with the virus while a Trump lead US didn&#x27;t (and let&#x27;s face it, even a US lead by pandemic experts wouldn&#x27;t have fared well, due to local mentality).<p>Egoistic individualism is deadly in a pandemic. Doing as if everybody exists in isolation of each other (and therefore has to deal with problems themselves) is deadly in a pandemic. Not realizing we are part of society is deadly in a pandemic.')
