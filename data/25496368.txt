People don&#x27;t mourn more for parents who die in their 50&#x27;s than in their 80&#x27;s.  I mean, I guess I&#x27;m willing to believe that some deaths &quot;matter&quot; more than others as an abstract idea, but I&#x27;m always suspicious when people try to cite metrics like this.  It sounds more like an attempt to downplay inconvenient facts than a genuine concern for the optimization of human suffering.')
