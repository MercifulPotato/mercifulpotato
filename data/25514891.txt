I think there is probable evidence that these dogs are not good pets.  Whether it is adoption pages stating that there shouldn&#x27;t be any children, other dogs, or cats in the home.  Gofundme for mauled children. Confiscated dogs, etc. Theses are not family dogs.  They have been bred to fight and kill just like others have been bred to herd.')
