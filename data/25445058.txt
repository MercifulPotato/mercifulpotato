You always have to take into account human nature, economic activity, and most unfortunately: psychology. So all criticism about how bitcoin inherently being pointless, sounds like off-tune. I want good reasons to&#x2F;NOT-to buy in.<p>First-world country citizens kind of trust their governments to at least behave lawfully, or at least be eventually accountable. There are systems in place for transactions and accounting, and &quot;everyone&quot; has access.<p>The &quot;Value&quot; of bitcoin, coming from a struggling third-world country (Lebanon), is in the ability to be independent of a currency that is inflating quickly, being able to transact with the outside world (even if only in bulk) without being under the mercy of a failing financial system that is lurking around to take a share in every which way possible.<p>The energy consumption needs of bitcoin are an obvious drawback. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to brush away the whole thing for only that reason.<p>Disclosure: I own an embarrassingly small amount of bitcoin (~0.4BTC).')
