It attacks the idea of property, and it attacks the idea that in order for someone to have a roof over their head or have a meal ticket, they have to work for a boss, in order to buy things that people just like them somewhere else in the world had to make under the same conditions. It points to the way in which that&#x27;s unjust. And the reason that the world is organized that way, obviously, is for the profit of the people who own the stores and the factories. So you get to the heart of that property relation, and demonstrate that without police and without state oppression, we can have things for free.&quot;<p>&quot;Looting strikes at the heart of property, of whiteness and of the police. It gets to the very root of the way those three things are interconnected. And also it provides people with an imaginative sense of freedom and pleasure and helps them imagine a world that could be. And I think that&#x27;s a part of it that doesn&#x27;t really get talked about â€” that riots and looting are experienced as sort of joyous and liberatory.&quot;<p>&quot;But there&#x27;s also another factor, which is anti-Blackness and contempt for poor people who want to live a better life, which looting immediately provides. One thing about looting is it freaks people out. But in terms of potential crimes that people can commit against the state, it&#x27;s basically nonviolent. You&#x27;re mass shoplifting. Most stores are insured; it&#x27;s just hurting insurance companies on some level. It&#x27;s just money. It&#x27;s just property. It&#x27;s not actually hurting any people.&quot;')
