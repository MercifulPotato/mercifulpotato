Awful. Maven&#x27;s common directory structure is about the only positive it brought, and I still wince at &quot;src&#x2F;main&quot;. They should have flattened more. Also the pedantic &quot;coordinates&quot; or &quot;artifacts&quot;. These are jar names and versions, people, not some cyber virtual reality.<p>Maven, while it did push forward on pulling dependencies from repositories, didn&#x27;t separate the dependency download from the code build, so build reproducibility became dependent on the repository access&#x2F;status&#x2F;completeness.')
