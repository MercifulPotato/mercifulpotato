It&#x27;s true that consumers sometimes make choices between competitors, like deciding to go to one fast food chain or another. But oftentimes consumers make a choice about how much money to spend vs save. If a consumer has $500 in discretionary funds, the consumer can decide to buy a simple, no-frills, commoditized &quot;meets-my-needs&quot; product and save the $400 for later. Or the consumer can decide to spring for the ultra-deluxe $500 product and save nothing.<p>Discretionary income is far higher than most people realize. Nobody needs to buy soft drinks, new cars (i.e. instead of a used car), new clothes (instead of sewing up old ones), yet another new video game (instead of a library of millions of older titles that are still as entertaining as they were when they were first released), or a million other things that you see if you look at people&#x27;s financial decisions. People do so largely because of desire that has been aroused in them by marketers.')
