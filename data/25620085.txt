Most of the common symptoms for the illness are things smokers regularly deal with like a loss of taste and smell, congestion, coughing, and breathing difficulties. So unless things are pretty bad, being sick might seem better than getting hospitalized and going through withdrawal.<p>I hope whatever wide scale antibody test they do ask if the person smokes as well.')
