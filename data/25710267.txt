Twitter does not ban international terrorists from its ranks nor does it remove regular people who say awful things on Twitter.  Go for it, do a search for violent threats on twitter.  See if they have banned every account in Africa or the Middle East, or Asia, etc.  Even north America.<p>They may ban Luis CK for misogyny let&#x27;s say, but they sure as hell would not ban all the Bros who use misogynistic language.  Do you think we can&#x27;t find twitter handles of cartelists making terroristic threats in Mexico or other places?  Is that all gone now?')
