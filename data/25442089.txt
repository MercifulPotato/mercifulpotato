If all you have to do is state and solve some systems, you can typically do it in one or two lines of octave, while in python you need to import libraries and use a bizarre notation (either @ or .dot look very ugly in formulas).<p>Besides, the sparse linear solvers are much more performant in octave than in numpy.linalg (because the scipy developers are notorious anti-GPL fanatics and they refuse to use the state of the art free solvers due to stupid license reasons).<p>I for one use octave almost everyday, and I&#x27;m a bit annoyed when I have to turn something into python.')
