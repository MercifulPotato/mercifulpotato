Xecuter&#x27;s stuff has been subtly or not so subtly targeted squarely at piracy for many years now. They have also done things like try to detect &quot;piracy&quot; of their own software and brick consoles in response (with inevitable false positives), which is utterly against the spirit of any kind of legitimate console hacking&#x2F;homebrew.<p>I&#x27;ve been involved in the console hacking scene since the PS2 times and a major developer for one generation, and I won&#x27;t shed a single tear for these guys.<p>Legitimate console homebrew these days is pretty much all done in the open and not for profit now, usually via software exploits. Where hardware is necessary, which is rare, it is usually open hardware. The companies trying to do things for profit are pretty much all catering to the piracy crowd.')
