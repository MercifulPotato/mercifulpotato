Absolutely no one has done this for Facebook, throwing a few hundred into Robinhood, etc. It&#x27;s not worth it, and the terms change with such frequency that it would be outdated immediately.<p>I still have my binder from my closing.  Worked in the mortgage industry for a while in college.  If they truly had you read through every page with explanations it would have taken you multiple days to do your closing.  I think you&#x27;re misremembering.<p>What they likely did was went through page by page, giving you a summary of each page as they went, and gave you the option to read it in its entirety or just sign based on their summary.  You might have read through the first 4 pages before you realized you would be there for the aforementioned multiple days if you wanted to read through every line of every page.')
