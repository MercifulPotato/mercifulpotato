I&#x27;m just genuinely curious and in the dark. I&#x27;ve never been to the country and grew up in the West during the Cold War, so when I think of Russia I was indoctrinated to think of &quot;the bad guys&quot;.<p>The country is an enigma to meâ€”very good at math but from what I read a corrupt place with rule by power and not law. So yeah, I&#x27;m just genuinely asking, how are <i>they</i> the ones doing these things which make the world a better place, and why isn&#x27;t it us leading the charge in these 3 issues? Maybe it is just a coincidence that those 3 things align with their selfish interests, and their is no altruism involved? Or maybe there&#x27;s a group in Russia that loves the ideals of the USA, and is able to actually help implement those ideals from there, because if you tried to do those 3 things from here you would be thrown in prison due to some bad laws&#x2F;people here?')
