The obvious errors were 1) artificial scarcity - too small address space leading to a situation where direct connection&#x2F;communication between members is impeded by various NAT schemes; and 2) too naive attack-susceptible protocols allowing subversion of DNS, IP routing, email forging&#x2F;spam. If we ever start again, the system should solve at least these issues.<p>The bigger issue is the control over internet services that we are witnessing (deplatforming, censorship). Technological ideas can help to prevent those but I tend to think no matter the protocols chosen, it will be the powerful who have the most power to control the network. So better design it in a way that no single power can control it all.')
