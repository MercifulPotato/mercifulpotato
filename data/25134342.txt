Item(by='ww520', descendants=None, kids=[25134773], score=None, time=1605687772, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25132903, text='With their vast size carriers have hundreds of water-tight compartments and it&#x27;s very unlikely to sink a carrier even with multiple direct hits.<p>It&#x27;s a pretty hard problem to hit a carrier in the middle of the ocean.<p>1. It&#x27;s difficult to locate a carrier group in the vast ocean, even with the help of satellites.  The earth&#x27;s curvature make surface level radars ineffective.<p>2. A carrier is not a sitting target.  The carrier battle group is armed to the teeth to neutralize any threat from air, sea, and underwater within its defense perimeter.  Its AWACS can detect objects upto several hundreds miles away.<p>3. Ships getting close need to overcome the barrage of fire power from the CBG&#x27;s fighters, missiles, destroyers, and submarines.<p>4. Aircrafts getting close need to overcome the CBG&#x27;s air defense - fighters and destroyer&#x27;s AEGIS system.<p>5. Submarines are a realistic threat, but USN has lots of experience countering that.<p>6. Long range cruise missiles fired from outside of the defense perimeter could be a threat, but cruise missiles are slow and can be shot down.  Also see 1 for guiding the cruise missiles thousands miles away toward a moving carrier.<p>7. Hyper sonic cruise missiles are a bigger threat but they have much shorter range.  Their firing platforms would be destroyed trying to get close.<p>8. Ballistic missiles are the new threat but they have their own problems.  Target location (see 1).  Their terminal radar has a very short time window to locate and lock on the carrier after exiting the descent EM blackout.  It takes time to fly to the general area.  A 5000 miles&#x2F;hour missile would take half hour to travel 2500 miles.  Meanwhile the carrier is moving away, could be up to dozens of miles away.<p>U.S. have ballistic missile launching detection mechanism (radars and satellites) that can detect the missile at the moment of the launch.<p>The SM-3 test adds a new arsenal of defense against the ballistic missiles.  It&#x27;s certain that the laser based defense system probably is being tested or may be have already been deployed.<p>Edit: realistically drones will be a bigger problem for a CBG going forward.')
