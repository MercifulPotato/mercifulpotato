So I sourced some Model Ms (before it was pricey) and Apple Extended Keyboards. For the sake of my office mates, I ended up using external but oldschool Thinkpad keyboards for silence and office peace.<p>I had high hopes for an external Apple butterfly keyboard, since it basically fulfills the promise of mechanical keyboards in providing haptical and audible feedback, combined with a shorter key travel. Additionally it would have been socially accepted far more easily than anything mentioned above;)<p>Since that will not be happening anytime soon, I have to wait 10 years until the virtues of the butterfly mechanism will be rediscovered by a small group of enthusiasts and hackers. :P')
