Recently a prominent lawyer was assassinated in broad daylight, that has gotten me scared. other than that this place is actually safer for non combatants than rest of the subcontinent and i can say that with authority. the governments otoh are not safe for people.<p>from what i have observed and from facts, at least on the indian occupied side, india spend like millions to convince entire generations about a local hero who happened to be pro india.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zeenews.india.com&#x2F;india&#x2F;at-2-3-per-cent-turnout-srinagar-records-lowest-ever-voting-in-any-election-2147453.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;zeenews.india.com&#x2F;india&#x2F;at-2-3-per-cent-turnout-srin...</a><p>this was a couple years ago.<p>yeah so its not like people are not protesting, we just don&#x27;t see a point in the conventional protests. kashmir has been fighting foreign invaders for over 500 years so its kinda in the system, to oppose.<p>as a kashmiri, i see no alternative other than complete independence. there is no other way forward, will that take 20 years or 500. Doesn&#x27;t matter<p>personally i think all three of these nations have to let go of kashmir, not because of some altruistic reason but because of CPEC. india and pakistan &quot;need&quot; to pass through kashmir to access it. china cannot afford jeopardizing their project because of indo-pak squabbles. for them business is king and the sooner things settle down, the easier.<p>for us kashmiris, we could practically live off of port fees for all the goods passing through our borders so yeah, i am hopeful')
