Big tech has failed to lay out the foundational principles they will use to perform moderation and have deliberately kept everything pretty shaky. I suspect this is because the tech companies themselves face following problems.<p>1. Workplaces are increasingly progressive and does not respect the diversity of thought. Reasonable conservative and libertarian groups are on fringe in most large companies.<p>2. Leadership is increasingly immigrant driven who often do not understand full implication of their policies and decisions.<p>3. Company is trying to feed the same propaganda they feed to their employees to the rest of the world without realizing rest of the world is very very different.<p>4. Rest of the media, political parties etc. constantly crapping on big tech does not help either. (If you hate success in your country, that success eventually will move out or will be born outside your boundaries e.g. TikTok).<p>5. Big tech has failed miserably to highlight all the good they have been doing through their moderation policies. Toolbar malware is a thing of past, you don&#x27;t have to install Adobe Flash anymore anywhere and email spam in my gmail is zero. Big tech and their walled gardens have saved millions of hours and resources wasted on other rent seekers and instead diverted it to themselves while improving use experience for my grandmother and her brother.<p>Big tech needs to play the same games that Big pharma and Big oil have been playing. They need to align themselves with various political groups, provide explicit platforms and assistance to everyone from far left to far right and make everyone feel included. This is not going to be simple but they have to do it.')
