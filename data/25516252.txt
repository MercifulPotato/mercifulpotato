Within 20 years they had society on board with genocide.<p>I have great respect for German public media highlighting this and keeping it alive today. Especially at a time when in nearby eastern european countries the media infrastructure has been turned into a shameless propaganda machine which has been rewriting history with &#x27;cultural broadcasts&#x27;. Not to mention operations such as RT further east.<p>Publicly funded media is wonderful, don&#x27;t get me wrong. But when the conditions are right it can turn Orwellian pretty fast.')
