Early on a malloc-like allocator would use brk&#x2F;sbrk to get a chunk of &quot;raw&quot; memory, and manage this for the user providing access using malloc&#x2F;free. Nowadays the same &quot;raw&quot; memory can be obtained using an anonymous map. A raw pool, when unused, can be returned to the OS by unmapping it.<p>Using an anonymous map provides address space randomization by default (for the raw pool location), whereas brk&#x2F;sbrk extends a limit and because of this are predictable.')
