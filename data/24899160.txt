Data is distributed across nodes but the nodes don&#x27;t know <i>what</i> they have. An individual file isn&#x27;t necessarily entirely on one node, it could (and most likely is) distributed across many nodes. In order to retrieve data you need to know the key for that data. At that point you can start requesting the appropriate blocks from the network and reconstitute the file(s).')
