I have a NVIDIA 1060 card in my workstation for CUDA - every single time I put it in running state again, I have a realistic chance of completely borking my system.<p>In fact I had an AMD card installed after the first two incidents, simply to have at least a chance of having working video output when the NVIDIA driver once again doesn&#x27;t want to talk to the kernel.<p>That and the whole practical implications and idealistic differences of having an (mostly) open source driver vs. a (mostly) closed source driver (I think we can agree that the open source NVIDIA driver is out of the discussion).<p>Obviously you might run into problems if you try to run very recent hardware right after availability. Kernel driver development is not ideal for cutting edge hardware and some things might break and it might need some time for your distro to ship the newest kernel&#x2F;driver.')
