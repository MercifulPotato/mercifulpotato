The answer (=SQRT(PI()<i>EXP(1)&#x2F;2)) = 2.066366. Later terms of the (1&#x2F;1 + 1&#x2F;(1</i>3) + 1&#x2F;(1<i>3</i>5) + ...) term quickly become minute, s.t. this term = 1.410686. That means the fraction term must equal 0.65568. However, setting all cells in column A to 1, then setting B1 = 1&#x2F;(A2+sum($A1:A2)&#x2F;sum(A3+B3)) and dragging the formula in column B down n times produces a convergent result of 0.525135 in B1, whereas I would expect 0.65568. But this formula seems to correspond to Ramanujan&#x27;s fraction syntax of 1&#x2F;(1+2&#x2F;(1+(1+3&#x2F;(1+4&#x2F;(...))))). Interestingly, at high enough n, the n+1 term in column B does not seem to matter: if it is very big, then the nth term is very small, the (n-1) term is still big, (n-2) term is small etc and they converge with multiple divisions in the lower terms. So: what should the formula be in column B to get to the right number?')
