Item(by='tarboreus', descendants=None, kids=[25914856, 25905526], score=None, time=1611589270, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25899637, text='I&#x27;m low vision &#x2F; blind and the other day I sat down to try to make Factorio self-speaking. I wanted to be able to hover over items in the inventory and have the game speak what they were, as a start. Though I like the docs pretty well and I got as far as having the game read chat messages aloud (you can dump to a file and I wrote a little speech server to check the file for updates and read its contents if it changed on disc), the names and descriptions of items aren&#x27;t available to the API, which seems like a pretty basic oversight. I could likely have implemented a reading of structures clicked on in the game world, but not of items in the inventory.')
