A good gaming core is different than a good general purpose cpu.  And apple has many more fundamental problems re gaming than a lack of horsepower.<p>If apple going after server market?  I don&#x27;t think so.  Apple products may be efficient but they simply cost too much and I don&#x27;t see the apple premium going away.  A cpu with a mix of cores is also not as directly scalable.<p>I think apple is still going after that &quot;core&quot; apple user, the one that appears in all the commercials.  They work at a graphics design office in the village.  They have a phone&#x2F;tablet for email and a desktop PC for serious photoshop work.  That&#x27;s the target market: The desktop PC that needs to on occasion push through a few minutes of photoshop rendering, not gamers or others who will run these CPUs at full throttle for hours.  The cpu needs to be power-efficient (ie quiet) 95% of the time, but remain able to ramp up on occasion to complete a task.  Rather than solid power it has a mix of cores to address whatever is thrown at it as elegantly&#x2F;quietly as possible.')
