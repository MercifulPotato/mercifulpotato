You can&#x27;t tell the difference between 4k and 1080 at that size until you get closer than 7 feet, and if you&#x27;re the kind of person who lives in a place with enough room for a couch and a TV, you&#x27;re not putting only 6 feet between them. Either it&#x27;s a small room and your couch is up against one wall and the TV up against the other, or you have a large room, and the couch is <i>still</i> more than 6 feet away from the TV.<p>If you want a dumb TV, get a 50&quot; or even 55&quot; 1080p TV and save yourself hundreds of dollars that you can spend on literally anything else that&#x27;ll make your &quot;TV&quot; (but who are we kidding: netflix and youtube) watching more enjoyable. But a popcorn maker and 10lbs of popcorn. Get a reasonable sound bar. Get many nights of take-out for in-home movie dates with your SO. Hundreds of dollars go a long way.')
