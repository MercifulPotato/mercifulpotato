Item(by='gerash', descendants=None, kids=[24670568], score=None, time=1601710119, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24668582, text='I used smart watches (not apple watch) for a week and can&#x27;t get over recharging them every night and went straight back to my solar G-Shock.<p>Step counting is what my phone does too and I really don&#x27;t need too much accuracy for that. Glancing at notifications would be nice in a busy work environment between meetings but at home, it makes not much sense to me. The rest (hand washing reminder, breathing reminder, etc.) are all gimmicks IMO.<p>So I am yet to see the utility of smart watches in their current form. Smart glasses on the other hand have way more potential')
