People of univeristy age should be able to self-learn, and I see no difference to a video of a lecturer vs sitting in a hall.  As long as questions can be emailed to them.<p>Schools on the other hand...plenty of students are unable to learn on their own.  &quot;Self learning&quot; is a skill, that even at the ago of 40 I&#x27;m still trying to master.
