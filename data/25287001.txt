At least with solar, you own and control the power production yourself, and (in theory) there&#x27;s no hidden costs.<p>Meanwhile, I live in a country where on the one side they&#x27;re pushing for and subsidizing solar energy, but at the same side they&#x27;re forcing people to change their meters so that the energy companies can pay you less for power you feed back to the grid; with a &#x27;dumb&#x27; meter, it was an even exchange, meaning that you only paid for the power you did not produce yourself. With the new system, you (I think?) only get 25% of the amount you sell, compared to the amount you pay.')
