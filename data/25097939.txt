I&#x27;m struggling pretty hard. I miss people. I miss my sense of being <i>good</i> at the parts of work that involved people. I&#x27;m shit at working alone. I&#x27;m not productive like some are, and all my best assets were how I could support people around me and help them love what they were doing. All I have left of work are the parts that make me feel badly every day.<p>Fuck this pandemic.')
