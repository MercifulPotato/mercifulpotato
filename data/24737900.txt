Could they not have provided that service themselves from inside China and comply with the law only to the extent necessary?<p>Is there a law that requires them to offer iCloud at all if they want to sell their hardware there?<p>Is there a law that requires them to ban side-loading?<p>It seems to me that Apple is always doing a bit more than they are required to do under the law. They clearly want to stay in the good graces of those regimes, especially in China.<p>But I do agree that the problem in general is structural and not specific to Apple. I think there should be something akin to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act to limit what those corporations can do in other countries. There has to be a limit to their aiding and abetting human rights violations.')
