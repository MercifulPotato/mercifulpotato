Based on what HN moderators have said in posts to users misusing throwaway accounts to violate the HN guidelines, they are able to link throwaway accounts to primary accounts.  That necessarily implies if HN suffers a severe security breach, all throwaway accounts may be linkable to the main account which would reveal the email address on the main account, if present, and enable researching of the user&#x27;s identity based on posts on the main account.')
