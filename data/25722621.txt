Political affiliation is <i>totally</i> subjective. If someone believes in violent death for Blacks, Jews and gays, should a Holocaust memorial group be forced to accept them? If no, then you need someone deciding which groups do and don’t merit protection. And who is and isn’t <i>actually</i> a member of that group.<p>It’s not impossible. But it has unintended consequences. More than re-delineating the private company &#x2F; utility boundary. More than expanding antitrust enforcement.')
