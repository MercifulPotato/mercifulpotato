In no particular order:<p>- Disable GApps. Note that this can absolutely be done without root [1], as I&#x27;ve done so on my BlackBerry KeyOne and a previous LG G6. This has the additional benefit of a dramatically faster UI on nearly any device.<p>- Use F-Droid instead of the Google Play Store when possible. If you&#x27;ve disabled GApps like I have, the Aurora Store can be used to fill in the few apps your employer may require.<p>- Use web versions of apps when possible. mbasic.facebook.com or simply facebook.com is a reasonable alternative to the app, and won&#x27;t steal you contacts. The former even allows messages to be sent without the app :)<p>- Use a custom ROM. Note that this will require an unlocked bootloader and either a maintainer for your phone, or to build LineageOS for yourself.<p>- Minimize permissions you give apps. Don&#x27;t get thrown when some apps request Location when you don&#x27;t think they need though: Google has tied Location to Network Access, meaning you must grant Location Access for most apps to see Bluetooth &amp; WiFi networks (which could reasonably be used as a proxy for your location).<p>- Unless you need it, don&#x27;t leave Bluetooth on all the time. Retail locations use Bluetooth beacons to ping devices and follow consumers through the store. Bluetooth is reasonably localized, and gives the retailer fascinating data relating to where you went, how long (or if) you lingered in front of junk food, if you had to search for something, where you went first, and possibly payment card information (waiting in line vs walking away after a payment is made at a certain terminal).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xda-developers.com&#x2F;disable-system-app-bloatware-android&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xda-developers.com&#x2F;disable-system-app-bloatware-...</a>')
