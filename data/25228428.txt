Using easy-to-read charts, you can see metrics on your organization&#x27;s G Suite adoption, productivity, and collaboration.&quot;<p>So they are putting &quot;productivity&quot; there between &quot;adoption&quot; and &quot;collaboration&quot;. This tells me that it is selling usage metrics which might be the same thing, but I don&#x27;t see an aggregate score per employee named &quot;productivity xxx&quot; which is the big issue with MS product.<p>Also google&#x27;s metrics are anonymous (see &quot;Work Insights and user trust&quot;). This seems to be a big difference.<p>Looking at metrics is fine. You need to know how the tools you are paying for are used. Grading employees according to those metrics is bad.')
