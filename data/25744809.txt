As far as #1, one might potentially argue that the evidence is the banning of Parler by Apple and Google&#x27;s app stores, plus revocations from Stripe, Twilio and others, all within 48 hours. Further, it also coincided with Twitter (a much larger AWS customer) banning Donald Trump. #2 is probably not so simple either, as Google (i.e. GCP) was one of the participants in the ban, and a bunch of those other companies aren&#x27;t US-based. It&#x27;s why we have courts and juries.')
