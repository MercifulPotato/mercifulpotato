From a user point of view, how the data is stored is not as important as how it is accessed and controlled. No matter who the Pod Provider is, in order to be Solid compliant, it has to expose data the same way: as resources in folders. However,the implementors of the standard are free to pick the underlying technologies according to their own purposes and constraints. That is why performance may vary from one Pod Provider to another.<p>&gt; As any standard, Solid only describes the interaction model the system must be compliant with. The Pod Provider only exposes a REST read-write interface to the clients, to which the storage technology is irrelevant, as it is in most Web-based systems. How this interface binds with the storage is specific to each Pod Provider.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;solidproject.org&#x2F;faqs#pod" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;solidproject.org&#x2F;faqs#pod</a><p>Solid is just the standard. It&#x27;s up to others (e.g. inrupt) to build the actual thing.')
