That said, I expect IBM still explicitly copyrighted their <i>implementation</i> of SQL (and licensed it [1]) as they had first started doing with some of the System&#x2F;360 software during the prior decade. Note that, in 1974, you still had to explicitly copyright something; it didn&#x27;t just happen automatically like today.<p>[1] As a side note, IBM may not have been the first to license software but they certainly helped make it a standard practice. When they unbundled much of the System&#x2F;360 software, they felt that copyright was a weak protection (given its uncertain legal status) so they combined it with a license.')
