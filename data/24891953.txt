Item(by='bloaf', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603675971, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24891199, text='&gt; To live in this process is absolutely not to be able to notice it-please try to believe me-unless one has a much greater degree of political awareness, acuity, than most of us had ever had occasion to develop. Each step was so small, so inconsequential, so well explained or, on occasion, &#x27;regretted,&#x27; that, unless one were detached from the whole process from the beginning, unless one understood what the whole thing was in principle, what all these &#x27;little measures&#x27; that no &#x27;patriotic German&#x27; could resent must some day lead to, one no more saw it developing from day to day than a farmer in his field sees the corn growing. One day it is over his head.<p>&gt; How is this to be avoided, among ordinary men, even highly educated ordinary men? Frankly, I do not know. I do not see, even now. Many, many times since it all happened I have pondered that pair of great maxims, <i>Principiis obsta</i> and <i>Finem respice</i>-&#x27;Resist the beginnings&#x27; and &#x27;Consider the end.&#x27; But one must foresee the end in order to resist, or even see, the beginnings...<p>&gt; In the university community, in your own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, &#x27;It&#x27;s not so bad&#x27; or &#x27;You&#x27;re seeing things&#x27; or &#x27;You&#x27;re an alarmist.&#x27;  \nAnd you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can&#x27;t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don&#x27;t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end?<p>-- Milton Mayer, They Thought They Were Free (The Germans 1933-45)<p>In the past few decades, the political right served as the watchdog against governmental abuse of power (domestically), while the left was more sensitive to corporate abuses.  But with the rise of big tech has come a generation of left-leaning young people willing to give the benefit of the doubt to corporations they see as by- and for- their own generation.  At the same time, the right&#x27;s foray into populism has ushered in a party-wide acceptance of authoritarianism (provided it is wielded against members of out-groups).<p>I agree with you if we were talking about a decision by HN, or Metafilter, or other small communities.  But Twitter&#x2F;Facebook et. al. do not feel the same.  The situation feels more like a company deciding that they can ban certain literature on the grounds that they own all the land in the town [1].<p>So it seems to me that our watchdogs are in some sense asleep at their traditional posts.  It seems to me that we have an instance of a corporation granting itself new and wide ranging powers (regardless of their benevolence) over a wide swath of public discourse.  It seems to me that this ought to be resisted as a beginning, though we cannot see the ends.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Marsh_v._Alabama" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Marsh_v._Alabama</a><p>&gt;...we have recognized that the preservation of a free society is so far dependent upon the right of each individual citizen to receive such literature as he himself might desire... can those people who live in or come to Chickasaw be denied freedom of press and religion simply because a single company has legal title to all the town? For it is the State&#x27;s contention that the mere fact that all the property interests in the town are held by a single company is enough to give that company power, enforceable by a state statute, to abridge these freedoms.  We do not agree that the corporation&#x27;s property interests settle the question...  Ownership does not always mean absolute dominion. The more an owner, for his advantage, opens up his property for use by the public in general, the more do his rights become circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who use it.')
