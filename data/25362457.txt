The president is publicly calling for the election to be overturned, reaching out to state governors and asking them to please over turn the election for him - and a lot of smart, well-meaning people are stuck in an information bubble where this is just a legitimate process raising legitimate concerns about election fraud. That <i>has</i> to be addressed, and I just haven&#x27;t seen any suggestions for popping the bubble other than censoring it out of all the popular places.<p>I was sympathetic to the ideas floating around in early November, that the issue would go away once we let all the legal processes play out. But they <i>have</i> played out, the votes are all certified, and nothing&#x27;s changed.')
