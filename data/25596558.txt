Item(by='rektide', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609445162, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25595547, text='I lose points a lot &amp; I don&#x27;t mind that.<p>But I do think there are, often, some very biased negative idealogues who vote down interesting &amp; valuable opinions, regularly, &amp; mercilessly, because they don&#x27;t jive with the image of the world as the downvoter wants to believe it.<p>I think it&#x27;s very frustrating. And unfortunate. And I think that usually it&#x27;s the ungenerous zero-sum view of the world people that tend to be mass downvoters. There are other generally unpopular or unsupportable opinions that get down voted too, which I think is more in the cards, more regular, &amp; especially in the contested&#x2F;hot threads up top. My main concern is not this, not people getting blown out of the water in hot spots, but a lot of interesting voices getting chilled &amp; sent down.<p>My ask is: more data. Show upvoted &amp; downvoted separately when one hovers over the net points of a post. I also like the opinion that downvotes ought include a reason, a cause: off topic, bad content, bad whatever, slashdot style.')
