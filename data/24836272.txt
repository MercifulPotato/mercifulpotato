I can see the usefulness of it from python and go, but I also fear that it brings an unnecessary large maintenance burden.<p>Http standards are evolving and soon the implementation will get stale, being in the standard library there will be need to updated it and possibly maintain backwards compatibility, even when it becomes clear that a new design may be a better option.\nSo, suddenly people will start using new, often better, libraries but you need to keep find workforce to maintain the old stdlib http library.<p>That is mostly why I keep thinking that it would be better to have it as a separate library, with an easy-to-use package manager to discover and use it.')
