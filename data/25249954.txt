You&#x27;re obviously convinced of whatever ignorant beliefs you have about the US, already.  That alone disqualifies you to talk about the origins of my country.  Now, run along and spread your mistaken beliefs to someone who cares. I don&#x27;t care what you think about the US, because I live here, an, you, apparently don&#x27;t. You have authority to speak about the history of my country, or what its become, until you&#x27;ve lived it.<p>Oh, I&#x27;d consider brushing up on your reading skills, too. You clearly comprehend nothing that&#x27;s going on in this thread, so stop pushing your distorted,  delusional narrative. It doesn&#x27;t play well here among actual Americans. Maybe there&#x27;s a reason for that.')
