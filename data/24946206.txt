You think &quot;CSV, comma-separated-values, it&#x27;s right in the name!&quot; And then you write a parser for it and realize it won&#x27;t read CSV files Excel generates.<p>Years ago I was porting an r5rs Scheme app from Guile to other Scheme systems. The entire standard is 50 pages of fairly readable basic English. You would not believe the amount of differences different interpreter&#x2F;compilers have on their agreement as to what a symbol can be. Or under-specified cases such as integer-&gt;char (one system goes out of its way to be a dick about it and purposely <i>not</i> use ASCII, trading pragmatics for pedantry)')
