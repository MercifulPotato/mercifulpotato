[...] The question was why couldn&#x27;t the material be packaged up in any other ways?</i><p>Re-read the original question by jcerelier, who explicitly asked why consumers don&#x27;t have the <i>right</i> to view all the uncut footage: <i>&quot;What are good reasons for not having this right by default ?&quot;</i> [1]<p>&gt; <i>No one denies that whoever creates something has the right to dispose of it however they wish.</i><p>That&#x27;s not correct. From another comment: <i>&quot;I&#x27;d rather have no notion of private ownership of ideas, knowledge and cultural goods at all.&quot;</i> [2]<p>&gt; <i>What&#x27;s the &quot;good reason&quot; it can&#x27;t be? Does it kill any babies?</i><p>That&#x27;s a really stupid argument to make. What&#x27;s the &quot;good reason&quot; you don&#x27;t send me 100 Euros? Would it kill any babies?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25505865" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25505865</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25507455" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25507455</a>')
