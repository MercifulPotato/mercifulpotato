So MSR-r are just the interface. And the MSR register access can be &quot;slow&quot;, so no synchronization or optimization required.<p>But, the idea of more register makes better architecture, is a total bad assumption. See the dead body of Itanium (128 general-purpose 64 bit integer registers, 128 floating point registers etc. )<p>With multitasking, one have to switch between context, and larger context (register file size) takes more time.<p>There are cases when you are better using just the GPRs, rather than the SIMD registers. (Linux kernel does not use FPU or SIMD registers)<p>Also SIMD usage may slow down the clock, like AVX in x86_64. So you may trust your compiler for vectorization, but it may make more harm than good.')
