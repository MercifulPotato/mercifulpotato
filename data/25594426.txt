A very nice review of China&#x27;s foreign and domestic policy, written by a retired, senior national security advisor to various (USA) Presidents from Nixon on. He was the China expert, who started young, and learned much over his forty(?) year career.<p>Fiction: \nSaturn Run, by John Sandford. Very exciting, great characters, science fiction with great science. I would call it a modern science fiction novel. Very Refreshing.<p>Science&#x2F;history&#x2F;cool:\nSunburst and Luminary, by Don Eyles. An Apollo Memoir; very exciting, great explanations about programming and designing the navigation and landing computer of the lunar module, with a neat view into the characters and history of the time.\nThanks to other HN posts for these suggestions.\nHappy New Year!')
