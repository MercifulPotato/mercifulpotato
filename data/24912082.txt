It&#x27;s fast, beautiful, and is generally awesome.&quot;<p>&gt;&quot;Sweet, I&#x27;ll take it...&quot;<p>I guess this is a different topic, but it wouldn&#x27;t play out like this.  You have to decide if you want the iPhone 12, the 12 Pro, the 12 Pro Max, the 12 mini, the SE, the 11, or the XR and then you decide do you want the white, black, blue, green, gold, yellow, purple, coral, or red, and then you decide 64 GB, 128 GB, 256 GB, or 512 GB, then you decide if you want AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, or Sprint.<p>I have lost count of how many dozen of different SKUs of iPhone Apple is currently selling.')
