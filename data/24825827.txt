I&#x27;m very curious what you spend the 2k on.<p>Here are some prices for central Europe. Kg of rice is 1 euro. Kg of oats is 1 euro. Potatoes and other tubers and root vegetables, even less. Cherry tomatoes, maybe 4 euros per kg. Lentils, peas, chickpeas less than 2 euros per kg. Whole chicken maybe 4 euros per kg. Chicken breasts are like 7 euros per kg if you don&#x27;t want to bother with cutting it up. I think meat in general is cheaper in the USA (but quality may differ).<p>Do you guys eat a literal ton of vegetables a month, or do we have different ideas of what healthy food refers to?')
