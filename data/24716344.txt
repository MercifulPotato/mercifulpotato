An API declaration is a fragment of a program, which is copyrightable under statute, just like chapter titles and headings are fragments of a literary work. API declarations constitute expression of an idea which has many ways to be expressed. And... even if a small part of a larger work is copied without authroization or license, then the copyright has been infringed.<p>Therefore, it should be uncontroversial that APIs are subject to copyright and that Google was infringing.')
