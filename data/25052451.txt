I bought a new top spec Air earlier in the year to replace the one I&#x27;d owned since 2013. I hate it. The fan comes on about every 30 seconds (doing things on the new machine that were fine on the 2013 one). Literally no at Apple seems to care and I&#x27;m not the only one complaining.<p>It&#x27;s taken then less than 6 months to refresh the entire line? What an absolute kick in the teeth - especially on the back of a machine I really dislike. Super shitty move from Apple.')
