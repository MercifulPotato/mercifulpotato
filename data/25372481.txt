This is anti market-as-totalizing-factor-in-life. These things aren&#x27;t contradictory.<p>&gt; and the Democrats have their usually anti market stance.<p>They gave us NAFTA. They passed a--i shit you not--market-mediated healthcare bill. As you speak, there is literally a power struggle happening wherein lobbyists are being stacked in Biden&#x27;s future cabinet to ensure favorable market positions for their represented patrons.<p>I think there&#x27;s a lot of confusion on your part. I think you&#x27;re mis-using &quot;market,&quot; to refer to some &quot;free-market,&quot; that could never exist. I might be wrong, but there&#x27;s no other way that I could understand how you can refer to Democrats, as a whole, as &quot;anti-market.&quot; Sure, AOC gets a lot of press, but you&#x27;re missing the forest for the trees when this forms your world-view of what that party is and does.')
