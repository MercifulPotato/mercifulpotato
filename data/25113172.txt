[x]\nIts <i>deleting</i> posts that gets sticky.  And yes your point about Twitter et al lending people some of their reputation &#x2F; Google juice is a very underrated part of the problem.  But how do we define content moderation rules online? Who sets those rules, where and when do they apply?  These are not things to leave to private companies with ad revenue.<p>[x] In fact I think this is too important to leave to tech companies.  I would <i>like</i> to see some W3C standard for tagging a URI - that is a distributed comments system where the browser &#x2F; client SHOULD &#x2F; MUST show that &quot;in the cloud&quot; there are rebuttals to this statement &#x2F; position.  So the rebuttal is seen where the rebutted is shown.  The more views a rebuttal gets the more prominent it is in the list of rebuttals.<p>Yes it will mean everything everywhere has rebuttal but ... that&#x27;s kind of true anyway.  And I like the upthread approach of a common (W3C) distributed moderation (ie a jury of ones randomly selected peers).  I think the idea <i>seems</i> workable - but more study is needed :-)<p>Call it the Other Side Protocol.')
