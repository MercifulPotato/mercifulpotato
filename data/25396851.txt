Newton&#x27;s laws are a perfect example of something that establishes a correlation but are useful absent accurate causation.<p>They did just fine until we needed something better. Einstein provided this but can we be so sure gravity as a result of curved space is &quot;true&quot; and not just a really good model? Perhaps the hunt for what quantum gravity will one day tell.<p>&gt; As a better counterpoint: if we could not distinguish between causation and correlation, why is general AI so hard?<p>I think general AI is hard because for one it might be a fiction. For general AI to be real, we&#x27;d have to assume people posses &quot;general intelligence&quot;. Or at the very least, were it beyond us, we&#x27;d have to assume we could tell if we had created it.<p>What we are really trying to do with &quot;general intelligence&quot; is reproduce something that took 3.5 billion years of natural selection to design. We have only recently become capable of even creating machines with the kinds of part counts that biology comes with. Were we to produce &quot;general intelligence&quot; in the next thousand years I&#x27;d be surprised it came so easy.')
