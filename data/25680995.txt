Menus suck when trying to change the temperature in a car&#x27;s touchscreen compared to individual knobs.<p>Volvo&#x27;s touchscreen <i>has</i> multi-touch, as you can use it to zoom (very poorly) in their (bad) map, but if the driver and passenger want to change their temperature at the same time, it&#x27;ll close the other&#x27;s menu, even though the two menus don&#x27;t even touch the other half of the screen closest to the other person.')
