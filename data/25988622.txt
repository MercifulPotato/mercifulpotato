If I have to pay each share 5$, and I have given out 500 shares, but when it&#x27;s time to pay out dividends 700 shares show up to claim them,then someone has to lose money right? Either I have to give 5$ to 200 shares that I never sold to people to begin with, or the 500 people who actually bought shares from me lose some of their portion to the extra 200. What am I missing if that&#x27;s not the case?  Surely that dividend money for those extra 200 shares has to come from somewhere?')
