Then the doctors there do their best to determine when their patient is safe to rejoin society.<p>One particular problem is that a person might theoretically be safe as long as they take their medicine, but many, many patients are utterly incapable of doing that on their own and any slip-up is likely to lead to more slip-ups until they end up unmedicated entirely.<p>There are partial solutions like long-lasting injections for some things, but I also know that even if that&#x27;s the proper standard of care, the doctors may fail to apply it with disastrous results and still walk away without even any liability despite having clear warning that their actions were putting someone in danger.<p>So seeing this intellectual masturbation by lawyers is actually quite painful to me given what I&#x27;ve lived through.  Especially when it practically requires mind reading to say what the person really thought, the idea that people could get off by claiming to have killed a &quot;hat&quot; with a bit of coaching is extremely troubling and I&#x27;m glad that judges aren&#x27;t buying this nonsense.  Sure, one can also look at the person&#x27;s actions for any indication they knew they were doing something morally wrong or that they might be punished for, but I&#x27;m still against opening up the insanity defense.<p>If anything, a true insanity defense should make it clear that someone <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> be a part of society because we should be far more skeptical about our ability to fix mental disorders than these lawyers seem to be.<p>I&#x27;d like to see how quickly they reconsider this if the lawyers pushing the defense had to live with their clients for, say, a year afterward.')
