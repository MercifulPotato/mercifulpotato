What they had was the family circumstances to delay gratification. Sometimes this was family wealth to support them for years, other times it was the family pooling their resources for one chosen member of the family, other times it was the family wealth to support them going to a lower tier medical school, and lastly it was family members who got them positions. I really hated the guy who cheated in honors English and went on to become a doctor.<p>Turning your descendants into doctors and lawyers is one of the traditional ways families use to preserve their wealth. It isnâ€™t because these people were smarter.')
