Google&#x27;s implementation just is targeted at their needs. If you are doing it for ingest you just need<p>* Basic SDP library, ICE-Lite, DTLS, SRTP<p>If you ship RIST you pretty much end up with the same thing!<p>If you go with WebRTC you have implementations in lots of languages as well (not just bindings)<p>* Go, Python, Pure C&#x2F;Embedded, Java, Rust, C++<p>Also WebRTC could let you do SVC or Simulcast. It would be a lot better for scaling if the uploader sent all the different quality feeds (and let congestion control ensure they don&#x27;t oversend).<p>I really feel that there has been a concentrated marketing effort that has hurt WebRTC on multiple fronts.<p>* Google oversells what they have done. They bundled up a bunch of existing protocols. That doesn&#x27;t get as my promotions&#x2F;awards though. It also helps them control the standard. If they paint &#x27;Google WebRTC === WebRTC&#x27; then they make a change and everyone else has to play ball.<p>* WebRTC competitors want to paint it in a bad light so they can sell $x')
