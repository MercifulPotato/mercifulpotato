Who do you want to fool here? The whole thing was toxic as hell. Every single time I looked into the comments of posts, I didn&#x27;t find anything that would qualify as &quot;merely conservative&quot; voices. It was a massive circlejerk of hate and the pure joy of doing that.<p>Sure things like impersonating someone are bad but there is no reason&#x2F;facts to assume that this is happening regularly or even happened one more time.<p>On the other hand what Donalds did all over the platform was the norm. It was approved by those who subscribed and participated even when they didn&#x27;t themselves.<p>As an outsider I find it quite funny that people say &quot;they&#x27;re just Hillary fans&quot; or something along those lines when your whole political spectrum consist of just two strongly polarized sides when in fact and day to day business not being on Donalds side doesn&#x27;t make them automatically Hillary fans.<p>Also: how is it the &quot;Hillary sides&quot; fault when the other side behave like mad and armed children? It&#x27;s just some poor attempt at victim blaming.')
