I switched to Gitlab and purchased a subscription not for features but as a hedge against them selling out to another major company with a conflict of interest, but at 4x the cost I can&#x27;t justify that.  So much for putting my money where my mouth is.<p>I looked around and nobody except Github has a non-free hobbyist tier AFAICT.  Is &quot;paid personal git service&quot; just not a thing?
