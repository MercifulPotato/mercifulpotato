The reason is more or less that humans are really, really good at staying in sync, but, even with only 2 parts to listen to, it starts to get almost impossible levels of effort to keep proper time.  In person, without any network lag, musicians can make adjustments in real time (<i>e.g.</i> always, always, <i>always</i> follow the soloist, even if the soloist is off tempo or off pitch).  The conductor is listening to the soloist, too, so you don&#x27;t need to worry about conflicting directions.<p>Here are a couple of examples I know of on YouTube where a single musician plays multiple parts, which are then edited together:<p>Now professional cellist, graduating senior at time of recording, Sarah Chaffee playing an original transcription of Alice Cooper&#x27;s <i>Poison</i> with 5 cello parts (with a short guest appearance by Shostakovich at about 2:42, then showing up again in the outro to play us out at 3:33): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=PjYwQHFsld0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=PjYwQHFsld0</a><p>Professional cellist Wells Cunningham playing the Handel- Halvorsen Passacaglia: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NseBdxfHk5k" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=NseBdxfHk5k</a><p>This guy has a really, uhm, interesting violin technique. ;)  Just for the fact that he chose to play the instrument the way he did tells me he does not actually <i>know</i> how to play violin.  What he&#x27;s doing is playing it like a teeny tiny cello.  Since the notes are so much closer together on the respective fingerboards on a violin than on the cello, I&#x27;m betting he needed an extra take or 2 on that.  His performance is passable, but <i>nothing</i> when put up against the performance of an actual, professional violinist.')
