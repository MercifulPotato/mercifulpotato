Sure they might be prepared to flout SEC rules if they thought they could get away with it but whether they sold is trivially verifiable and they would be guaranteed to get caught. Exiting the position was probably also a precondition of the new investors putting money in.<p>The comment you pasted is incoherent rambling. It&#x27;s honestly like something from a qanon forum. Even ignoring that prices don&#x27;t work how they seem to think the mechanism they suggest for manipulating them doesn&#x27;t make sense (it would also be very illegal and again trivial to verify for the SEC).')
