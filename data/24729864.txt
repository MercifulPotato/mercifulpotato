The actual research note was linked from it here: [1]<p>&gt; Any artificially-induced inflation of the money supply is economically destructive, promoting malinvestment and waste.<p>I&#x27;d love to see your sources there, because I don&#x27;t agree. Inflation plays important roles like pushing for allocation of capital. Inflation only matters if you hold dollar  bills under  your mattress. Once you invest it  in anything, including real estate or a  savings account, the effect is decimated, or reduced below zero.<p>&gt; Inflation does have an important role in the economy. When it happens naturally it tells investors that we are in desperate need of more capital investment.<p>What is &quot;natural inflation&quot; in Bitcoin? Does it naturally sprout more coins in steady state? Or are you suggesting velocity of money in a currency unable to respond to externalities should suffice?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;static1.squarespace.com&#x2F;static&#x2F;5d580747908cdc0001e6792d&#x2F;t&#x2F;5e98dde5558a587a09fac0cc&#x2F;1587076583519&#x2F;research+note+4.17.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;static1.squarespace.com&#x2F;static&#x2F;5d580747908cdc0001e67...</a>')
