If I am unable&#x2F;unwilling to moderate the comment section of a blog I host then maybe I should&#x27;t have one. I do not believe a completely open free-speech comment section is a requirement of a good or successful blog.<p>It&#x27;s not about having to moderate a completely free speech comment section. It&#x27;s about being able to even have one and to be able to host good people and good comments without having to be liable for the time when people act terribly.<p>Where I&#x27;m from I don&#x27;t think a bar owner can be held liable if a patron starts a fight and wounds another patron. You don&#x27;t open a bar with the explicit intent of it being an amateur boxing arena, but a nice place for people to enjoy drinks and conversation.<p>If a user online decides to breach trust and common courtesy by posting vile stuff on my site I shouldn&#x27;t be held liable for their actions as I did not force or coerce them to do it.<p>&gt;Nothing stops people from posting whatever content they want on their own site. It just discourages aggregation of other people&#x27;s content.<p>Yes, nothing is stopping them. But 230 is allowing you to do more with the internet other than just post things on your own site. That blog even describes an instance where replying&#x2F;forwarding an email - in which you are repeating  what rule&#x2F;law breaking thing another person said to be able to reply&#x2F;comment on said thing - you are protected against liability.<p>If you dismiss these liability rules you are effectively removing everything from chatrooms to comment sections from the internet, effectively making the internet into a snailmail&#x2F;bulletin board service.')
