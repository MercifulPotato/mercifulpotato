Software defined radio, and DSP in general, is revolutionizing what you can do in a small package. I&#x27;ve never been one to sit and talk for hours, though I do think it is neat on those occasions when you can talk around the world. I was always into the more technical things, like Fox hunting, and building gear.<p>We need people pushing the limits of technology who <i>aren&#x27;t just doing it for profit</i>, and that&#x27;s where the amateur really shines.  Doing things just to see if they can be done  has a rich and rewarding history, and I&#x27;d like to see it continue.<p>A few months ago, I used a $25 dongle, GNU Radio, and made a VOR receiver, for the heck of it.   VOR transmitters are used in aircraft navigation, and I can now firmly establish that I live EastNorthEast of the nearest VOR station to me. ;-)')
