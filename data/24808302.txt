But every time I try (which I do every 5 years or so, despite knowing better) it ends in tears and frustration. I don&#x27;t even have exotic hardware. Just some mainstream Thinkpads and Dell laptops. Usually, I give up after literally (!) weeks of trying to get sound &#x2F; hardware accelerated graphics &#x2F; hibernation &#x2F; power management &#x2F; etc. working properly. Ironically, I get the best Linux experience with WSL or when I run it in a VM on top of Windows.')
