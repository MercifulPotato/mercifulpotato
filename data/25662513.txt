The first means that people could be unaware of the extra steps they need to take to get privacy, but the second is the risky one.<p>Monero is known as a privacy coin and this makes it the target of governments that indeed made ShapeShift start to to KYC a year or more ago.<p>Monero is unduly targeted for standard features because governments don&#x27;t like perfect privacy...<p>The good news is that privacy does not have to be built in to a coin for it to be capable of giving privacy. If we reverse the Monero situation we might get something that is actually useful for the majority of us. A coin like Bitcoin that doesn&#x27;t have more than semi-privacy can have mixing added to become private.<p>Now, mixing as historically done on BTC is both expensive and centralized, which has caused several servers to be confiscated and people arrested. Again, governments really don&#x27;t like what you do with your money being private.<p>I&#x27;m personally a big fan of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cashfusion.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cashfusion.org</a> ticks all these boxes. It is built on a semi-private (bitcoin-like) coin and it solves the other problems as well with a mix (sorry, fusion) costing you nearly nothing.')
