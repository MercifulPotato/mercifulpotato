It needed to be connected to wired Thunderbolt Ethernet, which in my case means in the laundry.<p>Downloading packages took a long time (about 2 hours). &quot;grafting&quot; took longer. Finally it failed to set up the bootloader. No big deal, try GRUB or rEFIt, right? But they didn&#x27;t detect it.<p>There is an &quot;EFI Boot&quot; option in the startup menu (holding option). That just boots to a black screen.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but issues like this mean that I think GUIX is not desktop-ready for bare metal. It&#x27;ll be relegated to a virtual machine (along with OpenIndiana, PureOS, Haiku, Hello, etc).')
