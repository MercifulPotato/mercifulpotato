It&#x27;s probably the same underlying issue as Hikkomori and Grasseaters, namely that young men fail to secure their place in the economy, due to the latter being stagnant. There&#x27;s also people faking their suicide so that they can live an unsuccessful life without their family publicly losing face.<p>Plus a typical saying is &quot;if a nail sticks out, hit it harder&quot; so I&#x27;m not sure you would get community consent for helping the oddballs. At least not from the elderly, most of whom feel like they were the ones who had it though when rebuilding everything after the wars... which led to insane economic growth and a boom of opportunities for them.<p>So not sure it&#x27;s correct, but the idea that the elderly worked hard and the youngsters are just lazy is very persuasive. So problems facing the young tend to get less attention by politicians.')
