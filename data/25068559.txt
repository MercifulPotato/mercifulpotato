Many of them can&#x27;t afford migrating to a new stack, or want to.\nBut generally I kinda agree - more is being created with other stack nowadays. A byproduct of that is way more people learn Python &#x2F; Java as a first language, so you also perhaps need to think if being a Python guy gives you any edge when you turn 45-50 as hordes of young people learn it as we speak. Outsourcing a Python project is gonna be way easier 10 years from now than doing the same with Ruby.\nI don&#x27;t have clear answers btw, there&#x27;s just pros and cons.')
