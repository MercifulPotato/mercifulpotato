I&#x27;m sick of wading through thousands of products with fake reviews when shopping for something outside my field of expertise. Amazon&#x27;s own recommendation (&quot;Amazon&#x27;s choice&quot;, iirc) is just algorithmic bullshit and the ratings cannot be trusted.<p>Give me a shop that gives me a couple of hand-selected products for any given category and makes absolutely sure that I do not get counterfeit products. Couple that with great and personal service and I&#x27;m happy to pay a premium over Amazon.')
