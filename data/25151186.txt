Until such a time that users are made aware and given choices <i>from both their OS and browsers</i>, I choose to treat all of them as hostile in my own home network.  I see the users as frogs in luke-warm water.  Both ISP&#x27;s and centralized DNS providers can choose to boil them once critical mass is reached.  Some ISP&#x27;s have already boiled some frogs, but this is limited to specific ISP&#x27;s and specific countries.  The DoH providers are in a position to boil ALL the frogs globally once everyone has forgotten about DoH and&#x2F;or critical mass is reached.<p>At work, we already control these settings in the browser and can easily control any future settings in the OS so it is not an issue there.')
