The correct response when it happens is to call them out and tell them to cut it out, that its not ok.<p>Getting someone fired over an off-the-cuff stupid joke is crazy. Getting a lynch mob to literally attempt to destroy someones life over a stupid joke is much much worse than the joke itself, no matter how sexist or racist it may be.<p>Besides, you don&#x27;t change people by attacking them.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t know the individual story<p>The specific story isn&#x27;t really relevant, although you can look it up to see the context. The point is that the reaction is completely out of proportion with the &quot;crime&quot; and when someone loses everything over something as stupid as a joke, you either radicalise them or you push them to anxiety, depression and sometimes suicide. That is never ok no matter how racist or sexist you were.<p>&gt; I won&#x27;t be surprised if my employer decides to get rid of me.<p>Have you never said anything that you later regretted? I&#x27;ve certainly made jokes I wish I hadn&#x27;t. She posted it to her 170 twitter followers, stupid sure, but how was she to know someone would pass it on to a journalist with hundreds of thousands of followers who would then spread it and complain to her employer?<p>I mean, sure, its dumb to assume anything you post online won&#x27;t get spread and come back to you, but that&#x27;s a separate issue.<p>Besides, it looked to me that the employer fired her because thousands of faceless &quot;internet activists&quot; demanded it, not because they themselves deemed the tweet was a fire-able offense.<p>Remember, this conversation is based off my statement above:<p>&gt; <i>There&#x27;s a difference between calling someone out for something untasteful and actively trying to ruin their careers, marriages and lives over it.</i><p>By all means, call peoples bad behavior out! But don&#x27;t go out of your way to try to ruin their lives. That is all I am arguing for.')
