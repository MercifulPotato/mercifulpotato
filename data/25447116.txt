I guess it&#x27;s more so because I usually mentally recall my accomplishments for past jobs to write up my resumes, or rely on older resumes to recall work from past jobs. These resumes and my LinkedIn page are the most persistent documentation I have of my career.<p>Is it unusual to not keep track of your accomplishments on a more granular level? Do most people keep a personal &quot;brag document&quot; to recall things from past projects or items in case they come up with work later? Because at work I just go by the company and co-worker emails I receive.<p>Even when I was in college I wasn&#x27;t too keen on following up on whatever notes I wrote down for class. At work I don&#x27;t write down anything at all, whether quarterly, monthly, etc.')
