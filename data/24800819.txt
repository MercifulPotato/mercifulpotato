As in, more than 10, but I haven&#x27;t kept count so an exact number is elusive. And to be fair, I&#x27;ve done a lot of hallucinogens that weren&#x27;t MDMA.<p>MDMA was by far the most profound personally, and has made me a happier person overall. I&#x27;ve never fallen back into my old ways of thinking and am much more comfortable with myself.<p>But the first time is the most helpful and profound - once can really be enough, though I can understand why someone would want to take it 1-2 times a year just to keep it fresh in their mind.')
