I&#x27;ve done that part, and my doors close thunkily now (not that I ever cared) but the car is just as loud as ever inside. I think that unless you&#x27;re going for high-performance audio, there&#x27;s really not a whole lot of value in the sound deadener.<p>&gt; 25-50% coverage with butyl directly on the sheet metal is enough<p>This is true, you see in a lot of the professional installer videos that they will cover the whole surface in the deadener, but it&#x27;s not necessary.')
