Accessing the 2.5&quot; bay on the original PS4 is done by sliding off the cover of one of the four quadrants. The HDD caddy is held down by one screw. Not sure about the Slim and Pro, but on the original, it&#x27;s a Philips head screw, but not just any Philips head - it&#x27;s wider than necessary so that they could etch their trademark four symbols on it.<p>This is a custom screw that 99.9% of users will never see (guessing at that number of course) but they put it in anyway. That must have been a lot of work.')
