Pretending that the argument I have given is like making up something about a toy car just does not do anything.<p>The fact is that the argument I have presented demonstrates that the problem as given is flawed and does not have a unique answer. Most people don&#x27;t understand this and substitute the correct version of the problem in their mind, and then proceed to solve that by arguing about the probabilities. Of course the probabilities are what the problem is &quot;supposed&quot; to be about.')
