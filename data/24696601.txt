(If you have to)', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='This is not an anti-medication or -therapy post. The purpose of my writing is to inquire about the best self-help strategies for managing ADHD.\nThis might be useful for people who don&#x27;t have access to a therapist or to medication.\nIt would be nice if those strategies are backed up by findings.\nSo without further ado, here are my best ways to deal with this condition on your own:<p>1. Fish oil (EPA should be higher than DHA) [1][3][4]\n2. Zinc[1]\n3. Lithium (has severe side effects, but seems to be effective)[1]\n4. Meditation&#x2F;Mindfulness &amp; Yoga[2]<p>References:\n[1] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.webmd.com&#x2F;vitamins&#x2F;condition-1021&#x2F;attention+deficit-hyperactivity+disorder+(adhd)\n[2] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;18025249&#x2F;\n[3] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4321799&#x2F;\n[4] https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4175558&#x2F;<p>Disclaimer: use your own brain first! Or if you can, listen to your therapist. Again, this is aimed for people who have no access to professional help.\nI am not an expert in scientific literature.')
