If you try to do everything perfectly, you will often run out of discipline after a couple of days. Instead, you can try making incremental improvements<p>For example, if you&#x27;re currently eating 3 crappy meals a day, switch to having 1 healthy meal and don&#x27;t worry about the other 2 even if they&#x27;re unhealthy. It&#x27;s an easy change to make but it makes a huge difference. Keep it going for a while and then use the newly established habit to make the next incremental change and then another one.<p>Aim for small improvements over time, instead of aiming for perfection.')
