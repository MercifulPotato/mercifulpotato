I see where your inspiration is coming from! It&#x27;s really interesting when you think of it that way!<p>I think there is a true need for a decentralized immutable data store (basically get&#x2F;put&#x2F;list operations), and it could serve a vast number of use cases. It enables simple algorithmic memoization, complete reproducibility of ML models, and datasets shareability. The only problem is we lack practical solutions. Maybe Condensation could help, or maybe not. In any case, it&#x27;s good to see more alternative to traditional datastore that are not &quot;git for data&quot;.')
