I use all video conference tools(Whereby, WebEx, Teams, BlueJeans) in the browser and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with i3. Video conference tool gets its own workspace and it&#x27;s done.<p>My i3 is also set to open new windows in the workspace that triggered the new window so I never have to go fishing for any occasional pop-up, it&#x27;s where it belongs.')
