In my area Target moved in before Walmart which means their stores and their parking lots were designed before pickup services were started. This means the pickup experience at the Targets in the area is less than ideal. Walmart on the other hand built their stores and designed the traffic flow around them specifically to support large scale pickup service. As a result the Walmarts in the area seem to do a much bigger pickup business. I know many people that have switched from using Target to Walmart because of the vastly better pickup experience. This is all specific to my area and anecdotal. The original comment was also anecdotal, so I feel less bad about it.')
