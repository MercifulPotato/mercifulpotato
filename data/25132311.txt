They&#x27;re strange and hard to learn, and you have to do almost everything differently from what you learned, but it is really true declarative configuration of a machine from the ground up, not quasi-declarative where there&#x27;s always state that gets left out and you can never really trust the diffing&#x2F;idempotency mechanisms because they&#x27;re layered on top of things that weren&#x27;t meant to be used that way.<p>(If you dig into the details, you will find some &quot;atrocious hacks&quot; as the sibling comment puts it, but because of how it works, the hacks are almost completely encapsulated at build time and those builds are reproducible, so there&#x27;s much less to worry about when you&#x27;re deploying&#x2F;provisioning.)')
