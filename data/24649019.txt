There are tons of youtube videos that provide tutorials.<p>What helped me most was having concrete and doable projects that you&#x27;ll want to finish. My first project was a digital dice (attiny85, 7 leds, CR2032, button and a small perfboard). Now it&#x27;s a led strip for a camper (esp8266 w WLED firmware, potentiometer, 5V stepdown converter). I&#x27;m also toying with radio transmission over 433Mhz so I can have battery powered sensors (water-well depth, temperature, etc)')
