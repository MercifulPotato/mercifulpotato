(Sensor noise and other natural phenomena) There basically already is some natural dithering. If your software is not dithering extremely gradual gradients that&#x27;s the problem.<p>Still in that case if you wanting to dither you gradient you better be working in a higher precision format.<p>Anyways, please notice I said: &quot;8 bits is enough (generally)&quot;. There is a reason I said generally, I did not say always.<p>-Edit-<p>Although, lossy compression may effectively linearize gradients from video or photographs. Consider an extremely simple example: A compression algorithm that detects&#x2F;fits to a gradual gradients to much smaller delta encoding. Such as increase the channel value by 1 every pixel for a 100 pixels. While this might be rather simple example. It&#x27;s obvious to see how that would remove noise and make that section of an image highly linear.')
