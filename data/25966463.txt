Aren&#x27;t you encrypting data &quot;on the fly&quot;, while it is still resident in the CPU caches?<p>I assume NF&#x27;s software pipeline is zero copy, so if TLS is done in the NIC data only gets read from memory once when it is DMA&#x27;d to the NIC. With software TLS you need to read the data from memory (assuming it&#x27;s not already in cache, which given the size of data NF deals with is unlikely), encrypt it, then write it back out to main memory so it can be DMA&#x27;d to the NIC. I know Intel has some fancy tech that can DMA directly to&#x2F;from the CPU&#x27;s cache, but I don&#x27;t think AMD has that capability (yet).')
