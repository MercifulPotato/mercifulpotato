To be honest, I think I&#x27;d want a 2nd technical founder before a non-technical founder.<p>Unless the non-technical founder had some solid business knowledge&#x2F;skills&#x2F;experience.  Barring that, depending on the product&#x2F;market domain, I would still seek: technology skills&#x2F;experience, such as software, electronics, science, or engineering related.<p>And I studied liberal arts in college ;)')
