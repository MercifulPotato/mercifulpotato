Item(by='ChrisMarshallNY', descendants=None, kids=[25760862], score=None, time=1610535196, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25757398, text='I was the original architect (but no longer maintain) a fairly ambitious FOSS project that is the worldwide standard for a very particular demographic.<p>That demographic is notorious for a propensity to be “not nice.”<p>I kept it going for a decade, sometimes receiving rather...<i>strident</i>...”feedback.” I was called a tyrant (and worse) for refusing to deviate from its Core Mission, in order to make it easier for certain individuals to use in narrow contexts (that type of request is quite common, if you manage a general-purpose infrastructure project).<p>I learned (slowly) to be polite and respectful in my responses, even when approached in an abusive manner. The times I “hit back” (I’m good at that) were quite self-destructive, and did not do the project any favors.<p>My tyranny paid off, but it took a while. The project has been handed over to a team of really sharp folks that will, hopefully, never have to deal with the kind of crap I put up with. They will get a great deal of positive feedback, and very little of the asinine, juvenile garbage I got. That makes me happy. They don’t deserve it, and I’m grateful they took it over, making it much better than I ever could.<p>It was worth it. If I had to do it all over again, I would (but I’m glad I don’t have to). I’m a tough, stubborn old coot that can take it, and I knew what I was getting into, when I started (I’m quite familiar with the demographic). Even so, there were a number of times I wanted to bin the project and walk away. I’m glad I didn’t (and there’s many thousands of people that are glad I didn’t, but don’t know it).<p>Sometimes, we do stuff for reasons other than money, property, and prestige.')
