There are a bunch of single board computers with clone x86 pentium-ish cpus available all on a single ISA card, so I plugged one into ISA backplane, added a vintage VGA and SB card, and wrote a TSR that uses one of the watchdog timers on the board to slow it down a bunch so I could play Wing Commander II again.  Itâ€™s a fun and not terribly expensive weekend project.')
