Different scaling ratios for different monitors, much better automatic detection and configuration.<p>There are two remaining problems in my opinion<p>- Screen sharing is still rather hit or miss.  Pipewire is functional for me on latest versions of chromium, but does not work for some electron apps that package older versions (Slack, in this case).<p>- X-Wayland applications still make you feel the hurt from Xorg.  Most times I don&#x27;t care, but the default builds of chromium and chrome both rely on X-Wayland. There are AUR builds of chromium that have moved to Ozone and have native Wayland support, though (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aur.archlinux.org&#x2F;packages&#x2F;chromium-ozone&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;aur.archlinux.org&#x2F;packages&#x2F;chromium-ozone&#x2F;</a>)<p>----<p>Long story short, Wayland is why my personal machine no longer has windows on it.  It&#x27;s genuinely much better, and I don&#x27;t spend any time at all dicking around with xorg config files (literally not once have I touched a config file related to monitors or user input devices on my current linux box in the last year.  It feels very nice.)')
