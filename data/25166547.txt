They are as free to express and act on their opinion of private actors expressing pro-LGBT messages as people who believe otherwise are to express the opposite.<p>The last time someone didn&#x27;t want to bake a cake, they had to fight their way to supreme court... so yeah, expressing your beliefs is not an easy task to do.<p>The problem with beliefs is, that they&#x27;re arbitrary, and a tiny variable can make a good thing a bad thing. Rape in a movie? Bad thing. Crime, thriller, etc. Rape jokes, bad. But wait, if you just change the gender of the rape victim to a male, you&#x27;ve got a hollywood &quot;satirical erotic romantic comedy&quot; ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;40_Days_and_40_Nights" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;40_Days_and_40_Nights</a> ).<p>So, rape jokes are bad, and deleted ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;technology-15641998" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;technology-15641998</a> -here facebook even stood with free speech, but bent down soon after), but if the victim is a man, you can shoot a comedy and make $95M.

Who decides that? If we censor one, shouldnt we also censor the other? Or if we let one online, why not let the other? Is it just a personal choice of a trigger happy moderator? Or is there a written, official moderation rule, where content with rape is ok, if the victim is a man?')
