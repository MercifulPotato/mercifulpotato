And there is some speech that, if Parler (or anyone else)  doesn&#x27;t remove it, they can be subject to criminal (e.g., child porn, setting up drug deals, etc.) and&#x2F;or civil (copyright violations) litigation.<p>As such, <i>anyone</i> who claims they don&#x27;t moderate is probably lying, unless they <i>want</i> to go to jail, get sued into oblivion or both.')
