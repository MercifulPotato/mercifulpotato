It&#x27;s not &quot;minimal&quot; in the sense that you can&#x27;t do without every single line of the template. Just remove the parts you don&#x27;t want. It would defeat its purpose if there were multiple templates that each aim at different things and then you have to decide which template you have to choose. Having two minimal templates is not minimal because of the redundancy.')
