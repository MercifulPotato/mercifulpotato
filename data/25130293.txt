The remaining performance increase was from clockspeeds (gained without increasing power due to 5nm).<p>Short, wide architectures are historically harder to frequency scale (and given how power vs clocks tapers off at the end of that scale, it&#x27;s not a bad thing IMO).<p>4nm isn&#x27;t shipping until 2022 (and isn&#x27;t a full node). TSMC says that the 5 to 3nm change will be identical to the 7 to 5nm change (+15% performance or -30% power consumption).<p>Any changes next year will have to come through pure architecture changes or bigger chips. I&#x27;m betting on more modest 5-10% improvements on the low-end and larger 10-20% improvements on a larger chip with a bunch of cache tweaks and higher TDP.<p>Intel 10nm+ &quot;SuperFin&quot; will probably be fixing the major problems, improving performance, and slightly decreasing sizes for a final architecture much closer to TSMC N7.<p>I&#x27;m thinking that AMD ships their mobile chips with N6 instead of N7 for the density and mild power savings (it&#x27;s supposedly a minor change and the mobile design is a separate chip anyway). Late next year we should be seeing Zen 4 on 5nm. That should be an interesting situation and will help resolve any questions of process vs architecture.')
