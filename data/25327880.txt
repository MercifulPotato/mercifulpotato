Item(by='tialaramex', descendants=None, kids=[25329018, 25328066], score=None, time=1607299111, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25327137, text='This article has some errors which are unfortunate.<p>&gt; From the start, Let&#x27;s Encrypt used a top-level certificate (known as a CA Root) that was signed by ISRG Root X1 and cross-signed by IdenTrust<p>Their &quot;top-level&quot; root is in fact ISRG Root X1. This was <i>not</i> cross-signed by IdenTrust (that wouldn&#x27;t be impossible, several popular CAs took this approach, but ISRG, the people behind Let&#x27;s Encrypt, did not).<p>The CAs which were cross-signed were the Let&#x27;s Encrypt intermediates (sometimes called subCAs), so far these have been named Let&#x27;s Encrypt Authority X1, X2, X3 and X4 and now just R3 and R4 (the name has to be sent over the wire every time you connect anywhere, and just &quot;R3&quot; is fewer bytes than &quot;Let&#x27;s Encrypt Authority R3&quot;)<p>[ Why are there intermediates? Well, an issuing CA has to be connected, albeit not directly, to the public Internet. That&#x27;s obviously not the most secure situation conceivable. To protect the roots they can&#x27;t be kept online, they usually live in dedicated hardware modules used only for relatively rare ceremonies like creating a new intermediate. Then the intermediates are kept online. If anything goes wrong it&#x27;s relatively painless to distrust a mere intermediate, whereas distrusting a root causes massive disruption ]<p>Let&#x27;s Encrypt provide a handy diagram:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;letsencrypt.org&#x2F;certificates&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;letsencrypt.org&#x2F;certificates&#x2F;</a><p>Anyway, what changes in January is <i>not</i> anything about the certificates you actually get from Let&#x27;s Encrypt. Not one byte. What changes is essentially metadata, starting in January the Let&#x27;s Encrypt backend system will by default stop giving subscribers a chain of certificates that proves this can be traced back to Identrust&#x27;s DST Root CA X3, and instead give you a chain that traces back to ISRG Root X1.<p><i>Your</i> certificate is the same either way, for most people it will say it was issued by R3 (the shorter name I mentioned above, began being used at the start of December so many Let&#x27;s Encrypt users haven&#x27;t got a certificate from R3 yet but will do so automatically when next renewing). What changes is the accompanying certificate for R3 itself, there are two versions of that certificate.<p>If you need to service clients which don&#x27;t yet trust ISRG Root X1 you can (tell your software to) continue to request the other version of R3 that&#x27;s signed by Identrust&#x27;s &quot;DST Root CA X1&quot; until later in 2021 when that expires.<p>But there is <i>no change</i> to the actual end subscriber &quot;leaf&quot; certificate and that&#x27;s a mistake in the linked article.<p>I thought we might see a HN link for Let&#x27;s Encrypt new intermediate R3 going live in the middle of the week, but we didn&#x27;t. So I guess that means it went so well that nobody even noticed.')
