In what way is traffic and speech in the same class?<p>The reason this becomes an absolute is, unlike with traffic, the decision about which speech is abusive is objective and itself easy to abuse. When there&#x27;s no way to talk about the abuse (a situation the abuser would create) then it will continue until the abuser&#x27;s ability to censor speech is removed. In the real world this ability is often removed as the result of some serious violence and so most people don&#x27;t like to create conditions that could lead to such a situation.<p>People sometimes say that speech in a democracy is a nicer alternative to violence.')
