First of all, a meaningful attack of this kind would occur when some data is uploaded - if it&#x27;s just uploaded, you can basically do stupid pranks like replacing words and graphics. But more importantly, in order to actually perform a MitM attack, you need to have access to some parts of the infrastructure of the victim that you normally have not. For example, if you can perform the MitM attack by hijacking DNS (on a local machine or local network level), you can perform much worse attacks than MiTM, and HTTPS cannot stop you. In such cases HSTS can be helpful, although in itself is not without issues.')
