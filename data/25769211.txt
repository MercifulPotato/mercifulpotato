Just widen anti-trust.<p>Back when we actually imagined that government could stand up to powerful companies, we dealt with the Railroads with the tools of anti-trust. The situation was almost comically similar:<p>+ New, hyped technology;<p>+ Which received huge capital investment from newly printed money;<p>+ And which lent itself to a natural monopoly;<p>+ Which crushed competitors;<p>+ By offering to buy them for high prices;<p>+ Or by severely undercutting competitors<p>We already did this, we already solved this problem. Issue is that it happened before any of us were born. So I guess we have to go through the pain of learning this lesson all over again. It should be plainly obvious that we haven&#x27;t even really started, as evidenced by the plaintive &quot;bUt WhAt Do wE DO aBoUT tEcH!?&quot; cry that comes out every time these companies flex their muscle.')
