We&#x27;ve had four? contact incidents in my family so far, two that have lead to mandatory quarantines. We were only contacted once by local authorities, after an infection spread shut down most of my son&#x27;s day care center. We were contacted days after everyone already knew what had happened and started to self quarantine, and, honestly, had it not happened at a day care, we likely wouldn&#x27;t have been contacted at all.<p>Mandatory masks also aren&#x27;t guaranteed to be effective. We had several people where I work get infected, even though they were (from what is being said), following appropriate measures.')
