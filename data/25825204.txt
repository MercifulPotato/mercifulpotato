That or discourage frequent engagement (the US consumes comparatively massive amounts of healthcare product and service with inefficient outcomes). Our present system is _designed_ to prevent price comparison and shopping around via price opacity, network lock-in, state-level artificial supply barriers, etc.<p>Universal coverage on par with Europe would mean we all start consuming less individually (which isnâ€™t a big deal to outcomes but not part of our culture), or we need to have a far more competitive environment for suppliers. Either would be better than what we have today, whether insurance is public, private, or a mix of both.')
