They just need to hash the sensitive n-grams (hopefully, a small part of the whole dataset) and store one bit per hash.<p>Alternatively, they could do something like GAN and have a &#x27;discriminator&#x27; classify if a sample is natural or synthetic. Then, at inference, condition to be original.<p>So, verbatim training data reproduction - I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to be a problem, I think the author is making too much of it.<p>On the contrary, let&#x27;s have this knob exposed and we could set it anywhere between original and copycat, at deployment time. Maybe you want to know the lyrics of a song, or how to fix a Python error (copycat model is best). Maybe you want an &#x27;original&#x27; essay for homework inspiration. Who knows? But the model should know PII and copyrighted text when it sees it.')
