I upgraded from a Pixel 2 XL to a Pixel 4 XL this August. I honestly felt that both were quite responsive. The Pixel 2 XL became less immediately responsive over time, and it seemed to correlate more with increased CPU load--newer, more feature-laden software. I do not perceive a responsiveness difference between the 4XL and the iPhone 12.')
