Running a large-enrollment course is more like running a small business&#x2F;group than most people realize. You need dozens of staff doing repetitive stuff that looks easy to automate from the outside but really isn&#x27;t.<p>Teaching doesn&#x27;t scale well, even in CS where things like auto-graders can do a lot of the work. And even in the most automatable set of CS courses (intro programming courses).<p>And teaching <i>poorly</i> has negative value add.<p>The original SICP recordings have been online for decades and are 100x better than some random post-doc&#x27;s first attempt at teaching python.
