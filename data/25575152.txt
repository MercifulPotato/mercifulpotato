It&#x27;s lighter and sturdier that alternatives. It&#x27;s also more expensive so you can put it in $60k car but not in $25k car.<p>Radar and ultrasonic sensors are cheap, low power and plentiful.<p>Putting several lidars on a car would be too expensive, would use too much power (less range) and there isn&#x27;t a supply chain to make 2 million a year just for Tesla (500k cars x 4 lidars per car).<p>It&#x27;s just isn&#x27;t possible to put a lidar today on a mass market car and Tesla wants to solve self-driving before lidar becomes cheap enough.')
