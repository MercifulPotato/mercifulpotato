I&#x27;m in Europe and always take my birthday off - I don&#x27;t understand why anybody would want to work on their birthday. Even if I don&#x27;t have plans to celebrate until the weekend the idea of working on my birthday is very depressing (in fact in rarely celebrate my birthday and if I do it&#x27;s something small like dinner with a couple of friends). To be honest I thought it would be more prevalent in Europe given we seem to get more time off and taking time off is less &#x27;frowned upon&#x27; (at least this is my experience compared with my US based colleagues).')
