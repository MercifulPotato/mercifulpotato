The lab only had so many editing stations and they were shared across multiple groups. So for each editing session we first had to copy the project from multiple CDRs onto the editing machine (which took ages on the 4x SCSI CD drives), edit, then burn the project to a set of CDs - performing various rituals to ensure the ROM image wouldn&#x27;t be corrupted by a butterfly coughing in the corner or something - clean up the HDD so the next group could get working and hope the CDRs were even readable.<p>The editing experience itself wasn&#x27;t great either: forget about real time scrubbing or full resolution previews.\nToday you can edit films on a phone much quicker, more comfortably and with significantly higher quality.\nNo disappointment there for sure.<p>Same goes for 3D modelling packages, rendering and just plain number crunching in Mathematica, Maple or MATLAB.<p>Word processing is the one area that simply is so primitive by its very nature, that it&#x27;s trivial to reach peak-efficiency without throwing tons of compute power and tech in general at it. If word processing is all you do, you don&#x27;t need more than a glorified electric typewriter.<p>For many, many other applications - and yes, that even includes just taking and sharing pictures in real time - today&#x27;s technology is vastly superior to anything the 80s and 90s had to offer.')
