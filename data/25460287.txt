I have not had many problems with PDF, certainly no more than with other document formats. I often use tools like pdftk [0] (as found on many Linux distributions) to split sections out of PDFs, create new ones out of single-page PDFs created with ImageMagick, create odd-even page versions etc. I generally do not touch the more &quot;advanced features&quot; like embedded JS (which I have disabled in all readers which support it), I just use it as a document format which more or less guarantees the resulting document looks the way it was meant to, plus or minus a few fonts. For that purpose it works works well enough.<p>The &quot;bunch of jpgs&#x2F;pngs&#x2F;pick your poison in a tar container&quot; format you describe exists in a fashion: Comic Book Archive, a format meant for and mostly used for comics. It consists of a compressed archive which contains sequentially numbered &quot;pages&quot; which can be JPEG, PNG or other image file formats. For pure image documents it can be used as a replacement for PDF but since it does not support text it can not be used for scanned OCR&#x27;ed documents. DjVu [2] does support a text layer but that comes at the cost of complexity, it is far from the simple container you propose. Since an OCR&#x27;ed text layer needs to save not only the text itself but also the location on the image for each character I don&#x27;t see any way to avoid complexity here.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pdflabs.com&#x2F;tools&#x2F;pdftk-server&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pdflabs.com&#x2F;tools&#x2F;pdftk-server&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Comic_book_archive" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Comic_book_archive</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DjVu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DjVu</a>')
