In order for anyone to get ahead, someone, somewhere else must lose. Historically, zero-sum economies make for some pretty shitty living standards for most folks.<p>Growth, at least in the short term (the 50-100 year timescale), makes it possible to have an economy where gains can be had without necessarily making other folks lose. The downside here is that growth can only go for so long before resource constraints of one form or another bite everyone in the butt.')
