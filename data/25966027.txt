I type very fast (140 WPM? I forget) but my technique is totally non standard. I hold my hands&#x2F;wrists at &quot;natural&quot; angles (as one would on a split keyboard), but on a standard keyboard. No &quot;home row&quot; for me. The letters in the middle of the keyboard are liable to be typed by either hand, depending on the word: I cannot use a split keyboard because of this. Thumb helps out with lower row sometimes. I can type single-handedly without much difficulty.<p>I credit this &quot;technique&quot; with not having developed any sort of keyboard-related RSI over 30 years of daily typing. Mice gave me terrible grip-related RSI after a decade (I now use a trackball), but not so with typing.<p>I assume I&#x27;m not unique in having stumbled naturally on this method. But it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;ve ever seen taught, probably because it&#x27;s not very &quot;orderly&quot;.')
