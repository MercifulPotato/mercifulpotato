Am I over-simplifying?<p>It&#x27;s not a contradiction.  For instance: maybe you have an specialist (a consensus epidemiologist) that says if we don&#x27;t do A, B, and C, then N thousand people will die.  Maybe you have another specialist (an consensus economist) that says if we do those things, it will cost the economy M billion dollars.  Maybe you have other specialists in those fields that say other things, but are fringe figures rather than consensus figures.<p>Now the political figure or ordinary person has a menu of options, and has to make the trade-offs between them.')
