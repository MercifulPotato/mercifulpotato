I’d like to see daytime vs overnight generation source breakdown.<p>Remember that hydro power doesn’t care about time of day and wind is often able to generate more overnight than during the day.<p>Further time of use rates can be tweaked as usage &amp; generation requires.  Maybe with a lot of EVs in the future &amp; solar installed we encourage people to charge mid-day at work or sunrise-&gt;commute start &amp; commute end-&gt;sundown, this doesn’t work great in winter but also electric use is lower in winter so maybe it nets out.')
