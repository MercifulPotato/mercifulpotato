I don&#x27;t think Trump can handle fixing this, and I honestly think we&#x27;re in over our heads as it is.<p>We really need UBI, stimulus, healthcare reform, and as much as I hate to say it Biden is the closest we get to that. But, vote who you feel is good and safe, I voted green. I&#x27;m not gonna vote shame anyone.<p>Just when you vote think about all that&#x27;s coming : Global Warming, Water Wars (already started in Mexico), Droughts, More Fires, Covid, Covid part 2, Income inequality raised a factor or two, joblessness, homelessness for millions, protests, uprisings, etc... Next two decades will make or break us.<p>TLDR: Trump probably would be best against china, and if that were the only issue facing us, it might be good enough reason to go against the grain, but there&#x27;s so much shit hitting the fan now, maybe we do need change.')
