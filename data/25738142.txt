Telegram now has auto delete for chats for e2e chats and even manual delete including deleting your partners messages if you want to (on both sides - obviously not in groups).\nSo yes the quick chat that you dont want to be archived anywhere can be deleted quickly and easily. Ofc this does not prevent the other side from storing it in advance but its rather unlikely and It would no longer be possible to proof that yous send these messages. It would just be a text file that could be crafted. So depending on what you sent you have plausible deniability even if a backup exists.')
