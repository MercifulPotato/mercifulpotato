Why?<p>I think there is a legitimate value in short summaries of long articles. Often you can extract 90% of the value with just 10% of the time (and more importantly 10% of the energy). I&#x27;m mainly reading articles on HN to extract value, not because I enjoy the experience of reading.<p>Also, a summary can indicate whether it&#x27;s worth it to read the full article. When it&#x27;s unclear from the title what some heavily upvoted article is about, should you spend the time to find out and risk wasting some of your limited time and mental energy?')
