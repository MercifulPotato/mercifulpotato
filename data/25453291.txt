Item(by='fatbird', descendants=None, kids=[25455703, 25455024, 25454064, 25453322, 25454603], score=None, time=1608187914, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25453108, text='Because the academic standard for research, and the original motivation for tenure, allows for researchers to criticize anyone, including their own institution, as long as it&#x27;s done and presented as the proper product of research.  In other words, if a researcher is doing their research properly, it shouldn&#x27;t matter if they&#x27;re attacking their own institution or even colleagues, because it passes scientific muster and the quality of the research is what justifies it.<p>When companies like Google or IBM employee researchers, they&#x27;re positioning themselves as supporting that model of inquiry, and the benefit for them is the credibility that comes from participation in scientific inquiry.  Gebru attacking Google&#x27;s AI practices actually lends Google credibility for disinterestedly supporting basic research and taking its results seriously.<p>A company that employs an ethicist and takes that ethicist&#x27;s output seriously even when it challenges the company is a company that genuinely cares about the academic standard in that field.  A company that hires an ethicist and then fires them when they point out the company&#x27;s wrongdoing is sounding an alarm about their own unethical conduct.<p>The part I struggle to understand here is how Google could be so stupid.  Who cares, from a commercial perspective, if an academic they employ drags them?  Keeping Gebru on payroll was straightforwardly purchased ethical credibility; firing her is a PR disaster and an open statement that their ethics AI group is a propaganda unit rather than a genuine research entity.  It would have been trivial, even beneficial, to air the academic dispute.  They gained nothing by retracting her paper and then firing her.')
