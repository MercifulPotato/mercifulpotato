There&#x27;s always one judge somewhere who&#x27;ll disagree with a President&#x27;s actions no matter who the President is and no matter what the action is, simply because there are so so many of them.<p>The SCOTUS noted that they may need to reign-in the scope of lower-court orders, and this just adds weight to the issue.<p>It&#x27;s particularly important because there&#x27;s a practical bias. Opponents of an executive action can district-shop, while it is difficult for the Executive to file a declaratory-judgment action in a (perceived to be) favorable jurisdiction. So we end up with nation-wide judgments which differ what what the other districts would have ruled... but the other districts never had an opportunity to rule. Then... since a ruling has been issued, they are largely blocked from ever ruling.<p>However, the SCOTUS is is a bit of a bind, because allowing nation-wide orders works very effectively in general civil &#x2F; criminal litigation. The problem has seemed to arise mostly in politically-charged issues where the government is a party.')
