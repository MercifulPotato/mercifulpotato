It makes little sense that the company should earn more from some employees than others for the same work.<p>I get it that often companies are specifically trying to encourage people to live near their office in expensive cities, but from a standpoint of value created for the company it seems irrelevant what an employees outgoings are.<p>Presumably greater competition from more places around the world would eventually drive down developer wages in major cities. I do hear a lot of justification in terms of market costs for labour varying by region, but it frequently comes from people who benefit from stock market prices that are not priced depending differently on region.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s naive and unrealistic but I&#x27;d actually like to see it cause cities to get too expensive and actually create benefit for bringing economic activity to places with lower market wages.<p>I know the UK most intimately, and I can only imagine how areas like the North East might look if money had flown out of London and allowed more people who can work remotely to live there at higher wages. Would it have caused rifts and gentrification? Would the additional money have made it into the local economy and created more local businesses and a better economy?<p>There are a lot of open questions and I&#x27;m certainly in the camp that supports non-regionalised pay - to the extent I&#x27;d sooner work for someone else than accept a pay cut for doing exactly the same work.')
