Easier in that raw storage bandwidth has increased faster than single core performance. Harder in that to access that bandwidth you have to optimize that latency for that bandwidth has not decreased, in fact in cloud it&#x27;s increased. I.e. cloud storage can be extremely fast, but only if it&#x27;s multi stream storage. Similarly cloud compute can be fast, but only if it&#x27;s multi thread CPU.<p>But the main point of (2008) is that a lot of the links are broken and tools mentioned outdated. The general concept &quot;you can probably optimize your storage access&quot; is still true though but usually any such concept is, it&#x27;s the details around current caveats that are interesting.')
