Explicit rules exist in most, but many go further with resisting deportations, exposing discrimination in workplaces, solidarity strikes with workers in exploited countries, etc.<p>I&#x27;d recommend you contact some local trade unionists, you&#x27;ll find that they&#x27;re overwhelmingly pro immigration and anti-racist. You&#x27;ll also find that marginalised groups (including immigrants) are vastly over-represented in the labour movement in general, since we are exploited more.')
