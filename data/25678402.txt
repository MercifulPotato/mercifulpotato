We also have significant evidence that the trump campaign <i>tried</i> to collide with Russia (he even published those self incriminating emails on Twitter).<p>Few people cast doubt on the votes themselves however in 2016 and that Trump was the legitimate winner.<p>In this case there is zero evidence of widespread voter fraud after being litigated through the courts and acknowledgement as such by many republican Secretaries of State, senators, etc.')
