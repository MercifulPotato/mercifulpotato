First, it assumes that average every day users navigate the windows file system by that URL bar or power shell which is definitely false.<p>But wait, where would every day users actually have more hands on experience with a path structure? Oh that&#x27;s right, their web browser where it&#x27;s all forward slashes. Windows is the outlier here, not Linux&#x2F;Unix systems. They&#x27;re the ones who should change.')
