Keep salary how it is, give me free education including University (as we had 10 years ago), give us free healthcare (which we&#x27;re clinging onto), give us decent pensions (which have got a lot worse over the last couple of decades), give us affordable housing. Let us choose our work location, so we don&#x27;t have to commute to London or anywhere (COVID may actually improve this!).<p>Unfortunately UK doesn&#x27;t highly value technical skills - real engineers (civil, electric, mechanical) are even worse off. To improve things many have been forced to go to Asia, US or Germany.<p>It would be nice to earn more as a SE, but not without retaining the stuff in the first list.')
