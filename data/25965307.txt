It&#x27;s essentially (the classic) ESP32 cut to a single core, 320KB RAM, and with Bluetooth removed; however it does include USB.<p>There&#x27;s also ESP32-S3 which is dual core, with more RAM, USB, and Bluetooth, but I&#x27;m not sure any boards are available yet.<p>All of that not to be confused with ESP32-C3 which is a single-core RISC-V without USB.<p>And yes, their naming is confusing.<p>edit: Adafruit has some boards with ESP32-S2. If you get a random board from elsewhere, there are good chances it will come with a USB-to-serial chip, which you don&#x27;t want if you need to use native USB. So check.')
