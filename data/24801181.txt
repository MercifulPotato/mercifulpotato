But you know, there&#x27;s lots of work and it is great when people push together.\n\n    Me: Ok good, yeah I like my work and I like helping others but, I also appreciate my personal life. So... no problem if I decide not coming on Saturday right?\n\n    Boss: MMhhgh yeah, no problem, but you know, we like to think you are COMMITED to our startup mission.\n\n\n</code></pre>\nAnd, then they get angry when I don&#x27;t go on Saturdays. If you want me to go on Saturdays just put it in the darn contract and tell that as part of the terms when we are negotiating, then I&#x27;ll walk out and we will all be happy.<p>Same here, if the developer wanted something to happen, then he should have put it in the license. Otherwise, there&#x27;s no reason to be whining that something that was NOT expected to happen (as per the license) did not happen.')
