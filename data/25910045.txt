I can evaluate its performance on the target system. Now if I had to write software for a system and speed was critical and I could choose the type of memory to use, then you bet I would be reading up on this subject.<p>Differences between types of memory don&#x27;t just matter when you&#x27;re picking what hardware to purchase. It also matters greatly when trying to understand <i>why</i> your code achieves a certain level of performance. Understanding the characteristics of your memory matters even if you&#x27;re targeting a single fixed hardware platform that you can profile your code on.')
