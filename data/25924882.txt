Many of us wore sunglasses and looked away from the sun before totality to get our eyes a bit dark-adapted. And then when someone called out &quot;totality!&quot; we turned around, took off the sunglasses and used our binoculars or telescopes if we had them, and viewed the corona directly.<p>And no, no eye damage.')
