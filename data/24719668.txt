I&#x27;m not making up &quot;fringe scenarios&quot;. I have clearly (I think) explained how, given the problem as stated, switching is not necessarily beneficial, and can be harmful. You need to make an additional assumption (that Monty necessarily behaves in a certain way) that is not stated in the problem to get to the &quot;always switch&quot; answer.<p>By the way, once you make that assumption, those other scenarios you presented are also excluded.')
