I&#x27;ve seen they&#x27;ve fixed the screenshot program though (which I remember to have been an issue on older versions).<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to 21.04 for my next attempt to switch, maybe by then Firefox&#x27;s native wayland support will have progressed as well. After all what&#x27;s the point of Wayland when most of your software uses xwayland :).')
