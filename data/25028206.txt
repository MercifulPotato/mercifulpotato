I find the platform buggy, so buggy that I can&#x27;t imagine others using it. I&#x27;ve had ads disappear from the dashboard without explanation, and other ads spend several days awaiting approval. Does anyone have advice on getting better support from TikTok or a guide they could point me to? Thank you.')
