But one thing I find sorely lacking &amp; so far irreplaceable is the spontaneous interactions that used to happen. You know, water cooler talk, catching up with a friend you run into, side conversations before a meeting etc.<p>I was wondering if there&#x27;s a way to build an app that can help you &quot;bump into&quot; your coworkers again, only when you&#x27;re on break, but I was curious if people even had this problem in the first place?')
