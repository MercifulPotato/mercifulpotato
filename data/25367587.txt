If your eyes don&#x27;t light up when you hear &#x27;Clifton&#x27;s Cafeteria,&#x27; or &#x27;Pappy and Harriet&#x27;s,&#x27; or &#x27;half-day boat&#x27; what on earth are you doing here?<p>This state is one of the most unique and incredible places in the country. I can drive from the lowest point in the continental United States (Badwater) to the foot of the highest point (Whitney) in a couple of hours. That&#x27;s absolutely <i>magical.</i> I love this state with a deep passion, and I know many of its nooks and crannies (still exploring and learning). That&#x27;s why I will never leave.<p>If you don&#x27;t do <i>any</i> of that stuff and you just sit in a bubble writing code all day why on earth would you stay? Just takes parking away from the people that <i>actually</i> enjoy California for the magical place that it is.<p>I&#x27;m happy to pay higher taxes. It helps keep this state humming along as the 5th largest economy on the planet.')
