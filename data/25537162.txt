I have felt the anger and shock that Nick faces.<p>My gripe was that if management wants me to handle all aspects of a project, why can&#x27;t they just spell it out? What about communicating this to other stakeholders? Do I barge into meetings and tell people in sister teams to drop their other work and start listening to me because Gloria asked me to change my shape to a full circle?<p>The hand off from regular shape to wholesome shape is not obvious to Nick. And even if it was, they have no authority or power or resources to drive &quot;others&quot; until Gloria spells it out at least one time.')
