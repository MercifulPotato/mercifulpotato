One of the things I&#x27;ve learned, in as much as I can, is I don&#x27;t tell anyone.  I&#x27;d rather be rude than explain I&#x27;m in pain.<p>Not because I don&#x27;t appreciate sympathy.  Not because I&#x27;m ashamed.<p>It&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t want your advice on how to make the pain go away or to deal with it.  I&#x27;m tired of advice.  I&#x27;ve got too much advice.  I try things, I research issues.  I talk to doctors.  What your Aunt did that had a similar case to me 30 years ago to get better isn&#x27;t interesting, it&#x27;s an anecdote.  I&#x27;m tired of hearing of woo remedies.  If you have research, fine, I&#x27;ll read it.  One day.  Maybe months from now.  I am not your guinea pig.  I am not going to change my treatment regimen based off your advice tomorrow.<p>Sorry, had to get that off my chest.  It&#x27;s tiring.  More so than the pain sometimes.')
