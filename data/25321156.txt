I know business owners want to peg their hopes on that.<p>Look at other countries where everything is nearly completely open.  Dining, theaters, etc are still down revenue wise.  There will be ebbs and flows were people get sick of staying in and COVID fatigued and go dine out, then as cases or hospitalizations rise they naturally self distance or stay in.<p>A restaurant might be able to survive that, but it&#x27;s punishing and I&#x27;m willing to bet most won&#x27;t.  You can&#x27;t just stop and start a restaurant on a whim.  Look at NYC where Broadway made a pre-emptive decision to shut down until May of next year because of crap like that.<p>I guess leave it up to us Americans to fly in the face of common sense, though.')
