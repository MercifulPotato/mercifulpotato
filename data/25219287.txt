I have used OBS, and it does work, but it is complex enough and fiddly enough that operating it distracts me from my presentation.<p>This mmhmm app lets me do the key things OBS does – shrink myself to a corner of the window, with my presentation taking up the whole screen, jump to a live demo while keeping me in the corner — more simply, so that it is not a distraction to what I am presenting or demoing.<p>I use it every week. I work remotely, so these meetings are how I present myself at work. In that context, $10 a month is nothing; it doesn&#x27;t even merit a second&#x27;s hesitation.')
