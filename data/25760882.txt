Seen in the SQL area: Code has been created to do a simple task. Code does it&#x27;s job. Data gets bigger and bigger. Upon analysis we found out that Code is very suboptimal, no thought put into indexing, partitioning or operating on set-level overall.<p>SQL isn&#x27;t complex to learn and to be honest, it&#x27;s not difficult most of the time. But there are points in knowledge where people think: &quot;That&#x27;s it, i figured it out&quot; and the general topic is sooo much more complex underneath. This hidden complexity leads to statements like yours, given off by relative beginners (not assuming you are one).')
