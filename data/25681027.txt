Apple-supplied monitoring tools report that M1 under full load (all CPU and GPU cores) can draw over 30 watts.  Laptop displays don&#x27;t consume 150 watts.  If anything, the displays in either of the M1 portables likely consume about 5 times less than 30W, even at full brightness.<p>&quot;ARM won&#x27;t play nice with the larger CPUs they want to make&quot; - wat? Apple holds an architectural license. This means they paid a lot upfront a long time ago and therefore have a more or less perpetual right to design their own Arm cores without input from Arm.<p>&quot;a competent graphics solution&quot; - Also wat? M1 has an excellent GPU. It doesn&#x27;t compete with discrete GPUs that use 300 watts, but that&#x27;s fine: M1 is the chip for entry level Macs, designed for the smallest and lightest segments of their notebook line. And in that product segment, it has been every bit as much a revelation as the CPU.  It&#x27;s very fast, and uses little power given the performance.<p>What exactly do you think is going to happen when they scale that basic GPU design up?  Despite your dismissiveness, in modern silicon architecture energy efficiency is incredibly important: for any given power budget, the more efficient you are the more performance you can deliver. The performance Apple gets out of about 10W on M1 suggests they&#x27;ll have few problems building a larger GPU to compete with Nvidia and AMD discrete GPUs.')
