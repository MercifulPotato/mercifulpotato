You will probably not find anyone advocating disabling swap.  I do not run X11 anymore.  I stay in VGA textmode.

Happy to walk you through it though if you want to try NetBSD.<p>Chromebooks are claimed to be 100% safe from certain types of attacks.  The developers came up with this silly &quot;whitewash&quot; gimmick.  Their motivation for a disk-less-like system is to force users to store personal data in the cloud.  Ugh.  Well, the disk-less systems I have been creating for recreational use long before Chromebooks existed are just as safe.  Probably safer because I do not use a graphics layer or a web browser with Javascript interpeter.')
