He mentioned that in order to rent them in the state of Texas you actually need a heavy machinery license (the same necessary for excavators, bobcats and bulldozers).<p>This guy was great though, he also helped out with my 30th birthday where my friends and I went out to a friend&#x27;s ranch and just &quot;played&quot; with heavy machinery for a weekend.')
