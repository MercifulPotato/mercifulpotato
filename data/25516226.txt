You shouldn&#x27;t of course confuse &quot;quality&quot; with &quot;luxury&quot;, but for the price you pay, you (usually) get stuff that looks Ok and will do its job reasonably well for a pretty long time. Also, everyone likes to complain about how difficult IKEA furniture is to assemble and how bad the instructions are. We recently ordered a custom-made bed from a smaller company, and the quality was undeniably better than IKEA (OTOH it also cost about 5x as much as the average IKEA bed), but still the instructions skipped about half of the information required...')
