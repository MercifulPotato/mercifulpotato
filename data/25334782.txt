Usability could be better, that&#x27;s a fact, but it worked flawless for me over the last 8 months or so and if people are used to MS&#x2F;whereby&#x2F;zoom&#x2F;whatever then we typically get comments halfway into an interview day that the video hasn&#x27;t crashed yet, that the audio still doesn&#x27;t lag by 5 minutes and that nobody has been booted out for no particular reason yet. That&#x27;s how used people are to these glitches.<p>I&#x27;m not a big fan of Google, but the video meeting software (and the little pc that you can buy with a dedicated setup including super good echo cancellation) is at the moment best of the litter.')
