You can google what are the &quot;top journals for &lt;field in question&gt;&quot;. You can check the publisher. IEEE and Springer for example tend to be genuine.<p>But you still have to look at the individual paper and can&#x27;t believe it just based on a single article. Research articles are for sharing results among experts (and for advancing the careers of researchers), they are not aimed at laypeople. It&#x27;s easy to misinterpret them if you lack the background knowledge.<p>Even in non-predatory journals many results fail to replicate and are produced due to a publish or perish pressure. You&#x27;re better off learning from textbooks so you get info that has been verified, digested and distilled and represent consensus. Cutting edge research proposes new ideas by one group of authors, it&#x27;s not a consensus yet.')
