It is therefore a bit strange that the pattern has resurfaced lately, and has been heavily used in the implementation of UIs and webservers ...<p>You could argue that in small systems (compared to OSes), you can keep latency under control, but systems tend to grow, and modularity of the systems works against this (modules don&#x27;t need to know what other modules do or how long they take to finish their tasks).')
