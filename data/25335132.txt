In short, Basquiat is appreciated because he was a visceral, anti-establishment, extremely young guy whose work was raw and real, in comparison to the somewhat corporatized minimal aesthetic [1] that was popular at the time. He was also a really good storyteller (most famous artists are) and crafted a great narrative around his life.<p>Basquiat&#x27;s work is basically &quot;80s NYC&quot; in high art form. There was so much creativity coming out of the city at that time, it was really magical, especially compared to Lower Manhattan today.<p>If I had to make a tech world comparison, it might be something like early Apple Computer against IBM. Hippies in garages vs. the suits.<p>The film <i>Basquiat</i> is pretty good dramatization of his life. So is <i>Downtown 81</i>, which is a creative film starring Basquiat himself.
