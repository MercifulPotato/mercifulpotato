About 50% of the time the Chromecast Google TV we just bought can adjust the tv&#x27;s audio itself (unless we are casting to it, in which case it does nothing except pops up a notice to check settings, which we have thoroughly checked).<p>But there&#x27;s still a lot that can not be done. I change my Samsung monitor&#x27;s brightness, gamma, &amp; &quot;lean-back&quot; view mode multiple times a week. On my projector I switch between &quot;quiet&quot; &amp; normal mode, &amp; adjust keystone &amp; zoom depending on position.<p>It&#x27;d be awesome to de-interface the TV, to create machine-to-machine interfaces that let the TV be a &quot;dumb&quot; screen while still being able to fiddle it&#x27;s knobs. We could definitely go middle-way by returning to the tv having an &quot;on screen display&quot; only, some menus for configuration, but I&#x27;d love to also expand the digital controllability of these things, such that Rokus &amp; GTVs &amp;c can integrate with, become a comprehensive modular hub&#x2F;brain for controlling the TV.')
