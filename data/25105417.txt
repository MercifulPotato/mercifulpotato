He thought he was, did it for a year, and realized he was not cut out for it.<p>I don&#x27;t understand this comment and the other similar ones acting like they are somehow adding insight... yes, he couldn&#x27;t make it as an independent developer, that is literally the point of the essay.<p>Repeating the reasons he lays out in the essay and saying &quot;yeah, you won&#x27;t succeed as an independent developer&quot; seems a little like hearing someone at Alcoholics Anonymous tell their story and then responding, &quot;Yeah, it sounds like you can&#x27;t have a healthy relationship with alcohol&quot;')
