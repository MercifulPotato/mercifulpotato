As developers, it’s important to have a strong sense of our broader architectural ecosystems<p>Maybe I’m misinterpreting this, but those two sentences contradict themselves in my opinion.<p>Now either developers need to fully understand all the different micro-services, and understand how they all work together. Or developers will lose sight of the bigger architecture and end up specialising in only a few services.<p>But more importantly, I doubt micro-services will solve their problem of their monolith not being modular. That seems like an architectural problem that can also be solved in a monolith.<p>But in general, I have never seen a company that switched to micro-services, and didn’t end up regretting it a few years later.')
