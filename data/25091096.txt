We saw the writing on the wall around OS X 10.11 when major studios asked us to support Linux and subsequently bought $40k Linux-based mixing desks.<p>The fact is that any professional customer that uses NI has jumped ship years ago, so for Native Instruments the Mac market is shrinking in revenue, while growing in costs.<p>In my case, Windows and Linux are now paying for feature development. We still snort out OSX binaries from an old 10.9 xcode, but those aren&#x27;t notarized because no paying customer has asked for it yet.<p>This is what happens if you don&#x27;t value the time of your third party developers, for example with useless updates and poor documentation. I&#x27;m sure Apple will spin this as &quot;the app store provides&quot;, but there&#x27;s only so much work you can put in for a platform with a median lifetime app revenue of &lt;$1000.<p>In short, professional movie studios have voted with their money, and now the market follows suit by canceling Mac support.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;avid.secure.force.com&#x2F;pkb&#x2F;articles&#x2F;en_US&#x2F;Compatibility&#x2F;macOS-Big-Sur-Support" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;avid.secure.force.com&#x2F;pkb&#x2F;articles&#x2F;en_US&#x2F;Compatibili...</a>')
