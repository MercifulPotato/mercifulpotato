To other readers, i.reddit.com will solve all your mobile woes.<p>As for me, I find the front page to already be a cesspool of pretty shallow political takes, star wars memes, gaming news and awful twitter screenshots, all of which are pretty repulsive. I also get the sense that Reddit is used more by a new generation of kids, about half my age. I guess one of the disadvantages of being over thirty is that you lose the appetite to engage with teenagers&#x2F;early-20s people who are on their own journey towards maturity.')
