Both, however, require you to distribute source code and sublicense when certain conditions are met. The conditions are just different: GPL requires that you fulfill the copyleft when you give people a copy of the program while AGPL expands that to making it available over a network. Both of these ultimately let you have the same Freedoms as long as you don&#x27;t take action to restrict anyone else&#x27;s.<p>Whether or not a copyleft can be considered to be Free is a long-standing argument between the &quot;GNU&quot; and &quot;BSD&quot; schools of thought, albeit the former has long since won out in the broader marketplace of Free Software. I personally hold copyleft as Free, because the conditions that you have to satisfy in order to exercise your freedoms are marginal. In contrast, Polyform and TimescaleDB place a whole host of permanent restrictions on user freedom. It&#x27;s not &quot;oh you need to give someone the source if you&#x27;re also giving them a binary&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;you can&#x27;t ever host this on a cloud server without paying us&quot;. You are defining a particular use of the software that only you can enjoy and nobody else can.')
