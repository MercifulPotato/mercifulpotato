You can&#x27;t arbitrarily read&#x2F;write to the file system, acting as if there&#x27;s only one instance of the server running (if you plan to run hundreds or thousands). So even by waving the cloud &#x27;magic wand&#x27;, you still need to understand writing code in a cloud-friendly way. So in some sense, it&#x27;s a shared responsibility between the vendor and engineering. You need to understand how to apply the tools being given to you.')
