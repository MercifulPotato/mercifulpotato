If you look at the history of neuroscience, major leaps forward have almost always been driven by a new tool: whether it&#x27;s a new dye, or a new imaging technology, every time we have gotten a better look at how the physiology of the brain actually works, it has elucidated topics we could only speculate about before.<p>So it&#x27;s easy to poo-poo something like this from the sidelines, but if we can get more detailed information about the behavior or neurotransmitter concentrations over time, even if it&#x27;s just a point measurement this could be an input to more accurate models which could help explain all kinds of things about how the brain actually works.')
