They don&#x27;t have a responsibility to publish any particular review in the store. They&#x27;re free to include&#x2F;exclude&#x2F;weight the data they receive to give you star ratings for apps in any way they&#x27;d like. Vote clumps like this one tend to make star ratings less trustworthy as a measure of the true quality of an app, so I&#x27;d expect an app store operator to discount them.')
