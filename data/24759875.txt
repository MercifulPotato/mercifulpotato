Is that true?  I don&#x27;t agree; in fact, I&#x27;d rather be concise and communicate well than vomit more words onto the screen.<p>Additionally, beyond Dvorak, is there a better way to increase typing speed than spending what must be hours and hours building a bespoke solution for each one of your machines?  And what is the cost of the inevitable tsunami of errors you make in the learning process?  Are these neural pathways more valuable than say, learning a new language or practicing a different skill?')
