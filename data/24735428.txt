But how one does that when the subscription cannot be managed without an Apple device&#x2F;account and there&#x27;s no way to &#x27;pass&#x27; your subscription directly to the merchant?<p>That&#x27;s pretty much the definition of lock-in - there&#x27;s no way to cut Apple out. Apple on the other hand could remove the user out by banning all its subscriptions - which is far more damaging than any one merchant deciding to do so. The power imbalance is utterly on Apple&#x27;s side.')
