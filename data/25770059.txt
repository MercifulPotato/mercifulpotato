Think the typical 4channer type people. Obviously not all but when I had a chat with a couple of women from my class, they mentioned it was common to get hit on all the time during group projects when they were there to study and get talked down on as if they don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on.<p>I see similar behaviours to how men sometimes &quot;gatekeep&quot; games or even anything computer related. It&#x27;s quite common to hear of stories women face on online games when they open their mic.<p>Is there a chance they&#x27;d avoid it based on the type of people they might face? Maybe.')
