While I agree GDELT doesn&#x27;t have the kind of coverage some people may be looking for, I think it&#x27;s the best source for world news insights.<p>Oh nice, I actually saw Newscatcher on Rapid API but didn&#x27;t see the marketing page. It looks like a great product, and I think suited for large-scale solutions. TidalWaves will likely find a niche for people making visualizations and personal apps.<p>What I want to do is make a mature pipeline that handles at least 90% of what amateur and solo users would want to use GDELT for, so hopefully people see the value in that. After all, I could make this visualization using the API - so I&#x27;m sure people can think of many other cool uses for it.<p>Also, thanks for reaching out, I&#x27;d definitely like to collaborate in the coming months.')
