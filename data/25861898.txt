Get groceries? Pay for an Uber? Tip someone?<p>I&#x27;m sure someone out there insists gold is a perfectly legitimate currency for day to day life, and it&#x27;s not 100% incorrect. But gold is very inconvenient to attempt to use for quick transactions. You would typically exchange gold for some other currency to do day to day spending. The same is basically true of bitcoin now as well, which was (arguably) not the original intent at all.')
