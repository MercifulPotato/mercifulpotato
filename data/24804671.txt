It really is lovely sitting at 10pm with a sangria in hand on a historic staircase of a palace and watching the nightlife milling around.<p>But all this flocking is temporary. People do not move there to start businesses. (They do to Gibraltar, but that is a tax haven.) They just enjoy they stay, spend some money on recreation and fly back to gloomy-but-rich Amsterdam, London or Hamburg.')
