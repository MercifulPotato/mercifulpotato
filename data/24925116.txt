Simply from a standpoint about caring about labour practices, and workers rights, this is concerning. Is this happening using US prison labour? Chinese labour under a government that is actively committing genocide against the Uyghurs? I hope not, but with that info obscured, there&#x27;s no way to know if using this service passes a basic ethics smell test.')
