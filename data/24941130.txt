You get a detailed overview of all the important network technologies.<p>Next for TCP&#x2F;IP; i suggest <i>The TCP&#x2F;IP Guide: A Comprehensive, Illustrated Internet Protocols Reference</i> followed by the Stevens&#x27; books already mentioned by others.<p>Finally to understand the interaction between HTTP application protocol and the underlying TCP&#x2F;IP suite i suggest <i>Web Protocols and Practice: Http&#x2F;1.1, Networking Protocols, Caching, and Traffic Measurement</i>.<p>Only after you have some idea of the above should you look at the Linux specific implementation for which <i>Understanding Linux Network Internals: Guided Tour to Networking on Linux</i> is a good reference.')
