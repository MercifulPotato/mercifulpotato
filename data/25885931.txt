Over 85% of all bitcoins are mined in these countries:<p>- 65% is mined in China with 721.2 g&#x2F;kWh<p>- 7.2% in US: 417.305  g&#x2F;kWh<p>- 6.9% in Russia: 517  g&#x2F;kWh<p>- 6.17% in Kazakhstan (couldn&#x27;t fine specific figure but around 80% produced power comes from Coal plants so gCO2&#x2F;kWh must be very high)<p>The only country in the list which close to 0g&#x2F;kWh is Norway at 0.48%.')
