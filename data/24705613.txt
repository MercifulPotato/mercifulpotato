He predicted the Trump victory in 2016, and mostly pointed out the weakness of the herd to manipulation and is mostly sticking with his sentiment this time around as well (although I don’t know if he adjusted given recent events).<p>For example, he pointed out that a lot of this country is truly prejudiced and the Democrats are bungling their messaging by positioning themselves around defunding the police and protests, which illicit primal fears amongst a large voting block. Trump can manipulate these emotions easily, so beware of these dynamics.')
