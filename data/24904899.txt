Markagrensen is upheld by a actual law today.<p>If you look up a map of Oslo, look at (1) the large green areas around the city and (2) the apartment buildings and houses built only meters from the border. That&#x27;s the effect of putting a seemingly generous limit on growth 100 years ago.<p>Some people in the green movement uphold Markagrensen as a victory for the environment. I disagree: It pushes people to live in houses in the suburbs instead of in a densely populated city. It is a victory for friluftsliv.')
