It&#x27;s not, and you know it isn&#x27;t.<p>I think the scale is a good point (no idea what your original post contained since it was flagged before I read it). Twitter and a handful of other social media companies handle (by which I mean &quot;choose who gets to see what content&quot;) such an enormous volume of speech that its moderation policies can influence elections and therefore public policy. Moreover, their power is inherently anti-competitive--users can&#x27;t take their network to another platform because these platforms don&#x27;t interoperate by design. It seems like this is an antitrust issue, especially since these networks tend to lobby together to protect their interests.')
