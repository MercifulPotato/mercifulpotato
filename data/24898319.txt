Item(by='1241414315', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603731548, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24894826, text='&gt; forced hysterectomies are performed on undocumented immigrants in concentration camps show that it&#x27;s not really about racism for the people that are doing this.<p>The accused doctor is named Mahendra Amin, is an immigrant, is brown (if you couldn&#x27;t tell from his name), and has a history of medicare&#x2F;medicaid fraud (he settled with the State of Georgia). How did what is most likely just more insurance fraud from a brown immigrant quack with a history of insurance fraud become &quot;Nazi forced sterilizations in concentration camps?&quot;<p>Ironically, I&#x27;m more likely to be downvoted&#x2F;flagged for pointed out the doctor&#x27;s name, race, and immigration status than you are for spreading misinformation.')
