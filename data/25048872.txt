We tried to make this app dead easy to use and share sensitive information. Also, the premium plans with other password managers that offer sharing can run high for family plans. This app doesn&#x27;t also have a restriction on how many ppl you share with. Essentially, if you are running a small business and need to share some sensitive information with your co-workers, you can do that too with no problem.')
