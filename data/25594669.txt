It seems, however, that the reward she was optimizing for (building a platform around her persona, effectively turning her life into a consumer brand) was not the same as everyone else in that circle. Her shamelessness seems like a very effective policy, in that context.<p>Ibra (one of my all-time favorite players) is also a perfect example of this. Despite being a high-level competitor and objectively world-class player, he is also interested in using his personal brand as a monetizable tool in a way that many other top players do not (though, it&#x27;s fair to mention that players like Maradona have done this historically as well). For example, Ibra&#x27;s move to the MLS—and the fact that he was paid a record breaking 7.5 million per year—certainly required him to be a great player, but it&#x27;s also fair to say that the platform he brought with him made him especially attractive to a team looking to sell jerseys and season tickets.<p>So yes, I think you&#x27;re right that the table stakes to shamelessness being effective are the essential building blocks of success in one&#x27;s field—Paris Hilton&#x2F;Donald Trump have to have wealth and access, Zlatan has to be world-class, etc.—but I think that what that shamelessness buys them is a different kind of success, one they might not achieve without shamelessness (or without some parallel promotional strategy).')
