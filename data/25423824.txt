It&#x27;s primarily for legacy reasons, but we&#x27;re seeing actually a really interesting phenomenon: because WhatsApp exists as a way to ping someone with an emergency request that <i>should</i> disrupt their flow, we can have a culture where direct messages and mentions in Slack should be answered reasonably promptly but not immediately, and should not disrupt bandwidth. So Slack, even with little red icons appearing, becomes a safe haven for creative thought, and operational craziness can be isolated elsewhere.<p>I wonder how many more productivity and sanity points society would have gained in the past few years if Slack had built in an @@ or @! symbol for a &quot;SuperPing&quot; that&#x27;s differentiated from a normal ping (five knocks after the brush, perhaps?). Or even provide a structured way to set a priority on a mention, letting you reference that someone was involved in a thing you&#x27;re writing about or that they should see it as an FYI, but make it clear that they don&#x27;t need to worry about it immediately. You can make the UI have sane defaults so it&#x27;s not overwhelming, then you either let culture sort itself out if people are misusing the system, or otherwise ensure there are speed-bumps to misuse.<p>It&#x27;s ironic that even YouTube streamers benefit from being able to triage Superchats, with color coding based on the monetary value the sender ascribes to getting the streamer&#x27;s immediate attention. Why is donation-based entertainment more sane than the business environment?<p>At the end of the day, humans don&#x27;t work well when they&#x27;re &quot;always on.&quot; There&#x27;s a balance between UI simplicity and the fundamental UX principal that not everything can be important. I do wonder if there&#x27;s research on how many classes of things people can handle on a screen - rather than a binary classification between mentions and non-mentions, is there anything preventing us from handling a third priority level?')
