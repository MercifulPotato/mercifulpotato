Well, if it did, then it would have to save and restore those registers on each system call, and that would make domain crossing even more expensive. So this was a conscious decision in the Linux kernel.<p>I don&#x27;t follow. So a syscall that could profit from AVX can&#x27;t use it because then <i>all</i> syscalls would have to restore AVX registers? Why can&#x27;t the restoring just happen specifically in those syscalls that make use of AVX?')
