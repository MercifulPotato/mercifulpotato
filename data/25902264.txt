There is limited timeline where TSMC will serve as security shield for the island.<p>I see a lot of discussion here that US would glass TSMC fabs if China ever attempted takeover, when realistically China would be the ones to disrupt TSMC proactively and prematurely if PRC indigenous semi industry reaches useful levels. Catching up to EUV is much harder than undermining it. Chinese military modernization = the first island chain strategy is dead. Taiwan never got security guarantee precisely because other strategy to contain China existed (malacca &#x2F; sloc chokepoint), TSMC dominance is an aberration that no one apart from Taiwan is interested in. Hence I wonder how smooth the Arizona plant will go, possibly foxconn Wisconsin redux, but more pressing.')
