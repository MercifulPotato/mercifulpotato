That&#x27;s the barrier to entry, because no one wants to hear a musician who doesn&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing.<p>Jimi Hendrix. Elton John. David Bowie. The list goes on.<p>Just because you are happy with an arbitrary barrier to entry does not mean that everyone around you must be.<p>Music is a wonderful thing. Anyone can learn to make it. Telling someone they need to learn their scales first is just condescending.<p>&gt; As efficient as theoretically possible, ever, for the rest of time? Probably not. As efficient as is practicable by today&#x27;s professional musicians? Yes for sure.<p>&gt; But improvements are always welcome.<p>Hah. You have already proved this statement wrong. You do not welcome changes. You approach the very <i>idea</i> of progress with condescending skepticism.<p>Need more examples? How about the article we are discussing? The fact is that it is prohibitively difficult to market a piano with slightly smaller keys. Getting something like the Janko keyboard to get traction in this industry is practically impossible, and not because Janko&#x27;s design lacks merit.<p>Look: Nowhere did I say that musicians shouldn&#x27;t learn scales. That&#x27;s absurd. Neither did I complain that, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to learn scales, because it&#x27;s too hard.&quot; On the contrary, I <i>have</i> learned scales. I have been playing music since childhood, and am quite proficient.<p>My point is that learning scales is <i>arbitrarily</i> difficult, by nature of the way we write them and talk about them. We have Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, and Locrian. We call Ionian &quot;Major&quot;, and Aeolian &quot;Minor&quot;. When we write anything that isn&#x27;t Ionian, we use &quot;accidentals&quot;. It&#x27;s a mess. We can do better. We can make learning scales a simpler process. We can make better abstractions for them, which will make it easier to talk about more complicated theory.<p>Instead, people like you insist we all stick with 17th century western notation for eternity, because that&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve got, and it&#x27;s good enough. People like you insist that new players <i>must</i> be motivated to learn overtly unnecessary skills, for no reason other than &quot;that&#x27;s how piano keyboards are shaped&quot;. In doing so, you turn away intelligent people who are more interested in <i>music</i> than slogging through the centuries of cruft that traditional western music theory is made of.')
