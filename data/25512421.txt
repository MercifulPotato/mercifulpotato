Will they be as heavy as Go&#x27;s ? Go has 2 mutexes and some other fluff\n    2. Are they &quot;close-safe&quot; like, if I send something to the channel, and it is nil or closed, will it panic crash or stuck forever like Go does, or V is trying to be &quot;panic-free&quot;? Will &quot;prohibited&quot; operation return an error or panic&#x2F;stuck?\n    3. If channels are closeable, will I be able to close them twice without panic (closing closed door might creak, but IMHO should not burn the house down...)\n</code></pre>\n(At some point in the past I did suggest adding an error to channel operations so it will not panic if I am ready to intercept an error, but that was rejected)')
