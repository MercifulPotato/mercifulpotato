Item(by='GordonS', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608504508, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25489407, text='&gt; In Europe you get security + enough money to life comfortably, but not really enough to accumulate any capital and gain financial freedom<p>That&#x27;s not true. I&#x27;m almost 40, and excluding pensions and capital tied up in my home, I currently have around £500,000 in savings. This wasn&#x27;t particularly difficult to achieve on a software engineer salary in Scotland; we&#x27;ve travelled the globe for several years, have a nice house, 2 cars etc. We absolutely plan on retiring at around 50 at <i>latest</i>. Now with 20 years&#x27; experience I make €65k&#x2F;y from my day job as a software architect&#x2F;tech lead&#x2F;lead dev (working 30h in a 4-day week). My wife and I also run a B2B micro-ISV that&#x27;s made around €100k&#x2F;y for the past few years (it was a slow climb to that figure over 10 years).<p>So, we have a household income of around €165k (~$200k) - certainly more than most in the UK, yet nowhere <i>near</i> what I could make in SV on my own - and still certainly enough money that we hardly need to think about it, and with considered financial planning we can easily retire early.<p>I&#x27;d far prefer to live in Europe than the US - I work way less hours, I get way more vacation days, our healthcare system won&#x27;t bankrupt us (unfortunately I know firsthand it&#x27;s <i>far</i> from perfect, but it&#x27;s definitely still a boon for society), losing my job at any point in my career wouldn&#x27;t have me out on the street, I don&#x27;t need to especially fear the police, and (in general) people have a progressive attitude that serves to benefit all of society.')
