Which is pretty amazing considering it is targeted at getting work done. My 9th Feb i7 no-brand clevo manages to not throttle unless I max out both CPU and GPU. Of course, I have set the fan to ramp up to max instead of throttling, but neither the XPS nor mbp has that option.<p>Which is atrocious. I&#x27;d rather sacrifice battery for better cooling if it means I can actually use whatever fancy processor I have purchased.')
