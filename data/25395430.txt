There was a &#x2F;ʃ&#x2F; sound spelled with X, as well as a &#x2F;ʒ&#x2F; which was spelled with J or GI, GE -- this all merged and is today spelt with J or GI, GE, pronounced [x].  Also what is today &#x2F;θ&#x2F; in Spain was once distinct &#x2F;ts&#x2F; and &#x2F;dz&#x2F;, written as ç and z respectively (today c and z).  &#x2F;b&#x2F; and &#x2F;v&#x2F; had not yet merged and their spellings have since been sort of &quot;re-based&quot; to look like their Latin roots.  &lt;h&gt; for a time was not silent, and many words that start with &lt;h&gt; used to have an &#x2F;f&#x2F;.<p>So, the interesting thing about this relative to English: when pronunciation changed around 1500, they also updated the spelling.')
