If you want to customise the color palette, you will need to use the same color classes in all libraries, which requires  that the `colors` part of the config matches everywhere. Using a shared base config is probably a good start at least.<p>As purging is only done for production builds, the purge content paths only need to be defined in that projects config. If you are using components from `node_modules` then you should add their paths to `purge.content`.')
