It’s not about “owing” or not. It’s about delivering something that people want to use or not. If you fail, the users will go elsewhere. You don’t have to care; you might develop the software for your own personal gratification. But people are going to share their dissatisfaction and might very well vote with their feet. And it’s possible that, even if they don’t, your work makes the world a worse place. No, no one can sue you or call you a cheat for doing a bad job, but they don’t have to like it either.')
