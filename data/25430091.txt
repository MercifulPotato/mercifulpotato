Did I insult or offend any Mozilla fans (which I am one BTW, even after some questionable decisions of late)? Am I wrong saying it&#x27;s ironic to connect to Google -possibly the largest tracking company by far seeing they are present in almost every website out there- in an article praising anti-tracking measures? Is it bad to tell Mozilla to be more consistent with their message and actions?<p>Wish people who downvote would at least take the time to tell what&#x27;s wrong with the comment. I don&#x27;t mind being corrected... quite the contrary!')
