You can&#x27;t take pictures of specific people, up close. I don&#x27;t know the specific of where exactly the line is.<p>I don&#x27;t know how dashcams are handles here in DK \nI know in Germany there was a long debate and forbidden for a long time. I think in Germany they are allowed now, but you can&#x27;t just drive around and video everything, only if you are involved in a situation. I think the idea is they don&#x27;t want people driving around, recording everything to be some kind of vigilante police. Even a good driver breaks some minor rule by accident at times.<p>Edit: In DK you are not allowed to release the Dashcam footage if there is a person in focus &#x2F; the main subject. And I assume recognizable. Also only on public roads.\nNot sure how they handle numberplates.')
