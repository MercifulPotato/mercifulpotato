Punch yourself in the face, get real.</i><p>Yes, Hitler did have a concern for &quot;sneaky backstabbing&quot; - as did most Germans after losing WWI. It even has a name, Dolchsto√ülegenden. It wasn&#x27;t a correct idea, and it was doubly incorrect to pin it to the Jews, but there&#x27;s no great dispute that both officials and people believed it.<p>Does it come a surprise to you that Hitler was actually an antisemite? Did you think he mearly killed 6+ million people as an excuse to come to power while not believing it (not to mention he was already in power when he put that in process).<p>So, no, it wasn&#x27;t just a &quot;convenient scapegoat&quot;. People did (and do) believe those things, including leaders. Including racist, imprisoned, and disillusioned by a war defeat leaders.<p>In fact not just Hitler, but tons of people all across Europe, the US, Russia, etc, believed in such &quot;jewish&quot; plots, and still do, which is what fed the pogroms for example.<p>As for Stalin, he was indeed concerned of separatism from USSR, and he did want to have a good hold on Ukraine as it was an important food producing area.<p>&gt;<i>Do you think that Xi, and Co. give any real f..k for feeling of Han Chinese? Get real.</i><p>Yes. But then again, I don&#x27;t believe in cartoonish evil characters.')
