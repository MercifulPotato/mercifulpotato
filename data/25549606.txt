I hope you apply it! Here&#x27;s a free sample:<p>We have the same &quot;social credit&quot; systems in the West. They&#x27;re just covert not overt, and I find that covertness more likely to be distressing and confusing for most individuals, and therefore harder to deal with, and more abusive.<p>You will probably find this an extremely hard idea to accept, because it goes against the dominant Western propaganda narrative of &quot;China do evil, very bad evil, our evil different&quot;, and there&#x27;s a lot of sort of &quot;entrenched confirmation bias&quot;, and &quot;narrative immune system&quot; in the Western discourse that will cause you to reflex-react against, and be virtually unable to calmly and critically entertain the possibility of ideas outside that system, that challenge the &quot;unquestionable truths&quot;.<p>That fact alone <i>should</i> scare you, if you truly care about freedom to the level you purport to. Because you live in a &quot;free&quot; society, with &quot;free association&quot; and a &quot;free press&quot;, so you should be able to exist within, and think in, a &quot;free exchange of ideas&quot;. But the inability to consider ideas contrary to the dominant narrative programming, should indicate to you that things are not so &quot;free&quot; as the West needs to pretend they are.<p>Okay, without that little disclaimer out of the way, the social credit system in the West consists of: credit scores, KYC&#x2F;AML, intelligence mass collection and monitoring, social media control and censorship, &quot;national security&quot; blacklisting, and other tactics that are basically similar to the Nazi <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zersetzung" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Zersetzung</a>. If you are unaware of this, and have never read of nor encountered any of it, boy, have you been a good little sailor and not done anything in the slightest bit dangerous, nor contrarian. You&#x27;ve lived within the proscribed limits, as you are supposed to.<p>The danger I see in the Western systems of control is they sell people &quot;freedom&quot; when in fact it&#x27;s a lie, and they go about their control in a deceptive and coercive manner which I think it far more abusive to the &quot;individuals&quot; they pretend to lionize. The Chinese system, at least is transparent in its control mechanisms. It doesn&#x27;t pretend to its citizens it is free, and if you cross a line with state security, they will let you know about it directly.<p>All societies need to control their citizens and narratives, and I see this, the more open and transparent methods of Chinese control, as a template for a less abusive future relationship between the state security and intelligence apparatus, and the populations they protect.<p>I honestly think all states are heading in this direction, it will just take some time. I hope that in the future, people will see the &quot;covert coerce&quot; Nazi-era tactics now adopted by &quot;freedom loving&quot; &quot;Western liberal democracies&quot;, as embarrassing relics of a sad and dead bygone era, and will embrace the sort of hassle-free technological &quot;checking&quot; mechanisms, such as &quot;instant fines and exposure for jay-walking from facial recognition&quot;, and &quot;train tickets time-out&quot;, if you&#x27;ve done something bad, that the Chinese are trialing. Sure, these systems could end up being abused, and there are likely abuses going on due to corruption, but overall the system, I think, is solid. The Western &quot;social credit&quot; system and their extra-legal &quot;covert coerce&quot; consequences are already being abused, and are really pretty shoddy.')
