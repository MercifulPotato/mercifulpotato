You can include your own or 3rd party clients and get full autocomplete and type safety.<p>The styling did feel awkward at first, but even I, being the first time developer managed to create pixel perfect replica of whatever crazy widget style our designer came up with. And using cols&#x2F;rows made it easy to make app look good on variety of screen sizes.<p>I hope that in some moment in time we get same experience for the web, and I encourage more people to try flutter&#x2F;dart, you migh be pleasantly surprised.')
