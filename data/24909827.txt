The car would not exist as a consumer product if it were invented today. Automatic car systems may have to have close to zero fatality rates to be acceptable in the US. Possibly a national law of some sort could be passed to limit automatic car manufactures liability that would allow them to be deployed at scale. Otherwise, I see little chance of automatic vehicles existing in the US. They will cause deaths, especially if human drivers are still allowed on the same roads. I sure hope they can be deployed, as the benefits of automatic vehicles for safety, convenience, the environment, and efficiency are large.')
