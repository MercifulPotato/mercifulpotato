There is nothing wrong with windows and it&#x27;s extraordinarily convenient. Mail and Calendar integrated into the OS has never been better. Sure it&#x27;s not as good as Apple&#x27;s stuff, but it&#x27;s more than worthwhile.<p>Linux you have to mess around CONSTANTLY or learn more about how things work in order to get them to your liking. Linux IS a &quot;geeky alternative to mainstream.&quot; Linux is exactly as your example is about manual vs automatic. Stop and think for a sec why over 90% of cars are automatic and not manual. It&#x27;s easier! We can argue all day how Linux is superior to windows but at the end of the day, what OS are you wasting more time on trying to get something to work as opposed to that being just abstracted from you in the first place since you don&#x27;t need to know about it 99&#x2F;100?')
