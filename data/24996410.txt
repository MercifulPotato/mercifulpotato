I&#x27;ve used mushrooms, lsd, and a few others probably over a hundred times and one of the things that really seperates these drugs from others such as caffeine, alcohol, mdma, amphetamines, etc. is that there&#x27;s no noticeable comedown except that the experience fades away and I am tired (as I would be after any intense experience). On the contrary, I usually feel really good after taking psychedelics, often for a period of days or weeks afterwards.<p>People&#x27;s experience will vary of course, and if you have a bad or unpleasant trip you won&#x27;t feel good afterwards. However, in my experience, the majority of people don&#x27;t experience comedown after taking psychedelics.')
