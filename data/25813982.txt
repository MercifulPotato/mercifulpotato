This is not that.<p>This is about the use of the credit account metadata - e.g. what accounts do you have, when did you open them, your prior addresses - for identity verification.<p>This does represent a problem for people who have no, or insufficient, credit history to achieve the identification bar; but this isn&#x27;t about a patient&#x27;s creditworthiness <i>per se</i>.')
