Item(by='npsimons', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605979289, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25170661, text='Believe it or not, putting down books, stepping away from screens, and just getting the blood flowing through exercise is a great way to clear the mind and just let it wander. I&#x27;m also reminded of walking meditation. Used to work with a math PhD who would take breaks to walk around the parking lot smoking his pipe.<p>Other than that, I hang out in forums like HN and certain subreddits that seem to spark ideas in me. Some of them are hobby specific (I&#x27;ve got at least a dozen ideas for apps for search and rescue), but some just come out of left field or I look for a problem I have and want to solve.<p>I will also add that I use org-mode and live in emacs, so taking a note is just a couple of keystrokes away, and disk storage is cheap. I can always just archive it later, so I&#x27;ve never liked the idea of throwing out so-called useless ideas (was from some time&#x2F;task management system, can&#x27;t remember which), as I can always set the state to CANCELLED.')
