I have a few thoughts&#x2F;suggestions, but first:<p>Does anyone know of a competitive&#x2F;practice typing site (as TypeLit, or TypeRacer) where you help digitize books (or any sort of document)?<p>I&#x27;m very motivated by TypeRacer&#x27;s competitions (it&#x27;s silly, I know), but I would be even more inclined to play if I knew that there was a &quot;greater&quot; purpose...!<p>I haven&#x27;t looked into Project Gutenberg&#x27;s proof reading volunteering. But, something like that? A sort of &quot;good for humanity&quot; reCaptcha (the original one, that helped Google to digitize books)..?<p>---<p>Ideas for TypeLit:<p>- It would be nice if the WPM&#x2F;ACC counters updated in real time in the upper right corner, not just when changing pages<p>- The competitive aspect of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.typeracer.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.typeracer.com&#x2F;</a> might not be a perfect fit for your site but just wondering if a leaderboard&#x2F;social element could work (probably not, but just a thought)')
