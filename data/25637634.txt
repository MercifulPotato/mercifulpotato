In today’s digital world, singles are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted. On Hinge, there are no rules, timers, or games. Instead, you’ll meet your most compatible matches and you’ll have unique conversations over what you’ve shared on your detailed profile. It’s a natural way to find a great first date. Currently, 3 out of 4 first dates lead to second dates, we’re the #1 mobile-first dating app mentioned in the New York Times wedding section, and we’re the fastest growing dating app in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.<p>The recommender system powers Hinge’s matchmaking capabilities and we’re looking for a staff engineer who is interested in owning the backend portion of this system.  You will be the first dedicated backend IC on a new cross disciplinary team that includes data scientists, ML engineers, data engineers, and product managers.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;matchgroup&#x2F;48cec48a-b16b-4592-92e7-e8c011d3a87f" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jobs.lever.co&#x2F;matchgroup&#x2F;48cec48a-b16b-4592-92e7-e8c...</a>')
