Including journalists, and anyone creating educational content.  Even in fields with an emphasis on open access. Which many fields still lack.  And the introduction sections of papers can sometimes be surprisingly accessible to even young students.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t even be considering working on improving science education content, if sci-hub didn&#x27;t exist.  And I used libgen the other day, to check the best-selling introductory astronomy textbooks, and find they most all have the color of the Sun wrong (really - there&#x27;s a common misconception, pervasive in introductory astronomy education content).  From some of the same publishing corporations too.  It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been meaning to check for years, and which finally happened, only because libgen made it easy.')
