Either in the construction phase or ongoing operations phase.<p>In some ways the construction is little different than building an office park or warehouse, modulo some very special installed equipment and ventilation &#x2F; power systems.  Most of that $xB capital invested is going to the companies that make the extremely sophisticated line equipment, and that is not local.<p>As for the operations phase, it might employ 1,000 people, optimistically?<p>Not saying it&#x27;s not a benefit to the Arizona economy.  And certainly the economic calculations for something like this are far better than the bullshit $ thrown around for a sport stadium or team, for example.   Just saying that the $12-$38B figure is not what Arizonans will <i>feel</i>.')
