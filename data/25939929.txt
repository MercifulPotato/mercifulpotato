There&#x27;s a big difference between some kids screaming in your coffee shop and a community on a website supposedly dedicated to free discussion. A more apt comparison would be a group in a corner having a conversation at a rock concert. Suddenly this argument appears less apt.<p>And while some are screaming for these sites to get shut down over it, most of us aren&#x27;t. What you see from most of us is recommendation to stop using services that silence you. This is a reasonable response, if someone doesn&#x27;t like you, go somewhere where they do like you. That&#x27;s what the comment you&#x27;re responding to is advocating, embracing and even getting excited about. The internet needs a true public square, not a private entity masquerading as one that for some reason totally unbeknownst to them has to constantly remind everyone that they are not a published square.')
