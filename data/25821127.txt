The goal is to help you track your health without thinking about tracking your health - where many people fail. So to use Basis today (get the minimum benefit) you would need to use a glucose tracking biosensor (that we provide) and have an activity tracking wearable (e.g. Apple Watch, Oura ring, etc). It’s possible to use Basis with your own continuous glucose sensor (if you are diabetic let’s say) and already get those regularly. Depending on the peripherals&#x2F;wearables you have you could also feed your water intake and temperature in the data as well.')
