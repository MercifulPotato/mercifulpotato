Item(by='paganel', descendants=None, kids=[25713836], score=None, time=1610273337, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25712874, text='&gt; Hang Mike Pence<p>Somewhere on an older hard-disk I have a copy of all the terrorist incidents starting from the 1960s up to 2006 or so (web-scrapped at the time when that data was still partially open), no-where in there had I seen this type of events, there were mostly bombings, airplane kidnapping and the like. What you are describing falls though under the &quot;insurrection&quot; label, heck, we were saying the same thing about Ceausescu in December 1989 and thankfully no-one branded us as terrorists (I&#x27;m from Romania).')
