I suffer from mild chronic depression and I have noticed that doing my morning exercise routine makes it much more likely that my mood will be decent throughout the day than if I wake up and decide I just don&#x27;t feel like exercising that day.<p>I have also experimented on myself to see whether 30 minutes of exercise improved my mood in the middle of the day. Not totally surprisingly, it _usually_ did. Not always, but usually. It never once had a negative impact.<p>The main problem is one of motivation&#x2F;willpower. Telling a depressed person that they should exercise to feel better seems like solid advice on the surface of it, because it stands a high chance of both being true and actually working, BUT they are not in a place to usefully implement the advice. The brain gets in the way and overrides what we see as &quot;common sense.&quot; The same way you can&#x27;t tell an alcoholic to have a nice big steak instead of a beer for dinner. The person usually even knows the &quot;right&quot; thing to do, they are just literally unable to take the right action in the moment.')
