You can easily make your substantive points while sticking to these rules.<p>Most new users are legit and it&#x27;s the wrong cultural tradeoff for this place to allow established users to harass them. I certainly appreciate your wish to protect the integrity of the threads but it needs to be done while remaining an open, welcoming community. That last thing we want is to incentivize legit new users to leave just as soon as they arrive here, and we put up with a lot of downside in order not to punish the innocent.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a><p>Edit: it&#x27;s also pretty nasty to say that VCs are &quot;getting fleeced by this&quot; in a launch thread where you&#x27;re personally interacting with the founder. It&#x27;s clear that you&#x27;re an expert on rowing—that&#x27;s fabulous. It&#x27;s fine that you have a safety critique to make about this product—you&#x27;ve repeated it half a dozen times now. But it&#x27;s not in keeping with the spirit of this site to accuse someone of outright corruption.<p>If you had strong evidence of ill intent or something, it would maybe be different, but all you&#x27;ve got is a difference of opinion. Yes your opinion is a highly informed one, but it&#x27;s not the only one, and please let&#x27;s not do the internet slide-down where differences of opinion turn into accusations of malfeasance. That leads to the hell we&#x27;re trying to avoid on this site. Users who are posting here owe the community better than that, no matter how well informed they are.')
