Polite society has decided that they&#x27;re not going to hear about it because it goes against their intuition that no dogs are &#x27;bad.&#x27;<p>I have some friends that have pit bulls.  They never attacked a person, but they did attempt to kill a goat.  I can&#x27;t think of another type of dog that would maul livestock unprovoked with no history of aggression.  They are just naturally aggressive, and anyone that says otherwise is a shill or ignorant.')
