Item(by='pharke', descendants=None, kids=[24971163], score=None, time=1604340536, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24970398, text='I don&#x27;t know if the monitor is as big of an issue, a quick search on walmart.com yields their cheapest option at $69.99 for a 19&quot;. That&#x27;s if you have to buy one new. I&#x27;m sure the local craigslist would have second hand TVs with HDMI in. A lot of households already have multiple, cheap flatscreens. If we narrow the discussion to only those who cannot afford or do not have any of the above then I think we&#x27;re also talking about the same group of people that would not be able to afford the Pi400 at its current price. It would be more beneficial (and probably cheaper) to focus on making aid available for them to obtain what they need rather than redesigning the system.<p>The webcam is a different issue, there doesn&#x27;t appear to be much for a plug and play option for the Pi. Someone can correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.<p>If these were to be used as an option for remote education, I would hope that the same organization promoting them would also sell a kit with the system preconfigured to use an included webcam.')
