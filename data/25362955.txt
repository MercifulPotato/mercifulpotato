My spouse is begging me to. If my job were to finally announce permanent, optional WFH for employees, I list my house for sale that day.<p>Same complaints: cost of living &#x2F; taxes, quality of life, and kids&#x27; education.<p>The only thing keeping me here is my current job and clear opportunities for future [tech] jobs. If WFH became the norm, I&#x27;m out of here in 50 milliseconds. There are probably a lot of people like me.')
