I found Amazon pretty useless these days and rarely use it. I buy household essentials from Target their service and delivery is good and I have an option of in-store pickup within a day or delivery within a couple of days. At least they have a stable set of brands that they sell it&#x27;s not the highest quality but it&#x27;s good enough for most things. The things I care about quality I will buy directly from the seller.')
