Your comment was super specifically on topic.<p>The generic one which I detached was <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24890238" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24890238</a> - detach means it&#x27;s no longer a reply to your comment but is rather a top-level comment that can therefore float to a lower location on the page.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24890238" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24890238</a> either. It was just more generic. Also important to understand: the moderation decision is not primarily about a comment, it&#x27;s about the entire subtree. I don&#x27;t want people to feel blamed for what they posted, especially when it was other commenters who ended up going further off topic.')
