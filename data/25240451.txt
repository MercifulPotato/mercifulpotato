Item(by='chrismorgan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606596822, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25240340, text='A key word here is “governance”.<p>I searched for “rust programming language governance”, and immediately found <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rust-lang.org&#x2F;governance" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.rust-lang.org&#x2F;governance</a>. Nice and clear description of how it all works, how changes are made and who makes decisions, making it very clear that Rust is its own thing and not the property of or beholden to any one company, and that it’s very deliberately an open <i>project</i>, not merely open source.<p>I searched for “go programming language governance”, “golang governance” and a few other things, but I can’t find anything at all. When I look through their website, it’s Google this Google that, supported by Google, in order to contribute you must accept Google’s contributor license agreement, that kind of thing. I’ve found mention of “Go maintainers” in about two locations, as being those that can approve changes, but I can’t find any mention of who they might be (search terms included “{go programming language,golang} {maintainers,core team}”). Go is absolutely a Google open source project, as they say in a few places.<p>I imagine Go is a good deal more open to non-Google contributions than Swift is to non-Apple contributions, but it’s still very firmly Google controlling Go, setting its direction, and managing the project, in a way that was <i>never</i> the case for Rust.')
