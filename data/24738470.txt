Whenever a header file is completely enclosed in a ifndef guard, and that guard is still defined, it will skip the whole file.<p>Another option is &quot;#pragma once&quot;; it&#x27;s non-standard, but every popular C compiler (even MSVC) understands it, and has the advantage that there&#x27;s no risk of accidentally using the same include guard for more than one header file.')
