Item(by='rsynnott', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604180032, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24951428, text='&gt; I think I get less interested in self-driving cars the closer we seem to get to them. It honestly just stresses me out.<p>That&#x27;s probably a reasonable response. These things have the nasty feature that they both require less input from the driver the more sophisticated they get, but also that they require more _attention_ from the driver the more sophisticated they get (a boring old cruise control system won&#x27;t abruptly swerve into a concrete road divider, but a high Level 2 system will). And humans just don&#x27;t work like this. &quot;Don&#x27;t do anything, but be ready to take control within a second or so when it does something insane&quot; is not something we&#x27;re good at.')
