They dont see themselves as programmers and Python is complete gibberish for them, while R just makes sense. When i meet people from other companies in roughly the same space (i work in healthcare doing data analysis), it&#x27;s mostly the same. I actually meet more people who use SAS&#x2F;SPSS than Python.<p>For data analysis, R is in my opinion better than Python. It&#x27;s when you have to integrate it in existing workflows that Python quickly becomes a better choice.')
