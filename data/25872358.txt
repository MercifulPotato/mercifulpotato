My wife&#x27;s Prius was essentially an extremely heavy 70 HP equivalent EV.<p>0 to 10 it was a very fastest car although the acceleration curve flattened out fast and it was between hard and impossible to have enough traction to max it out.<p>I don&#x27;t hear much about prius transmissions being destroyed.<p>Something interesting to think about, I wonder with demographic trends etc if 0 to 10 is a more useful measure of daily driver performance and experience than 0 to 60.  My wife&#x27;s car does 0 to 10 at every stop sign, and technically my car is faster at 0 to 60 but I only did that twice a day at most for the commute, for sportiness reasons I might prefer the worlds fastest 0 to 10 car over a theoretically faster 0 to 60 car.')
