To sum up:<p>* The comparably priced Dell XPS 17 actually wins in most benchmarks (but the M1 is using Rosetta 2 translation for each of these!)<p>* The battery life is really amazing.<p>* The lack of cooling necessary is amazing.<p>* Software compatibility with ARM through Rosetta 2 is mind-blowing. No one expected it to work this well.<p>* Don&#x27;t buy Intel-based Macs any more!<p>* If you want a high-powered 13&quot; Macbook, this is it.<p>* If you want larger than 13&quot; or more than 2 Thunderbolt (USB4) ports, hold onto your butts!')
