Partly because being tired your capacity declines. Partly because, in retrospect, we were all <i>performing</i> hard work as a way of impressing clients, bosses, and each other. And partly out of some phenomenon related to &quot;revenge bedtime procrastination&quot; [1] where I just ran out of self-discipline and would secretly take the breaks I should have been taking anyhow.<p>Some years back I hired movers. Previously my experience moving had been the casual thing with friends and family. We took our time, joked around, took breaks, kept entertained. But these movers were <i>relentless</i>. They never rushed and never seemed stressed, but if there was work to do they were <i>on it</i> until the work was 100% done. And when there wasn&#x27;t work to do, they were perfectly chill.<p>I keep coming back to the memory as how I want to work. No bullshit, hard work when it&#x27;s time to work, and really letting go of it at quitting time. It&#x27;s harder to achieve for software, but I will keep iterating in that direction.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;worklife&#x2F;article&#x2F;20201123-the-psychology-behind-revenge-bedtime-procrastination" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;worklife&#x2F;article&#x2F;20201123-the-psychology...</a>')
