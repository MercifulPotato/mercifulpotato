Among the well-to-do, sure, we&#x27;re not only working in tech, but there is still the discomfort with there being many classes of people.  (The gig economy killed any hope of there ever being a middle class again.)<p>I think if you want people to say &quot;hi&quot; to you, you have to act the part.  Some single 20-something walking around with headphones and a hoodie... nobody is going to talk to you.  Get a dog and a partner, and people will talk to you while you&#x27;re out walking the dog.  They&#x27;re walking their dog, and so you have something to talk about.  (The dogs will break the ice!)')
