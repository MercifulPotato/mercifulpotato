Now, there are various SMPS topologies and typically you will chose more complex topology if you require more efficiency than your simple topology offers.<p>So using GaN transistors allow extending usability of a particular topology into higher power application.<p>GaN transistors have issues, though. As far as I know GaN are depletion type devices which means, essentially, they are normally ON. That&#x27;s not exactly what you want in a charger where in case your control circuit failed you would want the main transistor to stay open rather than closed.<p>I would suspect that this &quot;feature&quot; would require more additional parts just to ensure single failure does not leave the switcher fully on rather than off.')
