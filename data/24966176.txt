My mother&#x27;s phone got stolen and I had a lot of trouble trying to get into here Google account for her. I was lucky enough to have logged into it once in Safari of all things on my personal laptop. Google seemed to have placed a cookie to &#x27;remember&#x27; the device. Otherwise her google account would have been gone forever.<p>I now disabled all the trusted device related settings. Sure it is less secure versus hackers, but getting completely locked out isn&#x27;t a great prospect either.')
