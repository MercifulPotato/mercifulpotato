That manufacturers provide open design specifications and follow reasonable standards. That is after a few years, manufacturers do not have an incentive to fix the operating system of devices. Unless we can load open source operating systems, old devices will have security holes which is bad for security.<p>What I want to say is we should be able to fix and repair the hardware and software of devices.<p>I want to reach out and thank citizens of France for leading the way on repair index!')
