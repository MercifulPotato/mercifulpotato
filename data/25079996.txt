It&#x27;s awesome since a lot of parents have forgotten even the most basic maths principles  since they last sat in the school benches. Myself included, if you don&#x27;t calculate the circumference of a circle on a daily basis you tend to forget how to do it, for instance...<p>One thing that stuck out to me is that there are so many great YouTube videos on virtually any subject. Back in the day you were stuck with your textbook and if you, like me, were stuck with a less than stellar teacher, a lot of things didn&#x27;t stick. I have an identical twin brother, but we had different teachers and took different classes from middle school on. My brother was excelling at maths, I was faltering. My brother flunked french, it was my favorite subject. The only variable here is the teacher: my maths teacher was widely regarded as a boring, old and uninspiring man. My brother&#x27;s maths teacher actually cared about you grasping the subject. Same way around with our french teachers.')
