Which was why they were able to hold out until 1860 when the writing was on the wall.  Since slavery didn&#x27;t die on it&#x27;s own and was the underpinning of the economy of many states violence was somewhat bound to happen.<p>You can&#x27;t just expect to make any sizeable minority of your nation&#x27;s economy non-viable and not have all the people&#x27;s lives you just ruined start shooting.  You might be able to get away with it if the people losing out are an evenly distributed minority but if there&#x27;s a huge block where they are the overwhelming local majority it&#x27;s gonna get ugly.<p>The alternative path out of slavery would have been to boil the frog but with the uneven geographic distribution of slavery that wouldn&#x27;t have been reasonably possible to do socially (e.g. convince people to spend more any more money treating slaves better until wage labor is competitive and slavery can be legislated away without a war).  You might be able to boil the frog legislatively but the weak government structures of the 19th century were not well equipped for that kind of thing and that requires a lot of support anyway.  In order to get the nation bootstrapped the founders intentionally put off any action for several decades.  Something calamitous was kind of bound to happen.  Frankly I think we were kind of lucky we got off with a &quot;one and done&quot; war over it (yes I know there was a bunch of background violence after the fact) rather than a perpetual slow boil conflict that turns into a low intensity shooting war every few decades like you see in other parts of the world.')
