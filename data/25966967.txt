If the question at hand is &quot;is the world getting better?&quot;, then excluding China makes no sense in the pursuit of answering that question.<p>It&#x27;s also ridiculous for him to say that China doesn&#x27;t use policies that Pinker advocates for. That&#x27;s  absolutist and binary thinking. Pinker would advocate for the open market liberalising policies of Deng Xiaoping <i>relative to</i> Maoist economic authoritarianism, which helped to lift millions out of poverty in China, even though there&#x27;s still a lot that he doesn&#x27;t agree with China&#x27;s system.<p>If Pinker doesn&#x27;t like Putin&#x27;s strongman behavior in the region should he exclude Russia from his statistics on improving world peace? If Pinker doesn&#x27;t like the US healthcare system should he exclude the US from his statistics on childhood mortality?<p>This is a dishonest rhetorical strategy that Hinkel is employing. It&#x27;s clear to me now that Hinkel is a bad faith salesman who has set out to demonstrate his hypothesis at all costs.')
