Some say “he&#x27;s the Mark Zuckerberg of Russia”, an unfair comparison if you&#x27;d ask me. While both Pavel and Mark have built successful social platforms, that&#x27;s where the similarities ends.<p>Because he refused to comply with government demands to identify activists using VK, Durov was personally ousted from the company (and self-exiled from Russia altogether).<p>While refreshing my Durov trivia, I found he published a text a couple days ago, and this following passage just had a good vibe; \n“I focused on what I enjoyed most – creating social platforms that (hopefully) bring good to humanity. I spent most of my personal funds on Telegram for people to enjoy a free service that strives for perfection.”[1]<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;telegra.ph&#x2F;Consume-Less-Create-More-Its-More-Fun-12-04" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;telegra.ph&#x2F;Consume-Less-Create-More-Its-More-Fun-12-...</a>')
