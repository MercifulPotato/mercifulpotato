Item(by='Barrin92', descendants=None, kids=[24666299], score=None, time=1601614282, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24656389, text='&gt;I think Kaczynski was right about these claims. In his own words the Unabomber says: “The system does not and cannot exist to satisfy human needs. Instead, it is human behavior that has to be modified to fit the needs of the system. This has nothing to do with the political or social ideology that may pretend to guide the technological system. It is the fault of technology, because the system is guided not by ideology but by technical necessity.”<p>I don&#x27;t know if this is representative of the entire essay (I have to admit I haven&#x27;t read it), but I know that Kaczynski is often associated with far-right politics, or eco-racist groups. I&#x27;m very surprised because he almost sounds like a sort of super orthodox Marxist in that quote.')
