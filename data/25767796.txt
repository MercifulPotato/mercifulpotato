Compared to Android, Apple, Facebook, Twitter, eBay, and many other platforms I&#x27;ve developed for, I feel supported and catered to, and if I have a problem or a question, there is an actual human on the other end to guide me, politely and helpfully.<p>Developing for Windows back in the day, it was about halfway there. I had zero ability to communicate back to the platform owners, but I rarely if ever felt shit on, disrespected or disregarded. In contrast, on Win32, I felt like everything I wanted to do had already been considered ahead of time, thought through, and there was an existing and elegant solution available.')
