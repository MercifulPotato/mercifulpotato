Apple makes an active choice. Somehow, many Android devices exist--built by manufacturers I don&#x27;t see any need that name, which technically but only barely includes Google--and they don&#x27;t have these issues because they did not make the immoral choice made by Apple.<p>&gt; Apple allows one channel. It owns that channel. It is responsible for the content on that channel.<p>I understand this, and am claiming it is morally reprehensible: Apple&#x27;s explicit and actively immoral decision to say there is only a single distribution channel can be used on their devices directly leads to this problem. They <i>chose</i> to build and sell a device with a centralized point of failure that made China able to block apps from their phones.<p>&gt; Android had many channels, and Google’s App Store has the same apps banned, but an android user can simply use another channel.<p>I also understand this: the active and explicit decision made by the people who sell Android phones is what allows this. Apple explicitly decided to not allow this, because they are evil.<p>&gt; Since Apple is responsible for the apps in the Chinese App Store, they’ll remove apps that expose them to liability. Google does the same.<p>Obviously. But that is entirely irrelevant to the discussion. The decision made by Apple to only allow a single store on their phones is an explicit, active decision to be horrible people and to explicitly allow Chinese censorship of their devices.<p>We know this wasn&#x27;t a requirement to sell their phones in China, as many other phones are sold in China that do not have these restrictions. Now, you can happily say &quot;Apple wanted to have a monopoly on app distribution, and that&#x27;s why they decided to build a system that would require them to cave in to these censorship demands&quot;.<p>But you can&#x27;t claim that they would lose access to the Chinese market. This claim, in fact, makes the error you (incorrectly) claim I do, which is to incorrectly model the decisions Apple made with respect to their platform.<p>FWIW, if you want to listen to me go on about this issue for an hour and a half--to verify I am not somehow twisting my words here to avoid being wrong--here is a video of me speaking at Mozilla Privacy Lab.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vsazo-Gs7ms" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vsazo-Gs7ms</a>')
