Payment for order flow is still kosher in many circumstances; there&#x27;s no clear duty to go to the people offering it and demand price improvement instead. But what you definitely can’t do is accept a worse deal (or stop trying to find better deals) in order to protect your payment for order flow revenue stream.<p>It’s fair to say that this rule cuts off some interesting business models which might better serve different market segments, but that’s largely the point. In the SEC’s judgment, the potential for abuse is too high if stock brokers start acting like retail stores.')
