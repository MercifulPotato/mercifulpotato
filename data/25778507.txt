My experience of Reddit is that it is <i>extremely</i> left-wing. I would even go so far as to say rabidly so.<p>YouTube seems more &#x27;anti-woke&#x27; than &#x27;right-leaning&#x27;. Those aren&#x27;t the same, I don&#x27;t think.<p>Please go into more detail on why you feel this way, or if you have evidence to support your view. You could be right, because both YouTube and Reddit are vast websites, and I admittedly stick mostly to tech and tech-related areas of both, so I may not be seeing it.')
