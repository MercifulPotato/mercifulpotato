To most progressives, while they&#x27;re not fans of Romney and revisionism aside weren&#x27;t fans of McCain, having one of them in power feels less dangerous than having Trump in power.<p>If next election they&#x27;re up against an attempt for Trump to get back in, then yes, you could expect a large progressive turnout for a Biden re-election. But if he&#x27;s against a more moderate republican, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll see the turnout that happened this year repeat, which may turn out to be a problem for his supporters.')
