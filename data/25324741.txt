Scarcity without computational (and literal) power is necessary.<p>Maybe if we could use the inherent incalculability of the three-body problem as the basis for a cryptocurrency. You&#x27;d need to observe the universe to &quot;find&quot; astrocoins.<p>It would be Astrology on steroids.<p>Of course that leaves out verifiability, encryption, anonymous identity yet ownership.<p>What if you (somehow) knew both parts of the quantum uncertainty portions of a particle because you initiated the system. Then you could demonstrate ownership by being able to predict the location or the momentum at any time based on that.<p>But it would be fun to hold cryptocoins called Heisenbergs<p>But that is an actual physical particle.')
