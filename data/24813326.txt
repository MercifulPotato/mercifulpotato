Item(by='tynpeddler', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602968433, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24812438, text='&gt;  Broadcast media outlets are not monopolies either, and they can&#x27;t wantonly censor election speech like this by law.<p>You should clarify your argument here.  News media can &quot;censor&quot; election speech by simply not covering it.  In addition, if a speaker makes factual errors, the news station is under no obligation to refrain from commenting on those errors, nor are they prevented from providing correction. Most importantly, no newspaper is required to cover the same stories as another newspaper.  CNN for example, is not required to cover the the particular story you&#x27;re referencing.<p>Even with the equal-time rule, media outlets have broad discretion about how they choose to cover candidates.  For example, Trump benefited enormously in 2016 from an incredibly lopsided distribution of coverage.<p>And all of this ignores that the particular story you seem to be referring to has serious newsworthiness issues.')
