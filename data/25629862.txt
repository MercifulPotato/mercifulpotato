You are spot on about Stripe missing tax compliance support but we&#x27;ve got a few things in the works to change that, especially for SaaS businesses. Happy to share more what we&#x27;re working on if you&#x27;re interested -- kmoriarty@stripe.com.<p>On the payment method side of things, I&#x27;m curious what methods are being requested by buyers that we are missing? We do allow users to accept checks and bank transfers, so just wondering if there is a specific method we&#x27;re missing (aside from PayPal)? All in all, just want to understand exactly what you are looking for in terms of that last mile support from Stripe!<p>Checks: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;billing&#x2F;invoices&#x2F;paper-check-payment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stripe.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;billing&#x2F;invoices&#x2F;paper-check-payment</a>\nPayment Method Overview (incl.
