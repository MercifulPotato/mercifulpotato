The same is true of how americans use their system. There isn&#x27;t an old unit convenient for small weights of this scale, even carat is too rough, so they use mg.<p>I don&#x27;t know of any other examples of it being mixed quite like this, but I do see pressures given in &quot;mm Hg&quot; sometimes.')
