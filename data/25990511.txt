Lots of experience with AWS and cloud infrastructure, Javascript, Ruby, and all things front end as well. Looking for a small team building an exciting product!<p>I just finished building Campion, an edge deployable, open-source circuit breaker framework for synchronous service-oriented architectures. To build this project, I collaborated remotely with two other engineers, and we built it with Node&#x2F;NPM, React, Redux, AWS, and Cloudflare Workers.
