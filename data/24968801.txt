So if some software shops want to unionize, great. But I want the ability to join a company and not join the union, or failing that, be able to join non-unionized companies. If the goal is to force all software engineers to unionize, and then forcibly prohibit all non-unionized people from working in software, it&#x27;s simply coercion and I absolutely cannot support it.')
