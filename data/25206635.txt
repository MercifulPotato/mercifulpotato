Are people now moving towards k8s even for their development workflows? Especially the cases where to develop a feature, you have to depend on five external services so either you pull them and run locally (resource hungry although) or use staging version (not ideal) or spinning their copies on k8s instead?<p>In short, is docker-compose dead or will be dead forever in near to mid term future? And lastly, what is the current state of affairs?')
