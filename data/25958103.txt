Where individual shaders are adding linear complexity subtle interactions between different parts of a simulation can easily end reaching full factorial complexity.<p>As such AAA games favor independent systems which add as close to linear complexity as they can achieve.  3D models are a great example where extreme detail is largely irrelevant to every other part of the game.<p>That said, depending on what you’re measuring AAA games end up having wildly different levels of complexity.')
