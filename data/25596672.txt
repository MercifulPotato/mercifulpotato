Great for short bursts of story, sometimes with interesting wisdom. As a game developer, some of them have been inspiring for hooks to maybe use in future projects<p>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, by Tufte [1]: Very fun to peruse the graphs and charts. The visualization of Napolean&#x27;s army marching into Russian winter and back is a classic. I bought this because I was figuring out a novel UI for a video game about birds<p>Graphic Design: A New History, by Eskilson [2]: Goes over the history of graphic design and printing technology from pre-Gutenberg to the present day. I bought this because it was written by my college Art History professor. His class was my favorite in all of undergrad, and I wanted to experience more history delivered in his style.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;0394751884&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;0394751884&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;0961392142&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;0961392142&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;0300233280&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;gp&#x2F;product&#x2F;0300233280&#x2F;</a>')
