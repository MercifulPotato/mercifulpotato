People can be manipulated easily, look at who voted for Trump. The reality is that you&#x27;ve to see the history objectively.<p>CCP won the civil war in China (like Washington won the independence war) and is the legitimate government of China.<p>Luckily we don&#x27;t vote for who is legitimate or not in HN, but in the UN. And there are resolutions of the UN that consider the CCP the legitimate government of China. The same can&#x27;t be said for Taiwan for example.<p>I&#x27;m sorry but the down votes don&#x27;t change the fact. Your view of what happened is pretty foggy and inaccurate, perhaps full of bias.')
