I understand why people shudder at TCL, but they are mixing up the elegance of the language with the dysfunction of the situation it was pulled in to address.<p>Yes, when you start gluing random stuff together it gets ugly. This is true in real-life too. That&#x27;s the situation.<p>TCL, from the &quot;commands and strings&quot; handles this quite elegantly with a kind of Haskell-like power. And you can just use it as your shell, because it is designed to run commands! And if you are on macOS or Linux, there&#x27;s a good chance you even already have it installed. So go give it a try.<p>I think perl comes at this from &quot;the other end,&quot; making a general-use language into a shell-convenient package, but I don&#x27;t have enough experience on it to comment. Nonetheless, I suspect the horrors of perl are somewhat similar in nature: Too many blackbox systems that <i>must</i> be glued together.')
