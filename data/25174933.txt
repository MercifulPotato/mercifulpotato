The motherboard needs to physically support ECC (i.e., traces for a 72-bit memory bus need to be present) for it to work. ECC support can also be disabled within the BIOS firmware, either explicitly via a user-adjustable toggle, or by the motherboard vendor hard-coding the setting to disabled.<p>In any case, if the OS reports ECC as working, then ECC is fully functional.')
