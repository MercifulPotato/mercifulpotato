ATM it&#x27;s ~26% global ( oct 2020)\n If you cut segments where it&#x27;s not represented yet. e.g. cheap Zoe etc. it will be even higher and totally dominates luxury and performance ev market.\nIn 2022 tesla will deliver 25k car, and you can compare Zoe sales and Tesla sales. \nZoe sales also driven by car sharing, everybody knows that. It&#x27;s more a public transport segment.<p>Range of model 3 is 350 miles. But you also confusing WLTP and EPA. EPA is more conservative. sometimes up to 50%. \nTesla will at least double their sales in EU in 2021 due to delivering cheaper, locally Berlin produced, with local service model 3 and Model Y.<p>So far Model 3 is the best selling EV by volume despite been a very expensive car, In some market $50-80k. And even with this price it easily oversold nisan leaf, zoe etc...\nWV probably will be the biggest competitor in EU, but don&#x27;t compare their first pre-order delivery sales with delivery of the car that is 2-3 years on the market :)<p>In my opinion the biggest challenges for tesla are\n1. an ability to quickly enter local markets. They still not represented in many markets. E.g. LatAm is almost 0. You can&#x27;t buy tesla in brazil... at all.\n2. Deliver wider range of models and more often refresh it. Yes, tesla is still not on par with production abilities of traditional auto makers. Model S and X are very old cars even they update a lot inside. Model 3 is getting old as well. Those are great cars, but if you spent $80k+ on model s and you see on the road same 5 y.o. car that is not that shiny , you have same feeling, that your car maybe is not that cool and bright.  But every new model production is a huge problem for tesla. Maybe model Y was simple, but the rest.... They learned how to scale production. Now they have to learn how to scale scaling.<p>To explain #2. I want EV I considered Model Y. For me it&#x27;s still a small SUV. Due to the fact there is 0 other brands in this segment with decent mile range, performance, and software, Model Y was no brainer for me.  If there will be another brand, even not that great but it will be bigger , but not CYBERTRUCK big, I&#x27;ll chose another brand for my next car, simply due to size, despite been a loyal tesla owner.')
