It is systemically hard to make time it timing safe, more or less any mistake I padding completely compromises it. More or less every single operation involved in computing RSA exchanges is susceptible to timing attacks.<p>Then as the article says, it&#x27;s very easy to choose &quot;bad&quot; keys. Bad keys are ones that aren&#x27;t prime (I mean duh, but primality testing is probabilistic and has been found to go wrong before).<p>At a theoretically level RSA and ECC are essentially equivalent (in the sense that the maths is based on the same core problem), but the details of how it&#x27;s approached is really important.<p>Then when get to basic practicality. ECC keys are much much smaller than RSA for the same level of security - 256 bits vs. 4-8k - and while RSA is faster than ECC, the advantage is severely impacted by key size, so secure rsa keys will be slower the equivalent ECC in not too long.<p>That&#x27;s before considering the network traffic cost and latency for key exchange and certificate validation.<p>The only advantage RSA has over ECC at this point is that it is conceptually easier to understand - the mathematics are all basic primary&#x2F;grade school arithmetic on simple whole numbers.')
