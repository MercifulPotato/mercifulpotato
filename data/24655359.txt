Dangling free stuff in front of people and then offloading the burden of spam mitigation on people who didn&#x27;t ask for it is careless at best and arrogant at worst<p>edit: I should also mention, I feel bad for the Community Platform Manager on twitter who can&#x27;t really fix anything on his own but is still pained that people are unhappy. DO has dumped a bunch of crap on him too.')
