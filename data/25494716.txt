Specific numbers are meaningless. Calling it <i>same</i> order of magnitude seems an unfortunate (and technically incorrect) phrasing.<p>Still, the point stands - a 6x difference between <i>normally-served</i> dose and a harmful one is way too small to call it non-harmful. How do you even define a normally-served dose? This needs further clarification with better definitions.')
