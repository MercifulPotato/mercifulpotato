I&#x27;m going to take a wild guess that you&#x27;re also imbued with a similarly low opinion of PHP based on that (insightful if somewhat one-sided and flawed) article that guy wrote.<p>In my opinion, the flexibility and elegance you can get out of exploiting, not abusing or misusing, the dynamic nature of JS, is the main appeal of the language, it&#x27;s really damn fast to get stuff done, and even done in a nice and safe way, provided you have some idea what you&#x27;re doing.<p>There are terrible things that you can do in JS, and those are terrible even in the context of JS, but, what is a terrible thing to do in one language may be just fine(tm) in another, so trying to force some Java or C++ ideas onto any other language is just not a good way of going about things. Every language must be considered on its own.<p>What is reasonable to do when writing machine code may not be reasonable in assembler, and what is reasonable in assembler may not be reasonable in C and up you go.')
