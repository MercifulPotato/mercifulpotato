If people enjoy that good for them I guess, but nothing changes the fact that they&#x27;re fantasy. The colors are simply made up, that information isn&#x27;t in the film, you can&#x27;t tell from luminance which colors were there.<p>I cringe at colorized films for the same reasons. If you can&#x27;t take B&amp;W you should consider that make-ups, costumes and all settings were chosen according to how they would look in B&amp;W. In the same way that Technicolor forced you to have one of their color advisors supervising everything. At some point some audiences decided that B&amp;W was boring and the aesthetical appreciation of that whole graphical universe was lost, as a result the expectations are that everything has to look in a very definite way or else it&#x27;s unwatchable. I find such way of thinking the most narrow-minded by far.')
