My first Mac was a Classic II, back in &#x27;92. My last will be a MB Pro 2018 (actually 2020, but already repaired once and broken beyond working condition again). It was my third MB Pro in 3 years and every single one had to be repaired once before it crashed shortly thereafter. The company I work for has to replace around 1% - 2% of their MB Pro fleet per month. 6 - 10 devices are always in repair (additionally 1 - 2%).<p>I have notified my superior, that I am not able to work properly in January when I am back from a 2 months LOA were I privately switched everything over onto a WIN10 with WSL2 running Ubuntu.<p>I am not missing a thing currently. OK - I know at one point I will probably be missing Keynote.')
