I loved it&#x27;s syncing, versioning, and collaboration... and that this happen right inside Microsoft Office programs.  Google Drive was an unworthy successor and an unsatisfactory replacement.  I never used it as much or in a similar way to how I used Cloud Connect.  I tried, but it was frustrating.  I hate it when tech giants kill off great tools and try to get us to adopt mediocre replacements.')
