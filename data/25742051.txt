But this only makes sense in the context of a designer or observer external to the computation who can identify what that model is and thereby make sense of the output. So you can&#x27;t say that brain processes are computational, much less life itself, without committing some variation of the homunculus fallacy.<p>John Searle (famously known for his Chinese Room thought experiment) made this argument in a paper called &quot;Is the Brain a Digital Computer?&quot; [1] He points out that &quot;if we are to suppose that the brain is a digital computer, we are still faced with the question &#x27;And who is the user?&#x27;&quot;<p>A related problem is qualia. There is no computational process that will produce the sensations of colour or sound or touch. At best you will have some representation that requires having actually experienced those sensations to understand it. So a computational process cannot be the basis of or an explanation for those sensations, and therefore consciousness generally.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;philosophy.as.uky.edu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;Is%20the%20Brain%20a%20Digital%20Computer%20-%20John%20R.%20Searle.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;philosophy.as.uky.edu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;Is%20the%2...</a>')
