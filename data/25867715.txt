I generally need my projects to be rewarding unto themselves, that is, the act of working on them should be fulfilling. If the end goal is the only motivation, it is really easy to lose interest during the long slog and do something else.<p>The other big thing is separating work time from the rest of my life. I have a set routine. I start and end at basically the same times every day.<p>Finally, I keep track of todo items for my project.
