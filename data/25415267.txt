This happened so often that I wrote a wrapper to log in:<p>It would log into the remote machine using Expect, then it would send a command to the remote end that tested whether a home directory already existed.  If so, it spawned a new shell in it.  Otherwise it created a &quot;home directory&quot; in &#x2F;tmp, pulled a tarball from a server, and extracted it into the &quot;home directory&quot;.  Then it spawned a new shell there.<p>Depending on how often it happens, you could also have a separate command that does the initial setup, and then call that as required.')
