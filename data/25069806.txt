I think it&#x27;s conservative but not unreasonable to use as a rule of thumb that your net take home is about half of what a &#x27;naive&#x27; calculation would net you. Especially in the beginning where you need to reserve a certain part of your revenues as a buffer for economic downturns; 6 months at the least, better a year. Back in May&#x2F;April, it was the contractors that got the boot first. From what I can tell in IT they&#x27;ve mostly rebounded, but in previous crises that didn&#x27;t happen so soon.<p>And you can either choose to work with a middle man, who will take a sizeable cut of your revenue, or do your own customer development, which takes a lot of time. Yes there are people who work for the same customer months on end for many years, but a) that&#x27;s dodgy from a tax perspective, and b) in those cases you generally don&#x27;t get to charge e1000&#x2F;day.<p>All I&#x27;m saying is - grass is always greener on the other side. Yes as a contractor&#x2F;consultant you&#x27;ll make (a lot) more as a programmer in Europe, but not as much as the proverbial e1000&#x2F;day rate makes it out to be.')
