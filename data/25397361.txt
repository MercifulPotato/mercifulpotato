Just one or a few basic indicators to give you even the slightest bit of information about who wrote what you&#x27;re reading. Just a simple &quot;p = 0.03 US resident&quot; or an aggregate trust score based on a combination of social graph connectivity and spam reports or something.

(It&#x27;s not as crazy as it sounds - we already have zero knowledge proofs, blinded encryption, and various other privacy preserving cryptographic schemes.)')
