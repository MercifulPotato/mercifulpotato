The genesis of this project actually goes back to ~2015 and predates the current social medial landscape. But the challenges will be there and have to be addressed, while balancing building something people enjoy enough to use and help grow.<p>One problem I see with sites like Twitter, is that there isn&#x27;t _enough_ discourse. Anyone can make a statement, go viral, and there isn&#x27;t a true &quot;conversation&quot; around it. There are threaded comments but it&#x27;s not the same, and the idea here is to explore building real time conversations around those statements, and allow more critique. I&#x27;d like to explore building ways to reward messages that are relevant such as letting users nominate a message if it adds value.<p>Additionally there should be basic features such as muting&#x2F;blocking people you don&#x27;t want to see, and am openminded to hear other ideas people have.<p>I will say that HN is a shining example of how to keep a certain level of civility on a discussion site, but as it&#x27;s been mentioned before, scaling that to a much larger size may be very difficult.')
