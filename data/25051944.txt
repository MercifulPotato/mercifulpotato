Item(by='egypturnash', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605042554, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25051747, text='My 2017 13” Pro (no touch at) has two USBC ports, both on the same side. It is annoying. Especially after it turned out there is a design flaw in the 2017 Pros where charging on one side tends to trash your battery - guess which side both ports are on?<p>It’s nice to only have to plug in one cable when I dock it at my desk but I would have greatly preferred not having to replace the battery twice in the three years I owned it due to this. Especially since only one replacement was covered under the warranty thanks to the ‘rona shutting down all the authorized service centers in my city.')
