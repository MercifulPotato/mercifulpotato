The database should ideally stay the same with the infra, deployment tools, etc. The code structure should stay similar with various internal libraries (i.e. logging, synching data, etc.)<p>In a way, it also help to make good architecture decisions because rather than hack a one-off, it&#x27;s easier to spot the right abstractions that can be re-used across products.<p>Same with naming.. instead of naming all your things based on the product name, just use fun&#x2F;code names, so when you pivot or re-brand, you don&#x27;t have to rename everything or need to deal with legacy product names.')
