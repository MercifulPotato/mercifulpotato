And just like every evil regime in the past, it has wide support and the citizens cheer it on and support it and ignore the evil, because they&#x27;re told it&#x27;s evil for a good cause. They cheer it on because they&#x27;ve been brainwashed to hate the other half of the population and believe it&#x27;s OK to do evil to &quot;bad&quot; people. For a party so concerned about stopping the next &quot;Hitler&quot; and how Nazi Germany could have ever happened, they sure love following in the same exact footsteps.')
