The only time I&#x27;ve ever seen an equation like that was in Trig or Discreet math. Both of which were college level courses. None of which were in basic loops or arithmetic I&#x27;ve learned in actual introductory classes. I cannot calculate the area of a circle without a Unit Circle. I&#x27;m sorry but that&#x27;s just incredibly unfair to assume people just remember all the Trig they did like it was yesterday. Trig&#x27;s easy, but who uses it on a daily basis? Machinists and Architects probably use it far more than we&#x27;ll ever use it.')
