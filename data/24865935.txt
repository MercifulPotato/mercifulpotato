If you are in the video world today, those old versions of software can&#x27;t even handle HD let alone 4K&#x2F;8K. I couldn&#x27;t even imagine trying to run RAW video without GPU support. Why are people so clinging on to software that only allows work from 10-15 years ago? Times have progressed. The old software doesn&#x27;t support anything I need it to today (maybe I could get by with an old version of PS except for today&#x27;s RAW formats would bring it to its knees).')
