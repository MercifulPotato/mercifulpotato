It was a lawless area patrolled by gun wielding far-left activists who routinely harassed journalists, ripped phones out of streamers’ hands to delete footage of the “security team’s” deadly mistakes, assaulted visitors of the wrong political stripe, and ultimately were responsible for the shooting deaths of several people. While the atmosphere was more “street festival” during the day, at least for a while, at night and as the occupation wore on it swiftly devolved into violent anarchy.<p>Remember Raz Simone, the local rapper who showed up on the first night with an AK-47? Remember how he handed out rifles to seemingly random untrained people from the trunk of a car? Remember how his crew assaulted and pistol-whipped a graffiti tagger on the very first night of CHAZ&#x2F;CHOP, <i>on a Facebook Live stream</i>, saying “we are the police now?” Many similar incidents.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxnews.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;seattle-autonomous-zone-leaders-warlord-no-cop-co-op" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxnews.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;seattle-autonomous-zone-leaders-w...</a>')
