It starts off talking about &quot;Chicago = War Zone&quot; and then it devolves into the ground state of HN&#x27;s favorite whipping children of &quot;cancel culture&quot;, &quot;free speech&quot; and how &quot;The well-being of these communities shouldn&#x27;t be exchanged for free-speech(?)&quot;.<p>Chicago isn&#x27;t a warzone. Last year I bought my first home here. I wouldn&#x27;t live here if it were a warzone. But it does have problems and I have a vested interest in their resolution (or more realistically, reducing their impact). I think I explained pretty clearly how I see cancel culture, etc relating to these problems. If you have specific questions, I&#x27;m happy to try to answer (I don&#x27;t claim perfect knowledge, I&#x27;m only sharing my perspective).<p>&gt;  &quot;The well-being of these communities shouldn&#x27;t be exchanged for free-speech(?)&quot;. I&#x27;m not even sure what the last point was meant to be about other than showing angst at the idea that racist comments are largely derided and marginalized.<p>I don&#x27;t know how you got &quot;angst at the idea that racist comments are largely derided and marginalized&quot;. I explicitly noted that marginalizing actual racism is a good thing. The problem is that a lot of necessary debate is considered beyond the pale such that we are only allowed to talk about the solutions which (pretty obviously) are only going to exacerbate the problem, such as reducing policing in the communities most in need and letting violent offenders out without the necessary rehabilitation. Your comment (inadvertently, I&#x27;m sure) lumps these concerns in with &quot;racist comments&quot;, illustrating perfectly my issue with political correctness. I understand the desire for a simple worldview with a group of purely good guys and a group of purely bad guys, but I&#x27;m interested in solving real world problems and the real world has a lot of nuance to be explored. We have to be able to talk about that nuance in order to solve these problems. We&#x27;re not doing these communities any favors by avoiding unpleasant complexities.')
