I’m really glad that we’re taking this threat seriously, because we don’t need one more problem on our list of things that kill our bees.<p>While I’m at it, please allow me to remind everyone that there are thousands of solitary bee species in the world. They are the ones that go extinct or in real danger compared to our honey bees. There are many struggling beekeepers like me in the world, and we’re doing our best to keep our bees alive. But thousands of species are without keepers and they are dying. Please be gentle to the nature. Let them live.<p><i>(Edit: wondering how you can help, here&#x27;s what I humbly suggested below in another comment: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24889023" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24889023</a>)</i>')
