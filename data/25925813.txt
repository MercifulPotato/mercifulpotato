Write an automated test instead.  It is effort your are expending anyway, why throw it away?? And while you&#x27;re there, write the test beforehand, to clarify the specification of the code you&#x27;re trying to write.<p>With such a TDD cycle, those problems wouldn&#x27;t have happened.<p><pre><code>    Repeat\n      Write a test\n      Make it pass\n      [Commit]\n      Refactor\n      Commit\n    \n</code></pre>\nMind you, static typing can still help in this scenario, but <i>not</i> in getting the code to work and helping it remain functional.  It helps as verified documentation that eases understanding when reading the code.')
