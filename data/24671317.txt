Having more than one (or two, if we include WebKit - but Blink is a fork of it, so ...) relevant browser engines would be great. But as it stands right now, the fact that I can build apps that have all capabilities that the end user would expect (push notifications, background sync, &quot;Add to homescreen&quot;, offline capabilities) in the most popular browser out there and the fact that the latter is FLOSS (Chromium - obviously Chrome is not) means that IMHO we are in a much better place than a few years ago when web dev meant JQuery and IE8 polyfills. And that shows - I can now use only a browser, independent of the host OS, to do all of my days work (using Theia&#x2F;VSCode in the browser is a joy) and even entertainment (remember when a proprietary OS and a proprietary native app was required to stream video?) completely from a free&#x2F;libre and open source software. If that means that I have to accept a libre browser monopoly for now than that&#x27;s much better than having to accept a proprietary host OS IMHO.')
