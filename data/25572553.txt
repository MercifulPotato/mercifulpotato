Full of stupid cliches, like &quot;newsletters have existed since time immemorial&quot;. Long lists and descriptions not just of substacks, but even of other newsletters. Little to no discussion of why people prefer substacks to traditional media. But perhaps this is unfair. Perhaps the essay is an attempt to illustrate just that, by parodying the intellectual emptyness of traditional media.')
