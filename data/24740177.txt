I do, however, take issue with Apple pushing this idea that they can decide what information you can and cannot give users. Barring people from saying &quot;Hey, we didn&#x27;t delete this because we wanted to, Apple asked us to&quot; is a bit suspect as it leads to people associating the act with the app by default. It takes away agency from companies while giving Apple free reign to rule without being blamed for any mistakes.')
