Many, many things broke and I didn&#x27;t have time to fix them all.<p>I already use the strictest Tracking Protection stuff in Firefox, for example, and I do hit sites that don&#x27;t work correctly.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s worth revisiting but something tells me that the web uses more JavaScript, not less, since I last tried this experiment.<p>And regarding the patronizing aspect, let&#x27;s say your bank&#x27;s website uses JavaScript, what do you do?<p>Edit, actually, sorry, I re-read your comment and you answered my question:<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t give a damn about other sites (and I don&#x27;t browse intranet sites on my home machine -- if I&#x27;m in an office I use their office machine). If they don&#x27;t work I don&#x27;t use them except in rare cases when I really need to in which case they get run in a VM.<p>Q.e.d.<p>I&#x27;ll just rephrase things to something less offensive: you&#x27;re not &quot;hurting&quot; yourself, you&#x27;re limiting yourself, sometimes with drawbacks not everyone is able&#x2F;willing to endure.')
