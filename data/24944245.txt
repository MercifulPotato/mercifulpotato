To take an example, consider an election like:<p>32% of people: Clinton, Sanders, Trump<p>33% of people: Sanders, Trump, Clinton<p>35% of people: Trump, Clinton, Sanders<p>Now, this is a terrible election and there&#x27;s no clear winner because people&#x27;s preferences point around in a circle. Under traditional voting Trump wins, while under ranked choice Clinton is eliminated and Sanders wins. But if a few people preferring Trump &gt; Clinton &gt; Sanders had instead voted just Clinton &gt; Trump &gt; Sanders we could have had:<p>32% of people: Clinton, Sanders, Trump<p>33% of people: Sanders, Trump, Clinton<p>32% of people: Trump, Clinton, Sanders<p>3% of people: Clinton, Trump, Sanders<p>Then Trump would have been eliminated first, with only 32% of the first place votes, and his second place votes would have gone to Clinton, making her win. So by voting for a candidate they liked less, these voters got an outcome they liked more. Staying home and not voting would similarly have helped them.')
