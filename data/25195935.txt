At a jazz jam session, Elvin Jones, the drummer, hearing Bird&#x27;s lack of tune knowledge, was not amused and proceeded to throw a cymbal at him on stage and told him to get lost. Parker then went on to practice 12 hours a day until he mastered the literature, and he&#x27;s become somewhat famous since then. Parker could have whined about how unfair the pro players were towards him, but he didn&#x27;t, he went home and did his homework and came back and kicked everyone&#x27;s ass. Not saying you need this level of determination, but a level of open mindedness would be a good start.')
