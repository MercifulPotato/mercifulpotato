Intelligent mammals like whales and elephants, orcas and dolphins, actually have their own culture as well, and by culture I mean survival specific knowledge passed down between generations.<p>Simply cloning one of these animals and dumping it into the ocean reminds me of seal conservation efforts where seals were rehabilitated and then basically dumped into the ocean and swiftly eaten by orcas. A naïve approach is unlikely to work.')
