From what I understand from friends and family, the lockdown in the EU was not particularly different than the US. It varied from region to region. There was some resistance to wearing masks in some places. People did not stop traveling, holding events or eating out.<p>I think the best comparison to draw is China and New Zealand. They have the strictest lockdowns you can imagine and the virus has been completely contained in those countries. Whole cities are locked down after just a few cases. China has been limiting and disinfecting frozen food imports as it is one of the few remaining vectors the virus has been reentering the country. As far as I understand, their economies and daily life have been saved, but it comes at a huge cost to individual freedom, a cost that North America or Europe would never accept. There is no point in imagining Chinese disease control measures in America. It&#x27;s beyond the realm of possibility. We need other solutions.')
