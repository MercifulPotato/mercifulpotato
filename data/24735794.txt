I&#x27;ve been doing SQL since more than 14 years. Most of it was spent working on ETL projects for Finance and Utilities industries. Even today 80% of the code I write in pySpark is just plain SQL. It&#x27;s been my bread and butter. However, I spend a lot of time trying to think about a solution in SQL. It&#x27;s not an easy language to use when it comes to implementing complex transformations. I could write the same logic in Python in a lot less time. I use SQL mostly because it&#x27;s easily portable across systems and most analysts and to some extent tech managers understand it. I work primarily on proof of concept data products and it does the job for that. Then a real developer takes over and implements it in .Net.')
