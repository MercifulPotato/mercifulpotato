Effective people will make mistakes sometimes, ranging from missing a filing deadline to hiring people who end up not good at their job to trying some charitable activity that ends up not working. If we hold them to a standard of perfection, the rational activity of the people behind the charity is to just do something else. Is that good for us?<p>Of course we want them to be accountable - I&#x27;m not arguing that they should be able to do whatever, and they should try to meet all these requirements, that&#x27;s why we the public encoded the requirements in the first place. I&#x27;m arguing that there&#x27;s a big difference between accountability and expecting perfection.')
