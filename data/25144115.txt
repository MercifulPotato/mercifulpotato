There is a lot going on here. One, this is a letter to Facebook when it really seems to be the contracting agency that&#x27;s at issue. FB may just order their contractors to be like &quot;stop this shit&quot; and they comply, or they buy out the contract and move people in-house.<p>People only have so much time and capacities. A software engineer isn&#x27;t going to spend a lot of time on the sales room floor, but they might have started off in help-desk support. A CEO might not know what goes on in the warehouse, but he or she may have worked at a McDonalds growing up. If someone hasn&#x27;t worked entry level jobs elsewhere, would working on the factory really develop empathy? Would that change policy? Probably not.<p>It&#x27;s so easy to make two boxes, one for the oppressor and the other for the oppressed, and place everyone into those two boxes. If each oppressor works a day in the shoes of the other box, does that make a difference? If the workers throw their wrenches into the gears and seize the means of production, what if they&#x27;re completely unprepared to keep that machine moving and end up with famine?<p>The issues are complex, much more complex than &quot;Before you get your license, you should have to ride a bike on the streets for two weeks.&quot;')
