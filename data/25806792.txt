Microservices still exist and they each do their requisite task, but different work is done by different actors in the actor cluster. Actors are still a fantastic way of handling concurrency, since they can each be treated as single-threaded tiny programs that only think about themselves, and so I&#x27;ve used them in that way.<p>The actor just won&#x27;t exist elsewhere, but another microservice that happens to use actors might exist. It would be sent a web request or a message in queue or similar.')
