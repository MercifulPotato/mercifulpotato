I wanted users to be able to share their cards with their friends (or save it for later), but I didn&#x27;t want to deal with signup or saving stuff to a database - so I just let people generate a long link that contains the card content. Since we were only using emojis and text, and since I was ok with just using one type of font, I figured I could shrink that info into a link - even if it&#x27;s ugly[1]<p>When I first stared, I just used &quot;Impact&quot; font (I wanted a meme vibe), and it worked great - until I loaded it on my phone. So then I found a similar-ish font on google fonts, and that&#x27;s when I first started seeing race issues. I spent some time messing with it, added preload, but it still doesn&#x27;t load consistently. Especially I&#x27;ve noticed that the images that are used for the inside pages of a card (which are pngs generated by setting up a canvas then saving it as a blob) seem to load with a default font in race conditions. It all works again if people click to that image and load the actual canvas, but I doubt some people will do that. So it&#x27;s very frustrating and I really wish there was a better way - because there really are cases where a specific font is necessary.<p>I think it&#x27;s probably still not fixed, but here&#x27;s an example of the type of load that was causing me problems.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emojify.cards&#x2F;?canvas-0=HEY+357+576+6.417+9.018+0+0+0%7C%F0%9F%A6%A7+738+175+32.088+32.029+0+34+0%7C%F0%9F%95%B6%EF%B8%8F+1015+545+11.844+11.822+0+69+0&amp;canvas-1=%F0%9F%99%8C+711+23+39.803+39.729+0+26+0%7C%F0%9F%92%8E+-4+70+38.131+38.061+0+27+0&amp;canvas-2=+35+27+5.268+5.258+0+36+0%7C+0+0+3.896+3.889+0+57+0%7C%2520+0+0+3.896+3.889+0+58+0%7C%2520+-8+0+3.896+3.889+0+59+0%7C%2520+0+0+3.896+3.889+0+60+0%7C%F0%9F%92%9F+77+35+39.853+39.779+0+65+0%7CI%2520love%2520the%2520way%2520you+486+331+2.918+2.913+0+71+0%7Cthe%2520keys%2520to%2520my%2520heart+902+412+2.178+2.174+359+72+0%7Chold+668+592+4.332+4.324+0+73+0%7C%F0%9F%9A%80+1178+646+20.049+20.012+345+74+0%7C%F0%9F%92%B9+1512+54+15.709+15.680+0+75+0%7C(%2520and%2520also%2520%2524GME%2520)+1061+564+1.348+1.346+0+79+0%7C%F0%9F%9F%A9+1540+89+7.726+7.712+0+79+0%7C%F0%9F%9F%A9+1816+89+5.501+5.491+309+80+0%7C+0+0+3.896+3.889+0+81+0%7C%F0%9F%92%96+645+319+5.883+5.872+0+82+0%7C%F0%9F%92%96+653+974+5.992+5.981+0+83+0%7C%250A+1905+666+1.843+1.839+0+84+0%7C+1925+674+1.788+1.785+0+86+0%7CPS%2520-%2520%2520I%2520like%2520the%2520stock%252C%2520but%2520I%2520love%2520YOU+1905+670+1.340+1.338+0+90+0%7C%F0%9F%98%98+1979+1036+3.090+3.084+0+92+0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;emojify.cards&#x2F;?canvas-0=HEY+357+576+6.417+9.018+0+0+...</a>')
