If you use the machine before the capacitors age too far, the electrolyte will be &#x27;rejuvenated&#x27; so to speak. If you let it go too long, the capacitors lose their dielectric and are more likely to leak very high currents, which will boil the electrolyte and explode the container.<p>Apparently, even if the dielectric is old and perished, you can use a variac to <i>slowly</i> increase the voltage and rejuvenate the dielectric without the leakage current ever getting to explosive &#x27;boil the electrolyte&#x27; levels.')
