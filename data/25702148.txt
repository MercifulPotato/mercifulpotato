Because of covid, they&#x27;re back in flight simulators. For them, it&#x27;s very very weird to be in a simulator unless it&#x27;s for extreme scenarios like zero visibility, treacherous wind, engine failure etc. He&#x27;s had a handful of flights in the last few months so his licence is ok, but she&#x27;s got to fly as co-pilot for a while because she hasn&#x27;t flown for 3 months. There&#x27;s a critical mass issue though... If an airline doesn&#x27;t have enough pilots who can fly, it takes a while for the rest to get the co-pilot fly time. So now she&#x27;s in the simulator, and the instruction is simply &quot;Take off from London, touch down in Dublin&quot;.<p>I thought it was like riding a bicycle - you don&#x27;t forget. While that&#x27;s true to an extent, I was told that you do &quot;lose your edge&quot; without constant practice. (I&#x27;m sure every developer knows what is like to go back to a language after a year of not using it).<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting that it&#x27;s a factor here, just wanted to give a different angle to the low flight volume.')
