Or is RISC-V going to mainly stick to general-purpose code?<p>If there are a ton of extensions, will we need to compile all code for a particular machine so that it generates the right code for that machine&#x27;s mix of special-purpose chips? What will that mean for virtualization and&#x2F;or containerization?')
