I build llvm and various associated projects, mostly on linux but on windows and macos sometimes, and don&#x27;t remember issues of this nature.<p>I just kicked off a build of llvm and clang on windows using VS 2019 community and it finished just fine. I used the Ninja generator for speed but &quot;Visual Studio 16 2019&quot; also works. Those are the only two I do.<p>EDIT: ah, using llvm&#x2F;clang to build llvm&#x2F;clang. I have not done that, I use VS community. I&#x27;m not sure this is actually a CMake issue though.')
