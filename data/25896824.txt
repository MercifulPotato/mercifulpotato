I would be charging in my garage.<p>My impression is that many of the superchargers    are in locations that are fine for travel, but not very convenient for shopping.<p>If I pull up to a charger and it’s busy, with the owner absent, how am I supposed to know the status of the recharge? Is there something equivalent to a running gas pump that I can look at to estimate when the owner will return? Or, is the best move to simply move on, if there’s no empty plug?<p>How do 12 EV manage to share 2 charge ports at an apartment?  How do you know when it’s your “turn“? How long does your car stay plugged in, once you get the slot? Isn’t there conflict caused by impolite owners?')
