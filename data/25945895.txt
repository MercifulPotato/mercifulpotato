My point is that, at least for this crisis, most people (and probably the economy as a whole too), would have been better off if the government had given money only to individuals. People would have then “voted with their pockets” and the money would have circulated according to what people needed, boosting the economy “organically”.<p>As a side note, as it has been painfully obvious this past year, the stock market is not the economy - however, it seemed like the government focused on saving the stock market instead of the economy.')
