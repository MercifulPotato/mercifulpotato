Rather, I think it took you a year to learn a valuable lesson and to learn it relatively early in life. For most of us &quot;tech types,&quot; building stuff is the easy part. Telling other people about it, about why they should use it, why it&#x27;s better than the other guys&#x27; -- that&#x27;s the part we struggle with. You tried something difficult and learned something valuable. I hope your relationship survived&#x2F;survives the experience, but remember that life is itself a series of experiences. That&#x27;s what I would take away from this: it was a new experience, I learned something, and I came out of it on the other side a wiser person.')
