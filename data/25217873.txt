I worked for tier 1 banks that used both:java and cpp.<p>The trend is moving towards quicker time to market and simpler implementations and replacing cpp with java. \nThe cpp code bases I had to deal with were old, hard to maintain and easy to break. \nMore often than not cpp was a pretty bad lock in as well. For example a big evil bank very well known here struggled for 3 years to upgrade the compiler on one of those projects.\nDid not happen to this day, I&#x27;m told. Few years later they are still on RHEL6 and gcc 4.<p>Speed is an important factor in this business, but so is time-to-market.')
