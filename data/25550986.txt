CBDC is presumably just a store.<p>Central banks have been against direct accounts for retail for this reason, because they didn&#x27;t want to be in the business of retail lending as well.<p>What would be the alternative there? It seems unlikely that central banks would go into the business of vetting and giving out small business loans. Could a commercial bank function with only giving out loans and no deposit (I guess it would get loans directly from the central bank instead of balancing its balance sheet with deposits?)')
