Engendering hate and race-based conflict through rhetoric has been their modus operandi, and the rise in violence, protesting, and division is the direct result.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone important is going to push for a unification effort that offers White people a way to be part of the fold without having to hate ourselves, which is not something any self-respecting person should accept. White people who push anti-White rhetoric are detestable and nobody really likes them, on either side; they are merely apparatchiks and useful idiots that sow division and damage their own legacy.')
