Git is snapshot based. There is nothing to fix when committing, you just commit the result of the merge. Any diff you see is just for display purposes or for input to the three-way merge algorithm. Other users might see a different result if they &quot;git show&quot; your commit if they have a different diff algorithm configured. Pijul is not immune from diff algorithm problems you are talking about except with Pijul it is part of the repo encoding unlike Git. IOW, git already has the freedom to use a merging strategy that understands tokens or AST since it is not hard-coded into the repo encoding.')
