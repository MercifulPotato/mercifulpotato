The controls I need to have quick access to are not on the touch screen, and the ones that are on that screen, are controls I would have to take my eyes of the road and look for anyway.<p>I will have to grant that they have gone a bit overboard with putting controls in the touch interface, and I still don&#x27;t get why the glove box opening button is in the touch UI, but that isn&#x27;t a problem by any means.<p>I was a bit skeptical of the Model 3 UI, before I got it. But for me it is clearly a step up in usability from the &quot;a million little buttons with weird symbols that who knows does what&quot;, and while that view of traditional car interfaces might be a bit unfair. So is all the &quot;any touch screen UI in a car is bad&quot;, sentiment going around.\nTouch interfaces can work well in a car, as long as you don&#x27;t need to use it for the drive task, but only for auxiliary tasks that don&#x27;t need, and shouldn&#x27;t be split seconds tasks.')
