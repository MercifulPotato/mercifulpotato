Java - OOP, JVM, benefits of statically typed language<p>2. Python - Simplicity. Java&#x27;s verbosity kills productivity. If used properly, dynamically-typed language boosts developer productivity<p>3. Java&#x2F;TypeScript - Asynchronous programming with promises. It was mind blowing.<p>4. GoLang - Parallel programming with goroutines. Explicit errors as values reduces windows of having runtime errors.')
