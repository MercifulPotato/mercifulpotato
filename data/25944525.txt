Amazon offers a lot of building blocks.  We&#x27;re assembling those blocks into a solution so that AWS customers don&#x27;t have to assemble the blocks themselves.  As Amazon changes and enhances those blocks, we&#x27;ll evolve what it looks like to build on top of them appropriately.<p>And before long, we envision offering analogous functionality for the other public clouds.  We&#x27;ve found that the most valuable customers are using multiple clouds and want a single solution across them.  So even if Amazon eventually solves this problem for AWS, the multi-cloud market should offer us plenty of opportunity.')
