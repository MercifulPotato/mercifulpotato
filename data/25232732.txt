IMO this whole experience, coupled with Windows 10, is really crappy. TouchPad driver has issues with sleep mode, with no manufacturer fix on the horizon since multiple years. So my organization&#x27;s solution was to disable lower power states. Now even in standby it drains battery in 6 hours or so. Screen is still 1080p, and even if it was higher res, windows still has scaling issues in places. Settings are all over the place - since some update, the only place to make sense of your language &#x2F;keyboard list is Powershell. People give Apple shit for their QA but I think most of them have not used Wintel in the last 10 years.')
