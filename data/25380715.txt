Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607646248, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25371446, text='&gt; Umm what&#x27;s the incentive or motivation behind making this trade able?<p>Water is a scarce commodity used in industry. Since there is more demand than supply, supply has to be allocated in some way. Markets are the ordinary way of doing that.<p>What do you propose as an alternative? Here are some examples.<p>The first option is to give everyone the same amount of water, and prohibit anyone with more than they need from selling it, since that would be back to markets again. That obviously doesn&#x27;t work, because some, like farms and power plants, need more than the typical household, and they would have no way to get it.<p>Another option would be to make water free to everyone. Use as much as you want. But it&#x27;s scarce, so some would water their lawn in the middle of a drought and people would die.<p>Another option would be central planning. The politburo would decide how much water everyone gets. This requires your politicians to be smart enough to make better allocations than markets would and then actually apply that intelligence to the problem even when there is no personal benefit in doing that and a large personal benefit from corrupt allocations. Historically the results of doing things this way have ranged from mediocre to presiding over the deaths of millions of people.<p>Markets work better than all of those things, so what do you propose that works better than markets?<p>Note that there <i>is</i> a version of the first option that works great in combination with markets -- everyone gets a minimum amount of water required to live and then all the rest of the water is sold in the market. But then you still have markets for water.')
