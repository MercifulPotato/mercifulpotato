It&#x27;s simple to install. You follow a tutorial by typing something at the REPL and it gives you results. Learning stuff like importing modules, etc. happens as your coding ambitions increase.<p>Something else to consider is the Python shell at python.org&#x2F;shell. Students often have Chromebooks. I&#x27;m about to mentor second year high school students who are interested in CS. Several of them have Chromebooks only. I can recommend Python and point them to the shell.<p>I would think Python got a good bump through Hour of Code and other programs to introduce people to coding.')
