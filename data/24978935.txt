Most of the ones not listed tend to be expired, and many vendors sell expired ones.<p>Oh ohs!<p>If so, you&#x27;re in good company. Many less affluent, less educated families find themselves there. Some find they wasted $150 on a Chromebook which has a few months left, and some keep using it, and find their data held for a few grand in bitcoin.<p>Thanks Google!<p>But I suspect you have the CB514, not CB154, which IS listed, and which expires in 2024. If so, you&#x27;ve got almost four years left. Congratulations!')
