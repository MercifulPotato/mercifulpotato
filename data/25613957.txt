I never tried it on MacOS, though it would be unsurprising if that NeXT&#x2F;Mach-O derived object format were unsupported.<p>Anyway, the world of C extensions has mostly seemed syntactically judicious&#x2F;surgical.  That&#x27;s more just cultural, not guaranteed by anything, but it makes me suggest (without knowing) that MS extensions would probably not be hard to support without complexity explosion.  Apple, on the other hand, doing their own chips now and Swift and just generally being even more of a closed system..They seem most likely to make that hard someday if they ever think they can make more money by not supporting POSIX-like programs. :-( { EDIT - there will likely always be <i>some</i> demand for&#x2F;a way to create C callable wrappers&#x2F;headers for system services, though.  So, I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s crazy to hold out hope that this will remain possible&#x2F;not too bad for the foreseeable future. }')
