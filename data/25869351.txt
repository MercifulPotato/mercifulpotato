Item(by='jldugger', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611300605, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25866835, text='Sure, but the dichotomy being offered here is: &quot;instead of listening to our users, we just had to listen to our own good taste.&quot; The original &quot;41 shades of blue at Google&quot; A&#x2F;B rant is a tale of designer disenfranchisement. And of course a former Apple designer would latch onto that -- its carefully curated brand identity is &#x27;good design.&#x27;<p>Ken goes on to point out that instead Apple relies on exec demos (true); yet zero mention of consumer focus groups. Unless your idea of a good product focus group is one slightly egocentric billionaire.<p>And really, the entire argument comes down to: &quot;we don&#x27;t have enough hours in the day to consider every detail, so we just focus on the stuff execs see.&quot; When Ken brags about not consulting data in building his software, I view it as equal parts damnation and praise. If he didn&#x27;t consult any user metrics in designing the software keyboard autocorrect[1], we now know why its reputation with users sucked for years.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;1380188&#x2F;ken-kocienda-qa&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;1380188&#x2F;ken-kocienda-qa&#x2F;</a>')
