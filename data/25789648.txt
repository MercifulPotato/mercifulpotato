This is so the wave output by the speaker will cancel with the wave resonating between your walls, which will help the issue quite a bit (though it&#x27;s not perfect either).<p>With something like the Klipschorn you&#x27;re basically giving up on solving this issue with speaker placement and will have to resort to room modifications to ameliorate it. That said, you get a lot of benefits from the khorn also : )')
