Building released-to-web software without hardware, big teams, long-term API support, etc. should really have almost no process, except for maybe high-level prioritization of features&#x2F;functional areas (which a small-company CEO or PM can do). Reflecting on my own experience, it&#x27;s the micro-management of most development processes that kills me -- 45 minute stand-ups where I&#x27;m arguing over whether something will take 2 or 4 hours. I honestly don&#x27;t know and the powers that be just can&#x27;t accept that. &quot;How do you not know how long doing that will take!?!&quot;<p>I think most teams would be capable of this, it&#x27;s just that the people signing the checks get really, really uncomfortable with the apparent lack of accountability.')
