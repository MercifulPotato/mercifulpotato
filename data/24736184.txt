A good number of those (and others currently worth less than that) are growing very rapidly and will likely reach unicorn status in the next year.<p>So it seems like one can reliably expect 2-3 unicorns to come out of each YC batch. Those 2-3 unicorns likely more than make up for the costs associated with running each batch (including all of the ~$150K investments). Seems quite good to me.<p>Admittedly, there hasn&#x27;t yet been a Google&#x2F;Amazon&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;Microsoft-scale company that has come out of YC <i>yet</i>. I think it&#x27;s only a matter of time until that happens -- anecdotally it seems like at least a handful out of the recent batches could become massive home runs, as well as other more established companies like Stripe that seem to be growing quite well.')
