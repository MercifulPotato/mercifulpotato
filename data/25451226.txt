I went down this exact same route last December. I bought the same Sunny bike in the link, an Apple Watch, a Wahoo cadence sensor, and an entry-level iPad. The Sunny bike broke after 3.5 months of regular usage, right at the start of Covid quarantine. I ended up replacing it with a high quality ~$2k Keiser M3i. The Keiser has been great the last 7 months.')
