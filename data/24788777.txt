You don&#x27;t get to complain that it didn&#x27;t support your preconception.<p>&gt; According to intention-to-treat, the studies unanimously found masks to be useless. But there were a lot of signs that intention-to-treat wasn’t the right choice here.<p>Not a great sign.<p>&gt; In other words, respirators are better than masks are better than nothing. It would be wrong to genuinely conclude this, because it’s not statistically significant. But it would also be wrong to conclude the studies show masks don’t work, because they mostly show respirators don’t work, and we (hopefully) know they do.<p>He&#x27;s a fucking idiot.')
