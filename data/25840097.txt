Item(by='hecturchi', descendants=None, kids=[25840529], score=None, time=1611097123, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25839990, text='IPFS has a mechanism called IPNS where any &#x2F;ipns&#x2F;author-hash can resolve to &#x2F;ipfs&#x2F;hash and the ipns record is signed and can only be provided by that signer&#x2F;author.<p>But this is just another way of authenticating the &quot;author&quot;. You can also use dns (if you can trust it), or you can use signed content, or you can get the ipfs hash through a channel you trust.<p>The main idea though, is that IPFS content is authenticated by default because it is referenced by its own hash. The problem on obtaining a hash you can trust is just a layer above and solvable in multiple ways, as needed.')
