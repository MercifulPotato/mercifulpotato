You saw it happen en masse in 2008.<p>FDIC guarantees funds to the bank. If the bank fails FDIC ensures YOU continue to access your account.  If this means taking the bank into receivership and changing owners so be it.  You can go to the FDIC website to see what banks have failed.  Many do over the course of a year but the account owners are never at risk outside of the insurance amount on a single deposit account.<p>I hope you donâ€™t keep more than 250,000 in an fdic insured account without additional insurance (which is silly because you could just open another account at the institution for additional coverage)')
