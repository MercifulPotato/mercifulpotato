I was surprised to hear that certs were going from 2 to 1 year expiration and that made me really pause for a second to think about the lack of proper infrastructure around certificates, especially LE certs. I envision these short lived certs from LE&#x2F;ZeroSSL needing some of the components that ZeroSSL mentioned above and much, much more. Eventually, if&#x2F;when we have 1 week&#x2F;1 day cert expirations, we&#x27;ll need a certificate exchange system to better handle complex scenarios where other parties are involved (i.e. when doing client certs, SAML certs, etc.).')
