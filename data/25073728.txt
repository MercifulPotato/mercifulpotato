You can, of course, do that with DoH as well, but it&#x27;s not an &quot;indicated use&quot; yet.<p>So the short answer is: DoH &amp; friends break this attack completely against home router forwarders (the first target in the paper), but not for major public resolvers like 8.8.8.8; they&#x27;ll need to take some steps to break it themselves.')
