BTC is money like a gold bar, beanie baby, or block of IPv4 addresses is money.<p>&gt; However, nobody should expect something that will fairly soon have the same market cap as gold (about $10 trillion dollars) to not have a lot volatility as it grows. The tech darlings of today—Apple, Google, Twitter, etc. were also quite volatile as they grew.<p>Nobody describes the tech darlings as money, or as an alternative form of currency. They&#x27;re equities you can invest in, and comes with the expected volatility.<p>&gt; As you may know, the mantra in the bitcoin community is to HODL—hold on for dear life, not to time the market. For long term investors, the ups and downs don&#x27;t matter.<p>It&#x27;s nice that there&#x27;s a backcronym that&#x27;s been created from a typo. I still don&#x27;t invest in money, I use money to invest in assets.<p>Disclaimer: I remain long bitcoin (since 2012)')
