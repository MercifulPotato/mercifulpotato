This meant they couldn&#x27;t just use the lower part of memory on new chips, they were completely incompatible.  The lesson has been learned from that, and CPUs don&#x27;t ignore reserved bits.<p>But also this is a hardware feature so the code will continue to be compatible anyway.<p>Even if this acts like a permanent truncation of the address space by 4 bits, so what?  If you think you can keep Moore&#x27;s law going strongly enough to hit that cap, you&#x27;re probably going to hit the 64 bit wall soon enough after; might as well focus on that shift to 128 bit addresses')
