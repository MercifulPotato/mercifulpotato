What can I do about it?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Just as in the title. We are a small startup and all our API generated emails are invitational ones. They work just like Slacks invite emails.\nWe just changed a domain and that is when the issue started appearing. Our domain is managed by OVH.<p>We contacted Google support 2 times already. Things we already did:\n- Setup DKIM records for email authorization\n- Personalize invitational emails (company name, company logo, inviting person&#x27;s name).\n- Use best practises for invitational email templates (they also are similar to Slack)\n- Setup Google&#x27;s postmaster (we don&#x27;t have data yet)\n- Start handling all company&#x27;s email from new domain to build it&#x27;s reputation<p>Did you guys have similar issues? If so, how did you handle it and how long did it take to be resolved?')
