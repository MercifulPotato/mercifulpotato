Two channel DDR4 is 128-bits. So right there, 2-channel x 64bits DDR4 is the same bus-width as the 8-channel x 16bits LPDDR4x.<p>With that being said, 8-channel LPDDR4x is more than most I&#x27;ve heard of. But its not really that much more than DDR4 configurations.<p>128-bit (2-channel) DDR4 at 3200 MT&#x2F;s is 51 GB&#x2F;s bandwidth.<p>4266 MT&#x2F;s x 128-bits (8-channel) LPDDR4x is 68GB&#x2F;s. An advantage, but nothing insurmountable.<p>--------<p>A Threadripper can easily run 4-channel 3200 MT&#x2F;s (100GB&#x2F;s). Xeons are 6-channel. GPUs are 500GB&#x2F;s to 800GB&#x2F;s tier. Supercomputer-GPUs (A100) and Supercomputer-CPUs (A64Fx) are 1000+GB&#x2F;s.<p>----<p>HBM2 has a MINIMUM speed of 250GB&#x2F;s (single stack, 1024-bits), and often is run in x4 configurations for 1000GB&#x2F;s. That&#x27;s what &quot;high bandwidth&quot; means today. Not this ~68GB&#x2F;s tier Apple is bragging about, but instead HBM is about breaking the PB&#x2F;s barrier in bandwidth.<p>--------<p>But yes, I&#x27;ll agree that Apple&#x27;s 68GB&#x2F;s configuration is an incremental (but not substantial) upgrade over the typical 40GB&#x2F;s to 50GB&#x2F;s DDR4 stuff being used today.')
