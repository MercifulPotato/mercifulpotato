Why is VISA undoing this &#x2F; what&#x27;s the security rationale?<p>A. Is the CVV security number useless anyway nowadays?<p>B. Has taking pictures of both sides become easy to the average optical attacker, making CVVs moot?<p>C. Is it an economical calculation that CVV-on-back-of-card costs N seconds of CVV spelunking during the average purchase, thus costing $$$&#x2F;year in abandoned-midway purchases?<p>D. Has fraud reached a low enough point where it simply no longer matters to shave some of it with defensive measures?<p>E. Variant: has fraud reached a low enough point where the cost of the mechanical process of back-of-card CVV printing exceeds the cost of fraud?<p>F. Does this policy vary by region? (e.g. is VISA doing this in disciplined Canada, but never will in the &lt;whatever_country_with_more_fraud&gt;)?<p>G. ???<p>I&#x27;d mostly bet on C; what do you think? Also, should I worry and complain, or is attempting to talk to a bank beating a dead horse?')
