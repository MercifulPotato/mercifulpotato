It stated getting traction and more and more users started using it. At first I was exited to read the 5 stars reviews and thanks. When the app got even more traction and reached +30K users, the reviews and direct emails became toxic and insulting: why doesn&#x27;t the app do this? why is it free? are you selling our data? (the app is free w&#x2F;o ads and with Zero permissions not even network. It&#x27;s just a small sqlite database with a UI).<p>The I read the Flappy Bird&#x27;s creator story[1], I decided to stop reading the reviews all together, it&#x27;s just too much stress. I&#x27;m sure a lot of users (the silent majority) appreciate and find the app useful.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;businessideaslab.com&#x2F;flappy-bird-story-dong-nguyen&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;businessideaslab.com&#x2F;flappy-bird-story-dong-nguyen&#x2F;</a>')
