Item(by='ytjohn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605279468, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25080108, text='Up until this year, I had using BYOD MBP for both work and personal development, I&#x27;m on the late 2016MBP and it&#x27;s been a great setup that allows me to both interact with corporate&#x27;s exchange server, edit power point slides, WebEx screen share, and still develop for Linux servers.<p>End of last year, I switched jobs and have been forced onto a Windows laptop. I had been using VSCode, so after fighting with WSL1 and Docker on the work system for months, I installed a dedicated console only linux VM (under vmware workstation) within Windows and I use the VSCode&#x27;s SSH remote option. It&#x27;s pretty much seamless. The VM runs docker &quot;natively&quot; within it, the core part of vscode is running within the VM itself. There used to be a bit of confusion if you open a new vscode window, then you had to use that to open a second ssh-connected window. But last month, they changed that so you can connect the current window. When you open a folder or file, it&#x27;s all like browsing the &quot;remote&quot; VM&#x27;s filesystem. VSCode also now can auto-detect when you&#x27;re starting a program on a localhost port and creates an ssh tunnel from your desktop to the remote system (you can also set these up manually if it fails to detect it). Sidebar: Now that WSL2 is available, I could see migrating from my Linux VM under VMWare to a WSL2 Linux VM under Hyper-V, but that&#x27;s another level of effort for about the same end result.<p>Just prior to the pandemic, I had set myself up a linux desktop and made that my primary system (relegating my MBP to secondary&#x2F;couch use). My work laptop was on a stand to the right and my MBP was on a stand to the left. I would use vscode to remote into either the VM on my work laptop or develop personal stuff locally. I also setup VSCode on the MBP to remote into the desktop.  During the pandemic with kids home, I had to migrate from my detached garage&#x2F;home office to inside the house. So I rarely touch my desktop directly and do my (personal) dev work remotely on it from the MBP.<p>In the future, should it come time to replace my MBP, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use another Apple. Since I can&#x27;t BYOD it for my current job, and I don&#x27;t need Outlook and PowerPoint for personal use, getting a hefty Linux laptop seems just fine for personal. If they would let BYOD MBP on the corp VPN, I&#x27;d consider it.')
