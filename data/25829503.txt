Here&#x27;s some examples: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investors.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;management&#x2F;leaders-and-success&#x2F;jeff-bezos-big-mistakes-made-rich&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investors.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;management&#x2F;leaders-and-succes...</a> has some of such quotes:<p>&gt; &quot;Failure comes part and parcel with invention,&quot; Bezos wrote in his 2013 letter to shareholders. &quot;It&#x27;s not optional. We ... believe in failing early and iterating until we get it right.&quot; Three years later, he added, &quot;Amazon is the best place in the world to fail.&quot;<p>Or:<p>&gt; “As a company grows, everything needs to scale, including the size of your failed experiments. If the size of your failures isn’t growing, you’re not going to be inventing at a size that can actually move the needle,”<p>Now, I&#x27;m sure that doesn&#x27;t apply to AWS, and your culture is totally different. You&#x27;re an enterprise product with real contracts, real commitments, and making real money. You&#x27;re not the Groupon clone, online pharmacy or whatever that grocery service *Amazon killed today* was.<p>But if we&#x27;re accepting that Amazon&#x27;s general trigger-happiness when it comes to failed consumer products doesn&#x27;t extend to AWS, why does Google Cloud not get the same treatment?')
