My DIMMs are 3200 MT, so should be running at 1600 MHz. But I saw a note (not sure where) that Infinity Fabric can run up to 2933 MT on my machine and it would run in sync with memory with DIMMs only up to 2933 MT. Unfortunately my BIOS doesn&#x27;t allow to downgrade the RAM &quot;clock&quot; from 3200 MT to 2933, thus Ininity Fabric is running &quot;out of sync&quot; with my RAM.<p>This should mean non-ideal memory access latency at least, not sure how it affects throughput of large sequential transfers.<p>I&#x27;m planning to come up with some additional tests and hopefully write up a &quot;part 2&quot; too.')
