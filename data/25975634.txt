WSB wants everyone to think that there are 150% short positions and only 100% long positions. In reality, each short creates a synthetic long, so there are always more long positions than short positions.<p>WSB also seems to misunderstand the short interest. They&#x27;re pushing the idea that short interest must start going down to indicate the squeeze has started. They&#x27;re not accounting for (or deliberately ignoring) the fact that new short positions can be initiated at $360 which will be profitable when the stock inevitably falls. Reddit can&#x27;t keep the stock high forever with a never-ending stream of buyers. That&#x27;s why they&#x27;ve now shifted to pushing the narrative that everyone should buy and hold $GME to hurt Wall Street, which isn&#x27;t really true either.<p>WSB is also pushing the narrative that everyone is holding (or hodling) $GME shares and refusing to sell. This is perhaps the strangest claim of all, since it&#x27;s so easily debunked by looking at the huge daily volume of shares traded. Shares can&#x27;t be traded unless a buyer and seller agree on a price. The volume is extremely high, which means plenty of people are selling their $GME all day every day.<p>WallStreetBets has devolved into a blatant pump-and-dump megaphone.')
