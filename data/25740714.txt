I found that I was moderately good at keeping a 3D map in my head irrespective of rotations, so it was often a case of having barely good enough recollection to fly out of there within the time limit, and that made it very exciting. I think it was the flight controls that eventually made me stop playing. IIRC the was some momentum when turning and rotating which I had difficulty getting used to, it was frustrating enough that most of my close misses was due to it, and I finally didn&#x27;t want to fight it anymore.')
