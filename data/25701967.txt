My beef with current platforms is that they are good for extracting metrics and routing logs to their correct team (by service&#x2F;deployment&#x2F;...) but not so much for analysis.<p>When there&#x27;s a problem in my system, I want to bring up multiple views, manually annotate, highlight the new debug log statements I just added, mark events as good&#x2F;bad from complicated rules, etc.<p>None of the current systems (except maybe Grafana+Loki) really do this, they focus on ahead-of-time ingestion rules and tags. I would love a desktop or web tool that can do that, working from a log file that I can easily extract from my log platform.')
