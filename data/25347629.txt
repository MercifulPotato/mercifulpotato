Well, first, I&#x27;d encourage you to try Fedora Workstation for your family -- we&#x27;ve worked on making upgrades painless, so that they&#x27;re basically an automated thing that happens while you go for coffee once or twice a year (at your option). But second, if a &quot;Fedora LTS&quot; would fit your needs, why not give CentOS Stream a look? It&#x27;s not actually going to be that different from CentOS Linux, and almost certainly will have less constant change than a theoretical Fedora LTS would.<p>Also, I am not one of the highest upptity-ups in the company or anything, but from the inside: I see no evidence whatsoever that this is the result of IBM anything.')
