(Acid test: Can it detect and link against OpenCL without me having to write my own cross-platform OpenCL-detection script?)<p>* Excellent documentation, including clear and consistent best practices and design patterns<p>* A sensible language, whether a scripting language or a declarative language. Must follow the principle of least astonishment and be relatively free of foot-guns.
