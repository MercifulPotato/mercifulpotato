There is nothing whatsoever stopping you from writing poetry and sharing it as you wish in a free market.<p>&gt; not a good to be traded on a market<p>Sure it is. Mostly in the form of music lyrics, but also people make and sell poetry books all the time.<p>&gt; And yet many (obviously not all) people value poetry to some extent<p>I don&#x27;t know anyone who doesn&#x27;t like poetry in the form of a song. People still sing along in social settings, too, like concerts, church services and birthday parties.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s also a bit of a silly question<p>Not at all. I would expect someone posing the theory to at least have <i>something</i> at the top of their mind they&#x27;re regarding as a problem example. For you it&#x27;s poetry, and I showed that poetry isn&#x27;t suffering in the least under the yoke of a market system.')
