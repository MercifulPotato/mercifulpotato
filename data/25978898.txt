Item(by='teorema', descendants=None, kids=[25980245], score=None, time=1612102068, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25978772, text='I can&#x27;t speak for her but my guess is she&#x27;d say at some point, even if debeers started it, its not about debeers anymore. Or she&#x27;d say something like why do we value the art we do? Isn&#x27;t it all socially shaped? At what point does it become personal? If she wants a diamond because that&#x27;s what she had in mind, and what her parents and grandparents had, and she likes the color and brilliance, what the hell does debeers have to do with it? Couldn&#x27;t people still want white diamonds even if you could dig them up in your backyard?<p>It&#x27;s not really bullshit to want something but wrestle with the ethics of it, or to balance different options. Like I said, she probably would have went with a repurposed stone or none if we exhausted other options.<p>Moissonite for her was this thing she had never heard of, something that didn&#x27;t have meaning outside of a substitute for something else. It was untested. Heck, my guess is if she lost her stone she&#x27;d probably be fine getting a moissonite stone as a replacement now just because it&#x27;s been settling in her head for years and years now.<p>In the end this is just me inferring how she feels. From my standpoint, I just wanted to do what she&#x27;d be satisfied with... which is another angle on the issue.<p>Just to add later: she did like the color and brilliance of moissonite. I remember her worrying about the hardness and not having an intuitive sense of how durable it was. I think if someone had been able to say &quot;this has the same hardness as diamond&quot; scientifically speaking she would have been ok? I have no idea. It was a strange gem to her and she was just as skeptical of it as she was about claims of any given diamond&#x27;s provenance, ethics wise.')
