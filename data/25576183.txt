Problems are evident and if not addressed effectively, they become pretty serious. The solutions are not effective. Why not? The region is chock full of many of the world&#x27;s greatest problem solvers.<p>It seems that the &#x27;root cause analysis&#x27; is many times simply superficial. Too many homeless people? Give them homes. Too many addicts shoplifting to fund their habit? Decriminalize shoplifting. Cost of rental housing too high? Impose rent control.<p>This may be a consequence of the amount of time a politician is in office vs. the amount of time it really takes to solve these intractable problems. If a politician&#x27;s term is 4 years, and it takes 12 years to solve a problem, actually identifying the root cause and devising a solution would be the end of their career in politics.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure that if San Franciscans could elucidate what kind of a city they want San Francisco to be, no one would say they want it to be a haven for drug addicts and have the world&#x27;s highest rents. And there are enough neighborhoods that just about all environs they&#x27;d list could be implemented somewhere within the city limits.<p>Given that San Francisco is not the kind of city that San Franciscans want it to be, I can only chalk it up to ineffective leadership by the persons setting and enforcing the rules. That&#x27;s not solely the politicians. I&#x27;d guess it starts with leadership trying to satisfy everyone&#x27;s issues without triage for practicality or an investigation of possible unintended consequences of their solutions.')
