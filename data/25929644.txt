One that I ran into not too long ago when writing <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ohler55&#x2F;ojg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ohler55&#x2F;ojg</a> was the performance penalty that DRY code can incur. Sadly there is a lot of repetition in that code but by avoiding a dry approach the code is also several times faster than if more functions were used to avoid repetition.')
