They need a way to convert text on-screen to sound (or haptic feedback). Such a program can be easily used for C, because all the structure of C code is explicitly marked by its syntax - opening and closing braces, semicolons, macro beginnings and endings, etc. A C code reader can skip over any amount of whitespace, because none of it is semantic.<p>A Python screen reader would not have the same power. It would somehow have to communicate the significant whitespace to the user through sound. You cannot &quot;remove the silence&quot; when listening to a Python program, in the same way that you cannot strip out whitespace without changing the behaviour of the program.')
