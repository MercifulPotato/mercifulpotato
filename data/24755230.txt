Item(by='bluedevil2k', descendants=None, kids=[24755607, 24755279], score=None, time=1602515772, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24755003, text='The items placed in an auction don&#x27;t generally have a market price - that&#x27;s the point of the auction.  So, there&#x27;s a market price for gold.  It wouldn&#x27;t make sense to hold an auction for a 1oz block of gold because the price is known to everyone participating in the auction.  On the other hand, say there&#x27;s a 1oz rock taken back to Earth from a Mars mission.  There&#x27;s no market price and therefore no way to just sell it.  The auction will find the True Value by auction - in Milgrom&#x27;s case, going round by round and asking every bidder if they&#x27;re willing to buy the rock at X price.  In next round they ask every bidder if they&#x27;re willing to buy it at 1.1X.  So on and so on until there&#x27;s only bidder left.<p>To answer your question about valuing a used Tesla - a regression formula would work best, take the variables like mileage, features, color, etc. and find 30-40 used Tesla sales to create your formula.')
