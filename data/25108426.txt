It used to be part of the british empire and is now part of the american led anglo-protectorate. They are part of the anglo world and I can&#x27;t ever see us letting them leave.<p>Sovereign nations don&#x27;t have foreign occupation forces. Japan and SK are occupied client&#x2F;vassal&#x2F;satellite states. We can call them allies if we want to save face, but if china or russia had occupation forces there, we&#x27;d call them vassals or satellites or client. Ultimately that&#x27;s what they are.<p>We&#x27;d never call warsaw-pact nations sovereign states, wonder why we call japan or sk sovereign states?')
