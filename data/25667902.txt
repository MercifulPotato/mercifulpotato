Even if you live there for 20 years, learn the language and get citizenship, people likely won&#x27;t call you Czech. Maybe you can be called Czechian (if it&#x27;s a real word) or Praguer since those don&#x27;t imply ethnicity. I don&#x27;t live in Czechia though, so take this with a grain of salt.<p>&gt; The company is not owned by the Russian state and has never been.<p>This is true however, and NYT did (predictably) poor job here. Unless there is any indication that JetBrains were involved in the hack, mentioning &quot;Russian-owned&quot; in the title is misleading.')
