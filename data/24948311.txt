It&#x27;s standardized all the implementation for each language is roughly similar and has the same feature sets (middlewares, stubs, retry, hedging, timeouts, deadlines, etc).<p>2. High performance framework&#x2F;webserver in &quot;every&quot; language. No more &quot;should I use flask or the built in http server or gunicorn or waitress or...&quot;<p>3. Tooling can be built around schemas as code.  There&#x27;s a great talk that I highly recommend about some of the magic you can do [0].<p>4. Protos are great for serialization and not just over a network! Need to store configs or data in a range of formats (json, prototxt, binary, yaml)?<p>5. Streaming. It&#x27;s truely amazing and can dramatically reduce latency if you need to do a lot of collection-of-things or as-soon-as-x processing.<p>6. Lower resource usage. Encoding&#x2F;decoding protos is faster then encoding and decoding json. At high throughput that begins to matter.<p>7. Linting &amp; standards can be defined and enforced programatically [1]<p>8. Pressures people to document things. You comment your .c or .java code, why not comment your .proto?<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;j6ow-UemzBc?t=435" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;j6ow-UemzBc?t=435</a><p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;google.aip.dev&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;google.aip.dev&#x2F;</a>')
