They are private companies, and can do as they like within the legal frameworks they operate in.<p>Of course everyone is impotent taking actions against big, powerful, rich, heavily armed, strategically important countries. Who can say anything to China, and even more mundane - Saudi Arabia, Turkey, ffs, USA, UK, France, etc. and try to impose it? War is out of the question ( your population would probably be against it, and attacking nuclear powers isn&#x27;t really a good idea; for the non-nuclear powers, they&#x27;re still heavily armed, so you&#x27;re still looking at a costly military affair), and economic sanctions will probably be more crippling for your country than them, and will probably strengthen their dictators&#x27; position ( country X is our enemy and doesn&#x27;t want us to succeed!).<p>The UN isn&#x27;t the world police, and can&#x27;t be. It&#x27;s based on all countries participating together, and complying to rules set together. The consensus can&#x27;t work against countries with veto powers ( but they wouldn&#x27;t have joined otherwise), or against dictators that don&#x27;t care or can find a workaround&#x2F;allies that will support them anyways, thus making UN decisions impossible or inapplicable.<p>What do you think can any world leader do? Would you support your country, whichever it is, going to nuclear war against China to free the Uighurs and kill millions in the process? Would your fellow co-citizens when that means a crash of the economy, massive job loses, serious lack of all sorts of products, not to mention all the dead and maimed soldiers? If you think a trade war might work, it probably won&#x27;t, and would still heavily impact the world&#x27;s economy, with countries with debts to China and Chinese-operated companies&#x2F;infrastructure being caught in the crossfire.<p>Be realistic. The only thing that can stop China is China itself.')
