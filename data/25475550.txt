The people they follow cannot play popular music because of DMCA take downs.<p>The result is that a natural avenue for discovery music is cut off. Consumers will not associate the experience of the thing they&#x27;re enjoying with the music as has traditionally been the case with TV, movies, and bars. The setting has a lot to do with growing attachment for that band or that song in the first place.<p>The record companies are shooting themselves in the foot here.<p>It&#x27;s maybe a good thing - a new opportunity is open for a platform that allows a more permissive license. Artists that choose such would likely get a lot more exposure.<p>Maybe the Beatles of the future will finally be creative commons as it should be. Their music is, after all, is bigger than the band.
