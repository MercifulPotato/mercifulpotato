Eg Twitch seems like such an obvious idea now (but I don&#x27;t think my bad bet meter would have given Twitch a good score in 2008 - why would people watch other people play games instead of, you know, playing the game themselves?). In all honesty, I don&#x27;t think I would have predicted the meteoric success of a search engine or social media. Who wants an app that just deletes pictures from your phone? Why would I trust a stranger enough to get into their car? The Wright brothers sound a bit wonky in the head, trying to get something that heavy to fly. Etc.')
