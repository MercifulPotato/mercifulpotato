Guess what, we actually had a vote on whether we wanted to stay in Canada twice and decided than we&#x27;d rather stay with the federation. Do people in Quebec have various opinions on Canada? For sure. Does it extend to the US, UK and the rest of Europe? Absolutely not.<p>And since this is about Valhalla, why on earth would people in Quebec have some biases for Vikings?
