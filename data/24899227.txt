Almost all these systems give weighted probabilities to different parses, and if you gave the human a choice between the top 3, you could be much more exploratory&#x2F;risk-taking in choosing candidates. Or in machine translation or transcription, why do Google Translate and YouTube automatic captioning not communicate the system&#x27;s level of comfort with what it gives you, and provide alternative possibilities if that is low?<p>We&#x27;re humans - we can deal with ambiguity. Systems should trust that we&#x27;ll respect them <i>more</i> if they tell us they&#x27;re unsure, rather than either jumping to the wrong conclusion or simply being unwilling to guess!')
