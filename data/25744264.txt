What&#x27;s to think about? They&#x27;re just an annoyance, to be swatted aside.<p>We can <i>choose</i> to think of flies; to imagine they are as people, with their own (short) lives, wants and wishes and dreams; that there is fly art and fly culture equal to our own. We can so imbue those flies with our animism and ethics, and treat them the way we should (ethically) treat any other person.<p>If we can do that, I think there is a good chance our gods can do the same, but using their superintelligent-culture, and their superintelligent-art, and their superintelligent-ethics, but imagining as we can the fly who is human, they choose to imagine human who is god.<p>Maybe the point is our gods can be kind to us if we can find some way to convince ourselves to be kind to the fly.')
