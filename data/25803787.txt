Certainly some level of Schadenfreude. But, I won&#x27;t go into that here.<p>This seems more like a targeted public embarrassment operation than an attempt at identity theft. Objectively, Nidhi made a ton of elementary mistakes that would be inexcusable for a journalist. This includes non-technological mistakes such as not contacting the Dean or prospective collaborators who presumably voted to have her on the faculty. There is an immense amount of hubris on display as well. That being said, the scammers were incredibly sophisticated and committed to the ruse.<p>Either ways, this sets a bad precedent. The internet allows for sophisticated scams like never seen before. A public embarrassment in the world of twitter can easily end careers.<p>I hope she finds some quiet in the midst of this public show where she has been made an unwilling jester. She should have handled this in private. Now that it is out on Twitter, trolls will make sure she never forgets what I presume has been incredibly traumatic.')
