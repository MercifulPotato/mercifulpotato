The argument is:<p>1.  It&#x27;s vaguely mnemonic of FirST and ReST, but compactified enough that it&#x27;s still parseable as abstract names with no particular semantics<p>2.  It&#x27;s composable the same way that CAR and CDR are, e.g. FFRST == CAADR.<p>Another good pair of names is LHS and RHS for Left Hand Side and Right Hand Side.  Same argument applies.')
