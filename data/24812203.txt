Or in general, same groupings of letters that are pronounced differently. That aside, there&#x27;s a bunch of words that have been imported from English to Polish that mess me up (I&#x27;m getting tripped by the Polish pronunciation, it bleeds into how I speak the word). Grammar is actually great to learn (same goes for Spanish based on my limited experience with it).')
