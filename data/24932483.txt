Many laws are ambiguous. Sometimes you read a law and think you know what it means but it turns out it applies where you don&#x27;t expect and doesn&#x27;t apply where you do expect.<p>The law is complicated and expensive and painful. You need lawyers and judges and juries. People are, as you observe, severely hurt by the law.<p>These are reasons why we don&#x27;t need some pseudo sub-law drafted quickly by amateurs. The real law still applies and the fake law is arbitrarily enforced.')
