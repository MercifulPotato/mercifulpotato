However entropy, is in larger systems entirely unmeasurable as far as I understand (is there even a unit for it?).<p>Rather than tackle-these scientific shortcomings head-on, most tend to gloss over it. Perhaps a good place to start is to talk about the limited places we can observe it, and the logical reasons that our observations in these limited places must apply more generally. And then to explain whether a unit exists or not, why it matters so much.')
