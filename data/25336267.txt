The only reason I&#x27;m not going to jail is because it&#x27;s technically and economically not easy to enforce it. Just because I&#x27;m not going to jail doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not stealing. Stealing is stealing.<p>All I&#x27;m saying is people who do illegal downloads should at least understand what they are doing is technically a theft and don&#x27;t feel so entitled for stealing from other people. I sincerely hope there are better ways to incentivize creators who spend their time and energy producing their intellectual property to the world.')
