Working with Arduino, you&#x27;ll find that the CPU is reasonably capable but that the programming abstractions are clunky, and that&#x27;ll give you the excuse you need to get comfortable with direct I&#x2F;O port access.  What you learn along the way will apply on more sophisticated platforms.<p>As for the temperature sensor, it&#x27;s most likely digital (I2C or similar interface).  Without the part number it may be difficult to get it working.  If you don&#x27;t have the part number, it&#x27;s best to chuck it and order one from Adafruit or Sparkfun that comes with the necessary documentation and support code.  Reusing salvaged parts isn&#x27;t the cost&#x2F;productivity win that it used to be.<p>If you need more horsepower for your project than an Arduino or Teensy-class board can provide, then you would want to look at Raspberry Pi or Beaglebone Black.  If you aren&#x27;t already comfortable with *nix development, you have a massive learning curve ahead, for better or worse, and you&#x27;re going to be spending a lot of time in Professor Google&#x27;s classroom.')
