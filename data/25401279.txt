Where PC operating systems go to sleep when there is nothing to do for a while, Android sleeps until being woken by user interaction or scheduled timer events. It then performs the task(s) after which it goes to sleep again. A music player on a PC would keep the machine awake, a similarly built player would stop playing after a few seconds on Android unless the developer made sure to schedule wakeups or used the big hammer of requesting a wake lock. Spurious wake locks used to be a common cause of drained batteries until Android started to put limits on background processes.')
