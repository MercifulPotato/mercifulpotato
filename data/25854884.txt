I mean stop for months.<p>I agree, when a recall happens the store should pull them from the shelves, and consumers shouldn&#x27;t have to worry about it. Not everyone feels this way.<p>I&#x27;m only making a point about perception. There is a feedback loop with media, Facebook, whatever. The public CAN lose trust in lettuce, and it is not something to take for granted.')
