Access to a lawmaker or representative in a village may work like that. When you represent a state of 20 million, access means making an appointment and going through security clearance. There is a voting mechanism, a free press and various other mechanisms to back me up if I am consistently deterred from speaking to my public representative. But I&#x27;m in no way expecting to just walk in there, unannounced, without security clearance, at any time of the day, to demand attention.<p>Might as well argue that you should be able to just walk into the white house and speak to the top public representative.')
