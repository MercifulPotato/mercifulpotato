I started running and lifting at about 6 AM and slowly moved that back to 5 AM over the course of a year. It completely rewired my brain. I get sleepy around 9 PM now and fall asleep with no effort. If I don&#x27;t set any alarms, I&#x27;m typically awake by 6-7 AM. The big downside is that on the occasions I do need to stay up until the early hours of the morning, it&#x27;s a real struggle.<p>(An alternative interpretation of these events is that my body rewired itself in my mid 20s and my behavior changed accordingly.)')
