As everyone has been saying since decades, comments are for the <i>why,</i> not the <i>what.</i><p>Also, recall should be upper bound to the time it takes to find the relevant commit message. Having to actually recall from my brain why something was done is a terrible way to work: presumably at most two people in the original group know why, the people may not even be there anymore, and recall is far from perfect.')
