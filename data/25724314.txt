We just used it last Friday for a company offsite, and these issues killed the experience for myself and a few others:<p>1. You don’t see who is speaking when there are many people present— you have to scroll through participants to find the person talking. Lots of new employees, I didn’t know who was talking about half the time<p>2. Connection issues. I couldn’t hear the speaker but others could, for extended periods of time. Missed entire presentations due to this unfortunately, as I couldn’t hear or have any means of connecting to the speaker.<p>Don’t get me wrong it’s fun software, but it’s not ready to be your rock solid all-hands replacement quite yet.
