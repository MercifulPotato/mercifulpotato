(In fact, if you&#x27;re a lawyer with a bit of an idea of software engineering, you might make the argument that the code is testing the correctness of whether it can infringe copyright!)<p>As an (hastily made, non-expert) example consider a particular gun called the &quot;PandaHunter 9000&quot;. Now, pandas being endangered species and such, and having reports that people use buy the &quot;PandaHunter 9000&quot; to kill pandas, you might consider banning the purchase of such a gun. Of course, the manufacturer is going to say that you can use the gun for something else, and its intended purpose is not to kill pandas, but then imagine you find that they&#x27;ve actually been shooting pandas with the gun to test it. Do you see why youtube-dl has put itself in a somewhat unfortunate spot?')
