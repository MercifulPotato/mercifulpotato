FWIW I bought and read &quot;C++ Crash Course&quot; by Lospinso. I found that tremendously helpful with his approach of &quot;assuming you really know C [I do], here is C++&quot; and can easily recommend his book for anyone on this path.<p>That said, I like your ordering too.<p>The other confounding factor is that I have also written a lot of Java code (both during the development of the language and afterward for my column in Javaworld) which I really enjoyed, but it too &quot;fixes&quot; some things which James disliked about C++ (and as a long time C programmer I understood quite well).<p>As a learning experience, this journey has been confounding, enlightening, and painful in equal measures :-)')
