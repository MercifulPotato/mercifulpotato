It wasn&#x27;t until another Google employee showed up much later and echoed that there was a problem with Dart&#x27;s implementation that the maintainers would acknowledge the problem even existed.<p>The kicker is that the maintainers at Google then followed up with wanting me to submit <i>another PR with additional changes that they wanted to see</i> instead either merging the fix or adding the additional changes themselves.<p>Now my attitude towards Google&#x27;s open source projects is if they want contributions, they can pay me. I&#x27;m not wasting my time for free again for them.')
