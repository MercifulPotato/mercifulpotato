In an old vaccine, you&#x27;d just dump a bunch of spike proteins into the system. Here, you&#x27;re adding the step of making the body produce them. Could you clarify?<p>2) Why not just produce those spikes in a lab? Is it just much less resource intensive to have the bodies make them?<p>3) As far as stressing that this doesn&#x27;t alter DNA: Wouldn&#x27;t it suffice to say &quot;this does what viruses already do, but less&quot;?')
