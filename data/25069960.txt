I also lived in other European countries. No big deal, compared to the US (where I used to live for some time, too, but couldn&#x27;t get a good path to immigrate without losing my independence as a consultant). In most European countries, you can get a citizenship in 5 years, less in some cases (if you are e.g. a student in France). Switzerland is an exception, it requires 10 years now.')
