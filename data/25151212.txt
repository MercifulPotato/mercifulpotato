It is a mandate in the corporate administrative sense.<p>The problem is many people don&#x27;t feel they should be forced to pay into an organization that doesn&#x27;t reflect their values in order to have a job. In some ways, it&#x27;s similar to the notion that many people don&#x27;t feel they should pay taxes that go to support something they don&#x27;t personally support (e.g., abortion, war de jour).<p>Right-to-work is a way around that in many peoples eyes. In my opinion, it&#x27;s a policy that takes advantage of people&#x27;s short-term bias.<p>Saying &quot;just don&#x27;t take that job&quot; is like saying &quot;just don&#x27;t live in that society&quot;. It&#x27;s not wrong; it&#x27;s just not particularly helpful')
