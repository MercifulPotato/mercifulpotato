Item(by='ryantgtg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607896568, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25409690, text='I think sharrows are usually poorly-implemented - say on streets with high speeds or high volumes of cars. But I think they can be not completely worthless depending on the context. For example, Mountain View has design practices that suggest only streets with low speeds (I believe it’s 25 and under) should have them. Furthermore, they should be augmented with additional treatments, such as speed humps, chicanes, and bollards that force vehicles to turn off the road (so drivers can’t use the quiet neighborhood as an extensive cut-through). In that context - as just one tool that complements others - they have some value. Portland has good examples of this on their Neighborhood Greenway network.<p>Market Street seems like a poor place for sharrows.')
