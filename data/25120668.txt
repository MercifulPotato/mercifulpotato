But my advisor did, and he is a mathematician who attended Feynman&#x27;s lectures on computation. (Again the breadth : a math Ph.D taking a course in theory of computation from a Physicist.)<p>Feynman&#x27;s requirement for an A grade in the course was &quot;prove something original&quot;. Someone timidly asked, &quot;Well, what if we can&#x27;t?&quot; He replied: &quot;Then I feel sorry for you.&quot; I wish my history were slightly different.<p>But you must be more discreet, I think. It&#x27;s not wise to give intimate medical information to strangers who might not be medical experts.  All the best for your future.')
