You&#x27;d have an office full of incompetent people that are making $150k&#x2F;yr just because they&#x27;re a friend or relative of someone. That&#x27;s a really big problem in government and there&#x27;s no simple solution here. Even if you started doing background checks and not allowing partners&#x2F;relatives of current employees to be hired, they would just get picked up as favors by other districts. A sort of friend hiring exchange program if you will.')
