TSMC plays fast and loose with their definition of node. Any fab folks want to speak up?<p>What I mean by that:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcgamesn.com&#x2F;amd&#x2F;tsmc-7nm-5nm-and-3nm-are-just-numbers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pcgamesn.com&#x2F;amd&#x2F;tsmc-7nm-5nm-and-3nm-are-just-n...</a><p>&quot;And also goes some way to explaining why, despite TSMC offering a nominally 7nm process, the general consensus has been that Intel’s 10nm design is pretty much analogous. But what’s 3nm between fabs? At that level, probably quite a lot. But if the 7nm node is more of a branding exercise than genuinely denoting the physical properties of that production process then you can understand why there’s supposedly not a lot in it.&quot;')
