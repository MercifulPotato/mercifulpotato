Item(by='DanBC', descendants=None, kids=[25625559], score=None, time=1609709469, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25624981, text='Uber were running ads, and some of them were appearing on Breitbart.<p>There&#x27;s a campaign called &quot;sleeping giants&quot; that looks at a company&#x27;s corporate values, and looks at where that company is advertising, and asks whether that ad placement is compatible with the values.  Breitbart has freedom to say what they like, but customers of Uber don&#x27;t have to buy the megaphone.<p>Uber tried to pull the ads from Breitbart.<p>But the ads kept appearing.<p>So Uber looked closer, and they realised some of the data reporting was fraudulent. One ad company had a &quot;battery saver&quot; ap on Google Play. That ap had strong permissions, and it was scanning for people typing &quot;uber&quot; into the Google Play store. When they did that the ap made it look like the user had clicked on an ad and then installed the Uber app when they&#x27;d just organically found the uber app themself.<p>Uber closed off a lot more of their ad spend and they found no difference in user signup.')
