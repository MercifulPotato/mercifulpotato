Item(by='schoen', descendants=None, kids=[25525968], score=None, time=1608767842, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25522370, text='Cool, thanks for the reply!<p>I&#x27;m a vegan living in a place with a lot of vegan options and I&#x27;ve sometimes been surprised that delivery apps don&#x27;t have better data and interfaces to clearly say &quot;really, <i>only</i> show me items that definitely match my dietary restrictions&quot;. Caviar&#x2F;DoorDash has gotten a little better about this than it used to be, but is still not totally reliable. On the other hand, their user interface has many fewer steps than what you showed in the video, probably because it&#x27;s not focused on customization as the first step, but more on discovery.<p>I would imagine that customization is most relevant when people are relying getting things that are off-menu (maybe because they&#x27;re in a place without many vegan restaurants or restaurants with good, clearly-marked vegan items). But maybe in places with a lot of vegan food discovery is more interesting, because people might like to learn about dishes or cuisines that they haven&#x27;t ever tried before.<p>It could be helpful to think about how to let users make that switch in focus easily, so that there&#x27;s a clear path to choose either &quot;I know exactly what I want and I&#x27;m curious who can be induced to cook it for me&quot; or &quot;I know exactly what my dietary restrictions are, but I&#x27;m wondering what interesting dishes are available in my area that I might not have thought of, or might not be thinking of right this minute&quot;.')
