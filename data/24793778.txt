Really just curious about specifics, as I fully understand that people have different opinions on gun ownership. I used to be really against gun ownership too.<p>Is it because\n1. I didn&#x27;t state facts? I double checked videos\n2. I took what politicians&#x27; words out of context? Again, I double checked the context. \n3. I should not use a gun whatsoever? But then how do I protect myself, assuming escaping is not an option (of course I&#x27;ll try to run first). \n4. This is advocating violence? Then what&#x27;s a better alternative?')
