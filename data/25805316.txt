Nobody else but you is responsible for how you feel. John didn&#x27;t let you down, you had expectations about what he was going to do, and to your assessment, he didn&#x27;t meet those expectations (that&#x27;s also a reasonable thing to say, I think -- I would give more detail and context about specifically how those expectations weren&#x27;t met). That you felt one way or another about this has nothing to do with John, and there&#x27;s a lot of subtle and overt problems that can arise in a relationship when we attribute our experience to another person with our language.<p>I also mention that it sounds overly-generalized because saying &quot;when you do X&quot; has an implicit assumption that he will continue doing X in the future, and isn&#x27;t really all that specific about why X has certain consequences - I think it&#x27;s better to use specific situations in the past when X happened and to talk about what came up when that occurred. This is basically what I&#x27;m hearing you say in Point 2 :)<p>edit: fixed variables, wording')
