It cost more money, but it was definitely better bar none.<p>I think doctors are as good as their tools (education) and the feed back they get.  They can only listen to what patients say, however most people aren&#x27;t able to explain in detail what is going on.  As well, western medicine tries to focus on specific locations&#x2F;ailments and can miss the holistic portion of sickness.  This challenge is compounded by the fact that many illness have similar symptoms and human bodies are intensely complicated.<p>I don&#x27;t trust a doctor 100% (many of my friends do) however I do put a fair bit of faith in their training.  Anything serious requires more research on my own as doctors are fallible.<p>The thought you raise that you shouldn&#x27;t challenge or ask questions of what a doctor is telling you is quite alarming and I would wager that kind of laziness leads to poor health outcomes.  As I said, doctors are human and are fallible, the research (i.e. human health systems) is not complete, and they are working on deeply complex issues that have incredible amounts of interactions that are unknown and incredibly challenging.<p>That said - the doctor better be able to explain in a straightforward manner in order to gain trust.  And any profession that you should just &quot;inherently trust&quot; allows openings for laziness, abuse and bad outcomes.  Strongly disagree with you.')
