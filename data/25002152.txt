I feel like the tech boom is somewhat like a &quot;resource curse&quot;. Obviously tech has a lot more positive economic development associated with it, but a lot of it can just pick up and move to the peninsula or south bay.<p>It seems like a potentially bad mix where a lot of people live in SF just for the money, and as soon as a downturn hits amd the bad policies start to have consequences it will just hollow out. That may be happening now.')
