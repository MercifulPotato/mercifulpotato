Thankfully, I noticed it when testing the backups so I didn&#x27;t actually lose any data.<p>I&#x27;ve since switched to using encrypted rclone backups due to the design decision of having each source file map to one target file. For my specific use case, it&#x27;s more important that corruption of backup files has minimal impact vs. having good deduplication. I also like that the format is simple enough where I feel confident I could write an extraction tool that skips checksum validation or bad blocks if I really need to.')
