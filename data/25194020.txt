Item(by='peterburkimsher', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606179998, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25193110, text='Repartitioning from another distro (Elementary in my case, due to WiFi and trackpad support) is what I did for most of the installs. I still wasn&#x27;t fully sure how to run the CLI commands for a particular partition, rather than a full disk. In the end, Redcore just gave a better installation process for the same backend kernel.<p>Speaking of Knoppix, though, it worked great for USB boot, but I couldn&#x27;t for the life of me manage to get Knoppix booting from an internal partition. Flashing the ISO makes 3 partitions from USB, and if I copy those to internal partitions with cp -Lr, and set the boot flags, they&#x27;re still not detected. Eventually I just used Kanotix.')
