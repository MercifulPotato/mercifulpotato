I know of tons of people who feel this way.  You are arguing against a straw-man.  Yes, there are many conspiracy theory nutcases out there.  But people who believe all the numbers and still think we are overreacting are still being censored&#x2F;ignored to oblivion.  Not only that, but my (highly reliable ;-) anecdata tells me that most of these people are busy raising kids and growing the food you eat.  Just because they don&#x27;t have the time to spray their opinions all over the internet and petition their govt officials to freak out doesn&#x27;t mean that their viewpoints are less valid.')
