Consider:<p><pre><code>    package foo\n\n    type T interface { func Bar() }\n\n    func New() T {\n       return &amp;someotherpackage.ImplPickedAtRuntime{...}\n    }\n</code></pre>\nNow whenever you see:<p><pre><code>    x := foo.New()\n    x.Bar()\n</code></pre>\nYou have no idea where to read the code for Bar.  For maximum fun, ImplPickedAtRuntime should then contain members that were allocated in the same way.  What should be a simple M-. then eats up your entire afternoon.')
