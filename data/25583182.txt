Item(by='ve55', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609346622, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25581727, text='&gt;Clicking on the names of these &quot;brands&quot; takes you to a search result with no additional information on who made these products.<p>This in particular bugs me quite a bit on Amazon. The link for the &#x27;brand&#x27; appears as if you can click it and then see information about who you are buying from, but instead it just performs a search for the word and you often get zero useful results.<p>Instead I&#x27;d like to see basic information about the seller: what items do they sell, how many have they sold, what country are they based in, what is their average review, and so on.')
