Though, this is NOT a sales website, it&#x27;s a springboard&#x2F;archive of a body of work, spanning 15-20 years (eventually)...<p>My sense from some of your above argumentation and issues re: word choices, is that there&#x27;s somewhat of an implicit expectation of the uniform format of SV-stylee startup landing pages and JS libraries: snappy big letter bullet list of selling points, 5-line code examples and a big fat get started button...<p>People with such expectations really haven&#x27;t been the audience so far and likely never will be. Can I&#x2F;we do a better job to demonstrate use cases and help guiding people discovering relevant projects for their use cases? Yes, definitely, but bandwidth issue, function over time. Though, it&#x27;s <i></i>very<i></i> likely the following will remain an unmovable truth (as explained on the thi.ng&#x2F;umbrella readme):<p>&gt; This project is NOT a framework, provides no turn-key, one-size-fits-all approach and instead encourages a mix &amp; match philosophy for various key aspects of application design.<p>There&#x27;re many (likely experienced) developers who do very much appreciate such an approach, just as there will be developers for which this means a no-go zone. I think this is fine.<p>(...and again, I sincerely thank you for your feedback - food for thought!)')
