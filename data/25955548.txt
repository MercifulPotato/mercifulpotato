Looking at the outcomes - high-volatility stocks are up, safe stocks are down - makes me suspect this is a &quot;risk bubble&quot;.<p>When watching AlphaGo play Go, you can tell when the network thinks it is ahead or behind. When it is ahead, it will attempt to reduce uncertainty in its evaluation, seeking outcomes where it certainly doesn&#x27;t lose. When it is behind however, it will attempt to <i>increase</i> uncertainty in its evaluation, seeking outcomes where it <i>doesn&#x27;t certainly lose.</i> Looking at the market makes me suspect something similar is at play, where the market &quot;should&quot; go down but a lot of investment money is chasing opportunities that &quot;don&#x27;t certainly lose.&quot; In that sense the march drop would be two sequential realizations: &quot;we need to get out of stocks&quot; and &quot;everything else is also fucked&quot;, driving investors back into stocks due to a lack of somewhere else to go. Does that sound plausible?')
