Yes, people want to ostensibly see the different versions&#x2F;states. But for anything past the simplest setups, they immediately want to see changes, since you&#x27;re actually after change management, not version control. Viewing different versions scales very poorly. Even regular user oriented tools such Word offer &quot;Track changes&quot;, which is a diff view. Wikipedia also has a &quot;Compare versions&quot; button quite prominently on the page you mention.<p>If anything, most users I&#x27;ve exposed even to simple diff tools immediately appreciate the value. It&#x27;s just that mainstream tools rarely support diffing since it&#x27;s very complex from a technical point of view (end user tools and apps rarely work with plain text, they use binary formats, marked up text, etc), so it&#x27;s not a mainstream paradigm as a result, and people are less familiar with it.')
