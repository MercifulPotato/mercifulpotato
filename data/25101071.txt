Having each time to upload some code to debug it is time consuming. Also you have to rely only on logs to debug, you obviously cannot use a debugger, and thus the solution is to insert a ton of print statements in the code and remove them, which is not a problem to me (I usually do that even in code that I debug locally) but the service to read these logs (ColoudWatch) is not great at all, you don&#x27;t even have all your logs in one place, it&#x27;s a mess.<p>I think serverless is overrated, sure it maybe the right tool for a simple project, but when the complexity grows it&#x27;s best to use other more classical solutions.')
