Science is a system that produces and organises <i>knowledge</i>. Chomsky made this point many years ago in a similar debate in linguistics. Statistical learning might produce results, but it tells us virtually nothing about the underlying laws or structures that govern language use.<p>At some point this kind of methodology might have very bad practical consequences too. Behaviourism in psychology turned out to be a dead-end for that reason.')
