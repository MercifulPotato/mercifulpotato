I want to see people ask &quot;oh, if only I had no ability to install apps unless the manufacturer of my computer approves them&quot;. Haven&#x27;t seen any yet. As they say, if someone hits you on the head every day since childhood, you would come up with all sorts of reasons why it&#x27;s a good thing, and then miss it if they stop.<p>&quot;But people might get scammed by bad actors.&quot; They can as well get scammed on the web which Apple devices are capable of accessing. Or over text messages. Or over phone calls. Or in real life.<p>Your analogy about cats and dogs is wrong, by the way. Being either kind of animal is an intrinsic property of it that can&#x27;t be changed. You choose one or the other. It&#x27;s not like someone took an &quot;universal&quot; animal that is initially capable of morphing into a cat or a dog, purposefully locked it into being a cat forever, and then called it an iCat sold it to you for $999.99. On the other hand, an iPhone is inherently a general-purpose computing device, that was purposefully and artificially locked into only running software that was pre-approved by Apple, thus limiting what its user can do with it (without owning an electron microscope, anyway).')
