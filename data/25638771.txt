I truly hate the idea of being FORCED to join one though. I’ve worked union jobs in the past in California, and the idea that I HAD to join an organization and pay them a portion of my minimum wage hourly pay drove me absolutely bonkers. This was on top of the fact that the union never gave me any benefits, the reps were impossible to get ahold of and didn’t care at all even if you did get ahold of them. To me, it was a giant useless bureaucracy that I was forced to pay into.<p>I hope software unions look and feel different than the experience that I had.')
