Item(by='simonblack', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605137910, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25063141, text='Questions like &quot;How many tennis balls can fit in a plane?&quot; are a waste of time because they are unanswerable. To have any chance of giving a correct answer, too many variables would have to be specified to make it possible.<p>Ferinstance:<p>&quot;How big is the plane?&quot;\n&quot;What kind of plane?&quot;\n&quot;Will the plane be flying or not?&quot;\n&quot;Will the plane require space for a pilot?&quot;\n&quot;Will the plane, if flying, restrict the number of balls such that the plane is not overloaded past its maximum All Up Weight?&quot;\n&quot;How heavy is each ball?&quot;\n&quot;How large is each ball?&quot;\n&quot;Do we fill all cavities within the plane, such as wing tanks, wing cavities, underfloor cable cavities, etc?&quot;\n....\nand so on.<p>Smart-arse answers, while showing some lateral thinking, are only comparable subjectively by the examiner. Would a different examiner judge another answer better than this examiner does? In that case would person B get the job from examiner B instead of person A getting the job from examiner A?<p>As I said above, these questions are a waste of <i>everybody&#x27;s</i> time.')
