This has 241 points now, so if we assume that the number of people that took the test and has an account to write a comment is similar to the amount of people that upvoted, we get 10.6 with 8&#x2F;10. I prefer to round it to 10, because there are too many approximations.<p>So it&#x27;s not unexpected to get a few person that got 8&#x2F;10, even if it were a topic anyone knows nothing about.<p>(With a similar calculation we get 2.5 persons with 9&#x2F;10 and .2 with 10&#x2F;10.)<p>(From other posts informal statistics, there are like x100 visits for each upvote, but I guess more of them don&#x27;t have an account or don&#x27;t want to make a comment.)')
