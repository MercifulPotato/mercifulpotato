Judges reviewed court cases, and failing to find legitimate cases, dismissed them. That&#x27;s not saying &quot;you&#x27;re dumb and wrong.&quot; That&#x27;s saying - you do not have a case because you don&#x27;t have evidence.<p>&gt; a robust investigation<p>It sounds like each side defines a &quot;robust investigation&quot; differently. Given that judges from both major political parties dismissed nearly every court filing, and there is still no tangible evidence of widespread election fraud, when do we stop &quot;investigating?&quot;<p>The problem with theories made without evidence is that there is no way to &quot;disprove&quot; them because they are not falsifiable statements[0].<p>In this case, the request seems to be to have everyone who wants to believe whether or not there was widespread election fraud would need to review 160 million votes with their own eyes, rather than believe the bipartisan election officials as well as the bipartisan judges that reviewed the court filings. That&#x27;s an unreasonable bar to cross.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.butte.edu&#x2F;departments&#x2F;cas&#x2F;tipsheets&#x2F;thinking&#x2F;conspiracy.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.butte.edu&#x2F;departments&#x2F;cas&#x2F;tipsheets&#x2F;thinking&#x2F;cons...</a><p>Unfalsifiability<p>&gt; Because it is unfalsifiable, a conspiracy theory is not provable or disprovable.<p>&gt; Conspiracy theory is untestable because it invariably proposes that the evidence has been tampered with.<p>CONSPIRACY THEORY &amp; CONSPIRACISM<p>&gt; WE are a small, dedicated group of freedom fighters and freethinkers.

Why can&#x27;t you see what&#x27;s going on here?<p>&gt; THEY have hidden or destroyed all the evidence that would implicate them and have manufactured false evidence that exculpates them.<p>&gt; YOU are close-minded. In fact, you are probably one of THEM.')
