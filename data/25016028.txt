Contradict to HN&#x27;s opinion I think K8s is a joy to work with and with the job of managing a cluster outsourced to Linode, there isn&#x27;t much stopping you.<p>Curious why did you went with the CrunchyData PSQL operator a not other solutions? I&#x27;m in the process of migrating PostgreSQL to k8s myself and would like to hear your opinions why this one.<p>By the way, happy to vouch for GitOps approach. It&#x27;s still early, but we run Flux and except for few Helm related issue, it gets the job done and team is happy with the result.')
