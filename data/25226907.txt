(see the other story about &quot;what happened in 1971&quot; and the general stagnation of wages for the last few decades)<p>It&#x27;s not like Amazon or others are forcing workers to take these jobs.  This is voluntary, inevitable, equilibrium supply and demand of labor -- where willing labor is in great surplus lately compared to what was a previously stable pool of middle class jobs seeking employable bodies, leading to a very weak bargaining position.  The floodgates of global labor competition were opened with a lot of underdeveloped countries&#x27; peoples willing to take up jobs at low (but high for them) pay, and that has rippled through every developed country&#x27;s labor economy.<p>Until there is a relative shortage of willing workers, the situation will not change hugely I fear.  (Aside from pockets of shortage due to education, credentials, monopolies of labor, other barriers to entry, etc)')
