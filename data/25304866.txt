Is this asshole saying I&#x27;m bad at my job?<p>On the other hand, if he says that of course you, dear reader, have never coded a bug in your life - it&#x27;s other programmers who do that, and this new language will help you collaborate with those poor unfortunates? That&#x27;s an easier pill to swallow.')
