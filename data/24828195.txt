The &quot;increase&quot; that occurs with &quot;repeated multiplication&quot; in the layman&#x27;s understanding of exponentials is associated with the real numbers or subsets of the real numbers.<p>In reality, the exponential map is a repeated &quot;action,&quot; where the action can be rotational, as is the case with the imaginary numbers. You can also exponentiate matrices, polynomials, quaternions, etc. Each one has a well-defined exponential map, which you can write down and evaluate.')
