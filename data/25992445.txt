If you do a comparison you should compare fastcgi versus fastcgi, that is the standard way to run web applications. Running with mod should be faster because it&#x27;s running the interpreter directly into the apache process but it&#x27;s also making apache unstable.<p>mod_python was abandoned around a decade ago. It&#x27;s crashing on python 2.7.<p>mod_perl was dropped in 2012 with the release of apache 2.4. It was kicked out of the project but continues to exist as a separate project (not sure if it works at all).')
