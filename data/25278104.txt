I haven&#x27;t received a reply.<p>StarLink is underrated. Where I live, it&#x27;s $100 a month for 100Mbps Fiber to the Home (it was $200 last month) if you can actually get in touch with the &quot;National&quot; telco, which has a monopoly on FTTH, xDSL. The other operators offer &quot;4G&quot;, which goes to 10Mbps at 3 or 4 in the morning. It&#x27;s also capped as you can only download with &quot;high-speed&quot; about 1GB before it&#x27;s throttled.<p>Mostly, though, it&#x27;s a few kilobytes per second. We lost millions of euros in business because of that, couldn&#x27;t make video calls with physicians when we needed it the most for extremely urgent situations [tried 8 devices simultaneously with three different networks to get that to work and it did <i>not</i> work]. We bought about six 4G devices (routers, dongles). We bought a 4G antenna. Main xDSL provider took a year to bring us a line. For businesses, it&#x27;s $300&#x2F;month for 20Mbps. (Yes, that&#x27;s 20 mega <i>bits</i> not <i>bytes</i> per second).<p>There were other providers, but they were shut down by the &quot;regulators&quot; because they were too popular.<p>Seriously, fuck them. Let StarLink shatter these assholes. It&#x27;s taking too long.<p>If there&#x27;s anyone from StarLink here, I&#x27;d like to get some of these babies.')
