Item(by='elihu', descendants=None, kids=[24987146, 24986022], score=None, time=1604362395, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24949355, text='Regarding the &quot;D-minor problem&quot;, the way I look at it is that problem is not with just intonation per se, but with how C major is defined and how it is used in equal temperament vs JI.<p>The probelm is solved in JI by re-defining the key of C major to include both 10:9 and 9:8.  So, instead of one D, you have two slightly different Ds.<p>Equal temperament just uses a note almost half way in between to play the role of both notes, but that&#x27;s just an approximation.  (This double-role can be useful for certain chord progressions that work out in equal temperament even though mathematically they shouldn&#x27;t.)<p>JI definitely becomes a lot more useful and interesting if you allow for more than 12 notes per octave.  I&#x27;d consider 16 to be about a reasonable minimum for conventional 5-limit music, but having more opens up more possibilities.<p>In the context of the original article which seemed to be geared more to just implementing some sort of basic sequencer or picking random notes from a scale, I think picking notes from a JI scale rather than 12-tone equal temperament is an easy way to do something different from what everyone else does with a good chance of having a result that sounds good.  More serious music composition or performance in JI generally requires more awareness of the various quirks of JI versus equal temperament.  I do wish tooling was better; in some ways, MIDI kind of locked everyone into 12-tone equal temperament, and getting out of that rut is going to require some kind of large change.  (MPE and Midi-2.0 are possibilities; time will tell if they pan out.)')
