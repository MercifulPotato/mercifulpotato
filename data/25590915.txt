I don&#x27;t know crypto well enough to say for sure, but it looks like Linus needs to re-read rand.h from what that article says about the state of the comments and previous rolled back changes from Intel. It does make one wonder if Linus&#x27; arrogance and rudeness could be used as cover for a genuine backdoor.')
