At 3% it&#x27;s 258% over 32 years (1.03^32).  Most people are barely getting 1% annual raises which means income increases by 138% over the same period.  From 1984 to 2016 housing prices in the Greater Vancouver area have gone up 800% [1].<p>Assuming I got the math right, it doesn&#x27;t take much to see current young people are getting screwed.  In the last 4 decades wages have barely increased, but major assets like cars and houses are 8-10x what they used to be.<p>Add in the cost of schooling for 2 people, which in my mind roughly translates to the cost of 2 brand new cars for my parent&#x27;s generation, and it&#x27;s easy to see why young people can&#x27;t afford anything.<p>Then consider that &quot;household&quot; income is coming from 2 income earners now vs 1 income earner 40 years ago and you really start to get a picture of how tough it is.<p>How is anyone supposed to start a family when they can&#x27;t afford to start thinking about buying a house until they&#x27;re 35.  Frugal people from my parent&#x27;s generation could have their house paid off by the time they were 35.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huffingtonpost.ca&#x2F;ypnexthome&#x2F;canadas-housing-performance_b_9266608.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmluZy5jb20v&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANvVCZvx9fgRgx1AGvmavlU0NjRdAt0TQBlCpmu79odBxO7CebVqMp0Eoe1AUD0OkNqVKd9O6HIzmE5UsXxVm_VMmWh4-E5ipEA-yfnMKyMBHUX9ZwYKHjM2oY-Bep1a4h9iQRtH8qc--vdLW4zJf_FhUxDtO4MI21W-uskyrhPc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.huffingtonpost.ca&#x2F;ypnexthome&#x2F;canadas-housing-per...</a>')
