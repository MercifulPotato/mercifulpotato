Item(by='vsssk', descendants=None, kids=[25690244], score=None, time=1610137900, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25689769, text='&gt; Georgia election officials intentionally deceived journalists and (Republican) observers into leaving a vote-counting event by lying to them and telling them that they were done for the night, then pulling out hidden containers of ballots and counting them[1]<p>This is a joke, right? Did you even watch the video from the tweet you&#x27;re citing? The video states that ballots were placed in containers because counters thought they were finished for the night. People start going home. Phone call comes in saying keep counting. They take out those containers and start counting again. Observers return an hour later.<p>These are not &#x27;hidden containers&#x27;. You are a liar and a seditionist.')
