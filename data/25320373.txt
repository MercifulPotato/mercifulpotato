Read a bit about the exchanges between Hume and Berkeley to finally reach Kant&#x27;s Critique of Pure Reason.<p>Not only is the Critique a cornerstone of all philosophy but it shows you how philosophy should be conducted--carefully, rigorously, and by finding the limits of the scope of a subject so it may be necessarily true knowledge; this is what &#x27;Critique&#x27; traditionally means, the limit of the scope.<p>That being said my interest in formal philosophy (I&#x27;ve always been interested in epistemology) at all came from &quot;The Life You Can Save&quot; by Peter Singer. I ended up disagreeing with the argument Singer advocates for but he provides both the argument and the counter-argument. With the fairness being so remarkable, the book remains invaluable in one&#x27;s philosophical journey, and at the very least a great introduction to the philosophy of morals&#x2F;ethics')
