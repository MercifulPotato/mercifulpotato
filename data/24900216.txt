Jack Dorsey and Twitter&#x27;s chief(?) legal counsel went on Joe Rogan and openly argued that Twitter <i>is</i> a publisher. They expressly waived Section 230 protection and thoroughly explained that their users do no publish content on Twitter, but merely provide Twitter with content that Twitter may choose to edit and publish as Twitter sees fit. They said Twitter makes thoughtful editorial decisions and chooses what content to publish.<p>I don&#x27;t agree. I think that&#x27;s a lie. Twitter is a common-carrier and should not be allowed to discriminate, but that&#x27;s not what Twitter is saying. Twitter very openly claiming to be a &quot;publisher.&quot; Twitter wants you to say that.')
