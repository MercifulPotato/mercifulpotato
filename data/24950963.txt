They don&#x27;t care about app stores and all the kinds of things we on HN talk about. They care about user-friendliness and bang for their buck. Because Apple used to be so technologically innovative, even at high prices it felt like a bang for your buck.<p>Now I don&#x27;t think people think that&#x27;s what you get with Apple anymore. They play it safe, they don&#x27;t release innovative technology anymore. They just do what other people do. Apple TV+. Wireless earbuds. Slightly better components in each phone.<p>I don&#x27;t see them releasing anything that captures people&#x27;s imagination the way the iPhone did anytime soon. And if they don&#x27;t, they&#x27;ll be just another phone&#x2F;computer company to a lot of people.<p>That&#x27;s my humble opinion. Feel free to tell me I&#x27;m wrong and why.')
