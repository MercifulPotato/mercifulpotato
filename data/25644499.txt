Yet they all want for them and their goods to be able to use roads for free, roads that are built and maintained with taxes.<p>That&#x27;s a complete strawman and you know it. Any libertarian would say they&#x27;d be happy to pay to use privately-run roads.<p>&gt;No idea why they are not able to understand that both things are incompatible. If there is some option that allows both that I am missing, they didn&#x27;t manage to explain that.<p>Privately owned&#x2F;built roads! These even already exist: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Private_highways_in_the_United_States" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Private_highways_in_the_United...</a>. What&#x27;s hard to understand about roads being built by people that aren&#x27;t the government? Yes such roads might not be as optimally placed&#x2F;efficient, but the libertarian&#x27;s goal isn&#x27;t efficiency, it&#x27;s minimising what they consider the moral injustice of taxation.')
