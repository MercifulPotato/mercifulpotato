It works well.<p>In addition I have several playlists, as a song might suit the current playlist, and another song might fit playlist B instead. So any playlist might be seeding several other playlists at a time.<p>Sometimes I go through many, many recommendations, listen to a song in short pieces quickly by skipping most of it. It sounds weird but that way I can pretty accurately tell if the song is shit or not (read: if I end up liking it). If the song passes my filter, I put it to some playlist. I just do this quickly and finally go back and listen to the new ones.<p>As for &quot;dislike&quot;, there isn&#x27;t one per song but there is a &quot;Don&#x27;t play this&quot; per artist. I sometimes play children&#x27;s songs or pop as requested, and after some time the recommendations include music I truly never want to hear again in any recommendations (Marcus &amp; Martinus I&#x27;m looking at you).<p>Also, it feels like only the first songs in a playlist actually matter for the recommendations. I don&#x27;t know if this is really the case. I&#x27;d hope the recommendation engine took a random sampling of the entire playlist and recommended based on those.<p>Edit: there&#x27;s a &quot;hide&quot; for a track.')
