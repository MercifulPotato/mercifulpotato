That&#x27;s very much not niche. Also it&#x27;s a pretty bad example because very rarely do you need to worry about &quot;corrective lense accessibility&quot;, except maybe for things like VR helmets.<p>A better example would be things like wheelchair accessibility for instance, which is indeed very much not implemented everywhere.<p>To be clear I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s a bad idea to implement accessibility features, It&#x27;s actually quite commendable. I just feel like in practice it&#x27;s a lot of additional work to get it right and even then it may not do much good at all. Again, while the &quot;lang&quot; attribute is technically supported by HTML, I struggle to find places where it&#x27;s used in the wild, even in places where it doesn&#x27;t seem like it would be technically difficult to do it (like dictionaries and language learning websites).<p>If I was a gemini developer I&#x27;d definitely listen when people complain about bad accessibility, but I would also take the time to understand how people deal with things like multilingual content in practice and how to make it easier, because clearly at the moment &quot;lang=&quot; is not it.')
