Item(by='Dylan16807', descendants=None, kids=[25719991], score=None, time=1610304530, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25713666, text='&gt; In the exact same details? None. There is an extreme number of parameters and details in each of these codecs.<p>The patent doesn&#x27;t cover the extreme number of parameters and details, or someone would just change a couple and have a nice patent-free codec.  Far more general techniques get snapped up by a single owner.<p>&gt; If these things were easy to make, there would be constant new ones, each improving the last one. This is not the case - they take years and the effort of a lot of people to make new ones that are better enough to slowly replace old ones.<p>That&#x27;s because it takes so long to get implemented, and it&#x27;s a big cost to re-encode.<p>If it was just a matter of adding support to a couple programs and sending out an update, you&#x27;d see incremental improvements all the time.<p>We&#x27;re largely still stuck on jpg and png, for crying out loud, and those use thoroughly obsolete methods.<p>&gt; Removing a funding channel means there would be less, not more, incentive to pay tens of millions to billions to develop one. If you pay the R&amp;D and anyone else can simply take the work and not pay for it, then less companies will work on it.<p>There would be less total incentive, but there&#x27;s still the enormous incentive from everyone working with video to get better compression&#x2F;quality, and streamlining cooperation would be a big deal.')
