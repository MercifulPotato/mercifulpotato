They don&#x27;t really out-compete, they just use their existing vendor lock-in to gain an advantage. And really, by using your dominance in one &quot;market&quot; to gain an advantage elsewhere ends up feeling like a bit of a grey area.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually a gray area, since I&#x27;m pretty sure leveraging your market dominance in one area to compete in another is illegal anti-competitive behavior.  Isn&#x27;t that what the whole Microsoft antitrust case was about?  It&#x27;s too bad the government pretty much gave up on enforcing antitrust law for 20 years, since it feels like similar practices became normalized due to lack of enforcement.')
