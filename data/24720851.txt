It doesn&#x27;t mean that every family of a certain race will fit the stereotype, but if you look at numbers, they do check out. This isn&#x27;t fair, this isn&#x27;t nice, but it&#x27;s a very important piece of the puzzle and you cannot solve the problem without admitting it.<p>I am loving this utter shit assumption that is clearly being taken as gospel given the upvotes.<p>Do you actually believe the <i>AVERAGE</i> Black person you describe is not only engaging in tech with gusto but also good enough to get an interview for a senior staff position at Microsoft?<p>Ah, but the assumption is not only that this will be the case, but that Microsoft will <i>also</i> just blindly hire said person to &quot;satisfy quotas&quot;... WHEN HAS THAT EVER HAPPENED!?!?<p>You don&#x27;t even have a personal anecdote of seeing this happen, and I doubt few of the people upvoting this dribble actually have, and more than likely not to any significant degree in the aggregate either.<p>Like, holy shit, if your description of an <i>average Black</i> is true, that entire curve on the bell don&#x27;t even COME CLOSE to participating in tech AT ALL. Good job on the completely un-contextual resort to &quot;statistical reasoning&quot; to dunk on Black people.<p>Not to mention you show your colors when you fail to account for the children of African immigrants rather than the descendants of slaves in the US. But no, let&#x27;s believe there&#x27;s a line of unwashed Black masses, brutish and poorly educated, standing in an employment line that wraps around the Redmond campus waiting to get that hand-out job.<p>Fuckin hell, what is <i>really</i> happening in the tech industry is that a number of you aren&#x27;t hiring perfectly qualified people because their afro or some such made you uncomfortable so they were told they weren&#x27;t hired for &quot;culture fit&quot;.')
