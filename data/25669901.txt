Maybe there is someone here working for FB&#x2F;IG which can spare some time to help? I know it&#x27;s like shooting the moon but I&#x27;ve almost exhausted all avenues to ask support but nobody has provided genuine help. What happened is that hacker changed email (and possibly phone number) and there&#x27;s no way to use original email for recovery. Supposedly there is a form where you can verify your identify but it is non-existent in the Instagram app. TIA!')
