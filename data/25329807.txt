I&#x27;d expect rows to fall at different times due to differences in weight or whatever. The ship was likely rolling between port and starboard. So I&#x27;d expect a roughly even split of which direction the container rows fall.<p>Maybe they even fell strictly in sequence due to how they were secured to each other.<p>There might even be a video of this happening, but probably not a real high-quality one in the weather conditions that caused this...')
