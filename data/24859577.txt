Trying to cycle or scoot on slush filled roads or in 90 degree plus temperatures is a tedious chore; being unable to simply go out and bring home a 75 pound piece of unassembled furniture, or buying frozen foods in bulk sucks too.<p>Being 50 or older and having even the slightest health problem will teach you why cars are good. My own mother is 70  and is starting to have knee issues; cars are the only way for her to even survive. A lot of ebikes and scooters aren&#x27;t even able to support a weight limit over 200-250 pounds, limiting cargo usage. Many struggle to go up hills.<p>And we aren&#x27;t even getting into things like how bicycles and scooters are much easier to steal or steal from, or how unsafe walking can be at certain times of the day especially if you are a woman. Or having to ride a bus next to someone who smells like shit and is possibly deranged.<p>Cars are freedom and power. There is way too much idolizing a sort of serf mindset here; have nothing, do what government tells you, be part of a crowd dependent on others to sustain you.')
