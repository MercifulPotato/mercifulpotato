Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=[24963351], score=None, time=1604268571, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24957503, text='<i>&gt; There are semantic models of `F + Not(Con(F))` that accurately describe the theory.</i><p>That depends on what you allow to count as &quot;accurately describing&quot; the theory. See below.<p><i>&gt; The difference is that these models contain nonstandard natural numbers (these nonstandard numbers become the Godel numberings of the proofs of `Not(Con(F))`) if `F` is &quot;truly&quot; consistent (according to the standard model of PA).</i><p>These &quot;proofs&quot; are only &quot;proofs&quot; if you accept &quot;proofs&quot; with an infinite number of steps. In the post I originally responded to in this subthread, there is a quote from the Aaronson article that describes it this way:<p>&quot;it has a model (involving “nonstandard integers,” formal artifacts that effectively promise a proof of F’s inconsistency without ever actually delivering it)&quot;<p>Aaronson doesn&#x27;t accept these &quot;proofs&quot; as being valid, which is why he takes the position that F + Not(Con(F)) is unsound--or, to put it the way I was putting it, that Not(Con(F)) does not accurately describe the theory since F is consistent but Not(Con(F)) says it isn&#x27;t. That is also the position I have been taking.<p>The position you are taking is that Not(Con(F)) <i>does</i> accurately describe the theory--and therefore that the theory F + Not(Con(F)) is in fact sound--because we can reinterpret the formula Not(Con(F)) to mean, not &quot;there is some <i>standard</i> natural number that gives a proof that F is inconsistent&quot;, but &quot;there is some <i>non-standard</i> natural number that gives a proof that F is inconsistent&quot;. Then, as noted, you would also have to reinterpret the notion of &quot;proof&quot; to allow &quot;proofs&quot; that contain an infinite number of steps and never actually end, since that is what a proof whose Godel number is a non-standard natural number would look like. And since such a proof never actually ends, it never actually delivers a formula that says &quot;F is not consistent&quot;, so it never actually makes the formal system inconsistent.<p>In the end this is not really a dispute about the math--we agree on what the formal theory is, what its possible semantic models are, and what properties those models have--but on the use of words like &quot;proof&quot; and &quot;accurately describe&quot;. So there isn&#x27;t really a way to resolve such a dispute; we just have to be aware that there are two different viewpoints on how such ordinary language words can be used to describe the math.<p><i>&gt; The fact that there must be semantic models of any consistent theory is a cornerstone of first-order logic and is e.g. not true of second-order logic. This follows from Godel&#x27;s Completeness Theorem (not Incompleteness Theorems).</i><p>Yes, I&#x27;m aware of that; see above.')
