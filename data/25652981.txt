But you <i>can</i> get pretty damn close to the transmitter. The Shannon limit isn&#x27;t the only relevant limit, and is no reason to dismiss out of hand an entire class of optimizations that <i>do</i> help in the real world.<p>(Also, even if your equipment <i>is</i> capable of hitting the Shannon limit, I&#x27;m not convinced that transmitting at the highest power level is going to be optimal for multi-party communications with geographically distributed APs and stations. The information channel between my neighbor&#x27;s AP and his laptop is neither identical to nor completely separate from the information channel between my AP and my laptop.)')
