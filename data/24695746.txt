Once the net adopted the platform model, we were screwed. Platforms are as easy to regulate, as for example the telephone companies were back in the days.<p>They were easily forced to comply with wiretapping demands of the government.<p>The moment a central platform controlled (most of) our communication and was able to provide security to the users by using encryption, legislators realized the danger and also the solution. They would just need to force these central hubs with laws as they did back in the day. Legislation was&#x2F;is needed to break users&#x27; encryption and give government the access to all communication that was lost with modern forms of communication and encryption.<p>So on one hand, it is &quot;just&quot; a return to a previous state of affairs. On the other hand, given for example today&#x27;s methods of automatically listening in and transcribing voice to text, this would be a way more massive intrusion and control mechanism.')
