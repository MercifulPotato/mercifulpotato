I&#x27;m well informed.<p>Second - that the &#x27;government&#x27; was in control of some of the radio has nothing to do with the argument - that&#x27;s an example of &#x27;political speech&#x27;, particularly lacking institutional controls of the press.<p>The genocide was not arbitrary, of course there were leaders and those pushing for it. There were political forces moving millions of machetes into the country to be used in &#x27;the uprising&#x27;. But when it happened, it was almost universal, like a Zombie film.<p>President Trump, using &#x27;direct channels&#x27; (Twitter&#x2F;FB) to spout lies about election rigging, is able to do this completely without any fact checking. He can say almost anything he wants, and a certain % will believe him. He has made veiled hints at violence.<p>5-10 Million people believe that the election has been rigged, and the constitution has been usurped. Those are Revolutionary terms, and they have guns.<p>This story reads like an election in a crappy African Republic where there is zero institutional credibility.<p>A &#x27;decentralized web&#x27; mostly lacks any ability to decipher fact from truth - it&#x27;s expensive, it requires integrity, transparency, oversight - which is why we have many institutions to do that right now, and it becomes a real problem when they start to bend.')
