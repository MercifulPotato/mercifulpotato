I have an allergy against javascript, so being able to write front end code in Clojurescript was a dream.  There are a few differences, mostly due to the fact that your code is single threaded, but otherwise, what you learn will be applicable to later using with Clojure.  I have to say I envy you, already knowing Java, as the hardest part of learning Clojure(script) has been interopt with the host language.')
