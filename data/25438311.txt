I think the AI could use a lot of work. I notice most enemies have some kind of &quot;approach distance&quot; where they won&#x27;t come any closer. Perhaps it&#x27;s intentional but if enemies never come closer to engage, at any point in time or their HP, I can just hide behind something a few meters away and pick them off with quickhacks and headshots, even when they&#x27;re completely aggro&#x27;d.')
