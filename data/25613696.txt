It comes off like an out of touch person trying to stay “fresh” or “with it” shoe-horning a dry press release comment into a medium people use to laugh at cat photos. Even official Twitter accounts and journalists have the sense to link externally to more important matters. It undermines credibility to put those matters directly on Twitter. A single short tweet of that type is bad enough, but a 12 tweet thread is further forcing long discourse into a platform built to avoid it.')
