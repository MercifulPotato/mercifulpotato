Item(by='ChrisMarshallNY', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602414969, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24744211, text='I read the article, but started to get a bit disappointed, when it got to competing and advancing one&#x27;s career&#x2F;impact. It espouses a different motivation from the one that drives me.<p>I&#x27;m not against these. After all, it&#x27;s why most folks get into whatever they are doing. We all need to keep a roof over our heads, and food on the table. We also want to feel good about what we do. It&#x27;s just not why I do what I do.<p>I do what I do, directly as a <i>love of the craft</i>, and all my work is an act of creation.<p>I get up early every morning, and walk a couple of miles. It&#x27;s usually dark, when I do, and I use the time to sort through what I&#x27;ll be doing that day. A lot of that &quot;sorting&quot; is a moral and motivational inventory. I figure out <i>what</i> I want to do, and also <i>why</i> I want to do it. If I can&#x27;t come up with a compelling <i>why</i>, then I have to reconsider the <i>what</i>.<p>I do enjoy writing. I&#x27;ve done a lot of it[0], and will do more. I don&#x27;t have a schedule for writing prose. I tend to churn something out once a month or so, but I will sometimes do a couple of articles in fairly quick succession.<p>I do them for myself. It&#x27;s nice if people read them, but they really help me to clarify what and why I do, as well as <i>how</i>. Like everything else I do, I apply a lot of polish and refinement; even if I am the only person that will ever read it. One of my habits, is that <i>everything I do, I do as &quot;ship.&quot;</i> When even my casual throwaway experiments consist of a level of quality not seen in many large-scale industrial apps, then the stuff I&#x27;m serious about, is likely to be fairly robust.<p>The one daily thing that I like to do, is write code every day. Not just LeetCode (in fact, I <i>never</i> practice that stuff). I like to write &quot;keeper&quot; code, every day, 366 days a year. Of course, I&#x27;m not able to actually get that done every day, but I get most days done. My GH Activity Graph is pretty much solid green[1].<p>I&#x27;ve been at this game a while, and a lot of what I do is almost &quot;instinctual.&quot; Basically, &quot;muscle memory.&quot; When I&#x27;m working on a a project, I don&#x27;t whip out my GoF <i>Design Patterns</i> book, and figure out which of the Basic Patterns I&#x27;ll be using, or my copy of <i>Rapid Development</i>, to set out a project plan; I just start writing an OBSERVER or ADAPTER, without bothering to call it that. In fact, the only reason that I tend to use industry jargon, is when I&#x27;m trying to leave a trail of breadcrumbs for maintainers. Otherwise, I often make up my own terminology.<p>I&#x27;m a bit &quot;on the spectrum,&quot; and tend to live in my own world. It can be a massively productive world, but is insular.<p>When I write -especially about <i>how</i> I do stuff, it often forces me to get out of &quot;muscle memory,&quot; and into the same world everyone else lives in. I have to explain what I do to an audience that is larger than just myself.<p>So, it&#x27;s great if people like what I write, but it really doesn&#x27;t matter that much (at, least, to me).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;littlegreenviper.com&#x2F;miscellany&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;littlegreenviper.com&#x2F;miscellany&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ChrisMarshallNY#github-stuff" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ChrisMarshallNY#github-stuff</a>')
