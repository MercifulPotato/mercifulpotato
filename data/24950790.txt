I studied cognitive and computer sciences (CMU &#x27;03) - and when I graduated I realized I didn&#x27;t know much about writing software.<p>Luckily, I found a software engineering course (Berkeley, 2005) after graduating and they let me attend without being enrolled. That professor (Kurt Keutzer) had wisdom! Literally life changing.<p>These engineering skills are totally different from what you learn in a computer science curriculum. I highly recommend a course like the one OP links.')
