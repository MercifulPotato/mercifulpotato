You&#x27;ve still got people claiming there was no evidence, even after videos emerged of ballot counting without the legal requirements and of people employing sleight-of-hand to remove a thumb drive from a counting location. These incidents may or may not be significant enough to change the outcome of the election but when they don&#x27;t appear to be taken seriously and investigated properly, it creates the impression that some people aren&#x27;t very concerned with election integrity.')
