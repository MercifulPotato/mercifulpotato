He&#x27;s also allowed to do so openly and to a crowd. Language like &quot;will not stand down&quot; is obviously in reference to the &quot;fight&quot; for his &quot;case&quot; and falls in line exactly with the language he had been using at previous rallies and on Twitter. Was he &quot;inciting&quot; a riot then?<p>I hate that I even have to say this, because it seems childishly unnecessary, but I am not a fan of Trump. But I feel there is enough to condemn him for without grasping for straws.')
