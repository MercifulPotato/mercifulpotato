It runs Plex well in a BSD jail and has a GUI that’s usable for everything I’ve needed so far. ZFS support made setting up a zraid pretty easy and it supports easy backups to a number of cloud providers. Of course it’s BSD so no native docker, but from what I’ve seen most people choose to run Docker in a vm instead of on native containers.<p>I’m thinking of trying out proxmox for my upcoming home server because I want to give GPU pass through a shot, but I’m definitely impressed with TrueNAS and would recommend it.')
