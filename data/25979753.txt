Likewise, buying in a tanking market on margin entails additional risk that needs to be well considered before hand.<p>Selling straddles or strangles against a long position in a stock that you do like is reasonable play, but there needs to be a full understanding of how vol and time decay can effect the value of the entire position up to maturity and a recognition that nobody is getting assigned&#x2F;called early excepting unique circumstances (ie, high dividend stocks)<p>For those reasons, I&#x27;d only suggest these types of trades to fairly well capitalized retail investors and those who have taken the time to gain a basic understanding of equity options and the use of margin.  In proper hands, these can be very rewarding trade ideas&#x2F;techniques.')
