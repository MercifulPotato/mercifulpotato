Synthetic benchmarks can lack fine grained precision. They might be bad at determining who&#x27;s on top when there&#x27;s a very small gap. But they provide valid results for determining if two products are in the same LEAGUE.<p>Sure, I an iPad could&#x27;t run Linux, gcc or StarCraft,, but that&#x27;s mostly an ecosystem issue, not a hardware performance one.<p>We&#x27;ve seen this coming for years now. Both the big obvious signs, and the little signs, like Apple continuously unifying code and APIs across platforms.')
