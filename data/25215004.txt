Vegans generally adopt a hard-line, no-compromising position on things like this.  That&#x27;s the antithesis of a lot of what we talk about here, which is continual improvement, perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good, and making reasonable trade-offs and compromises to find better solutions.<p>A startup that said &quot;We&#x27;re going to build X in the most perfect, idealized way, and will settle for nothing less!  We&#x27;ll never ship until it&#x27;s perfect&quot; would be laughed out of town and burn through their money before shipping anything.  And that&#x27;s pretty much what veganism advocates for.')
