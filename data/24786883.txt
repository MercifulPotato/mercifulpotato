As @jacquesm said, good 2D printer costs peanuts. The amount of R&amp;D in color quality, speed and other parameters is huge. There were a lot of teams involved: mechanical, electrical, software, chemical... And because of that investment, there are thousands of patents that the big players are continuously paying each other for. It&#x27;s a very old market with a lot of legacy. For most of us, a printer is something for home photos, some documents, and so, but that&#x27;s only a little part of the cake: the money is in professional printing, ads, designers, etc.<p>Once that is said, it should be possible to work in a general-purpose open source 2d printer. The open community has achieved bigger goals. The biggest problem I can see is the entry barrier: to get a very basic printer, you have to invest thousands of time with a lot of knowledge in different areas, when a basic printer, even from the large companies, is not very expensive.<p>I think that one of the only chances we have for that to happen is that a company frees its designs and patents and community starts working from there.')
