He asked me for advice on how to get his iphone onto a laptop, like with an emulator or something. This was about a year ago, so the ARM mac stuff was just rumors at that stage, and I mentioned that it wasnt possible.<p>Now, I can say hey if you get one of the new macbooks &#x2F; mac minis, you can run your iphone apps natively. He probably will be one of their first customers.<p>I wouldnt be surprised if there was a huge &#x27;professional&#x27; market that is untapped. not the traditional professional market but the ones which want something as simple &amp; familiar as a iphone, on a desktop.')
