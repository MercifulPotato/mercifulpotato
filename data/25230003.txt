Like the amount of work they take is the amount of work it took to get through college, or master your profession, etc. More time than most people can afford to spend.<p>So the first thing to do is learn how to use the work <i>other people</i> have put in to answering the question. Learn how to judge the reliability of sources. Get to know the structure of the existing discussion of the issue. Look for ways to take advantage of existing knowledge in related areas to shortcut those tasks.<p>If you get good at those things, you&#x27;ll at least get better at understanding the real complexity of the questions you&#x27;re asking. You&#x27;ll still do your own thinking, but realize that you&#x27;re not in a position to just jump into that. You need to learn the context first. As other comments noted, you likely don&#x27;t really even understand the question yet.')
