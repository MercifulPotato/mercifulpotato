That&#x27;s just something we have to live with. And yes, energy efficiency is very good (though things like thicker insulation ALSO causes more waste, so, as everything else, it&#x27;s a trade-off).<p>But the degrees to different ways of producing energy cause waste are really vastly different. Compared to spewing out greenhouse gasses and particulates into the atmosphere when burning fossil fuels, waste from wind, solar, and yes even spent nuclear fuel, are really trifling issues. We should do it well, and work on improving recycling etc., but current ways of handling them are vastly better than using fossil fuels.')
