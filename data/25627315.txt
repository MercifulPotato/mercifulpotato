I assume this is public information (or derivable) so I think it&#x27;s safe to share.<p>Internally we have a few Confluence Cloud instances we use, with a single main one shared by the entire company (basically) which is located in a single area (somewhere?), though the VPN connection points are different.<p>So from a network topology standpoint our experience shouldn&#x27;t be too different from most customers (at a very gross level) -&gt; summary is, we definitely have users representative of &#x27;bad networking&#x27;, but you&#x27;re right maybe I should be trying to intentionally degrade mine (right now i think its two cross US hops, but could be wrong).<p>I&#x27;ll make sure our team looks at this dimension -&gt; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible within our telemetry data, but maybe simulating it will get some interesting results.<p>I do recall reading once about something about AWS infrastructure (endpoints? edges?) having some configuration that causes omething like this:\n1 - first returned packet is some some small size\n2 - next packet (after ack is returned) can be double the size\n3 - same\n4 - same\n5 - until max packet size<p>And though (1) is configurable (in theory), and I think the doubling&#x2F;size increase is configurable (in theory), AWS does not allow for this configuration in their services.<p>But I can&#x27;t find what I was reading so if anyone knows about that (a) being a problem and (b) how to work around it, let me know!')
