We just bury them, apparently they&#x27;re mostly resin and glass fiber and last a billion (or whatever) years leaching in to the ground.<p>I&#x27;m interested why this is a problem. Can&#x27;t we make the blades out of various exotic metals like wings of the last aircraft generation are? Before the carbon 787 etc? Then we could just recycle them? Or is there a lightning strike issue or something I don&#x27;t understand?')
