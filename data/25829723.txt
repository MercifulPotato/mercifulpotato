Item(by='JoshGlazebrook', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611027435, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25829306, text='I actually prefer amazon fresh because they only show you items that are in stock. If something is out of stock, its out of stock. Where as ordering through instacart to a regular grocery store, or even the equivalent through kroger, safeway, HEB, etc, you have no idea if items are in stock. Half the time they are out of a pretty significant number of items and either are substituted or just not included entirely. Entire dinner plans can be ruined by a single ingredient being out of stock and you have no idea until after you&#x27;ve already ordered.<p>Since there are no shoppers going into the physical stores, amazon fresh can actually keep track of what they have.')
