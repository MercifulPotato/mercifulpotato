Separating physical abuse from moral abuse and thiniking it is worse is a very modern idea.<p>Before, slapping a child was not abuse, now it is. But that doesnt mean before the abuse of children did not exist, just that a slap was not considered abuse if it was justified.<p>Personally i think moral abuse can be far far worse than physical... in part because people have harder times to take the decision to leave.<p>Im not even defending sean connery&#x27;s point here, just trying to make some sense in why he could be something else than THE BIG EVIL for having this opinion at that time.')
