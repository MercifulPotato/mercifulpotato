People die for a lot of things, is it an argument that makes these things automatically vertuous?<p>&gt; Refusing to vote is no longer a viable means of protest, no longer the smart-arsed thing to do; itâ€™s just a wasted opportunity.<p>So what is a viable mean to protest?  The post itself mentions that elections are most likely rigged, that all candidates are equally despicable. So what is one supposed to do to express disagreement with the current system?<p>Furthermore, there is a false equivalence here between &quot;vote&quot;, &quot;election&quot; and &quot;democracy&quot;.  These don&#x27;t automatically go together.<p>Anyway, the style makes it too hard to understand if the author believes their own writing, or if it&#x27;s just mockery.')
