Corporations can&#x27;t feel shame, since they aren&#x27;t alive.<p>There&#x27;s a certain amoral one-upmanship in corporate culture that&#x27;s seemingly immune from any sort of shame defense.<p>For example, someone inside Wells Fargo suggested that they could simply open new bank accounts for existing customers without telling them.  If this were an individual moneychanger, they would be shamed by society for being dishonest.<p>Even if individual employees can be shamed (and the best executives have long disabled that emotional response), the corporation can just replace those employees.')
