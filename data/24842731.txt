At least it is to someone with a physics background, which is the context in which I encountered it long ago.  I&#x27;m used to thinking essentially functionally and in terms of operation-&gt;arguments&#x2F;objects (or verb-&gt;subjects), not something with the order and asymmetry of, say, object.operation(object).  I wouldn&#x27;t expect an operation to be tied just to one of the operands.  I&#x27;ve seen the result of people trying to explain to scientists, say, Java-like &quot;OO&quot; as if it was somehow mirroring the sort of things they work on.')
