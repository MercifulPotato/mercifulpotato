To me, &quot;to be political&quot; means &quot;to act politically&quot;, and definitely not &quot;to hold political views&quot;; so &quot;to be apolitical&quot; means &quot;to act without regard to politics&quot;. Possibly I&#x27;m just using a different definition from everyone else.<p>Oxford English: &quot;not interested or involved in politics&quot;. Even that is ambiguous; does it mean &quot;at least one of &#x27;uninterested in politics&#x27; or &#x27;uninvolved in politics&#x27;&quot;, or does it mean &quot;neither interested nor involved in politics&quot;?')
