If I can&#x27;t dig into the objects and poke around at how the individual pieces actually run I find it extremely hard to get a handle on these things at scale.<p>I&#x27;ve always assumed it was more a &quot;me&quot; issue, and so I&#x27;ve attempted to work in the more &quot;normal&quot; manner, but with pretty poor results. I&#x27;ve all but given up on Python due to its lack of a decent REPL and gone back to Ruby, where at least I have pry to dig in with as needed.')
