To a lesser degree, perhaps also Rust?<p>Are these actually counterexamples? While in absolute terms there may be a fair number of people using them, in relative terms the amount of people who know C++ and&#x2F;or Rust is absolutely dwarfed by the amount of people who know &quot;easier&quot; languages like JS, Python and PHP.<p>In this case &quot;easier&quot; refers to the amount of effort needed to pick it up and get some result on screen, not to the amount of effort to be a guru. I think for a lot of beginners productivity and even (memory) safety is completely irrelevant. They are not very productive anyway and their code crashes all the time because by definition they make beginner mistakes. What is more important for beginners is to keep up momentum and get through the initial hurdle of &quot;I don&#x27;t understand this&quot; to the point where you start thinking &quot;this is fun, I can make cool stuff&quot;. Rust and C++ solve professional problems, not beginner problems.')
