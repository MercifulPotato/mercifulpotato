United States does not mean that it&#x27;s not a good example of speech that ought not be protected.<p>It might be an example for speech that ought not be protected, but it&#x27;s not an example of unprotected speech grounded in either the preexisting case law or any precedential rule in <i>Schenk</i> that is still operative, so it&#x27;s not a useful touchpoint for analysis. It&#x27;s pure unsupported dicta sandwiched between two well-referenced points of law in the decision.<p>&gt; Speech that is false and intentionally causes a panic should not be protected.<p>Intent is not an element of the well-known hypothetical described in <i>Schenk</i>, nor the even more abbreviated form derived from it raised in this thread.')
