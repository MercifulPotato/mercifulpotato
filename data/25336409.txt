Item(by='rhacker', descendants=None, kids=[25336504], score=None, time=1607370737, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25333448, text='I don&#x27;t know why one would think so, 100 years after the spanish flu, it&#x27;s barely a footnote that, let&#x27;s be honest, most people that frequent this board hadn&#x27;t heard of before covid-19. I think one would mark the previous century as either the great depression or wwii. I don&#x27;t think in 100 years covid will have any lasting effect on the 25-45 year olds of the 2120 crowd (and we&#x27;ll all be close to death). Besides they will be more worried about the coming war with the Xanthiane&#x27;kkas and the Mars colony massacre.')
