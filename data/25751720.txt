It can clearly be used for to traffic drugs, humans, blackmarket weapons, etc. It can be used to flee justice, evade police, abets vehicular manslaughter, etc. The list goes on and on. Is it even controversial to support the highway system as is? Do we loose sleep over it?<p>IMO, this is literally a strawman argument. You&#x27;re picking a very rare, extreme event and amplifying the importance of that event in an attempt to make an argument.<p>Following the implication of your argument (that we don&#x27;t worry about a rare even on an otherwise good system), we shouldn&#x27;t even bat an eye at Parler being removed.')
