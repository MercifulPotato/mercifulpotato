Disclaimer: I live in a city that is growing constantly and has many growing pains that are being worked through.<p>To me, it almost sounds like this type of tax puts more power in the hands of big developers, which is a challenge many municipalities deal with right now - striking the right balance with that. If they want to force someone to sell the remaining property in a block they’re trying to develop, wouldn’t they just need to make enough improvements that the city drives that person out with taxes?<p>I can’t help but think it could incentivize municipal governments seeking revenue to approve big projects without input from people living there, and incentivize people living somewhere to being actively anti-development.')
