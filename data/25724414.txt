The reasons we hold our opinions are fundamentally just another set of opinions.  Unless you&#x27;re talking about something more fundamental - in that case, yes, we can still be friends when our first principles are opposed.  It&#x27;s just harder.<p>I think it comes down to just how tolerant we&#x27;re willing to be.  It&#x27;s easy to be tolerant when the stakes are low; who cares if someone is doing something somewhere else that makes us uncomfortable?
