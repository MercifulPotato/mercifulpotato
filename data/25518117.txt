Last time I checked (four or five years ago, by making a trivial HTTP&#x2F;0.9 server, as the first step of a “writing HTTP servers” tutorial series that never materialised), Firefox either wouldn’t render the output at all, or would render it as though it had been a text&#x2F;plain response (can’t remember which it was). In other words, it’s not a real web page. I would expect precisely zero occurrences among the top million pages, not the thirty that 0.003% indicates. I think it’s <i>far</i> more likely (p≅0.9999) that these indicate some sort of error.<p>(For those unfamiliar with it, HTTP&#x2F;0.9 is the label for a protocol where the client opens a TCP connection to the server and sends “GET &#x2F;”, and the server responds with the body, verbatim, and closes the connection. No status codes, no headers, nothing.)')
