The economies are also quite heterogenous.<p>Norway is probably the least good example example, due to the relative dominance of the oil &amp; gas sector, but if you look at the stock market index of Denmark or Finland, for example, you&#x27;ll find that the top companies are in different industries, exporting globally and world leaders in their respective niche. I&#x27;ve included a Nordics fund in my global stock market portfolio, since this small part of the world economy is disproportionately diversified in high tech.<p>I&#x27;m sure this can be duplicated elsewhere, through education and increasing the reliability of institutions. It&#x27;s the kind of non-zero-sum development that would leave the world better off as a whole.<p>In fact, I&#x27;m a bit frustrated that Norway lags behind the other Nordics in this respect. There&#x27;s something about our country that slows us down when it comes to building profitable export industries.')
