Item(by='fsflover', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608800168, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25524415, text='&gt; The problem with &quot;free software&quot; fundamentalists is they care more about the freedom of the software than the freedom of the user. Part of free choice from a user perspective is the freedom to run proprietary blobs.<p>No one is removing the freedom to use blobs. You can use them on PureOS, too (and I did). The difference is you will not run into proprietary software by mistake (which <i>is</i> possible on Debian).<p>&gt; Also when it comes to freedom to run or not run proprietary software there is no such thing as a wrong choice, just a personal choice.<p>Most users never heard about free software and do not make a choice, just use whatever is installed. This is exactly how you make a <i>wrong choice</i>: unknowingly.')
