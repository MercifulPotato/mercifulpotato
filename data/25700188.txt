With Star Wars it was just a series of profit maximizing attempts. George Lucas released Episode IV. Then he saw a bunch of demand and made V and VI. Then later made I-III since there was more money to be made. Disney bought the franchise and decided there was still more money and nostalgia is a powerful factor and made VII - IX using a lot of the same actors.<p>In the same vein, I guess Indiana Jones is temporally ambitious as it shows an aging Harrison Ford.<p>But unlike the other examples, I there really wasn’t an artistic vision. It was more financially ambitious which accidentally ended up looking like temporally ambitious.')
