Usually poorly. Never with a satisfactory answer, at least to date.<p>If one asks this question, mustn&#x27;t one also define what agency is? That seems like a hard problem in itself.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t see the problem with considering the computer as a black box and evaluating its intelligence (or lack of it) from that standpoint. After all, that is what us humans do with each other on a regular basis; for example, we evaluate humans as a black box in job interviews.')
