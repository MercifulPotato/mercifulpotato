If your CPU gets thermally throttled a lot it&#x27;s more likely that you have a faulty or underdimensioned heat sink, in that case I&#x27;d try to apply better thermal paste and&#x2F;or ensure the heat sink properly connects to the CPU. My Alienware throttled the CPU a lot due to overheating because they didn&#x27;t apply the thermal compound right during fabrication (and seemed to use cheap compound with low conductivity), applying better thermal compound fixed that problem reliably, while undervolting the CPU did almost nothing in that case.')
