They were testing trucks vs trucks with the same axle type, but different numbers of axles (hence axle weight instead of vehicle weight).<p>It could be that four tires on a truck axle are much more effective at spreading the weight than two car tires. Or it could be that it&#x27;s not much better, as the forces are still placed on a relatively small area of asphalt.<p>How this makes cars and trucks compare is, as far as I could understand from the literature when I dug in to it, an untested open question.<p>There could be a 10,000 factor difference. Or if two tires at each end are spreading the weight over 2x the surface area and you assume that matters, then you have to divide that 10,000 by 2^4 and it&#x27;s now only 625x as damaging.<p>I suspect the reason nobody cares enough to test this is that it would still be a gap large enough to make cars insignificant.')
