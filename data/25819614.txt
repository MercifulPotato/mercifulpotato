Item(by='Jallal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610959431, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25817267, text='There&#x27;s something very fishy about ClearInk.<p>I checked their website to see what their technology looks like. I wanted to see how their product compare to a eInk screen use in many devices (such as Kindle&#x2F;Kobo&#x2F;ReMarkable), as this is the kind of products that interests me. It turns out that all the pictures shows the back of what I expect to be tablets&#x2F;phone prototypes (or maybe it&#x27;s just stock photos), and not a single time the screen.<p>It&#x27;s almost comical : you advertise for a screen tech, but you carefully avoid to show how such screen looks like. Definitely a red flag.')
