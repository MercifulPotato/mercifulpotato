If you do something like go back in time and murder Hitler, you&#x27;re going to be impacting the actions of every single human being alive. Within a few generations there&#x27;s going to be an entirely different set of people alive than the set of people alive in the universe in which Hitler was not murdered. This idea that you would still have to go back in time because the universe corrects itself makes no sense because there&#x27;s just no way you would still exist. I&#x27;d be willing to entertain the idea that someone else would go back in time for the same reason, but it&#x27;s all just wild speculation.')
