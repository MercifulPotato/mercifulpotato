Item(by='andreygrehov', descendants=None, kids=[25840355, 25840423], score=None, time=1611098306, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25839341, text='&gt; Apple discovered additional workers as young as 14 years old during an audit just three months later.<p>While this may sound terrible, it&#x27;s not that uncommon in less developed countries. I had my first job when I was 15 and that was one of the most exciting moments. I&#x27;m pretty sure those 14 years old are as excited as 15 years old meâ€“eager to work and make money. It would be a breaking news if a supplier were to _force_ children to work, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s not the case here. Those kids do want to work and they are proud to be doing work for Apple.')
