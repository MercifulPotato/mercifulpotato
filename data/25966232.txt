The U.S. loss of Midway could have spelled the loss of Pearl Harbor and the Hawaiian Islands. If Japan had taken them, the United States may well have been forced to sue for peace. Even without a Japanese invasion, the key position that Midway represented could well have slowed or stopped U.S. offensive moves for some time to come. It is for this reason that Midway, and not Guadalcanal (launched 7 August 1942, the first offensive of the United States against the Japanese), is included in this work. A U.S. loss at Guadalcanal in late 1942 to early 1943 would have forced a longer war and attacks at other locations. A U.S. loss at Midway, however, may have precluded any U.S. offensive into the Pacific.</i><p>&gt; a.) they seem more representative of what most war is like<p>Yes, that&#x27;s true. I&#x27;d highly recommend <i>With The Old Breed</i>. It&#x27;s sort of the inverse of <i>100 Decisive Battles</i>: a single soldier put his pen to paper and recorded everything he remembered about the Okinawa conflict, from start to finish.<p>Amazon: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Old-Breed-At-Peleliu-Okinawa&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0891419195" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Old-Breed-At-Peleliu-Okinawa&#x2F;dp&#x2F;08914...</a><p>epub: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;the-eye.eu&#x2F;public&#x2F;Books&#x2F;Bibliotik&#x2F;W&#x2F;With%20the%20Old%20Breed.epub" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;the-eye.eu&#x2F;public&#x2F;Books&#x2F;Bibliotik&#x2F;W&#x2F;With%20the%20Old...</a><p>&gt; Similarly, it&#x27;d be interesting to read war histories that focus on logistics and technological development.<p>I agree! Does anyone know of something like this?')
