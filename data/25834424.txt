It&#x27;s a well standardised term of art: it means what the OSI define it to mean. It&#x27;s pretty precise, and is not a meaningless marketing term like <i>premium</i>. Similarly <i>free software</i> (and especially <i>Free Software</i>) means what the FSF defines it to mean.<p>When people start using these terms to mean whatever they feel like it should mean, it muddies the waters for those of us trying to have serious discussions about these topics. Tellingly, such redefinitions are generally broader than the accepted OSI definition, so as to include whatever product someone is trying to push.')
