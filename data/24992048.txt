I&#x27;m eternally creeped out by how many cameras are now in residential neighborhoods in urban and suburban areas.<p>In the city, there&#x27;s a dozen cameras on every corner. This was a problem a decade ago, but once you left the densely populated areas for the suburbs and rural areas, cameras were few and far between.<p>Now in the suburbs, there&#x27;s cameras at the intersections and in parks, and everyone is wiring up their homes with neighborhood surveillance cameras that let law enforcement know if the cameras capture any potential evidence that the government can subpeona or copy via a warrant without ever having to let the cameras&#x27; owners know.')
