Documentary was edited beautifully and well done.  It delivered the emotions it was edited for perfectly is all I&#x27;m saying.  Hats off to the director.<p>However, having said that and we all know AI will have bugs and will very well take paths we couldn&#x27;t have imagined.  It isn&#x27;t so comforting to think companies like Palantir making wrong profiles of you and autonomous driving running over people will all be possible.  But may be we can delete racism, discrimination, prejudice?  yeah.. probably not until humans are left out of the algo and let it self code itself up.<p>I&#x27;m just saying, the future will be interesting when emotions are put aside and people, places and things profiled in a manner totally unconventional today.<p>It&#x27;s rather ironic that almost all of man&#x27;s greatest discoveries were made accidently like vulcanization of rubber or post-it or even antibiotics.<p>Wondering what kind of future humanity will have where everything is done deliberately and unconditionally.   No emotions, accidents or serenity at play.<p>Coincidently, my greatest finds in life were almost all accidently including the love of my life and my fav food.  I would have never met her nor find my fav food if it wasn&#x27;t for certain unforeseen accidents.<p>PS&gt; It isn&#x27;t possible like chess to precalculate Go strategies.  The documentary proved that and the game itself dictates that.')
