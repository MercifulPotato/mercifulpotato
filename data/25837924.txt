Or, walk back in after 15 minutes, tell the pharmacist you are OK, and then leave.<p>There is a reason vaccine sites don&#x27;t do this. When someone has an allergic reaction the response needs to be quick.<p>The local health department runs pop-up vaccination clinics in concert with the local research hospital. They considered issues like this during planning and they choose not do it.<p>When someone sitting in the car starts to have an allergic reaction how does a response get there quickly.<p>Best case the patient is on the phone with a monitor in the clinic. That monitor has to notice there is a problem and inform a responder that there is a problem.<p>Right away you have a problem. An in person monitor can monitor more people than someone juggling phones. The clinic needs more people. Also, seeing someone get flushed or slump over is easier than noticing, hey NNN stopped responding. The monitors can respond quicker.<p>Once a monitor informs a responder they have to find the right vehicle in the parking lot, the patient may be slumped over. There&#x27;s other people sitting in their car. Hell, 25% pf vehicles are white these day. Finding the right car takes a while.<p>Then they have to get into the car which might be locked or parked in. Only then can they provide care.<p>What the clinics do instead is keep traffic to a level where they can have people wait safely. Both in terms of waiting space, patient spacing, and availability of monitors. They know how many doses they&#x27;re getting over time so this isn&#x27;t hard to plan.<p>When vaccination throughput needs to go up they open a parallel pop-up that can also keep people safe.')
