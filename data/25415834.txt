Everyone who wants can bring a DECT or GSM phone and register a 4-digit extension, and each congress, several thousand people do. The whole venue, as well, as some nearby hotels, are littered with DECT and GSM base stations. There&#x27;s also bidirectional interconnectivity to the regular phone network. It&#x27;s always one of my favorite parts of Congress, but it has kind of ruined me since I have trouble taking tech conferences without their own phone network seriously. :)<p>(Cave-at: I&#x27;m not involved with the technical implementation. I just know the system as a user.)')
