Bush who (with massive public support) charged in to the Middle East, glassed one or two countries, set the US up for 20 years so far of ruinously expensive wars. He served two full terms. I might have seen an article sometime recently that he had taken up painting and is pretty good at it.<p>What level of accountability am I expecting him to be held to for that? I think those may have been some of the worst political actions taken in my lifetime. When you say &quot;less accountable&quot; - what do you think shows a democratic government being held accountable? I like democracy, but I don&#x27;t think the government is accountable.<p>Corporations are actually held accountable. If they screw up, the owners can lose out massively. Executives too through incentive programs.')
