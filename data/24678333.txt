Somebody would join my Zoom at ~8:30am and it keeps going until about ~5:30pm everyday. People are free to come and go as they wish, people from other teams join, when people come looking for us they come into the Zoom call etc. This includes other people from other teams from different countries. If things do get private&#x2F;technical&#x2F;disturbing we just go into breakout rooms. When I finally get online at 9am or so there are usually four or five people already in there.<p>So to answer the questions: I don&#x27;t miss them because I didn&#x27;t lose them, and it has worked great -- our team is the highest performing one with the least amount of cabin fever. The reason why it&#x27;s successful is because it isn&#x27;t management-driven &quot;mandatory talk time.&quot; It&#x27;s just a bunch of people hanging out.')
