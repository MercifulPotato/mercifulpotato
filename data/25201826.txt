Wonderful perfect quadraphonic sound with distortion levels\nso low as to make a brave man weep.<p>‘This is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council,’ the voice continued. ‘As you will no doubt be aware, the\nplans for development of the outlying regions of the Galaxy require the building of a hyperspatial express route through your star system, and\nregrettably your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition.
