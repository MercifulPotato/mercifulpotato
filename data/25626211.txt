Itâ€™s about being able to incrementally build something while having it running and updated as you go.<p>I also tend to often just reload changed namespaces and resetting the (component&#x2F;mount&#x2F;integrant based) application too. Or letting shadow-cljs live reload my clojurescript. But having the REPL directly accessible is still super useful.')
