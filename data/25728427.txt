Item(by='cesarb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610370816, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25727086, text='USB-A requires some force to be plugged, and most users are &quot;gentle&quot; when plugging (not using too much force). So what happens is, the user tries it first in the correct orientation, but it doesn&#x27;t enter (because the user was too gentle). The user flips to the wrong orientation, and uses a bit more force (but it won&#x27;t enter because it&#x27;s upside down). The user then flips back to the first orientation, and uses even more force; this time, the force is enough, and the plug enters the socket.')
