It always sits in my pocket and I have a knife for cutting boxes, a phillips head for that random drawer knob that’s loose, a decent pair of scissors for a loose thread unraveling my shirt, and a dedicated tool designed for easily opening those annoying plastic bubble packs. Oh, and a great pair of pliers, of course. It’s not a big purchase, but it’s $50 that I continually find myself glad that I spent.')
