Before that seminar I wasn&#x27;t aware that my choice of color scheme meant that some people couldn&#x27;t interpret my plots. Now that I know, it&#x27;s really easy to just google a colorblind friendly color palette and use that instead. I wish I had known earlier, and I hope that by people talking about it and hosting seminars like the one I attended it becomes a more standard practice.')
