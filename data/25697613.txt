(Perhaps better called &quot;page scaling&quot;; it&#x27;s what desktop browsers do when you press control-plus&#x2F;control-minus.)<p>My choice is either to increase the browser&#x27;s text scaling and deal with tiny UI elements (e.g., upvote&#x2F;downvote buttons on HN), or pinch-zoom and pan around. Both are awful.<p>All the machinery for full-page zoom (&quot;page scaling&quot;) is already in the browser! Just let me use it!')
