Wow they were annoying. Really nice for impressing your friends, or heating up your listening room, or making your electric meter spin, if you are into that. I was not impressed. I felt a modified Dynaco ST70 was way more listenable. The output transformers were really not rated for full bandwidth at full power. Circuit was not very nicely done. I would give it a solid &quot;meh&quot; on my audio scale. You can do a lot better for a lot less.')
