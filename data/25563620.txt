They do not have executive function in the same sense as an Executive Director. The latter carries out the strategic plans decided by their Board, and serves as the day-to-day executive function. The Haskell Foundation&#x27;s Board responsibilities are clearly delineated on the site, and is the more accessible position of the two. It is also unpaid, and not a function (necessarily) of tech experience, unlike the Executive Director, who must necessarily have at least some experience with project delivery and Haskell&#x27;s ecosystem + community in order to function.')
