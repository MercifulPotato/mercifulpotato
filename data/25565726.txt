Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609206406, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25558292, text='&gt; What does raytracing have to do with the popularity of custom engines?<p>Raytracing is being used as a synecdoche for technological advances in rendering. The point is that as off-the-shelf rendering improves, the advantages of a vertically integrated engine diminish.<p>&gt; Off topic, but this is not a good analogy. The &quot;cloud&quot; is just a network of mainframes, which means mainframes are arguably the dominant form of computing (and will become more dominant as thin clients, like Stadia, rise in popularity).<p>&gt; Mainframes were not necessarily purpose-built, unique machines. They were instead defined by their sharing model, which is where the term &quot;personal computing&quot; comes from -- as a contrast to the mainframe&#x2F;server model.<p>That&#x27;s a very essentialist perspective; there are a lot of ways mainframe computing differs from typical personal computing and no single one of them is definitive. As a programmer, a mainframe offered you a reliable computing environment, because they&#x27;re built to be highly available from the hardware up. That&#x27;s very much not the case with the cloud, which follows a worse-is-better approach where your jobs can be terminated whenever and you&#x27;re expected to handle it. While shared computing resources may be making a comeback, I don&#x27;t think that kind of ground-up high availability will, so while the cloud has some aspects in common with mainframes, it&#x27;s very much not the same thing.')
