Many times at a 4-way stop where all the cars arrive relatively simultaneously, if a car doesn&#x27;t have any blinkers on, I have to guess if they intend to go straight forward, or have forgotten to signal -- or they start signaling <i>after</i> they begin to accelerate for some reason. If I had to guess, I&#x27;d say that up to 1 of 10 cars may fall into one of these categories. People at busy 4-way stops (incl. myself) tend to want to increase flow by a self-organized optimization of allowing more than one car in the intersection at a time if they don&#x27;t interfere w&#x2F;each other- such as two cars across from each other going straight or turning to opposite roads.<p>I think that&#x27;s one of the unappreciated features of self-driving cars, is that they will always signal their intent, whether to other human drivers and cars via lights, or directly via data.')
