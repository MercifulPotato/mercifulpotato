The SEC has given the definitive guidance on the topic, which is based on the Howey case:<p>&gt; The U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s Howey case and subsequent case law have found that an &quot;investment contract&quot; exists when there is the investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.[5]  The so-called &quot;Howey test&quot; applies to any contract, scheme, or transaction, regardless of whether it has any of the characteristics of typical securities.[6]  The focus of the Howey analysis is not only on the form and terms of the instrument itself (in this case, the digital asset) but also on the circumstances surrounding the digital asset and the manner in which it is offered, sold, or resold (which includes secondary market sales).  Therefore, issuers and other persons and entities engaged in the marketing, offer, sale, resale, or distribution of any digital asset will need to analyze the relevant transactions to determine if the federal securities laws apply.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sec.gov&#x2F;corpfin&#x2F;framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sec.gov&#x2F;corpfin&#x2F;framework-investment-contract-an...</a><p>Ripple (as distinct from the XRP token it created), currently holds a large block of uncirculated XRP created at the beginning of the network. This network does away with mining in favor of the Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ripple.com&#x2F;files&#x2F;ripple_consensus_whitepaper.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ripple.com&#x2F;files&#x2F;ripple_consensus_whitepaper.pdf</a><p>This protocol foregoes mining in favor of a system without proof-of-work. The tradeoff (or feature, depending on how you look at it) was that the distribution mechanism would involve Ripple itself giving away and selling XRP. This gave Ripple complete control of the money stock at the network&#x27;s inception.<p>This is very different from how Bitcoin currency distribution works.')
