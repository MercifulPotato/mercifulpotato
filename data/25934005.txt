Building it takes time and money (people, materials, whatever). You&#x27;re going to have to explain your idea to your investors in order to raise capital. During that process, you need to be protected from them taking your idea and starting a separate business behind your back.<p>Lots of patents really are just ideas for things which <i>might</i> work rather than things known&#x2F;proven to work. Possibly these should be differentiated somehow, and maybe have a shorter time horizon on expiry if they&#x27;re not &quot;upgraded&quot; from an idea patent to a working-device patent. But that&#x27;s a legit reason for idea patents to exist, and that&#x27;s the present reality.')
