Maybe one with a cab on it to stop the weather, but 8-10ft would be enough. I could send it to get my groceries, have it follow me places if I need to take something with me, and send it to my family if they need to give me something.<p>Rental truck beds would be even better. I could order one, have it go pick up my curbside order from Home Depot and the Grocery Store, and then drop it off at my house. Then I could send it back to the rental facility. Likewise, companies could buy them to deliver for the last mile.<p>Is anyone working on this?')
