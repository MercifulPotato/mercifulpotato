Any kind of credibility system can be hacked. You should ask two images, mandatory, and one of them should be &#x27;my product&#x27;, like a some kind of an actual clue, that the reviewer purchased it at least.

This kind of a site stops the incentive of forging fake review, like who wants to forge a bad one, but this still has to be protected from defamation attempts.

The credibility system could work only over protection')
