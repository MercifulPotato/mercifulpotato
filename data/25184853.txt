If it&#x27;s not actionable, then it&#x27;s just adding to the doom. But not all of it is not actionable. And you definitely can&#x27;t take actions based on information you don&#x27;t have. Even just telling your friends about it is arguably action, because while it&#x27;s not actionable to you, maybe it is to them, or maybe it&#x27;s something you can take action on as a group.<p>Obviously finding a balance is essential, so you can be well informed and reactive, but also not drown in doom. I&#x27;ll admit: it&#x27;s a balance I haven&#x27;t found, but I firmly believe living in a metaphorical hole isn&#x27;t going to make anything better.')
