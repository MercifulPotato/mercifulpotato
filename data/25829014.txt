It was one of those things I expected to do much sooner, but didn&#x27;t end up getting as many requests for hosts as I expected (at least compared to other features). That&#x27;s changing a bit now now that Divjoy gives you something a bit more advanced. That attracts customers with more complex needs and, it would seem, more opinions around hosting. Firebase Hosting and Heroku are up next. Probably AWS after that.<p>Previewing code: Happy to send over an example codebase if you shoot an email to hello@divjoy.com :) I&#x27;m going to be rolling out a code preview so customers can explore what their code will look like when exported. Plan is to let non-customers browse at least some it it.. or maybe just view half of each file.. or maybe I&#x27;m overthinking it and I should just let everyone see the code and emphasize they aren&#x27;t legally licensed to use it. Anyway, definitely something I&#x27;ve been thinking about.')
