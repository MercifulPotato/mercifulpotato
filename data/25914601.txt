When even an exposure like Snowden&#x27;s is basically meaningless there seem to be no other way. Just blowing the whistle doesn&#x27;t do much if anything. I&#x27;ve just seen in mainstream media (Netflix documentary Spycraft) that Snowden &quot;gave 1 million documents to China and Russia&quot;. When media like Netflix tells viewers such propaganda unopposed it is clear that Snowden might as well have kept his job. Sadly I have neither the money nor brains to make a difference myself outside voting so fingers crossed some that do, will.')
