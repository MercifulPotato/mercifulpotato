It isn&#x27;t unfair to the startup that big companies pay more, it&#x27;s unfair to the startup employees that the startup isn&#x27;t paying more. I&#x27;d argue that if a startup can&#x27;t pay market rate for the employees it wants (be it cash or equity) then it wasn&#x27;t properly funded in the first place.')
