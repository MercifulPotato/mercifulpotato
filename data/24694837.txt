But if I may give one critique. Please add a way for users to reach the footer, it becomes silly to reach it when you have endless scroll. Either put the links in footer somewhere else and remove the need of the footer or stop the auto load after sometime and give a button for user to load more. so that they can find the footer and know more about your website.')
