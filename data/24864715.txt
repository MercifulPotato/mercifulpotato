There are cameras and microphones in your home, build  into hardware devices you neither understand nor control, which are permanently connected to their corporate control servers. While you watch TV the TV watches you, while you shop in an online store, the store takes note what products you look at, and when you call your mom, your call is automatically transcribed and scanned for vile evilness by agencies that will defend the secrecy of their methods with violence against the general population.<p>Your argument about public spaces works just as well for private spaces. If this trend continues there will be no reasonable expectations of privacy at all.')
