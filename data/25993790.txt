I suspect most users don&#x27;t notice but e.g. Quicktime on supported formats adjusts colors according to monitor color profile and video color profile and it&#x27;s visible for trained eyes. I can adjust manually my VLC too in colors but it&#x27;s not exact science and just by comparing and personal feeling. I wished I could optimise videos as good as my TV is doing it in VLC (but this is also beyond colors).<p>Thanks VLC!')
