Item(by='musicale', descendants=None, kids=[25066093], score=None, time=1605150980, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25065976, text='Yeah, the Mac Pro supports up to 1.5TB of DRAM (vs. 16GB), it&#x27;s got a bunch of slots and discrete GPUs, and it can run Windows and Windows VMs. I hope it doesn&#x27;t end up as an orphan system like the 2013 &quot;trash can&quot; Mac Pro, which was an interesting system that got zero upgrades. Perhaps Apple will offer Apple Silicon upgrades to Mac Pro buyers.<p>Assuming they can build it (and they have implied that they can scale their silicon designs up in terms of cores, power, and clock rate), an Apple Silicon Mac Pro will be a pretty interesting machine.<p>If they wanted to, Apple could even bring back an Apple Silicon powered Xserve, or the legendary, mythical, modular desktop Mac (I know, now we&#x27;re in the realm of pure fantasy, but one can dream.)')
