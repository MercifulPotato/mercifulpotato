I expect them to post the video soon. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codesync.global&#x2F;speaker&#x2F;ron-pressler&#x2F;#745why-user-mode-threads-are-often-the-correct-answer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codesync.global&#x2F;speaker&#x2F;ron-pressler&#x2F;#745why-user-mo...</a><p>&gt; Also, this statement makes you sound like Goliath.<p>Maybe, but it&#x27;s not just a matter of size but also trajectory. And, as you say, our competition is <i>mostly</i> off the Java platform. My point wasn&#x27;t to brag, but to put matters in perspective. There are dozens of nascent languages, the vast majority of which will <i>never</i> make it to the top ten, let alone the top five. And while a few of them will, no doubt, one day unseat the incumbents, we obviously don&#x27;t think of all of them as &quot;threats.&quot;<p>&gt; what are those languages?<p>The obvious ones. It&#x27;s not that we don&#x27;t know that some smaller languages will one day become big, some will even surprise us all, but extrapolating early growth to long-term success is certainly not a good model.<p>&gt; Like, what are the odds that it took until 201x for you (all) to decide to copy records from ML? You certainly didn&#x27;t do it before Kotlin for some reason.<p>As I wrote in another comment, Kotlin&#x27;s arrival and Java&#x27;s &quot;boost&quot; are both a response to the same event: Java&#x27;s decline in Sun&#x27;s dying days. Once Oracle increased investment, it was mostly a matter of prioritising which features to do first. Records were seen as less urgent as lambdas, so they came later.')
