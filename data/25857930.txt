Turns out it was illegal as per their TOS so my professor had me quit that project and take it offline.<p>The biggest problem I had encountered back then is that there was a packet transmitted with a certain signature in order to turn on the cameras that I could not reverse for the life of me (had something to do with the app version).<p>Other than that: basically two IR cameras that stream in an interleaved pixel format (2 x 640) x 480 iirc. It was a fun device to use and hack, but the first time I had ran into the brick-wall that is an enclosed format.')
