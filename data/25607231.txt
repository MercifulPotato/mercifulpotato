Item(by='gjvc', descendants=None, kids=[25609113, 25609037], score=None, time=1609535684, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25606370, text='This is really bad news.  I have seen multiple sellers with this unnecessary condescending attitude as you mention.  Even when their city is under social-distancing restrictions, they are insisting on pick-up in person and coming into their house to &quot;sign off&quot; that the goods are working.<p>Someone needs to take these lemonade-stand sellers down a notch or four.   Were ebay to extend the feedback mechanism to pre-bidding &#x2F; pre-purchase queries, the participants would be forced to clean up their act.  It seems that ebay is not incentivized (enough) to do this, and so the situation persists.')
