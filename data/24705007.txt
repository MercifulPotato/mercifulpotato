Had no idea.  It&#x27;s interesting in that these numbers differ from the conversations I&#x27;ve had with academics who tell a different story.   But I had those conversations decades ago, so perhaps the inflation of higher education has had an impact here.<p>The number you cite is inflated because in includes both US and international students.  Is the revenue from international students broken out anywhere?<p>But that doesn&#x27;t change my point.  If the number is &gt;0, it&#x27;s a problem.  The US tax payer should not pay for foreign workers to take US jobs.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not opposed to international students.  I&#x27;m just saying that when it comes to impacted majors like computer science, where not everyone who wants to study it can do to capacity constraints, the US government should incentive universities to offer the opportunities first to citizens and then to international students.  Right now, for some universities, those slots are reserved for international students.')
