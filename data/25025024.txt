So there were &quot;angel&quot; makers, woman who aborted without a doctors license. It was dangerous- it was shunned, and it was absolutely necessary, because the normal sex-drive, with no money available for contraceptives - this was the only way out of &quot;constant&quot; reproduction, work-overload and deeper poverty.<p>If caught in the act of aborting, the very same woman, often with several children already, in fear of getting shunned and ostracized, would throw the &quot;witch&quot; doctor to the wulfes.\nAnd this is what this sounds like.<p>Requesting a black-market Vasectomy and then denying it when the light of public opinion falls on it. Such things happen in totalitarian states, like china, but not in democracy with independent courts like the us.')
