They probably won&#x27;t.</i><p>And yet that is what copyright law generally requires. &quot;Convenience&quot; isn&#x27;t a valid justification for fair use.<p><i>My use of youtube-dl is legit as far as the copyright claims of video creators go. I&#x27;m not reusing or redistributing their content without permission. </i><p>No, actually you mentioned a number of infringing uses that wouldn&#x27;t be protected as fair use except for the training bits.<p>But the issue for youtube-dl is different: as a tool, the question is whether it is designed to infringe copyright, and the answer thus far appears to be that it is, especially given that they explicitly design for and test this ability.<p>What it may come down to (if this gets to court) may be the percentage of the user base that uses it for legitimate purposes and the percentage that doesn&#x27;t. If they can&#x27;t show that a substantial portion of the userbase uses it for downloading stuff other than RIAA licensed videos, youtubedl is DOA.')
