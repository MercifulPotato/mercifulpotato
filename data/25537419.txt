I&#x27;ll posit that most folks know how bad the name squatting business is around the internet and nobody really thinks hard about somethingreallyobscure.com so long as it&#x27;s not confrontational in some way (religion, politics, swearing, etc.). But I will say &quot;anything ending in .com has more implicit trust&quot; - I&#x27;m always mentally questioning if any link from one of the new gTLDs is just a spammer&#x2F;ne&#x27;er do well.<p>Been here, done what you&#x27;re doing, there&#x27;s a .com out there with a fun and interesting name which somehow resonates with your personality. Think long term - avoid trademark&#x2F;copyright branded words in the name, avoid being too narrow in case your hobby changes, easy to type and spend some time <i>really</i> thinking about plurality - I&#x27;ve discarded a lot of ideas simply because it would lead to other people going &quot;was that with or without an (s) on the end?&quot; - same with double-letters in the middle, just avoid them.
