I don&#x27;t find it to be great, but it is sufficient.<p>Since I am the OP, I&#x27;ll note that while I don&#x27;t like to print a lot of papers, I do inevitably print important ones. I fully agree on the Brother laser printer (only kind I have used, so not knocking other brands). Even printing in draft mode (saving on ink) is generally more readable than inkjet printing, in my experience.<p>I&#x27;ll probably end up getting another iPad, but it has been interesting to see what other people use.')
