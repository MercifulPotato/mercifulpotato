Usually its handled by a DSP (VLIW architecture), but I&#x27;d imagine that the GPU architecture has more FLOPs. DSPs probably have less latency, but something like SDR is not very latency sensitive (or more like: the community models latency as a phase-shift and is therefore resilient to many forms of latency)<p>Note: I&#x27;m not actually in any of these communities. I&#x27;m just curious and someone else told me about this very same question.')
