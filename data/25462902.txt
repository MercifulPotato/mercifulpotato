I&#x27;m a big fan of these types of &quot;perpetual motion&quot; computers.<p>The project reminds me of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.google.com&#x2F;gdata&#x2F;articles&#x2F;radish" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developers.google.com&#x2F;gdata&#x2F;articles&#x2F;radish</a> which was a solar cell + LCD system that showed who had booked a conference room. It had to use LCD because e-paper wasn&#x27;t feasible in 2008, but someone could do something similar now with e-paper.<p>&gt; Iâ€™d like to find a vendor who could help me design a one-piece panel that would go all around the frame, which should decrease complexity and increase efficiency. It would also be nice if the panel was black, so as to nicely tie together the white of the mat and the grayscale of the image.<p>If you opted for a black border, could you put a slightly tinted piece of glass on top of the solar cells to make them look like a generic piece of glass instead of solar cells? You would lose incoming light, but the aesthetic improvements might be worth it.')
