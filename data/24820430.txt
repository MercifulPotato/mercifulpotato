What if monopolies split <i>themselves</i>? Wouldn&#x27;t that be great? Does the same company really have to make the phone <i>and</i> the charger? No, but there are 2 reasons apple does:<p>1. Collaboration between the phone department and the charger department is slightly easier.<p>2. They can abuse their monopoly on iphone chargers to force you to pay more for them.<p>Apple makes about 30 billion on iphones per quarter. Assuming all iphones were $600 (which they arent) and everyone uses 2 chargers per iphone (because the first one broke) priced at $20, apple would be making $2 billion from chargers.<p>Say, if they didn&#x27;t abuse their monopoly position for chargers they would make only $1.8 billion from them.<p>This is $2.0 billion - $1.8 billion = $0.2 billion less revenue.<p>Now if you just tax apple progressively such that taxes for 32 billion in revenue are more than $0.2 billion higher than paying taxes for 30 billion in revenue, apple will split into iphoneapple and chargerapple by themselves!<p>Now in practice you might not want to tax revenue but for example the value of the company or something else.<p>Also you don&#x27;t want the &#x27;split&#x27; companies to still behave like they are one company, this means that you want the split-off company to have different shareholders from the main company, because otherwise they would just behave in mutual interest.<p>More in line with the topic, netflix might decide to split into a &#x27;movie suggestions algorithm&#x27; service and a &#x27;movie streaming&#x27; company.<p>Google would split into a gazillions of different companies.<p>But some interoperable internet legislature might be a little more realistic :)')
