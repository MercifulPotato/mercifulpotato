As for reddit, they kept T_D along, but subs like that regularly leak out and brigade other subs, which is why they were banned. Not for the information they share. Also, many of the comment sections devolved into doxxing and treats, which is also against global rules. Reddit generally doesn&#x27;t give a shit about how true or false the opinions are in a sub as long as they don&#x27;t break global rules and leak to other subs.<p>So no, they were not banned for &quot;sweeping opinions you don&#x27;t agree with&quot; either.')
