Ark submarines full of embryos that are mass produced by a world that somehow puts aside their differences and comes together for the singular goal of saving life.<p>Restarting the carbon cycle would require a massive effort, but with planning and lots of hard work it might be possible.  The post apocalyptic world would be a strange place full of dead plants and animals that take a long time to start decaying because all of the microbiota that normally cause decay were also killed off.  It would be interesting to see how fast they would spread afterward.  It would give humanity a small buffer before they start releasing gigatons of CO2 into the atmosphere at least.  It really depends on how well the oceans survive.  If algae can come back reasonably quick the planet can be saved.')
