These are not recommended for winter camping.<p>Sad to say some manufacturers, and thus camping magazines and web sites, <i>do</i> recommend canister stoves for winter camping (<i>cough</i> looking at you, snow peak, though you are not alone).  I&#x27;m surprised they haven&#x27;t killed anyone -- perhaps they are used by people who stay close to their vehicles.  Those canisters are heavy and have to be packed out and discarded.<p>Liquid stoves have other tradeoffs but are much more reliable at all inhabitable altitudes.  They are good at temperatures I can deal with at least as I try never to travel overland below -10 F -- I know some do but I simply don&#x27;t believe I have the skills.<p>Another problem with the inexpensive canister stoves is, surprisingly, their tolerances.  We had a jetboil fail in the Australian desert -- some grit simply got where it shouldn&#x27;t.  Bit of a crisis.  A dragonfly or something like that is more tolerant of expanding, contracting, getting unfortunate bits in it (and being cleanable).')
