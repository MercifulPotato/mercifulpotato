I think adoption would be far better if there was just a single, open source, global, decentralized Matrix network.  Users don&#x27;t want to have to run their own servers and have to figure out which network of servers to join.  If a user downloads a client app to their phone they expect to be able to then connect to THE network.<p>As long as the code is open source, then there is always an out to create a new network, but why do that before it is actually necessary?  (Basically federation is just a form of premature optimization)  Communication networks should be like git repos.  We should all be working in the same repo, but if sh*t hits the fan, then fork it and carry on with business.')
