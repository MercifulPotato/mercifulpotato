P&amp;G, Unilever, Cocacola, etc have never, not once in history, had a gung-ho C level exec who said &quot;Screw it, I&#x27;m going to find out if our advertising works&quot;. And then either found it works and kept spending, or found out it doesn&#x27;t work and saved literally billions of dollars.<p>There is so much money at stake that could be either saved or generated, its simply not possible that no one has looked at it. I used to help Pepsi&#x2F;Fritolay set up tracking to tie advertising on youtube to in-store sales. They spent millions of dollars to measure their ads, Google had a clean-room data center specifically for pepsi&#x2F;frito. The idea that no one actually checked if this system works is simply not possible.')
