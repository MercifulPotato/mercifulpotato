I have a Node.js server which generates HTML and opens a browser on Windows which then asks the server for that html at 127.0.0.1.<p>So browser will be my GUI and Node.js packaged with vercel&#x2F;pkg my back-end. It is more flexible than say Electron because GUI can be anything I want it to be.<p>My concern is only will users accept a local server running on their desktop. I&#x27;ve tried to configure the executable so that the server accepts connections only from the same host as where the http-requests are coming from.<p>I assume the same situation would exist with Denon, if you build a product with it and want to use the browser as your front-end. Are users OK with a server running on their PC?')
