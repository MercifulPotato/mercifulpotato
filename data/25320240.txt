In common lisp one could easily use a macro or reader macro but in R a change in the parser is needed so “\\” can be used instead of “function”.<p>Note that the existing “f &lt;- function(...) ...” syntax is not being removed. But I write a lot of code like<p><pre><code>    state.range &lt;- apply(state.x77, 2, function(x) c(min(x), median(x), max(x)))\n</code></pre>\nand it will be an improvement to be able to condense it a bit to<p><pre><code>    state.range &lt;- apply(state.x77, 2, \\(x) c(min(x), median(x), max(x)))</code></pre>')
