Item(by='wassenaar10', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612194905, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25988129, text='To be honest, this sounds like &quot;stoned-ape theory&quot; tier speculation without evidence, so it&#x27;s good that it&#x27;s being downvoted. This sort of thing is honestly super annoying. You like to use mushrooms recreationally? Great, do what you want. But when people who are excited about psychedelics start doing this thing that you&#x27;re doing above, namely trying to say that ancient use of psychedelics was the reason for all manner of cultural practices, it&#x27;s very annoying, anti-intellectual, it it has honestly soured my opinion of psychedelic-users. For example, it&#x27;s really hard to take you comment seriously when it contains things like:<p>&gt; Various accounts describe the shaman and the rituals performed in ways that are fascinatingly similar to the narrative of Santa. An all-knowing man who defies space and time? Flying reindeer? Reindeer-drawn sleds? Climbing down the chimney? The giving of gifts? The tales of the Sami shamans have it all.<p>&gt; This partially explains the practice of the Christmas tree, and the placement of bright red-and-white presents underneath, which look like Amanita mushrooms, he wrote.<p>Yeah, except these aspects of Christmas described here are largely American traditions with <i>well documented</i> origins. So even if some (tenuous) parallels between Sami folk religions and modern American Christmas exist, how exactly is it being postulated that those Sami traditions made their way into the US? Scandinavian immigration to the US was quite small in comparison to German, Italian, Irish, etc., and they were rarely ethnically Sami. Meanwhile, as I&#x27;ve said, US Christmas traditions like Santa, Christmas trees, gift giving, the Christmas color scheme and so on have pretty well-identified origins, which are largely from British and Central European traditions, with a modern, more secular, reinterpretation coming about in the 19th and 20th century.<p>Look, I used psychedelics in my younger days. They have many effects, but the strongest one I would say is that they <i>make you think things are far more profound than they really are</i>. I don&#x27;t doubt that they have potential for treating depression or addiction (recent research on this seems promising), but it seems that far too often, psychedelic-enthusiasts fall into the trap of &quot;psychedelics are so cool, I must find a way to tie each and every thing to them.&quot;')
