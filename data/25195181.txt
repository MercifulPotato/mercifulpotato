Lefties aren&#x27;t perfected beings, eh?<p>One thing a lot of people seem to gloss over is that up until ~25 years ago SF was the <i>weird</i> city.  It was like a refuge for all the freaks and weirdos (or if you were just gay and sick of taking shit for it) to come and hang out.<p>So all the &quot;shiny happy people&quot; with their nice jobs and no drug problems or social maladjustments come here and fuck it up for us.<p>It&#x27;s like, you could go anywhere, why do you have to take my home and make it just like everywhere else?<p>(But as others on this thread have pointed out: THAT&#x27;S CALIFORNIA BABY!
