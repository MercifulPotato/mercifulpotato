They are their own convulted thing, a thought.<p>Talking and writing about them helps me to &quot;linearize&quot; them and to find the holes.<p>Especially technical writing helps to get things in check. Did I miss some steps? Can I reproduce my conclusion from my text alone, without any extra input?<p>Write something, try to explain things, it can help you to understand better; even if you think you already know them well.<p>You don&#x27;t even need to publish your stuff, though others people input can help greatly too, even if the just ask questions because they don&#x27;t know the topic as well as you.')
