I do admire how experimental Apple was with their hardware back in those days, though: built in TV tuners, NUBUS, audio interfaces, not to mention the very progressive laptop designs (Duo, 2400c) and Newton!<p>Part of me really misses how fun an inventive hardware was between the 90s and mid-2000s. Things feel very stale these days and maybe M1 is the push that this industry needs to get innovating on new platforms again?<p>edit: if Dell or Lenovo would do an ARM variant of the XPS13 or X1C that was capable of running Linux, I&#x27;d buy the hell out of it.')
