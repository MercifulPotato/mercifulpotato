But then the chart shows that in fact large swaths of it were PPP loans, unemployment benefits and stimulus payments. All in a year where apparently (PPP excepted) total pay for employees almost didn’t go down at all.<p>What this all suggests to me is that to pay for this we should have taxed high earners and not used debt. I say this because I fear inflating markets (stocks, housing, whatever) will actually wind up harming the middle class if&#x2F;when the bubble bursts. Better just not to have the bubble in the first place, by taxing the money away on the front end.')
