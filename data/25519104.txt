I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re gonna get 100 people to pay $100 million for an earlier spot in the line. Or 1000 people to pay $10 million. Particularly because people with that amount of money to throw around (if you can pay $10 million for one vaccine, you are very very wealthy) know that they can most likely pull strings to get ahead in the line anyway. So at most, they are probably paying to jump ahead by just two or three months from where they will be anyway. (If you are young, healthy and rich, you probably don&#x27;t care enough to pay these prices. If you are old and rich, you probably are gonna be not-too-far-back in the line anyway).')
