We had Peter Lawrey consult at one of my employers, and I&#x27;ve worked on both C++ and Java HFT systems.<p>We used Chronicle as a high performance messaging system.  The secret sauce is just memory mapped files, single threaded processes, and using Java objects as flyweights that just write to the end of the file, or are read from the end of the file. No GC. When taking market data off the wire, or sending messages around a system, that <i>is</i> competitive with C++ and certainly has a fast time to market, and lower defect rate.<p>The other thing people are conflating is high frequency part:  get the market data and... do a complex calculation as fast as possible, and place or pull an order.  Placing or pulling orders can be further optimized too.<p>The fast complex calculation part is where Java isn&#x27;t as competitive and you run into the GC unless you use object pooling, warming up the JVM and so on.  We had a 50-50 system of Java for the bulk of the system, and C++ for the complex algorithms where we mark hot paths and check the assembly on godbolt (thank you Matt Godbolt).')
