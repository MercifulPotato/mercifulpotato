They only ship things very fast, and they charge you what that costs. They are optimizing for fast and correct, not cheap.<p>If you&#x27;re concerned, you can call or e-mail them to ask for an estimate. It&#x27;s worth noting that free shipping is never free -- it&#x27;s either hidden in the item cost, or some corner is being cut.')
