But businesses may offset that liability with the VAT they paid acquiring goods or services that were used in their own revenue-generating activities (input VAT).<p>So, for example, ACME sells TNT for $10 and VAT is 10% or $1 (output VAT), so price to customer is $11 and ACME&#x27;s VAT liability is $1. Say ACME paid $0.25 VAT to its suppliers for the chemicals in the TNT and the paper casing (input VAT). ACME&#x27;s net tax liability is $0.75, and that is how much they would actually fork over to the government.<p>Note that if ACME&#x27;s customer is Bugs&#x27; Mining Shop, i.e., a business, they <i>still charge</i> VAT on the transaction.<p>In a sales tax system, ACME would not have paid sales tax to its suppliers at all, and it would not have charged Bugs&#x27; Mining Shop a sales tax. Thus, sales tax is generally more economically efficient than a VAT from a business perspective.')
