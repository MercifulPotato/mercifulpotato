I don&#x27;t know if imposter syndrome is so black and white. All I have is anecdata; I grew up upper middle class, went to some great schools, and held some really wonderful jobs (especially my current job, which is my dream!) - but each day I wonder if today is the day they realize just how little value I bring to the team. The frameworks I&#x27;ve built always need some kind of improvement and when my coworkers look at code, they just debug it in their minds almost instantly. Me? I need to manually step through the debugger with most of the bugs I work on. Management will discuss new features with our team and I&#x27;m still trying to figure out fixing the technical debt from the last feature. I&#x27;ve held this job for quite a while so I guess I&#x27;m doing something right but holy cow there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m in the same tier as my coworkers.<p>I dunno, I&#x27;m not saying that I disagree, all I&#x27;m really saying is I think there could be more that goes into imposter syndrome than class upbringing. It&#x27;s a dissonance of knowledge and belief: I know I bring value, but I sure don&#x27;t believe that I do.')
