Not being used for official reporting purposes.  In my opinion it&#x27;s kind of dishonest how you present that.<p>I&#x27;ll admit it made me lose interest in reading much further because I don&#x27;t trust you to have used the other 42 citations in good faith.<p>Anyway, that was just meant as constructive criticism.  Just something to keep in mind in your writing in the future.')
