Remember Apple&#x27;s deal with Intel where Intel would hold back their newest CPUs from the rest of the market so Apple could have their big reveal and &quot;Worlds fastest blahblahblah&quot; blurb to push their Mac refreshes? But apple never really upgraded their proc offerings, and you couldn&#x27;t upgrade your processor on the machine you bought, so after 6 months or whatever they would be lagging behind in performance vs what you could build or buy elsewhere.<p>Well I guess once AMD whooped Intel that was not longer going to be an option. Not only would Intel not be able to deliver their &quot;World&#x27;s fastest blah blah&quot; marketing claim, but Intel couldn&#x27;t afford to hold anything back from the general market. I guess their little deal with TSMC letting them clear the cobwebs off this strategy and continue it for a bit longer going forward..')
