One that I am now considering is small signs by the roadside. You see the political little signs in the USA now saying &#x27;Vote for XX&#x27; - similar to this.<p>One problem I see is that my product https:&#x2F;&#x2F;toonclip.com is an online animation editor and is not &#x27;a local product&#x27;, so not sure about the effectiveness of this method.<p>Anyone, experiment with this? Any feedback?')
