I&#x27;m too young to remember the crypto wars of the 90&#x27;s (I was a kid back then), but I&#x27;m well aware of them and bring them up fairly often when talking to peers about the background pushes against encryption that constantly happen. I also make a lot of personal effort to rid my life of resources owned by large corporations, but I often wonder if there is something more I could be doing to resist these things.')
