I think there were 4 charged with guns? None of them used them. The only person shot and killed was a Capitol Officer shooting blindly into a crowd, hitting a white unarmed woman, nearly hitting another Federal Officer. I wonder if he&#x27;ll face charges. I wonder if that woman will get memorials in her honor. Did you know she was an Air Force veteran?<p>There are videos of the people in the capitol taking selfies with capitol police and walking around peacefully. Weird coup.<p>&gt; Neo-nazis<p>I saw people who supported Tump. I didn&#x27;t see any neo nazis. There was one man with a communist tattoo, and some fucking QAnon idiot with a racoon on his head who should go to federal prison.<p>If you really think this was some kind of insurrection, I feel sorry for you. It was nothing of the sort. It was pittance compared to the burning down of a fucking police station by BLM rioters.<p>&quot;oh I&#x27;m so scared. The peasants in the village have made their way into the royal court and sat at our golden seats and found our candy desk!&quot;<p>Anyone who broke or stole anything will face federal charges and will go away (and should). But classifying that entire group the way you have is disingenuous. Especially compared to the rioting and looting that&#x27;s been endorsed and encourages as being good and righteous by the left wing media.<p>The media has told us setting things on fire by BLM is fine for months and now they&#x27;re acting like 1&#x2F;10th of that is the end of democracy.<p>&gt; “But it is not enough for me to stand before you tonight and condemn riots. It would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without, at the same time, condemning the contingent, intolerable conditions that exist in our society. These conditions are the things that cause individuals to feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent rebellions to get attention. And I must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard.” -Dr. Martin Luther King Jr')
