Item(by='souprock', descendants=None, kids=[25616103, 25613975], score=None, time=1609589322, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25610125, text='People are kept separate.<p>In first grade, I was in the &quot;green&quot; reading group, with just 4 or 5 out of about 30 kids. Nothing was ever said about abilities. I just assumed that the groups were random. I was the best in the green group by far, so it seemed that I was experiencing the other extreme of mental abilities. Late in the year, something inadvertently revealed to me that &quot;green&quot; was the best. To this day, I have no idea how bad the other groups could have been.<p>I remember being the best in AP Chemistry too. I set the 15-year record for the final exam score, permanently changing the grade scaling for the class by 3 points out of 100. (old scaling would have given me a 103 but that became a 100, and even years later all the grades would be lower by 3 points) That class was about 15 out of 350 students who started as freshmen. There were other students, about 50 out of the 350, who dropped out. I don&#x27;t have much of an idea of what their science classes might have been like.')
