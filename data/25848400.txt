Small companies with any expectation of growth should probably just use Rocky instead from the get go.<p>I have a single server in my home running CentOS 7. I gain nothing by using RHEL over Rocky in the future, except with RHEL I have to accept ToS, do some subscription checks, and run the risk that Red Hat cancels this programme down the road. I only see this of value for someone who actually runs real RHEL in prod, and needs to test&#x2F;validate hardware&#x2F;software. For anyone just wanting &#x27;free&#x27; RHEL, they should just use Rocky.')
