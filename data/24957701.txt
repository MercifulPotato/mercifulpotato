Excluding those, there&#x27;s only 10 commits from people outside the team, which frankly isn&#x27;t a big deal.<p>Anyways, it&#x27;s frustrating that the author is kinda acting a bit scummy for something that might not have been even a problem. If he was a bit patient and had just got permission from those people beforehand... (I don&#x27;t really think any of those 10 people would object to it since the commits aren&#x27;t that big, unless one of them is a free software movement purist perhaps) And people generally agree on Mozilla&#x27;s &quot;95% author coverage&quot; line so I think this controversy might have been a bit overblown.')
