But that alone isn&#x27;t sufficient to absolve them from responsibility or scrutiny while talking about a <i>paid product</i> for a holy grail medical problem like depression.<p>&gt; He also has every right, to share his story about his struggles with depression, and what did and did not work for him.<p>But that is not the <i>only thing</i> they are doing now, is it? They are linking their paid app to that story, and that puts it in the realm of false advertising. FTC and FDA regulates the real world, independent of our being full of love or fear, and if that app was big enough it would likely be in trouble.<p>&gt; so you keep living in your world of fear and cynicism. I&#x27;ll live in mine of love and courage.<p>I&#x27;d watch for confirmation bias.')
