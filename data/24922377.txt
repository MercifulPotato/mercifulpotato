I also actually tend to like that they&#x27;re centralized and apps aren&#x27;t able to just stomp all over the configured hotkeys.<p>Screencasting is still a pain point, but I actually appreciate the security model that makes it painful, and pipewire is functional enough that I can pretty easily share a screen on anything that can run in a browser (Zoom, Discord, Hangouts - Slack is still a pain).<p>I don&#x27;t have issues with XWayland being blurry - although I do have issues with Xwayland windows having the same scaling restrictions as X (If you move a window from a scaled screen to a non-scaled screen, it won&#x27;t re-adjust).  Fortunately, most of my daily apps are now Wayland native, including my editor, my terminal, and my browser (Chromium build with ozone enabled).<p>---<p>Now, all that said, if you&#x27;ve tried recently and it&#x27;s still not there, I absolutely get it.  But I think it&#x27;ll move faster than you expect.  4 years ago I certainly wouldn&#x27;t have believed you if you&#x27;d told me I&#x27;d like Wayland enough to bother writing out this whole comment chain :D')
