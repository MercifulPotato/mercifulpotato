I think you are interpreting them incorrectly, or disingenuously.<p>We have had 399,857 deaths over the average expectation, and 328k over the upper bound. Are you saying that every single one of those excess deaths are from COVID infections? How many of those are from deaths of despair, lack of preventative healthcare due to closures, abuse, murders, aggravation of Alzheimer&#x27;s etc.<p>The simple fact, that I would love to hear a reasonable refutation of, is that a majority of the people who have died from COVID would have died this year from another cause. However, those who have died from the impact of our response would NOT have died this year.<p>All in all, we reduced the number of life years due to our response. That is the problem.<p>Edit: Lets look at state data.<p>Florida has been widely criticized for their lax restrictions, while California has been widely celebrated for their lockdown. So which performed better?<p>Florida has 18,000 excess deaths and a population of 21.48 million.<p>California has had 37,000 excess deaths and a population of 39 millions.<p>So about the fucking same. Notice also that a lot of the excess deaths in California came throughout the Summer, where there wasn&#x27;t as big a spike as there is now.')
