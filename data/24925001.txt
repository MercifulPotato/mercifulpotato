But I think it&#x27;s not great when non-managing peers do it to each other either.<p>Unless there are really well established relationships and a good track record at work, there&#x27;s going to be some background thought, conscious or unconsciously adding a little stressor: &quot;I wonder how much they really mean it&quot; and &quot;I wonder if my boss thinks like this too&quot;.<p>A lot of people have imposter syndrome already.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to add a bit more.')
