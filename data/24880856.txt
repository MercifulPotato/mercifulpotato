And yeah, you basically can&#x27;t take a day off ever.<p>Anki is very powerful, but you also need to structure your learning&#x2F;routine around it somewhat, or maybe another way to look at it is that you need to make Anki work for you. I currently spend about 15-20 minutes a day on Anki, earlier on in my language learning it was over an hour a day.')
