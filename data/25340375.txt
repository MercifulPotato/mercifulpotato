Item(by='joecool1029', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607390611, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25338406, text='&gt;This is about providing internet to underserved communities on Earth.<p>Anytime lines like this get written, be suspect.<p>&gt;I don&#x27;t see anyone on here complaining about how Charter chooses to spend the profits from this deal, it&#x27;s certainly not going to go to settling Mars.<p>I complain all the time about the cable companies, but this is a thread about SpaceX. As irrelevant as that comment is, it&#x27;s even less relevant arguing that using funds to build a LEO&#x2F;VLEO satellite ISP (that will probably get divested at some point) will somehow help them get to Mars. Commercially there&#x27;s no point in going to Mars so it takes political willpower and nations to finance it on a scale that&#x27;s many orders of magnitude greater than anything done at the moment (more than even the JWST).')
