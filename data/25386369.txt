Yes, I can now access all sorts of news worldwide which would have been difficult or inaccessible in the print era. But the newspapers in smaller markets are either disappearing or have greatly reduced capacity. It&#x27;s much easier for me, in Kansas, to read about the current political struggles surrounding Brexit than it is about whatever my rural county is doing. There are rumors of corruption here. Certain decisions which are completely idiotic. But there&#x27;s no one investigating. No newspaper or television willing to cover it in any detail. It&#x27;s a black hole.<p>My situation isn&#x27;t unique. This is the reality across much of the US. Not just the rural areas. There are many cities where cutbacks mean the local press doesn&#x27;t cover the cops or the city council as much as they did in past decades.')
