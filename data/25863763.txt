They are really trying to keep their low wage workers on payroll, despite having revenues cut in half because of COVID. Everyone is shopping at Amazon+WholeFoods. If those workers lose their jobs, will they be homeless? I don&#x27;t think consumers care or think about them, even though they might be their neighbors.')
