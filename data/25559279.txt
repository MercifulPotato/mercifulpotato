Games like Spelunky are played by people for much longer than the average indie game precisely because the process of learning the meta-game takes time but is still engaging.<p>If you want to calculate how much &quot;AI generation&quot; or &quot;procgen&quot; is freeing up resources you also want to look at how long people are playing these games for and how many resources were used in making them. If indie teams of 2 or 3 can collectively make the world play their games for longer than it plays games made by much bigger teams, then that&#x27;s a definite freeing up of resources. And this is what&#x27;s happening today to some extent.')
