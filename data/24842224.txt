If it didn&#x27;t lead to overall more watch time (as a proxy for user happiness with the service) they wouldn&#x27;t have launched.<p>They&#x27;ll have diced the metrics by user device (to see if specific devices perform poorly at those frame rates), ISP (to look for incompatibilities with ISP QoS settings targeted at youtube), country, and a bunch of other metrics.   They wouldn&#x27;t have launched until the vast majority of users saw a better overall experience, and all regressions were at least understood.<p>You&#x27;re right that some changes within Google aren&#x27;t properly AB tested, or are pushed out at the direction of management whatever the metrics say, but this one I guarantee was.<p>From all of the above, I can conclude that the majority of users in your position probably prefer 720p60 over 1080p30.')
