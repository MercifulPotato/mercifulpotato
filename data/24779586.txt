Item(by='anarazel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602698700, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24777393, text='&gt; The title is misleading<p>The HN title certainly seems to be. My understanding is that 9th circuit opinion was talking about the bulk phone metadata collection program (which used to be enabled under section 215 and even done before (&quot;stellar wind&quot;)), not about 702 collection. But that 702 collection is certainly part of PRISM as we understand it.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s my reading that pertains specifically to the case before the court and not a conclusive determination about the entirety of the PRISM program.<p>I understood it to be somewhat generally about bulk metadata collection under 215 (which is not all of PRISM).')
