When I turn on music,the differences are not that high after you get used to it, I can put the inear buds in my pocket.  Also noise-cancelling is as good in any of them passive noise-cancelling with in ear buds == ANC with headphones.<p>Seriously after you get used to any of them, you don&#x27;t notice the differences in between them because you got used to the sound out of one of them that is unless you compare them.<p>Why do you prefer pricey over ear headphones over in-ear buds?')
