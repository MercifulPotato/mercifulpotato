I&#x27;ve been hacking recently on qdisc classifiers, and trying to set a filter up with BPF, but there&#x27;s a paucity of documentation on the subject. The tc tools are sorta documented here (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man7.org&#x2F;linux&#x2F;man-pages&#x2F;man8&#x2F;tc-bpf.8.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;man7.org&#x2F;linux&#x2F;man-pages&#x2F;man8&#x2F;tc-bpf.8.html</a>), but it&#x27;s quite hard to find docs on the underlying syscalls and the behavior of `bpf_prog_type_sched_cls`.<p>I bought a copy of BPF performance tools to learn more about the BPF interface, and it&#x27;s really useful but quite focused on performance! I wish there was a resource of similar depth and breath about eBPF for classification&#x2F;XDP.')
