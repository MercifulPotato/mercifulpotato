Item(by='justin66', descendants=None, kids=[25024647, 25024203], score=None, time=1604767003, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25015590, text='&gt; Yes you can now boot a raspberry pi from an external usb3.0 hard drive or SSD in an enclosure. But how many people actually do that?<p>Judging by how often people talk about the feature online (or how often they enquired about the delay in implementating it on pi 4 - it&#x27;s been possible with the 3 forever), a lot.<p>&gt; something like the raspberry pi but with a socket to plug in a cheap M.2 SATA or M.2 NVME SSD is needed.<p>This is a not entirely uncommon but very badly thought out feature suggestion for the pi that comes from technical people who aren&#x27;t the target audience and don&#x27;t understand the target audience for the pi. It&#x27;d be an okay feature on the Pi compute module.<p>First things first, though: if you&#x27;re really worried about storage reliability on these things (or anything), please stop prefacing your hardware suggestions with &quot;cheap.&quot;<p>&gt; low cost industrial&#x2F;embedded&#x2F;dedicated purpose headless machines, is from the microsd card failing after 6, 12, 18 months.<p>If you&#x27;re trying to get this much value out of the thing, using either a legitimate, brand name USB ssd (not something cobbled together in a cheap enclosure), an industrial SD card built for embedded applications, or network booting are all good options.<p>Consumer grade sd cards are... cheap. It&#x27;s not such a problem for a lot of the Pi&#x27;s applications. I&#x27;m happy to use cheap sd cards to boot Pi 3s that serve as music players while using a Samsung T5 on the Pi that serves the music, for example (and on a development system).')
