This is not true of company-&gt;employee relationships.<p>It is assumed that if you join a company you share their values and if you no longer share their values the barrier to leave and join another is quite low. People have different values and that is fine. Unless your employer is engaging in illegal behaviors, speaking out against their value set is just showing intolerance for other people and their values.<p>Move on, join up and use your time to help lift values you hold, donâ€™t just spend all your time tearing down others. Respect the fact that others can have values different than your own.')
