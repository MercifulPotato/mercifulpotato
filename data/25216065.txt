Item(by='kelnos', descendants=None, kids=[25216115], score=None, time=1606353947, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25209064, text='&gt; <i>If the option was a mac with privacy vs a mac without privacy but $10 cheaper, I&#x27;d think the market would pick the mac with privacy.</i><p>I&#x27;m curious about this, and there are some ways we could test it if we had access to sales data.<p>Amazon sells a Kindle that displays ads on the screen while the device is asleep, and a more expensive model without ads.  How many people buy the one without ads?  (I&#x27;m assuming the device sends back a record as to what ads were seen or interacted with, which has privacy implications.)<p>Hulu has a plan that shows adverts when you watch a show, and a more expensive plan that doesn&#x27;t.  How many people pay for the more expensive plan?<p>More generally, what&#x27;s the price spread that would cause most people to flip from buying one version or the other?  To use your example, I&#x27;m sure most people would pay for a &quot;mac with privacy&quot; if the difference (on a multi-hundred-dollar or $1k+ product) was only $10.  But what if the difference was $50?  $100?<p>And that&#x27;s not even the exact same example, since a &quot;mac with privacy&quot; might look, to the average user, to be identical in operation to the &quot;mac without privacy&quot;.  Paying more to avoid advertisements has a clear impact on the experience of using a device&#x2F;service. But knowing that your $X-more-expensive mac isn&#x27;t sending application launch data to Apple doesn&#x27;t change your day-to-day experience much.')
