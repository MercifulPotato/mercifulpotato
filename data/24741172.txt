If you are helping a dictator or authoritarian regime, sure.  I think it is in the wrong side of the story.<p>But helping out the US in developing high-precission weapons does the opposite.<p>1. It might save lifes, as the alternative is dumb carpet bombing.  As we know during WW2, carpet bombing killed mostly civilians and destroyed cities.<p>2. Most weapons that the US has, are there for deterrence, and not necessary meant to be used, and in the long run hopefully they are never used.<p>3. The US is the better greater power by a long stretch. I know it gets a lot of flak here, but while it has done many mistakes, the US has done more good that usually gets forgotten. \nThe alternative is China (in the Pacific) or Russian hegemony in half of Europe.  I am talking as someone born in a former communist country. And almost all former communist countries in Europe are staunch US supporters&#x2F;allies as they have lived first hand communism, and experienced its rotten system.')
