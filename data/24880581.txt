Any time the Nazis did it(like in Lvov) it took a huge amount of work to help with burrying&#x2F;burning the bodies, Nazis didn&#x27;t want to do it so they would conscript the local population, which was then likely to strike back as they knew exactly what would happen to them. If you told people you were &quot;relocating&quot; them they were far more likely to come peacefully, and concentration camps provided a very valuable source of labour to nearby areas. As for feeding them....it doesn&#x27;t take much to find out that they were barely fed anything. Pretty much only the prisoners who received outside parcels with food survived more than a month or two, simply because the prisoners weren&#x27;t fed, given proper clothing or any care whatsoever. The same with &quot;massive housing complexes&quot; - Auschwitz initially used existing military barracks and then built very simple huts for Birkenau. It&#x27;s hard to call it housing.')
