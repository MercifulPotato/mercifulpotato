It&#x27;s important because <i>despite</i> not having a business case, it&#x27;s a groundbreaking exploration of what technology can be and a platform for really free experimentation.<p>I&#x27;ve spent several hundred hours just experimenting within it and testing out ideas or refining things that were not previously tractable. In many cases, simply having beaker with its unique possibilities and constraints as a playground has helped inspire new ideas.<p>Unfortunately that doesn&#x27;t automatically translate to anyone getting paid, or widespread adoption, or many other things people use to measure value. But many of the most important things aren&#x27;t the ones we measure or celebrate.<p>Looking forward to checking out your videos pfrazee.')
