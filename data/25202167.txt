Item(by='littlestymaar', descendants=None, kids=[25202617], score=None, time=1606246683, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25200721, text='&gt; where an NGO moved a camp and set up multiple tents on a main square for theatrical purposes and the clearing of the square was completely justifiable<p>It was indeed a happening, by activists. A bit of context: the state is required by law to provide emergency housing to these people, but failed to comply, so this NGO organized this happening to attract attention on this problem (and the  non-respect of the law by the government). Reacting to such happening by assaulting the JOURNALISTS covering the event is unjustifiable in a democratic country, sorry.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m more worried about teachers being killed for showing drawings to students<p>It was ONE teacher, not teacher, and it was indeed a tragedy. And it also has no link with the police assaulting journalists (Samuel Patty was defending free speech, assaulting journalists is as far as you can get from thatâ€¦).')
