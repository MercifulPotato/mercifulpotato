The problem is the 1mb block size cap. The block size cap restricts the number of transactions that can be processed in a block. It&#x27;s an artificial restriction of supply. When demand increases the price (tx fee) goes (way) up.<p>There is some magical thinking within the Bitcoin community that only a fixed block size will prevent centralization. I have never heard a solid argument to back that up. Everything in technology is growing exponentially (cpu power, network throughput, disc space). So in relative terms the block size is decreasing exponentially. Technically Bitcoin mining should get exponentially more decentralized. This is not happening.<p>If we let the block size grow at the same rate as the surrounding tech, or at least at some rate, the supply problem would go away. The transaction fee would go down and we would not need to use flaky and centralizing tech like the lightning network that mimics the financial system that we wanted to escape.<p>For a long time this was a theory. However several forks of Bitcoin have tried it in practice (eg BCH, LTC, BSV). Over several years these experiments have shown that if you stop restricting the block size you get a system that is dependable, cheap to use, and scalable.<p>My wish for 2021 is for people in Bitcoin to reconsider if they have made a mistake in restricting the blockchain. I hope they will have the courage to change their minds in light of data.')
