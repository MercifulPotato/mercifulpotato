I&#x27;m an old-skool Slashdot person who just moved over to HN a year or two ago, and there are lots of things I really miss about the Slashdot moderation system.<p>One of the most noticeable things is trying to skim a discussion with thousands of comments.  On Slashdot, you can set your threshold to +5, and see only the very most insightful comments, no matter where they are in the thread.  On HN, there&#x27;s a lot more digging required to get the gems.<p>That said, I do think HN&#x27;s &quot;story-selection&quot; algorithm is an improvement.  What shows up on the front page relies a lot less on the quirks of the editors, and seems to result in a much more diverse set of posts.<p>As others have mentioned, I think the top-level moderation is the most important factor keeping HN worth reading.  It&#x27;s dang intervening and setting the tone which does the most for HN at the moment.  We need to keep him happy; and I hope that he has a &quot;succession&quot; in place in case he&#x27;s ever unable to continue the work.')
