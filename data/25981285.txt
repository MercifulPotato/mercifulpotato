It&#x27;s clear their highest priority was to avoid admission that they were running out of money.<p>IMO, this is why anyone wanting to &quot;trade seriously&quot; should NOT use Robinhood.<p>Robinhood is like the fast food of investing. It&#x27;s designed for convenience, but makes you worse off in the end.<p>If you want a legit trading platform, then download Thinkorswim, Tastytrade, Schwab, Webull, Etrade, or Fidelity.<p>Any of the above will tell you way more information than Robinhood, give you significantly better charts, and various extras like News and Level II data for free (at least Thinkorswim does).<p>Honestly, just look around at the different offerings, maybe give them a test-drive, and choose whatever one suits you. Yes, you will probably have to learn the platforms, but that learning is valuable knowledge.')
