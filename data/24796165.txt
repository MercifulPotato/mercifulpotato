I am glad to announce that we have reached that goal today. Dhaxle is live on Product Hunt. Our platform helps people and institutions to manage their projects in remote locations and create wealth at their optimal pace.<p>The concept of Dhaxle was born after my frustration of losing money while trying to enhance my loved ones and consolidate my life as new immigrant in US. I undertook some projects in my country of origin.<p>My goals were to uplift my family and stop the pressure of sharing a third of my earnings almost every month. But I became frustrated when I couldn&#x27;t get clear reports on the spending or updates on the implementation process. I lost part of my investment and abandoned other projects due to endless litigation with contractors.<p>I shared my pain with friends and extended the inquiries to my communities and peers around the world. A significant majority admitted experiencing similar issues.<p>Thus, my co-founders and I created this system that provides peace of mind, protects our investment and values our initiatives while uplifting our global family.<p>You will find a link to videos in the PH launch page as well as the link to our website. The system is on trial mode. Feel free to register an account to access your personal dashboard and assess how it can be useful to your needs of remote project management. DHAXLE: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;dhaxle\nWe are excited to receive all your feedback as we navigate through this important step in our journey.<p>I also have a video message for you: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;7MBJpnYjqOM.<p>If DHAXLE can add value to you or someone in your community and networks, awesome. Please let’s talk! I really want to hear your thoughts, questions and comments.<p>All the best for your startups!<p>Roger Yomba N.')
