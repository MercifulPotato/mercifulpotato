PyTorch and Detecton2 was released at that time and fitted well with our needs, so after some tests we saw it was easier to debug and work with and occupied less memory, so we converted.&quot;<p>There are also several allusions that the PyTorch community is more active and supporting than TF.<p>To be clear, I love PyTorch, but I don&#x27;t have enough production-level experience to confirm or reject these claims, and TF is not well-presented in the article.')
