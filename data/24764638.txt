The most popular and useful ML algorithms are boosted trees and random forests; they&#x27;re more or less geometric approximators (which are all nonlinear). And as ANN nerds like to say, there&#x27;s plenty of nonlinearity in neural approaches.<p>But mostly I agree with you: modeling is horse shit, worshipping models (linear and otherwise) is childish idolatry and Dijkstra was completely correct about just about everything (speaking as an APL bum).')
