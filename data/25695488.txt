Item(by='throwawaysea', descendants=None, kids=[25695610], score=None, time=1610158770, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25694816, text='What I have observed today on social media is that censorship has been ramped up dramatically all in one day. And I don&#x27;t mean Trump. I&#x27;m seeing even posts from conservative accounts that unequivocally condemned the capitol raid getting deleted, and entire accounts being deleted with no notice. This to me feels a lot like a digital political genocide, the culmination of an ascendant group with significant power (progressive left allied with tech giants) suddenly unleashing it upon their political enemies.<p>I dislike Trump, but the claim that he has incited violence is without evidence, and we see that in Twitter&#x27;s blog post announcing his ban (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.twitter.com&#x2F;en_us&#x2F;topics&#x2F;company&#x2F;2020&#x2F;suspension.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.twitter.com&#x2F;en_us&#x2F;topics&#x2F;company&#x2F;2020&#x2F;suspensio...</a>), since it offers no hard evidence and only subjective leaps of the imagination. The call to delete his account because of the current political <i>context</i> is unacceptable, and it is also total hypocrisy given that this logic was not applied when BLM riots caused billions of Dollars in damage in the last year. It&#x27;s also hypocritical given that nearly identical incidents (riots at the capitol) have taken place several times before and not resulted in this type of coverage or censorship. Several of these incidents are in the past few years, such as the climate riot which AOC participated in (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;13&#x2F;alexandria-ocasio-cortez-sunrise-activists-nancy-pelosi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;13&#x2F;alexandria-ocasio-cortez...</a>) or the riots concerning Brett Kavanaugh&#x27;s appointment (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;2018&#x2F;oct&#x2F;04&#x2F;kavanaugh-supreme-court-protests-washington" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;us-news&#x2F;2018&#x2F;oct&#x2F;04&#x2F;kavanaugh-su...</a>) or the 600-person riot protesting immigration law (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;Politics&#x2F;womens-march-protesters-call-end-family-separation-capitol&#x2F;story?id=56240419" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;Politics&#x2F;womens-march-protesters-call...</a>).<p>This isn&#x27;t about riots. It isn&#x27;t about violence. It isn&#x27;t about a coup. It isn&#x27;t about Trump even. It is only about big tech bowing down to the new incoming leaders who control their fates, and with the changing of the guard, they have become comfortable showing who they are - powerful partisans who will put the power of their monopolies to work if left unimpeded. That should scare anyone who knows where this path leads based on history. I&#x27;m genuinely worried, because as always, these changes come in response to an event that scared people and now they are naively welcoming authoritarian changes.')
