The problem there is people are a bit reluctant to type in their credit card number, in case the number gets stolen.  Crypto is safer for this because the private key stays with the user on their phone or desktop wallet.  Also, pasting the credit card, expiration, and your name takes longer than scanning a QR code with your phone.')
