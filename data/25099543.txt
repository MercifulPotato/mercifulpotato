This wasn&#x27;t some onetime only type of comment. Remember when he said a US judge couldn&#x27;t rule on a case where Trump was losing, because the judge was of hispanic origin. That&#x27;s another racist comment. Trump has continually made these types of comments, made references to shithole countries. You can&#x27;t just dismiss that with a claim that he was saying something else, because his comments were part of a long standing sequence.')
