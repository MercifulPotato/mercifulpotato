I saw more than one case of positive interactions between Anandkumar and others who initially disagreed or were on the fence who then discussed things offline. That certainly didn&#x27;t appear to be harassment.<p>In response to your below comment:<p>&gt; The part you didn&#x27;t quote. The part about &quot;re-educating&quot; them<p>The full tweet I&#x27;m quoting is<p>&gt; I am looking for volunteers to try and change the minds of fanboys of Pedro (real people and not bots, everyone I saw is male). Especially junior people. We need to get them away from fanaticism. I can share my blocked list. We need #ALLY who can engage with them. Please DM me.<p>Heck, in another tweet she noted &quot;My blocked list is not meant to be punitive.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s nothing about &quot;re-educating&quot;, and even searching up discussions here and on reddit that contained quotes of her tweets, I couldn&#x27;t find anything mentioning &quot;re-education&quot;, except your comment and one other in this thread. Neither references an originating tweet, and, not for lack of trying, I can&#x27;t find anything on waybackmachine that includes the term, and I&#x27;d have assumed that someone would have taken the time to either comment on it or capture it at the time.<p>Could you please point out her use of the term, because I&#x27;m unaware of it. So the rest of your comment doesn&#x27;t make much sense as it appears to be based significantly on words that weren&#x27;t actually said, and further based on subtext and implications of words that, again, were never actually written.<p>&gt; And if all that is fine, why did she apologize?<p>Perhaps because she&#x27;s willing to apologize when she&#x27;s made others feel uncomfortable. That&#x27;s essentially what her apology says.')
