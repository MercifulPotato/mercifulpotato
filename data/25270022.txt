With a small library I was able to make a block diagram and simulate closed system response for arbitrary input. You have to create blocks(which is basically derivatives and outputs), put them in model and define interconnections. It is simple but pretty flexible. I am now trying to properly implement subsystems, and maybe gui for drawing block diagrams.<p>I would be super interested to see what you made with sympy. Can you show an example project using it, or put notification if you ever make it open source?')
