Putting aside the pedantically literal creative work that goes into documenting an API and naming functions, the chief engineering role of the API is,<p>- breaking the domain of work into well modeled types<p>- information hiding<p>- keeping dependencies together and&#x2F;or variously keeping data dependencies apart<p>- leaving room for extensibility<p>- speed of operations<p>- and promoting the correct use i.e. single v. multi-threaded or one server vs. distributed<p>That&#x27;s real work, and getting a &quot;good API&quot; i.e. recognized throughout industry as well adapted to the problem domain (say SQL for DB work) or copy-on-write for C++-strings almost always reflects a better implementation which bubbles into the API.')
