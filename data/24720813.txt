We have a private cloud by IBM (click2cloud) and IBM Bluemix. Honestly they are both bad. We also have azure and that’s night and day. But then again we even have oracle cloud, which I guess just means we like to step on mines in a minefield.<p>I think part of why we use IBM cloud services is we also use their consulting heavily. Everything runs on rhel and is supported by ibm.')
