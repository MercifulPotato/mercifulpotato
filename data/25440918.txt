Item(by='shpx', descendants=None, kids=[25444167], score=None, time=1608113879, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25440704, text='I used i3 for a 4+ years, then a few months ago I got tired of the screen tearing when I scrolled in Chrome and the screen showing a frame or two of checkerboard patterns (actually it&#x27;s more complicated, like black pixel fuzz around text that used to be there) any time I resized or moved a window. Now I just use the built-in Ubuntu desktop environment (tried the Wayland version but Spotify and Discord don&#x27;t work). Since most of the time I just have a terminal, Chrome or Emacs in full screen it doesn&#x27;t even matter.<p>Starting compton (which seems essential for i3 but the documentation doesn&#x27;t mention it) didn&#x27;t help. Enabling some Intel drivers fixed the screen tearing but broke my multimonitor setup.<p>Also dmenu is garbage compared to program search in modern desktop environments, it&#x27;s just search for bash commands, half the results arent something you&#x27;d want to run from your desktop and it doesn&#x27;t learn.<p>It makes sense that it&#x27;s not popular, most people have better things to do than read a manual and learn a new configuration language with 100s of options just to move windows around.')
