Moore&#x27;s law is a statement about the number of transistors on a chip, nothing more (Moore?). And sure enough, the Threadripper machine I built this year has about double the number of transistors as the Threadripper machine I built last year, which has about double the number of transistors to the one before that... (although this is partly a function of increasing budget; Moore&#x27;s law specifies a two year doubling).<p>But sure, if you want to talk performance - the fastest CPU this year, the Threadripper 3990X, is over 100x faster than the fastest CPU of 2005, the Athlon 64 FX-57. That&#x27;s about 7-8 doublings, or pretty much spot on.')
