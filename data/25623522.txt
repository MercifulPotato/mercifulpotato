You can use dyn on the stack (without a Box)?<p>This has been one of my biggest complaints about Rust: I&#x27;ve been using it for <i>years</i> at this point. I read most of the Book, I&#x27;ve read a few unofficial books. And I do love the language, but it has so many cases like this where things that you&#x27;re allowed to do (syntactically or otherwise) are somehow so non-obvious that you can miss them entirely. I still get blindsided by something like this every couple months, and I always end up a little mad that I&#x27;ve been doing things the hard way until some obscure unofficial material (or more often, a stack overflow answer) teaches me about an entire feature that I didn&#x27;t know existed.<p>Rust is really great at telling you what you can&#x27;t do, and in many ways its documentation is incredibly thorough, but it has a real problem when it comes to discoverability and establishing a consistent mental-model of what its syntax actually means (and how you can then apply it to other situations). I don&#x27;t know what the root cause of this problem is. But it&#x27;s really distressing to me each time I discover a huge blind-spot; it makes me feel like I never fully understood the language concepts that I thought I understood.<p>I say all of this out of love: I really want Rust to succeed. I still prefer to use it despite this issue. I just believe this is a huge thorn in its side, especially when it comes to adoption, for which it already has an uphill climb.')
