My problems with numpy have always been that I have to make a lot of calls on small bits of data and the ffi overhead eats all my performance gains. If I put more logic on the native side and made fewer bigger calls it would be faster, but that often doesn&#x27;t make sense, or is a slope where putting the logic unto native pulls a data structure over or another related bit of logic until I just have a tiny bit of python left.')
