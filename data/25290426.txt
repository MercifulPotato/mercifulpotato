I&#x27;m excited because Apple just showed what is possible. Other companies are going to have to try to match it.<p>I have wanted a powerful &quot;enough&quot; fanless laptop for many years. I got excited about 4 years ago with Intel&#x27;s short-lived M line and I bought an Asus ux305. It served me well for front end web dev (had to use a cooler stand under sustained high load though). Great Linux support and battery life (after installing tlp). I remember feeling a bit of awe that it was reasonably snappy with no fan, but it was not quite there. I can only imagine the feeling is an order of magnitude greater with the M1.<p>I don&#x27;t own any Apple products, but I still hope that raising the bar will benefit me later on. I&#x27;ll be pretty pumped when this level of hardware can run a mainline kernel.')
