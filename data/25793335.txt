If I could use Supernotes as just a client, but use my own hosting, it&#x27;d be excellent.<p>Is there a way I could use Supernote with my own data? Eg if I have markdown files on my ftp &#x2F; webdav or other, could I load them in Supernotes? Could I export the .md to ftp or other?<p>PS: what did you use to create your community site? I like the solution. Is it Discuss?')
