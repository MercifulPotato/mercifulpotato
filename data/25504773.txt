For content that abhorrent, any number of occurrences above zero is enough to tell what kind of person a user is.<p>Whilst I agree that the comment you refer to is absolutely abhorrent and should be treated as such, I also strongly believe that people have the capacity to change and that we as a society should be pushing for that change.<p>If that comment was from a number of years ago, any number of things could have happened to change that persons view of the world and the people in it.<p>If you have someone who&#x27;s so misinformed that they hold these horrendous views then casting them aside forever is, in my view, the opposite of what we should be doing.<p>In the physical world we tend to put people in to the &#x27;correctional&#x27; system (whether it works as a correctional system is very much up for debate), but in the virtual world, we just censor them and let them go away and reinforce their views with each other in their own space.<p>We&#x27;ll never get a better society if we don&#x27;t challenge the nasty parts of it and work out why people go down that path and, critically, forgive them if they change.')
