Here&#x27;s an &quot;old&quot; paper from July:<p>Toyoshima, Y., Nemoto, K., Matsumoto, S. et al. SARS-CoV-2 genomic variations associated with mortality rate of COVID-19. J Hum Genet 65, 1075â€“1082 (2020). <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1038&#x2F;s10038-020-0808-9" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doi.org&#x2F;10.1038&#x2F;s10038-020-0808-9</a><p>The measured variation between the now extinct L strain and the new current G strain is the G strain was about 2% higher correlation between strain and fatality rate.  The actual fatality rate was not 2% higher which would be huge, but the % of L in a population vs population fatality rate correlated 2% higher based on euro country data in the spring.<p>Certainly there&#x27;s only two real impacts on fatality rate right now, both incredibly politically incorrect to discuss, there&#x27;s an enormous staggering stunning huge disparity in fatality rate by age, and a merely giant disparity in fatality rate by comorbidity rate.  The medical science seems clear, but the political impact makes it impossible to discuss quarantine policies that would minimize total death rates.  Hundreds of thousands of lives could be saved by locking up everyone over 60 and everyone over 300 pounds and a couple other pre-existing conditions, but AARP is one of the strongest PACs out there and even if it saves her life, grandma will vote out anyone who &quot;locks her up for a year for her own good&quot;.<p>Personally I&#x27;m old enough that I&#x27;m working very hard to max out my cardio health for when I inevitably get it.')
