Item(by='purchanceallus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611683264, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25910852, text='&gt;I don’t have anything to add on monitoring distance, but both of the affidavits you linked specifically agree with the video that they left and not that they were kicked out, because everyone thought counting was finished for the night. Neither of them claims they wouldn’t have been allowed to stay if they had stayed until the room was empty.<p>It seems the reason they thought they were done counting is because a supervisor told the counters to go home, and said that they were done counting for the day.<p>Relevant part from the linked document (paragraph 8):<p>&quot;Sometime after 10 o&#x27;clock p.m., the counting activity slowed.  Shortly afterward, a younger lady with long braided but blond hair yelled out to all of them they should stop working and come back tomorrow (the next day, Wednesday November 4th) at 8:30 A.M..  Thereafter, all but 4 election employees left State Farm, leaving just the blond haired lady (who Michelle and I assumed was the supervisor), two older ladies and Regina Waller at the location.  This lady had appeared through the night and Michelle and I believed her to be the supervisor.&quot;<p>I think that while it is possible the observers could have just stayed there until everyone left, it is likely that they believed what they were told -- that the counting would finish the next day.<p>At any rate, it is at best a bad look.  I agree that it doesn&#x27;t prove fraud or anything close.  It does, however, look suspicious and IMHO warrants further investigation.')
