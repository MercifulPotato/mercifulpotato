If zip files can be streamed then both of the example above would fail because in the first case we&#x27;d see file B and in the second we&#x27;d see file A (old) before we saw that the central directory doesn&#x27;t reference them. If you have to wait for the central directory before you can correctly use any of the entries then functionally you can not stream zip files.<p>You cannot filter a particular file in a stream using UNIX fifos and constant memory, but you could replace the old file A with the second file A in the stream because it is later. In this way, yes you can consume a zip file in a streaming way, even if you have to wait until the end to pass any of the output to another process.<p>TAR and CPIO have the same &quot;feature&quot;.')
