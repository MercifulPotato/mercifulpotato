A favorite ~recent example was discovering &quot;Power of Two Choices&quot; (for bins and balls) a few years ago, and then, that very day, doing a prototype of a cache using that approach.  I seriously doubt a Mechanical Engineers would have the same experience with ~contemporary fundamental physics theoretical papers.')
