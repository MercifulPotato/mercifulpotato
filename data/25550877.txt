Let&#x27;s remove all forms of regulation, shall we?<p>Someone joins your company and starts leaking all your intellectual property. It is all good, though, because legislation related to that doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>A developer joins your company, and shortly after uploads your entire code base to github. That&#x27;s OK due to lack of legislation saying otherwise.<p>A sysadmin changes all the passwords and asks you for a ransom to unlock your production database. That&#x27;s also OK.<p>Your ISP randomly makes your internet 99% slower and then asks you for an exorbitant amount of money. That&#x27;s also OK.<p>The accountant forged your signature and stole all the money. That&#x27;s also OK.<p>Your customers randomly decide to not pay you. That&#x27;s also OK.<p>Your employees start dismantling the office and taking furniture and equipment home. That&#x27;s OK.<p>The mailman shows up wearing the company swag you ordered. Doesn&#x27;t matter anymore.<p>HR people upload a spreadsheet with everyone&#x27;s personal information and salaries to the Internet. That&#x27;s OK.<p>Some larger company sends some gangsters to force you to sell the company for a fraction of its price. That&#x27;s OK.<p>As you can see, saying &quot;regulation is bad&quot; is nonsensical. Without certain guarantees, businesses cannot exist.')
