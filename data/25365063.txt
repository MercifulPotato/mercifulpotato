So what Youtube is doing is the very definition of _freedom_ of expression. A government pressuring them to carry pro-government messages is the crime, not the other way around.<p>You are now having the government and pro-government voices pressure non-government organizations to publish pro-government material while claiming that it &quot;protects&quot; freedom of speech. This the exact _opposite_ of freedom of speech, it is in fact forced propaganda.<p>So indeed there is no &quot;but&quot; because it is _the government_ that is in the wrong by pressuring publishers in what they must include.')
