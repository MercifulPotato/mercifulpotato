I&#x27;ve seen more and more shows incorporating this, but the process is messy (usually involves recording voice memos on your phone and emailing them somewhere, sometimes becoming unmanageable).<p>With Lines, hosts get a branded landing page that includes a web-based voicemail recorder, plus a unique toll-free number for premium subscribers. All VMs appear on the hosts dashboard for easy management. Messages are transcribed to make them skimmable.<p>There&#x27;s a bunch of other stuff.. all with the aim of helping small teams capture the power of this tried and true content channel. If you would like to try it out (or know someone who would like to try it) I&#x27;m happy to comp paid plans in return for candid feedback. Just shoot me a message. Thanks for reading!')
