This does assume they allow outbound connectivity to more than 80&#x2F;443.  I have found places that do not allow this.  I could run tinc [1] on 443, but if UDP is blocked, the VPN will be slower.<p>That said, in fairness, not everyone sets up their own VPN mesh.  Some people use commercial VPN providers. So in that case, it would assume my friend does not block access to that VPN provider.<p>[1] - <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinc-vpn.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinc-vpn.org&#x2F;</a>')
