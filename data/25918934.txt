After the initial trouble, we did remotely all the things that looked impossible to do outside the office: 1-1s, meetings, workshops.<p>Only one exception: the coffee break. The occasional chit chat which happened in the coffee area has not been substituted from any call, even the most informal one. In fact you don&#x27;t schedule a coffee, you just go there and find a colleague. It&#x27;s great for teambuilding and company culture.<p>We tried to do remote coffees but the magic doesn&#x27;t happen.\nDo you know anyone who tried to replace this moment with a remote tool or way to do it?')
