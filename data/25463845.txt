Her ultimatum isn&#x27;t satisfied, so both part way.<p>This group of people also hyper-focus way way too much on this part, which is not the important.<p>It&#x27;s much better to focus on other stuffs like her paper didn&#x27;t get approved because o A, B, and C. Or how Google suppresses her paper because of X, Y, Z.<p>Instead these people are yelling that Timnit was fired unfairly when she was the one who gave the ultimatum first...?')
