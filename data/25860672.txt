If you could stop that then you wouldn&#x27;t need DMCA 1201. So what it does in practice is act as an anti-competitive cudgel to prohibit adversarial interoperability.<p>The CFAA does something similar -- it&#x27;s excessively broad and basically everything it prohibits which is actually bad was already prohibited by other laws.<p>There are a wide variety of financial regulations (mandatory chargebacks, KYC) that effectively require the result that you can&#x27;t have a low-friction anonymous digital payments system. This means that if you want to consume media on the internet where the author gets paid instead of them paying to host content, without all your media consumption ending up in a dangerous central database associated with your social security number, it has to be supported by advertising. And then we&#x27;re back to the dangerous central database.<p>These laws are harmful to a free and democratic society.')
