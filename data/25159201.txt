Ligatures distort that.<p>Ligatures are fine when reading prose, but I find them too confusing when coding. That&#x27;s a personal preference, though. I&#x27;m sure some people have no problem with them.<p>I expect a significant proportion of programmers do not like coding using fonts with ligatures, so it&#x27;s interesting that this website only provides the ability to filter fonts to display only those with ligatures. I would have liked the option to only display fonts WITHOUT ligatures.')
