Which ones may depend on your weather, cultural, etc. preferences. But Silicon Valley proper I find not particularly appealing; housing costs are only part of the reason. (SF itself has well-documented pluses and minuses.) I don&#x27;t live or work in CA&#x2F;SV. But if I were in SV but no longer needed to commute, I might well stay in CA but I&#x27;d probably move somewhere outside of SV commuting distance.')
