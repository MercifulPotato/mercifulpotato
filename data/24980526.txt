The source of gender discrimination and racial discrimination and religious discrimination and age discrimination is that there are a whole lot of teams at a whole lot of tech companies that are white men int their 20s, and have no interest in hiring anyone who isn&#x27;t a while man in their 20s.<p>It&#x27;s the reason &#x27;culture&#x27; should be entirely removed from any sort of interview criteria - more specifically, interviewers should be warned that measuring a candidate based on &#x27;culture&#x27; is an open door to discrimination.<p>More broadly. it&#x27;s something that needs to be pointed out whenever discussions drag out about &quot;why aren&#x27;t there more of &lt;X&gt;?&quot; and &quot;Why do &lt;X&gt; make less?&quot;  It&#x27;s because our entire industry does it&#x27;s best to keep &lt;X&gt; out.  It&#x27;s not brain chemicals, it&#x27;s not negative role models, it&#x27;s not any other excuse that likes to get thrown up.  It&#x27;s deliberate, at least as deliberate as it can be.')
