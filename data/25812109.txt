While I mentioned fillings as a safe use, there is a (very small) amount of vapor released when they&#x27;re installed, and more gets released if they need to be removed. Not enough to matter in adults. If you needed enough fillings for it to be a concern the dental microbiota issues causing the decay would be a far bigger general health threat. Indeed, Alzheimer&#x27;s is linked to gingivitis (gum disease) and the hypothesized link with amalgam fillings may be an artifact of people with worse gum disease having worse dental health, and thus more fillings.')
