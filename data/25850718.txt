It is quite a lot of work, even with the Ansible script. First was the DNS SRV record, that is needed to federate with matrix.org. And the Signal integration happily sent messages to my friends, but I never got any messages back.<p>I have quite a lot of experience with Linux and server maintenance. And I know if I put enough time to this, I&#x27;ll get everything to work eventually. I&#x27;m still saying that paying money for somebody else to do this feels like a nice investment at this point. The task of doing everything by yourself is quite tricky.')
