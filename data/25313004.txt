High society acceptance as long as the person didn&#x27;t wreak too much havoc. It has been idolized in folklore songs, books and stories for children. Just part of the life. Kids drank sometimes too.<p>Fast forward today - access to alcohol is even better (apart from minors). Yet society doesn&#x27;t spiral into alcoholic madness apart form few fringe individuals.
