There&#x27;s no native PS5 or Xbox series X&#x2F;S version you can buy. You buy the PS4&#x2F;Xbox One version and play it via backwards compatibility. Apart from video resolution or low FPS, have there been significant problems on the last gen consoles in terms of bugs that aren&#x27;t on the new gen?')
