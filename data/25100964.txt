While a statistically few people exist who really are biologically missing certain psychological abilities (what we usually call mental health disorders), for everyone else it&#x27;s totally possible to increase&#x2F;decrease things like empathy, critical thought, fearfulness, optimism, etc. over time.<p>Making those changes consciously is just a) hard and b) usually quite gradual&#x2F;hard to gauge progress, so as a result the position that &quot;you either innately have it or you don&#x27;t&quot; becomes quite seductive.<p>This sword cuts both ways: that ability to change is present even for awful or deeply suffering people. However, it&#x27;s also possible for positive things (empathy, hopefulness and the like) to <i>decrease</i> over time even without conscious effort.<p>This is one of the reasons that I think everyone, if able, should try to get help in tracking their mental state, even if they&#x27;re healthy: how you do this might differ (therapy, church, regular mental check-ins with a trusted confidant, journaling, meditation, whatever), but it is a really powerful quality of maturity to be able to watch--and to the extent you are able, manage--your &quot;levels&quot; of these personal&#x2F;psychological qualities')
