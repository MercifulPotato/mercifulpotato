Item(by='arcticbull', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605808761, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25147359, text='I&#x27;m not blanket defending them.<p>(1) I&#x27;m a right-to-repair activist, I believe that batteries should be user-serviceable and preferably end-user-serviceable. The fact that Apple refused to replace batteries in exchange for a fee is nutters to me. Apple&#x27;s general disdain for third-party repair is indefensible.<p>(2) I want a system that tries to get as much performance as possible at all times, and that means as a consumable part (the battery) ages, less performance is available because less instantaneous power is available. This aging process begins on the first day and first charge cycle of ownership. That means if the device is always pulling the most power possible out of the battery, the performance characteristics of the device change over time, like balding tires or razor blades. A balding tire or razor blade is not defective, even if I can&#x27;t take corners as tightly or have to slow down my shave to avoid cutting up my face.<p>(3) I would prefer a device that ramps down peak performance over time to match the capabilities of a consumable part rather than one that artificially limits peak performance early on to avoid a ramp-down. And I would certainly prefer a device that throttles at 20% capacity to one that takes a dirt nap at 20%. I had one of those, and it was <i>awful</i>. I couldn&#x27;t rely on it to get home, for instance. The patch at issue here resolved that completely. I&#x27;d also prefer a device that is <i>on</i> at 20% to one that shuts down before it gets to 20% in some effort to avoid throttling.<p>(4) I don&#x27;t think that a battery that is able to supply less instantaneous power over time is defective so long as its reduced capability is in line with expectations for the given age and number of charge cycles, and therefore shouldn&#x27;t be eligible for a complementary automatic in-warranty battery replacement.<p>(5) Ok, say you prefer the other. Fine, don&#x27;t buy an iPhone. It&#x27;s not a 100 million dollar lawsuit worthy issue. It&#x27;s at most a good will issue for the few folks who would prefer the other behavior, and having a switch resolved it.<p>Is that really such a ridiculous stance? Does this really irritate you?')
