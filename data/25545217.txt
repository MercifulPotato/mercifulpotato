Science can get lost in the woods for a long time -- for one thing, theory is fun -- but eventually has to bump into some empirical data. For instance the trouble that plagues the search for a theory that reconciles gravity and quantum mechanics is that theories are a dime a dozen, but ones that can be empirically tested remain elusive.<p>Theology was regarded as a science in the middle ages, but its appeal was to evidence found in scripture and tradition rather than empirical data. I honestly don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s regarded in the same way today.<p>With that said, scientific methodology can be useful in the exploration of math. I&#x27;ve used computation to guide me towards a proof. For instance if the problem is: &quot;Find all numbers such that ...,&quot; and the first 10 of those numbers are powers of two, hmmmm... guess where you&#x27;ll start looking for a proof. But the computation itself was not a proof.<p>Computers can be studied from a pure math angle, e.g., computing the order of a sorting algorithm. But they can also be studied by treating a computer as an unknown whose properties are discovered by empirical testing of hypotheses. For instance, benchmarking is such a pursuit.')
