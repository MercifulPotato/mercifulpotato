The rules in Sydney, which they have had for a year and will likely have for all of 2021 (no more than 5 visitors, no gatherings &gt;30 people in public) are much more restrictive than any other state in Australia. I much prefer a short and hard lockdown with closed borders to states who refuse to attempt elimination and being able to live a normal life as a result.<p>The Victorian 2nd wave was undeniably a management screw up, and when restrictions were announced I was dubious that itâ€™d even work (thought the cat was out of the bag) but the fact that their modelling forecasts were accurate (to the day!) months out shows they knew what they were doing and for me it seemed worthwhile.')
