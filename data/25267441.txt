Papert at the time of this video had spent decades running experiments in schools in the US and with entire school systems (e.g. Costa Rica). Not perfect work, but he was likely one of the few people in the room with actual experience introducing both computers and radically different approaches to learning in a wide array of contexts. Share this not to preclude Shaw&#x27;s contributions, but to note that Papert&#x27;s comments on budget &#x2F; logistics are coming from experience actually trying this stuff.<p>- While Papert was harsh in his critique of traditional education research, he kept up with the research (Shaw&#x27;s point that Papert doesn&#x27;t know that world is frankly false). For example, see Papert&#x27;s critique of a seminal book on school reform: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learning.media.mit.edu&#x2F;courses&#x2F;mas713&#x2F;readings&#x2F;why_school_reform_is_impossible.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;learning.media.mit.edu&#x2F;courses&#x2F;mas713&#x2F;readings&#x2F;why_s...</a><p>- I haven&#x27;t seen the entire video, but the bigger point Seymour would make is that introducing computers to school offers an opportunity to radically rethink learning and teaching. Instead of learning math through lectures and worksheets, a kid might learn through creating personally meaningful things in microworlds (see his discussion of Logo in Mindstorms): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mindstorms.media.mit.edu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mindstorms.media.mit.edu</a> or Andrea diSessa&#x27;s later work.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in a more recent take, I recommend checking out Mitch Resnick&#x27;s new forward to Mindstorms: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@mres&#x2F;the-seeds-that-seymour-sowed-c2860379617b" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@mres&#x2F;the-seeds-that-seymour-sowed-c28603...</a>')
