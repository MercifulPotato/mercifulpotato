If ETH gets devalued through inflation by too much the security of the network would be compromised. They are explicitly moving to a 100% proof of stake model for securing the network (already partially deployed). This directly incentivizes stakeholders to protect the valuation of ETH. Finally, if EIP-1559 is implemented, the network will begin burning transaction fees. That is to say, it&#x27;s possible in the future more ETH will be burned via transaction fees than produced from staking, in which case ETH issuance will go negative.')
