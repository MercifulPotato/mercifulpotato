Timestamps fit that bill (even though it&#x27;s the Universe changing the state).<p>For testing purposes I often find myself making functions that take the date as an argument. If the language supports default values, I&#x27;ll set it as a default value. If it doesn&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll make a convenience method or a null check to set it to &#x27;now&#x27; if none is provided.<p>It turns out though that a lot of code we write to run within Â±30 seconds of &#x27;now&#x27; ends up over time having to run (or re-run) on old or future dates. So with the exception of logging and events, having that as an argument turns out to be useful or at least neutral.<p>For logging and events I&#x27;d probably use a mock timing library anyway.')
