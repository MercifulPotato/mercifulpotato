Supplies in some downtown supermarkets are low, with fresh produce completely out-of-stock.<p>The fact that snowplows are nowhere to be seen and streets continue to be in such a poor state suggests to me that not only we are completely ill-equipped for this situation (which is normal), but that the situation is overwhelming and the few resources we do have are spread thinly across the country.')
