Pop OS is a real usability achievement, the tiling desktop is great, and controlling both hardware and software is how you get something as user-friendly as a mac. I especially loved this review of the Oryx: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5aJ9U5t9oD4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5aJ9U5t9oD4</a>')
