Nothing.<p>People in Intelligence are as smart and more importantly dumb! as the general population.<p>One difference is they can&#x27;t smoke pot (Unsure about the Dutch)<p>Their only &#x27;power&#x27; that makes them seem better than mediocre is they can do things that would be considered illegal for a normal person without fear.
