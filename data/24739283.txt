It can correct syntax errors in C++ (!).<p>More generally, it can convert text from a simple, unstructured form into more complex, more structured form, with just a few example transforms. It&#x27;s astonishingly good at it, but I haven&#x27;t seen much on the public net about it. I don&#x27;t know why people aren&#x27;t exploring it more tbh.')
