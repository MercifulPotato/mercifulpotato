We want to make it easy for families to measurably reduce their carbon footprint, using our website.<p>Our product combines multiple disciplines together (which you can read more about below). I believe this could spark a lot of interesting questions, especially around how cognitive neuroscience and web development affect our habit formation.<p>Our product is in its early stages, and we&#x27;re experimenting with using &quot;carbon missions&quot; within the website, to help gamify the process of living a greener lifestyle (switching to LEDs, sorting your trash, etc.). We also incorporated an in-game storyline using &quot;Zerons&quot;, which are AR characters you can view after completing a mission (implemented using Google&#x27;s WebXR framework).<p>Please check out the website if you want to see it for yourself - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;playcarbon0.com.<p>We would love to hear your feedback, especially if you have tried to educate yourself or other family members about living green in the past. What helped you to make a change, and what didn&#x27;t?<p>Also feel free to email me at zain.raza@students.makeschool.com, if you would like to schedule a 15-30 min user interview or UX testing session so we can improve!')
