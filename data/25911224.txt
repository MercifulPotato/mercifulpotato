Item(by='jodrellblank', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611623754, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25898712, text='B; the argument that if humans are going to take over the galaxy and become a multi-trillion population species and you throw a dart anywhere in the population of all humans who ever lived, chances are the dart would land in the region of most population, and therefore where you live is probably the time of highest population, so we never do become a galaxy-spanning species we only dwindle from here.<p>And it&#x27;s a daft argument because if you don&#x27;t have a soul, you are the product of your environment. You couldn&#x27;t be born as someone else, or somewhere else, or somewhen else, just like the River Amazon couldn&#x27;t be on Mars or in Pangaea, because it&#x27;s defined as &quot;the thing in Brazil, currently&quot;. You couldn&#x27;t be born in the Wild West because you are defined as &quot;the child of your parents&quot; and they weren&#x27;t there, then. You didn&#x27;t end up &#x2F;in&#x2F; that meat body, you &#x2F;are&#x2F; that meat body.<p>(And if you do have a soul, and they are randomly assigned to meat bodies, this argument is still like saying &quot;roll two dice, the most likely combined outcome is a 7, I got two dots and one dot so that must be what 7 is&quot;)')
