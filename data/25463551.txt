The US waning internationally, citizens divided and full of hate.<p>We&#x27;re factory-less, fab-less, and have fewer educated. Fewer consumers. Lots of debt.<p>We have SpaceX, but China&#x27;s pace of exploration and international cooperation is increasing faster than NASA&#x27;s.<p>The only advantage I can think of us our military and navy, but China has carrier-killers and ICBMs.<p>Zoomers on TikTok hate capitalism and the military, and it seems like they&#x27;re being indoctrinated by an &quot;algorithm&quot;. Or maybe it&#x27;s the lack of opportunity we&#x27;re providing for them.<p>If and when our tech companies and entertainment companies get leapfrogged, what will we have to export that brings us wealth?<p>What happens to democracy and liberty when the top economy and producer in the world is a single-party state?<p>I hope we&#x27;re hacking back just as hard. That&#x27;s what the NSA <i>should</i> be doing rather than domestic spying.')
