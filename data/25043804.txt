Figuring out the phase problem is one of my biggest TODO items.<p>How did you compute FFT of the phase? The thing is, phase is discontinuous or multivalued function if we represent phase as a real number. We could also represent phase as a complex number of unit magnitude: exp(i phi). It would be continuous, but complex-valued.<p>And phase is indeed important for hearing:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auditoryneuroscience.com&#x2F;vocalizations-speech&#x2F;speech-modulated-signal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auditoryneuroscience.com&#x2F;vocalizations-speech&#x2F;speech...</a><p>I didn&#x27;t quite get the trick with uninterleaving the lines.')
