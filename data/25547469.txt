I&#x27;m specifically talking about the ass-heavy FWD crossovers and minivans that dominate the roads today (though I suppose there&#x27;s a few FWD sedans out there with similiar handling).  They all have a very respectable sway bar up front for good &quot;car-like&quot; handling and they all have a lot of weight out back.  This results in a class of vehicles that mostly cannot go sideways even if you try (and believe me, I have tried).  Someone with one of those cars comes in with four nearly bald tires and wants two good ones put on and you put them on the rear then you have improved their handling by exactly zero because the fuse in the system is still the front traction.  Adding more rear traction doesn&#x27;t help because handling&#x2F;performance is determined by the weakest link in the chain and that&#x27;s still the front which is unchanged .  If you put the tires up front then sure, there&#x27;s a 2% chance of going sideways rather than a 1% chance but you&#x27;ve also improved the handling greatly by addressing the weakest link which is end that was lacking in traction.  The vehicle will corner and stop much better because the threshold for loss of traction is much higher.')
