Item(by='kazinator', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606216932, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25197352, text='&quot;C-Like&quot; and &quot;Lisp-like&quot; are not very well-defined terms. Some people see such categories as very broad, such that both Javascript and Awk are &quot;C-Like&quot;, and Tcl is a &quot;Lisp-like&quot;.<p>This is a problem, if you ask a question that inherently demands specifics.')
