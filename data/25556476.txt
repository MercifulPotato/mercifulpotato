I&#x27;m saying let the problem take care of itself.<p>The actions you were proposing weren&#x27;t things to help people make better decisions (if they were, it would still be free will). They were to make laws to outlaw activities. If you don&#x27;t believe in free will, why do you propose <i>helping</i> people make better decisions? Do you really think imposing someone else&#x27;s will over others is more benign? The government imposes its will through force or threat thereof (causing human suffering).<p>Government and politics is not really artificial. They form naturally whenever there are groups of people - similar leadership and power dynamics exist in the natural world too (look at bees, ants, wolves, etc).')
