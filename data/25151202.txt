I point it out. When they insist on defending that with a bunch of irrational hand-waving, I&#x27;m going to call them on it.<p>Everything you&#x27;ve said that makes this &quot;Bad&quot; is supposition and conjecture. Everything which is good about it is actual benefits people will see. Even if it is indeed &quot;deflection&quot;, the effect is a massive benefit for a huge number of small developers.<p>That you refuse to recognize that is just sad.')
