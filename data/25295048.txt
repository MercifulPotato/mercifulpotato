For the first few weeks, they&#x27;re in &#x27;bootcamp&#x27;, which is quite generalized.  For example: I&#x27;ve never done any meaningful Android or iPhone development in my life, but during bootcamp, I learned how to do Android and iPhone development (at a basic level) at Facebook.<p>After the first few weeks, but with a couple of weeks remaining in bootcamp, new hires are actively looking at and talking to different teams with open positions to join.  By the end of bootcamp, a total of about five weeks, the person formally joins a team.')
