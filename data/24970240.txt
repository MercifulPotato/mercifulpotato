Things we&#x27;ve noticed:<p>- Yes, UI sucks<p>- No autobilling<p>- Reboot times are slow (as the actual machines are reboooted, not a VPS)<p>- You need to upgrade to higher bandwidths for great speeds<p>- Some routing problems, very rarely<p>- You really need to know what your server needs are 6-12 months in advance<p>- Some product offerings way too expensive (eg. Loadbalancer)<p>Great things:<p>- Price. Net-net, still cheaper to buy 2-3 dedicated servers than a single beefy VPS<p>- A lot of sales, like every month<p>- You get the full resources of the whole server<p>- Reasonable support for network or hardware related issues<p>- Unlimited traffic (at least you don&#x27;t need to worry about normal usage overages)<p>- DDoS protection<p>Other thoughts:<p>In terms of performance, dedi&#x27;s work great. I&#x27;ve found their OVH Public Cloud instances (not the cheap one, but the more expensive ones) have not as great performance. Might as well buy a dedicated. The only pro is that you only pay for the time you use.')
