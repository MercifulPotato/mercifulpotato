Like any other company it must turn in information if requested by court order.<p>For example US was deep into banking system of Middle East countries[1] because they couldn&#x27;t get all SWIFT transactions they wanted.<p>If you are to blame SWIFT blame Belgium first because they essentially decide what happens with SWIFT at the first place. After 2001 world is not the same, anti-terrorist and anti-laundering laws are pervasive but I suppose for greater good.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;15&#x2F;us&#x2F;shadow-brokers-nsa-hack-middle-east.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;15&#x2F;us&#x2F;shadow-brokers-nsa-hac...</a>')
