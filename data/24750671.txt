But you&#x27;re totally right that the &quot;Unity way&quot; of using the editor isn&#x27;t how a lot of us would naturally gravitate to creating a game. I learned to like it, though (I think).<p>For me, I realized that wanting to &quot;keep it all in code&quot; is a learned habit, and part of why I learned it is because the tooling when everything in code is just so much better. I can navigate references, etc., count on compiler errors runtime errors, etc. But none of this fundamentally required me to keep it all in code _if_ the tooling allows it. With ~2020 it feels like the tooling is getting to that point.')
