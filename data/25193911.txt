We are mapping two functions to a function in the same domain.<p>Convolution is neither a valid example of an inner product or an outer product. No basic geometric operation on vectors has the correct type signature and axioms for convolution to be interpreted as a generalized &quot;x&quot;. What we&#x27;d be looking for is a billinear mapping of vectors to vectors, and complex number style multiplication in R^2, or cross product multiplication in R^3 or R^7 are the only real candidates in that category unless we start interpreting functions as matrices.')
