Giving people a voice means that good and bad (depending on anyone&#x27;s personal view) voices are amplified. Hate is strong and it takes time for people to &quot;have enough&quot;, only then do cooler heads prevail.<p>The main issue is the ability to amplify and spread so easily. Social media is built upon addiction because addicted people view more ads. How different would social media look with just a few changes like no ability to repost&#x2F;retweet&#x2F;copy&amp;paste&#x2F;etc and what if you never saw who liked a post and what if you weren&#x27;t show things that your networked liked? These things are what creates the echo chamber. People are lazy. Most wouldn&#x27;t take the time to gather information and create original posts.<p>I think privacy is another issue. We should always have some expectations of privacy. Regardless of which party you favor, what if the government bans your way of thinking? The ability to share a counter message is crucial to any stable system. If there is only ever one message, all is lost and you see things like North Korea.<p>I think there are ways to do communications applications that are freedom empowering and not subject to a central authority. The question comes down to support. Will people pay for that or use the free ones that abuse them with ads and manufactured outrage? I&#x27;m curious on what your product vision is, could you give an elevator pitch?')
