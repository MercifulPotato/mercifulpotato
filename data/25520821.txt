Because that is what I do in the beginning of the interviews I lead, I dislike the approach &quot;let&#x27;s slap this guy and see if she calls her mother&quot;. It puts the interviewer on the throne and the candidate of their knees, it is an interview and not the &quot;real&quot; job, and the candidate may have studied for months and might be rightfully defensive when they see their months of work go up in smoke after your &quot;slap&quot;.')
