Item(by='matkoniecz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609669405, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25618205, text='+1 there is plenty of things that are tagged quite poorly in OSM, but are likely to be used if data quality is better (like say kosher status of some food places that can be usefully tagged - this quest just appeared in StreetComplete, disabled by default. You can enable it if you want to record such info in your area).')
