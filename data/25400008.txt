However, the biggest challenge has been reliability.<p>For example, a service provider will have a 5H outage without any clear indication about what&#x27;s going on or when it will get resolved. This leaves us in a difficult position to raise an incident with an unknown ETA where we can do nothing but wait. Then when it&#x27;s all resolved, we either don&#x27;t get a post-mortem or a hand-wavy one.<p>Or a service provider will lose data, which may have been minor to them but critical to our operations. And all we get from them is an &quot;oopsie!&quot;<p>So over time, we&#x27;ve ended up insourcing mission critical pieces (within reason) since we can engineer solutions with guarantees that are inline with customer expectations and our own targets.<p>Separately, in some cases, buying and integrating turned out to be a ton more work than what building in house would have been. Because when we build in house, it can be built to meet our full requirements in the first place.. whereas when buying, we may find ourselves working around limitations in the APIs provided to us.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enchant.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.enchant.com</a> - shared inboxes, knowledge bases, live chat')
