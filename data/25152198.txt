I have YT premium so won&#x27;t see any changes but it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d advocate signing up for at this point. I&#x27;m locked into like 2013 pricing and am not touching YT Music.<p>This is definitely a Google push that will change the platform, I think. RoosterTeeth founders have pushed the whole &quot;your content, your site, your store&#x2F;etc&quot; for a decade at least and though FloatPlane might be a capable rival as it builds more creators I think that is still true. You need to own your own distribution methods even if YT or another site is primarily where your views come from but that takes resources away from creating your primary content. Hard to do for a solo creator.')
