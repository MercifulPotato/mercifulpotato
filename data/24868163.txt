The waves are a fraction of the size of those in the Atlantic. If &#x27;waves were roads&#x27; then you would need a four wheel drive equivalent of the &#x27;sea monster&#x27; to make it an &#x27;ocean monster&#x27;. Ground effect isn&#x27;t ground effect in quite the same way if you have to fly 50m above the water instead of 5m.<p>The other reason is that the Soviet Union did not have any realistic ambitions to invade the United States. Their thinking was much more defensive than Western Cold War thinkers were allowing their paranoia to believe.')
