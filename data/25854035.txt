This seems to be the general pattern of every culture on Earth - Europeans, Native Americans, Africans, etc.<p>In fact, if there&#x27;s a main point one should derive from the Native Americans&#x27; story, it&#x27;d include being very wary of welcoming foreign peoples onto your lands, even if it&#x27;s just for trade. Diversity did NOT make the Lakota stronger (especially when it carried Smallpox, liquor, etc).')
