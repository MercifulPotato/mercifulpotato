More abstractly, deleting a day of memories is still pretty close to a form of death. You better believe I&#x27;d feel weird if you restored me from a day-old backup. There is a version of me that died, and I never get to remember that day of experiences. Your dismissal of the possibility of killing an AI only applies in a small slice of possible scenarios. Your first argument is a lot stronger.')
