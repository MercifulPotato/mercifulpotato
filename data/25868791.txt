And since I&#x27;m a researcher rather than an engineer I&#x27;m also not forced to get on the threadmill. But like I said, I do see some value in using Docker as a tool to let a bunch of researchers run wild as semi-trusted superusers (by &quot;semi-trusted&quot; I mean we can be trusted not to purposefully do evil, but not trusted not to accidentlaly step on each others&#x27; fet).
