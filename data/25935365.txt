Like jaw dropping on a nearly daily basis insane.  Lots of Americans just don&#x27;t realise how much they&#x27;re being screwed by the system that has been built, and they buy in the narrative they constantly get told about it being the best health care system in the world, and that coming with a cost.<p>Note: few people will pay that $225.  Most of that gets handled by your health insurance, who will often also have bulk purchasing deals with medical companies that helps drive down the cost to them.  You do have a co-pay to cover, plus a little extra, so it&#x27;s still more expensive than you&#x27;d pay in the UK for medicine.')
