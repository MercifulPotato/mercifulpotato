It certainly <i>feels</i> impossible but I know rationally that it isn&#x27;t. That being said, bridging the rational knowing vs the emotional feeling is always a challenge, especially with behaviors that are compulsive.<p>&gt; <i>One other thing worth mentioning is that you might be beating yourself up for not being productive in your spare time, which is particularly self defeating since the feeling of guilt will lead to more of the avoidance behavior</i><p>It&#x27;s interesting that you mention this because I do carry a lot of guilt when I&#x27;m not working or learning something, which definitely tends to exacerbate the avoidant behavior and make me more likely to engage in it. I have a very hard time accepting that something like watching a movie, reading a (non-work) book, or playing a video game is &quot;worthwhile&quot;, because it feels like it&#x27;s not &quot;productive&quot;. It&#x27;s something I&#x27;m definitely working on, however.')
