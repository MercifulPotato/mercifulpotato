Sitting down and dreaming up ideas is pretty idealistic but it generally doesn&#x27;t result in successful products.  Even things like the automobile were an evolution type product, not a from scratch thought process.  So you need to be out experiencing life, talking to people and finding pain points that have a market to sell into. Write down those things over time, take the ones that look promising and go deeper and talk to people about them, explore what type of market might exist and then you settle on ideas.<p>In my notes I have more ideas then time now cause everywhere I go I see things that could be solved.  Just many of them are not worth enough to do as a business, others that are worth it require significant capital (so more due diligence to explore there) and still others I am exploring myself deeper all the time.  But you&#x27;ll find when you stop trying to dream up fancy new ideas and start looking at processes and pains \n around you and in other peoples lives, businesses etc you&#x27;ll find an unlimited supply of ideas.  Some of those ideas are incremental, others are transformative and either can be lucrative and fun.')
