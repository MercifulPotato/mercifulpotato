Collision attacks are fatal to Bitcoin, because they can make it impossible to achieve consensus over what is the valid version of the blockchain data. If you get advanced warning, transition is possible with some caveats. But hoping for advanced warning is risky when money is on the line (collision attacks can even be used to steal money in certain scenarios, eg with certain ways of doing multisig).<p>&gt; because bitcoin didn&#x27;t used a brute-force resistant hash function<p>That&#x27;s really a topic in of itself.
