And yes, how cellular state machines work is clearly different than how a computer state machines work, they have a surprising (to me) lot in common. If you are interested in these comparisons I can recommend two books, one is Feynman&#x27;s &quot;Lectures on Computation&quot; which discuss computation (and programming) in a very generalized way, and Nick Lane&#x27;s &quot;The Vital Question&quot; which looks at the origins of life and discusses the evolution of multicellular organisms in a very approachable way.')
