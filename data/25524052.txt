A suspension of common sense is certainly important sometimes, because common sense can lead you astray, but at other times it will save you a lot of time and mental energy.  A classic example from antiquity is Zeno&#x27;s paradoxes of motion.  It was not immediately clear to people trying to rationalize about these &#x27;paradoxes&#x27; how they could be resolved.  But somebody who is slightly less in love with their own rationality, who trusts their own common sense, would not waste their time wondering about a supposed paradox that can be refuted by standing up and walking around the room.  Failing to balance rationalism with common sense can get you stuck in solipsist traps or worse.')
