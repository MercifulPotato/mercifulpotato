Their exact needs seem to be making laptops... and so these chips would make interesting candidates for other laptops, if split off from Apple.<p>It&#x27;s never going to happen, and an independent company might struggle for R&amp;D money, but if these prove to be better laptop CPUs there is a market there.')
