Decades of programming experience from kernel hacking to 3d engines and distributed systems.<p>After a few days reached 60-80 wpm (depending on the typing test). A drop of ca. 20 wpm from my 13&quot; MacBook Pro.<p>Installed a dual booting Ubuntu 20.04 Mate LTS. Comes with all the necessary open source drivers. Make sure to get the pre-baked distro for GPD Pocket 2 from Canonical&#x27;s website. Intel Graphics acceleration works flawlessly as do all the GPU acceleration options in Firefox. Installing Compiz as a compositing manager really speeds everything up.<p>Now use this more often than my Macbook Pro. In fact, the GPD Pocket&#x27;s touchscreen spoiled me and now I keep pressing on normal laptop&#x27;s screens expecting for things to happen :D. GPD&#x27;s substitute for a mouse is incredibly precise, a huge surprise as my expectations were super low for such an unproven solution. Think of it as some sort of capacitive&#x2F;optoelectric Lenovo nub in the corner of the keyboard.<p>Ultimate hackery: The keyboard has a fan on&#x2F;off switch as the Celeron provided has an operating range of up to 100C. So if you don&#x27;t need the highest clock rate, turn off the fan with one key press :D<p>Hoping fellow hackers appreciate this review. Of course, this post is written from my GPD Pocket 2.<p>P.S. Also running Wine, PlayOnLinux, WinUAE and AROS. 8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD make it easy to be cavalier about resource use. Performance wise you&#x27;ll be fines as long as you&#x27;re not compiling large codebases, editing large videos or expecting to raytrace animations in Blender...')
