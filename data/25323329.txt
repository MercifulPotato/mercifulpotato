Item(by='MauranKilom', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607260902, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25322118, text='&quot;I changed this byte in the library to fix the problem&quot; is the ultimate triumph of being in control of your device imo. If your CPU can do a thing, you can (in principle) always find out why it does that thing and make it do something else if you want. It&#x27;s just bytes all the way down.<p>The corollary is that fixing any such problem is <i>only</i> a matter of <i>how efficiently</i> you can do the necessary detective work to narrow down where those important bytes are. Onlookers are often puzzled how you did something that seems impossible to them, but the key is the realization that &quot;it&#x27;s possible&quot; was never in question. It&#x27;s only a matter of finding the path to make your computer do what <i>you</i> want - just like programming.<p>(Yes, there are fundamental limits like CPU bugs, web requests or homeomorphic encryption. Normally one can be quite sure which of these are relevant in the first place though. And of course, you can&#x27;t fix software that is a complete mess in the first place, but working around specific bugs is often practical.)')
