I&#x27;d call that, maybe, &quot;research biomedical science&quot;.<p>I think OP&#x27;s comment is precisely that the practice of medicine has very little to do with what top-quality research would prescribe, and is more like medieval reasoning (like causes like, etc.).<p>Of course the reason behind this is that we dont have much top-quality research; and what &quot;research&quot; we often have is poorly executed and ambiguous (if honest).<p>What we &quot;need&quot; is 10k &quot;disposable humans&quot; manufactured on-demand, for 100k RCT experiments. What we have is often much closer to astrology.')
