But as you imply, our world is far from perfect. Many scientific facts require heavy training and&#x2F;or expensive equipment to verify that most people just don&#x27;t have. But the cool thing is that IF you did have the skills and gear (and patience, free time, assistants, etc.), you absolutely can image a virus particle, or measure the mass of an electron (not all that complicated, it turns out!), or take your own observations of the motion of the planets and re-derive Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion.<p>&gt; My point is that no one is personally verifying science. On an individual level we cannot be sure that these are not stories and hearsay.<p>You should hang out with more scientists. It turns out they count as &quot;someone&quot;!<p>&gt; Science, as we do it, ie based on trust and without personal verification, is absolutely equivalent to religion. A comforting, explanatory story is provided and we believe we &#x27;know&#x27; what is happening. Scientists are our priests and we take their pronouncements as gospel, without questioning them.<p>This is a grossly false equivalency. The thing with any scientific claim is that you <i>could</i> independently verify it; in practice, verifying modern scientific claims tends to cost tons of time and money, but nothing in principle prevents you.')
