Item(by='acover', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608704171, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25514494, text='&gt; With data from 25 OECD countries over 15 years from 2000 to 2014, we find that a higher minimum wage decreases labor demand but does not affect labor supply. Our empirical results also suggest that relatively modest increases in minimum wages have limited impacts on employment. On average, 10 percent increase in the minimum wage decreases employment by 0.7 percent, thereby increasing unemployment rate by 0.64 percent.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ns1.6thsigmahosting.com&#x2F;pms&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;jrge&#x2F;article&#x2F;view&#x2F;5227" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ns1.6thsigmahosting.com&#x2F;pms&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;jrge&#x2F;article&#x2F;v...</a><p>This is just one paper, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a fact.')
