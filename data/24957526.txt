Like instead of &quot;ssh 10.0.0.1&quot; I have to now do &quot;ssh -6 ::&#x2F;&#x2F;::2001:db8:ffff:abcd::34ff:2e6f::49af:fdef::&quot;? Fuck that.<p>The simple fact that I can&#x27;t memorize IPv6 addresses makes me lazy to use it. Whenever I want to SSH into a machine in 5 seconds flat I just rattle off its IPv4 address and I&#x27;m in.')
