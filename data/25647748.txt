Google are involved in stuff they shouldn&#x27;t be involved in, access to an e-mail account should not be proof of identity.<p>Incidentally, in my country, there is a government-mandated (everyone has it) single sign-on solution that companies can use if they want to really know who someone is. The implementation isn&#x27;t perfect and unfortunately they&#x27;re starting to nudge people into using an app (that can only come from an app store, creating a sort of catch-22) instead of one-time pads, and there&#x27;s a lot to complain about there. But I think the principle is completely reasonable, that just like we have passports, birth certificates etc., governments absolutely need to enter the digital era and provide modern forms of identity services. This is yet another area where everything moving to the internet has led to privatization through the back door, and I fear the world where some American company can turn me into a digital unperson much more than one in which my government can.')
