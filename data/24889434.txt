A biologist (Kerr) was trying to either improve the heat-resistance of european honeybees or gentle the african bees and amplify their productivity.<p>A fuckup led to the release of several of swarms of african bees which went on to crossbreed with local european honeybees, so africanised honeybees were not actually a human creation.<p>The result turned out to mostly take from their african ancestry: highly defensive, fast reproduction, readily swarming (or even absconding), way less picky about their nesting sites, â€¦ leading to high invasiveness.<p>AFAIK africanised honeybees are no worse than their african ancestors (though I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;re any better).')
