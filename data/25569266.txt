The architecture was of course outdated and needed to be scrapped (no protected memory, cooperative concurrency, etc). But what I miss is that the OS directory was meant to be accessible and modified by end users. To install a driver, all you had to do was to drag and drop the driver extension onto the extension folder and reboot, and the opposite to uninstall it. No complex command lines, things left behind that still affect the OS. You could do the same with application settings, fonts, etc.<p>This simplicity and accessibility of the internals of the OS is what I miss (and I moved to Windows when OSX scrapped that).')
