What I noticed in the last ones is that switching CPU manufacturer is easy, since you switch cpu+motherboard and never expect to be able to upgrade (3 years later you want a new motherboard anyway even if you could theoretically upgrade).<p>But what creates inertia is my big expensive G-Sync screen which ties me to Nvidia. My monitor is the only expensive piece of hardware that survives between machines. And that&#x27;s the genius of Nvidia&#x27;s proprietary sync solution: So long as the cards are anywhere close, I&#x27;d of course choose the one that doesn&#x27;t force me to switch screens. So far it has luckily not been an issue since AMD haven&#x27;t upset Nvidia nearly in the way they upset intel. So Now I&#x27;m running a Ryzen and an RTX in the latest build.')
