But I&#x27;m skeptical of this comment mainly because your sources are youtube videos. Which of course doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean they&#x27;re wrong, but I wanted to go over some of the people behind these. Some of them (e.g. Dr. Steve Phinney) seem like area experts, some I wasn&#x27;t able to verify credentials of (e.g. Dr. Mary Newport) and some seem to have controversial (and possibly fringe?) opinions regarding nutritional science (i.e. Jordan Peterson, who is a psychologist not a medical expert).<p>So may I please ask experts chime in here, how reliable information in this comment? What are some papers one can read on this issue? [1]<p>[1] Except obviously OP. But OP is from 2016, and if this is understood, I expect there to be more papers on this? Also the relationship between parent comment and OP paper isn&#x27;t clear to me, so maybe an expert can explain whether the parallel is justifiable.')
