It&#x27;s based on near-identical technology to Bandai&#x27;s &quot;Tamagotchi&quot; virtual pet though Digimon was marketed mostly towards at boys and Tamagotchi was marketed mostly towards girls.<p>It&#x27;s from the same era as the Game Boy Color and has some interesting features (serial communications between devices, and the infamous &quot;tab cheat&quot; that momentarily disconnecting the battery with a plastic tab to randomize the memory contents).<p>Interesting how Pokemon is widely emulated, but nobody ever bothered with Digimon. There has been multiple generations of Digivice hardware, so best start at the original.<p>I&#x27;d like to see somebody take on the reverse-engineering challenge. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s even a ROM dump yet.<p>They&#x27;ve actually started selling new stock recently (20th Anniversary Digivice), including at retail stores for around $30 each.')
