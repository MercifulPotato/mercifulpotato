Then abuse and overuse. Disillusionment. Decline. At some point people will finally figure out what OOP is all about by looking up decades&#x27; old works and youtube videos (if youtube is still available) and hopefully will learn to integrate it.<p><i></i>*<p>A discussion with a dev recently when I started refactoring his PR with him and started pulling business logic from services into model.<p>Dev: &quot;NOOO!!! You can&#x27;t do this!!!&quot;<p>Me: &quot;But why?&quot;<p>&quot;You can&#x27;t put code in model. Model is for fields and getters and setters only and business logic belongs in business services&quot;<p>Me: &quot;Why?&quot;<p>Dev: blank stare... (imagined, this was over zoom)<p>Me: &quot;So... why do you bother with having fields private if you plan to have public getters and setters for everything?&quot;<p>Dev: blank stare<p>Me: &quot;Isn&#x27;t object oriented programming about having logic alongside the data rather than separate? Isn&#x27;t it about modeling operations that act on the data to limit exposure to internal state?&quot;<p>Dev: blank stare<p>Me: sigh...')
