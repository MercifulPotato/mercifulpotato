Do you remember the phrase &#x27;mostly peaceful protesters&#x27;?  We&#x27;ve been hearing it for 8+ months after violent riots in major cities which resulted in 30+deaths, hundreds of innocent people attacked, and 1 billion+ in property damage.<p>&quot;There are wrong opinions, and then there is “six million Jews were not enough” and “hang the Vice President”, and a violent mob attacking the Capitol. No one is under any obligation to tolerate such actions in a civil society.&quot;<p>Antifa and BLM have taken over multiple state and federal buildings over the past 8 months.  In June, for instance, multiple fires were set all over DC.  A church was nearly burnt to the ground and the President had to go to an underground bunker as a result of the threats outside the white house.<p>Unlike the protests in January 6th (which was an unorganized mess of random people), BLM and Antifa are professional rioters&#x2F;criminals.  They wear masks to protect themselves and have corporate backing from large left-leaning organizations.<p>Instead of concern, local leaders painted BLM and named a major street after them.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you only seem to care when it&#x27;s Trump supporters.  Political violence is wrong on both sides, but only one political not only supported it, but paid the bail of rioters and continue to deny that it even exists.  The real criminals are about to get into office.<p>&quot;If I advocate for your murder, am I just expressing an opinion that should be consequence free if someone kills you? Does that change if enough people agree with me that you should be killed?&quot;<p>You do realize Trump never said any of this, right?   Him and his entire campaign have denounced the violence repeatedly.  If you listened to the speech before the capitol was attacked, it was not full of any sort of energy.  He basically said that it was all in Pence&#x27;s hands.  Supporters were actually angry because he sounded so defeated.  This doesn&#x27;t sound like the actions of someone trying to storm the Capitol.<p>The media+tech companies+incoming administration are censoring and destroying their political opponents for things they themselves have been supporting and instigating for 4 years.<p>If it wasn&#x27;t so scary, I would call it pathetic actions from limp-dick journalists.')
