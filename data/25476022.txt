Roll your own.  But at least in this case, you&#x27;re dealing with your own issues, with things not hidden and abstracted away, and at literally 1&#x2F;100th to 1&#x2F;10000th the cost of AWS.<p>And yes, that&#x27;s with the hardware investment and wage costs rolled in.<p>I feel like AWS and others created some sort of one ring, and just reeled admins in, pulling them from the wild, so that with a shortage of greybeards, people can&#x27;t find those with the &#x27;sysadmin temperament&#x27;, and are therefore stuck with cloud.<p>And it is indeed a specific temperament, to create stability, which means creating <i>some</i> constraint, yet to forge that constraint in the most effective way, whilst doing one&#x27;s best to enable devs to work most effectively.<p>AWS has constraints, but because it&#x27;s a wall of &quot;this is the way external corp does it&quot;, it gets far less flack than the guy that smells like onions, when he says &quot;we can&#x27;t do this safely&quot; or &quot;this policy must be followed&quot;.<p>Yes, OK, this is a bit of a rant.  Sorry.')
