The reason people buy into ecosystems is so there&#x27;s a single entity that is weighing and making decisions about what creates the best user experience, which necessarily means having control over the roadmap of standards and interfaces.<p>Even if we were designing the perfect tech ecosystem that was free of business or competitive constraints, it still wouldn&#x27;t be a good idea to have an app developer, with their own motivations that may not be aligned to users, dictate SDKs and standards to ecosystems or platforms. It&#x27;s a weird and unsustainable power dynamic that misaligns incentives. It&#x27;d only be viable if in the process the app developer opened the standard and shared control of its future.<p>As much as Spotify wants to be a platform, what they offer is just a service, and they&#x27;re not positioned to be controlling such standards. I love Spotify and much prefer it to Apple Music, but what they&#x27;re doing is choosing not to build features that their customers want on platforms their customers have chosen in order to gain leverage in the regulatory battle over the 30% cut. I respect the desire to have a more level playing field but their other complaints are disingenuous and are not in the best interest of their customers.')
