I’d bet dollars to doughnuts your laptop can&#x27;t play fullscreen, 4k&#x2F;60fps video for 20 hours using only the battery:<p><i>In fullscreen 4k&#x2F;60 video playback, the M1 fares even better, clocking an easy 20 hours with fixed 50% brightness. On an earlier test, I left the auto-adjust on and it crossed the 24 hour mark easily. Yeah, a full day. That’s an iOS-like milestone.</i><p>Another one:\n<i>Just 17% of the battery to output an 81GB 8k render.</i><p>These are just a couple of highlights from the article &quot;Yeah, Apple’s M1 MacBook Pro is powerful, but it’s the battery life that will blow you away&quot;: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;17&#x2F;yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro-is-powerful-but-its-the-battery-life-that-will-blow-you-away&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;techcrunch.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;17&#x2F;yeah-apples-m1-macbook-pro...</a><p>You have to look at the totality of the what&#x27;s going on.<p>In short, the M1 Macs are right up there with the fastest machines available at reasonable prices and at a fraction of the power consumption.<p>The machines set a new level of performance per watt and there&#x27;s no disputing that. That&#x27;s pretty good for their first attempt at Apple Silicon Macs.')
