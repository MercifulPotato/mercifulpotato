When people feel that something so close to them is in question, they often lose sight of reason and argue instead from an emotional perspective.<p>I think this document does a good job describing ways that people who want to can have a fact-based, clarifying discussion. \nBut in cases where I and my interlocutor both have the curiosity, openness of mind and desire to come to a better understanding ... I don&#x27;t think we need this document to have a productive debate, and it might not even feel like a debate, but rather a conversation.<p>People have vitriolic debates because they feel threatened, marginalized, attacked -- and then their goal is to defend themselves. We have ugly fights because we don&#x27;t want a richer understanding in that moment. And for issues in which no one feels at risk, I think people tend to have either useful conversations, or none at all due to lack of interest.<p>If a colleague and I, neither of whom have put a lot of work into any specific approach to building compilers for functional languages enter into a conversation about the relative merits of compiling with continuations versus administrative normal form, either we can have a good nerdy time, or one of us leaves bored.<p>If I, a renter in a rent-controlled apartment, and a family member who is a landlord have a conversation about rent control, property taxes, the mortgage interest deduction, and the policies which have benefitted each of us, we can both feel attacked and defensive even if neither actively wishes the other ill, even though both of those groupings are potentially temporary states which apply to us. The goal becomes not just to better understand, but to walk away feeling ok about your life. Am I a parasite for paying below market rate? Is he a villain for being subsidized by his less wealthy tenants?\nOnce the stakes involve how you live your life, or how you view yourself, it&#x27;s hard to keep wanting it to be a collaborative and open-minded exploration.')
