This pattern was actually preferred because it kept the nuance of the image file structure visible within the function.  Yes, it&#x27;s heavy handed now...  but back then it was useful to know the &quot;blocks&quot; and &quot;strides&quot; of images when you had to make pixel-perfect changes and didn&#x27;t have higher-level supporting code.<p>Could they have abstracted MakeMegaTexture_f into something that built up leaves of tga structs they interweave in that function? Or just chunk through them with the tga data structure.  Our standards for what is <i>good</i> code has changed with our understanding of code.')
