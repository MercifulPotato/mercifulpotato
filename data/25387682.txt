Item(by='Jtsummers', descendants=None, kids=[25388118], score=None, time=1607704963, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25387185, text='You can do it without hash tables.<p>If you&#x27;re able to create a graph structure with references&#x2F;access&#x2F;pointer types or whatever COBOL uses you can have records with contents similar to:<p><pre><code>  record Bag:\n    string : Description\n    array of Bag Pointer : Children\n    array of Integer : Count\n</code></pre>\nWhere the indexes into the two arrays correlate. Since, as you parse, you don&#x27;t <i>know</i> where the children may be, you can use an array to store the bags as you read them in. And in a second pass construct the graph proper. You may also want a set of pointers up to the bags containing a bag, but it&#x27;s not, strictly, needed.<p>If I were doing this year&#x27;s in C, I&#x27;d have done something like that since it, also, doesn&#x27;t have a built-in hash table&#x2F;dictionary.')
