If it wants to do something courts keep blocking it can dissolve those courts and then they can&#x27;t block it.<p>For example the UK&#x27;s Supreme Court is I would argue in most practical ways far more independent than the more famous Supreme Court of the United States, its judges are not appointed based on partisan loyalty or selected to achieve some naked political goal bypassing the legislature, they&#x27;re just independent judges from roughly the same process that creates other judges in the UK&#x27;s courts. But - in this one way they&#x27;re far less independent than the SCOTUS, the Congress cannot abolish SCOTUS, but Parliament created and could in principle destroy the UK Supreme Court.<p>Would they have the guts to do that? Realistically no. Their constituents would I think be pretty unhappy about that. But in principle it is technically possible.')
