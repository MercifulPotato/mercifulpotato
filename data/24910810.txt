Item(by='deanclatworthy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603826411, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24906682, text='&gt; People dislike Facebook and other centralized platforms not because they&#x27;re centralized per-se, but because the user experience is terrible<p>I&#x27;m not sure I agree here. My anecdote is that the experience of Facebook events is superb. People are prompted to fill in pretty good basic information, can discuss arrangements on the &quot;wall&quot;, and I&#x27;m reminded about my attendance before the event multiple times. The invites also come into a place where I already spend a fair bit of time. I don&#x27;t know anyone who makes events outside of Facebook within my circle of friends.<p>&gt; This reads like a tech demo where the tech and decentralization is the selling point, but the truth is, the masses don&#x27;t know&#x2F;care about that and rightfully so. The same applies to Mastodon and similar projects.<p>I agree with this. Until the mainstream narrative realises that giving away all of our personal info is a faux pas, engaging with platforms like this is limited to activists and those who have an incentive for privacy.')
