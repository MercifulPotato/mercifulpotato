Sizing work so that it&#x27;s big enough to be of some value delivered to your users is a great way to actually getting your team thinking about the big picture and the impact they&#x27;re having and to encourage your team members to work together on delivering that value.<p>You don&#x27;t need to slice and dice stuff into tiny tasks. You don&#x27;t need a manager handing these tasks out to team members. You can have teams that self organize and have a laser focus on the impact they deliver.<p>I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m quite biased as I&#x27;m the founder of a startup [0] that builds a product management tool that encourages teams to have larger work items where they can capture a whole &quot;unit&quot; of value delivered to users. Teams use our work items to write a lot, attach designs, code snippets, etc. When they need to break down stuff, just add a todo list in the work item. We also don&#x27;t have a notion of single assignees, but instead allow groups of users to be set as the team for a work item.
