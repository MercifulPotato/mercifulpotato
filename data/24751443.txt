I&#x27;m totally not saying that the right point on the velocity&#x2F;quality spectrum is always right over at the quality end (or even that those two choices are fundamentally orthogonal), and by using the phrase &quot;an acceptable level of risk&quot; you&#x27;re demonstrating you&#x27;re the sort of developer that understands there _is_ risk. And I&#x27;d assume that means you&#x27;d have pushed back if someone had instead &quot;and this PDF generator needs to run on the same servers and have access to the databases with all our PII and financial information on them&quot;.<p>I spend a lot of time talking to &quot;full stack developers&quot; who came out of graphic design into front end web dev and then fell into nodejs backend dev, who&#x27;s only &quot;architecture&quot; course was about drawing buildings and who&#x27;s main complaints about security requirements are that bars across windows look ugly. A startlingly large number of them don&#x27;t even know there are things they don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;d say fewer than half of them could tell you what OWASP was, and fewer than 10%  of them could tell you what SQLi or XSS was, and whether their sites need to consider them as attack vectors. Most of them just say &quot;I use $frameworkDeJour, it handles all the security stuff!&quot;<p>(BTW, last time I needed to supply dynamic PDFs in a web app, one of the good fullstack-via-FE-and-graphic-design devs build the PDF generation in the browser (using some random js&#x2F;pdf library) so we could just feed it JSON from the backend. Made me sleep better at night doing it that way...)')
