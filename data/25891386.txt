This use of the word &quot;chemical&quot; seems to be a thought-terminating clich√© of sorts and I would argue it is precisely what leads to overreaction in cases such as dihydrogen monoxide.<p>People learn to associate &quot;chemical&quot; with &quot;bad&quot; and a certain class of &quot;chemical-sounding&quot; names with &quot;chemical&quot;. It would be better if the lay knowledge and perception of chemicals was more nuanced, so that it is realized that chemicals are <i>not</i> bad due to their membership in this category, but for other, more complex reasons.<p>There are bad chemicals and there are good chemicals, and there is no shortcut to knowing which is which other than putting effort into understanding the mechanisms.<p>I think penalising this usage of the word &quot;chemical&quot; might further this goal.')
