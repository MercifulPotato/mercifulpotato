I prefer the brevity and clarity of the shorter licenses, personally. I&#x27;ve also found that, sometimes, if there are two similar projects with a BSD vs GPL split, the BSD project tends to be more pragmatic and focused on the product&#x2F;code more, while GPL projects err towards ideology, possibly at the cost of functionality. OpenSSH vs lsh as an example.')
