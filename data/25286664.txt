The former is an effective teacher which viscerally reveals crucial insights, while the latter is pedagogically almost useless; using an electronic calculator to solve problems consists of nothing beyond punching keys and looking at the result, given as a disembodied string of digits entirely out of any context. The slide rule probably even ends up slightly more efficient for the type of problems students typically see in high school, after a bit of practice. Precision is more than sufficient.<p>Any assigned problem which needs a calculator would be more effective if the calculator were removed and the numbers involved were simplified to the point students could manage them mentally or with a trivial amount of scratch work.<p>Where electronic computers really shine is in their programmability, and for that students should be working with a full programming language and a real keyboard.')
