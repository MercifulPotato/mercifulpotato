Item(by='jacobolus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606982475, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25285619, text='&gt; <i>given the choice in examinations between log-tables, slide-rule, or calculator, we all made the same choice</i><p>Students would benefit greatly if given a slide rule instead of an electronic calculator for their exams. The former is an effective teacher which viscerally reveals crucial insights, while the latter is pedagogically almost useless; using an electronic calculator to solve problems consists of nothing beyond punching keys and looking at the result, given as a disembodied string of digits entirely out of any context.<p>The slide rule probably even ends up slightly more efficient for the type of problems students typically see in high school, after a bit of practice.<p>Where electronic computers really shine is in their programmability, and for that students should be working with a full programming language and a real keyboard.')
