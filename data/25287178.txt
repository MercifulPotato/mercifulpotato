It&#x27;s such a huge pile of templates referencing each other and exceptions being used to control the command flow, that I was once hired as a freelancer just to link the whole thing into a static library, because the company using it was unwilling to deal with the source code, but needed it for FIPS compliance.<p>It&#x27;s an incredible engineering feat that they managed to let you mix and match cryptographic functions and containers and storage formats as you see fit, but having a C++ stack trace with 5 abstract templates in it makes it very painful to debug if stuff goes wrong.')
