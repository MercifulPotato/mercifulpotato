I&#x27;m from a former Soviet Union country and grew up after its collapse. Perhaps the (relative to the US) poverty we had ended up being treated differently from the poverty that&#x27;s in the US? Eg we were poor enough that fast food wasn&#x27;t abundantly available. Maybe once we&#x27;re as rich as the US is right now we will have the same problem as the US does with poverty and fast food.<p>That being said, shen people are really poor they still get by. They will find a way. 200 years ago almost everyone (excluding nobility) lived on about $2-3 a day in 1990s money. That&#x27;s like two coffees at a coffee shop. People just lived differently and usually worse lives. Also, coffee shops weren&#x27;t really a thing here until about the last decade or so. You could buy coffee at gas stations, but there weren&#x27;t these fancy coffee shops.')
