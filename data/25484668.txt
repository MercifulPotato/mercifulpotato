And doesn&#x27;t this also put an shade on your original argument that it is &quot;the will. A culture change is needed&quot;?<p>I haven&#x27;t worked for 20 years but I work in certain automation, and from what I&#x27;ve deduced it is rather that the V in (100-V)% is quite high, <i>and then there&#x27;s</i> W = a x V (a is an positive constant) that specify required labour, specialization &amp; investment for automation; which is almost always lower in supply than &quot;voluntary work available&quot;.')
