When I switched from Linux to Windows, it was partly due to outside pressure and partly due to a desire to help team members in India who did not have that special deal and were thus forced to use Windows.  But a couple of years later, the special deal evaporated and everyone had to move to Windows...<p>I suspect that it is still common to be forced to use Windows at $BIGCO.')
