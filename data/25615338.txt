I live in a rather cold part of Canada.  My apartment block has AC outlets for each parking spot.  So too does my work, and all local hotels.  These are meant to power block heaters, something that doesn&#x27;t really exist in the UK, but in recent years some people have been using them to charge their EV&#x2F;hybrids.  The charging rates are very low but the ubiquity of the outlets make them relevant.  Having very small&#x2F;cheap charging points on literally every parking spot might be the better approach than a few dedicated high capacity &quot;charge bays&quot;.  These outlets are dirt cheap to install.  No IP issues, no electronics, no networks.  Just an outlet and a circuit breaker.<p>(These are also all free to use. Administering a payment system for each outlet would cost more than the power.)')
