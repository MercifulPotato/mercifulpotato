Item(by='Jtsummers', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604101864, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24947568, text='I will agree, Backus&#x27; ideas have panned out in many ways. Not having read his lecture in quite a while I can&#x27;t comment on whether or not, in 1977, he was overselling the idea at the time, especially as I&#x27;m not familiar with the state of the art in research at the time (having been born 5 years later, and CS concepts not being taught in chronological order).<p>Regardless, your original comment made two absurd claims:<p>1. Dijkstra attacked the paper that inspired Haskell and everything else that currently exists in FP. <i>He tried to destroy it.</i> [emphasis added]<p>Which is what my quote of Dijkstra&#x27;s actual statements was meant to rebut. He did <i>not</i> try to destroy it. He criticized it, and some of his criticism may have been wrong then, and I&#x27;d say is wrong now (with greater understanding of the ideas Backus was presenting), but he did <i>not</i> try to destroy it.<p>2. He should be a footnote in history.<p>Another absurd position. Because of one response (and if you wanted to you can probably find a number of others) exaggerated beyond reason (&quot;He tried to destroy it.&quot;), you want to dismiss some 50 years of work.')
