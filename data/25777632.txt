My gross salary is after the pension is deduced. The gross includes my kids university costs, but they are deduced as taxes so don&#x27;t show up on the net. \nAn american deduces the kids university costs from his <i>net</i> salary (and there could be more, e.g. pensions).<p>Comparing pay as a simple number &quot;gross pay&quot; is extremely difficult. Comparing net pay purchasing power or similar after necessary expenses including savings (and kids university) is probably more accurate.')
