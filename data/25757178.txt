Trump starts flame wars for self-promotion and profit and YouTube doesn’t see adequate compensation for their costs. They could stand to have less abusive speech and more money in their pocket. YouTube has a very wide moat trenched around them and so they don’t have to cater to niches to maximize their profits.')
