In this very form I&#x27;m typing in, all the clickable elements (hyperlinks and submit button) are flat, but different styles immediately distinguish them from non-clickable elements, <i>even if these styles vary between web pages and browsers</i>. It&#x27;s never been the case that GUIs consistently used 3D appearances to denote clickable widgets. 3D elements add a lot of visual clutter for complicated interfaces, which is why those &quot;flat UI sucks&quot; posts only show &lt;10 GUI elements side-by-side. Google &quot;Word 95&quot; and &quot;Word 98,&quot; both have a flat menu bar, though Word 98 has the addition of flat toolbars which helps readability.')
