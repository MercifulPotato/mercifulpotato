About 1.5 years of that was working after hours, then about 10 months or so of 6 hours at my day job and 2 hours in my company, then just recently I quit my job with about a years worth of savings and am full time in the company.<p>The risk I took, until recently at least, was almost nothing, since I had a job all along and was actually saving money at a quick pace.<p>You too can start a company without going bankrupt with a bit of planning and a bit of frugality.<p>nb. I&#x27;m counting my project as a success if it brings me &gt;= 1x median wage on the side, which is a low bar. Also, I am not rich.')
