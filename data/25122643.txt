It&#x27;s fantastic and native-speed when you do things right<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;geokon-gh&#x2F;corascope&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;geokon-gh&#x2F;corascope&#x2F;</a><p>I even managed to make a little SVG backend for it<p>That said - this seems to be more of a &quot; graphics library &quot; while JavaFX is more of a &quot; user interface library &quot;.
