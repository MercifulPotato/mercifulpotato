Apple really nails the &quot;it just works&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m a software engineer, and I&#x27;m happy to get my hands dirty with some code.  But when it comes to my devices, I really don&#x27;t want to waste my time trying to figure out why this or that device, doesn&#x27;t pair with, or work well with, my other device.<p>Apple just does this better than anyone else.<p>I recently got an Apple watch and the setup process was sublime.  Pairing with all my other devices, was effortless.  Instantly my watch was &quot;mine&quot; with everything I need on it.<p>The LTE setup was mostly painless too.  There was a bug in the process that was on Verizon&#x27;s end, but other than that, getting my phone paired to my number was a breeze.<p>The pairing with my phone, and my mac, is what makes this whole ecosystem special.  It just works, and it works pretty damn well.  Yes, you can get most of this functionality on a windows or linux machine, with an android phone, airpod replicas, and an android based smart watch but the fluidity of the apple integration is unmatched.<p>This is what (some) people are willing to pay more for.')
