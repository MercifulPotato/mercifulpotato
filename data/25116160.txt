You walk up to the window, they hand you a small device and send you back to your car. When your device lights up, you go to the pickup window. There is no line at all.<p>I don&#x27;t know how many hundred dollars it cost them to buy a couple dozen devices or how much it costs to wipe each one down and put it back under the infrared&#x2F;anti-cootie lamp each use. But there are orders going out the window about every 2 minutes and no customers within 50 feet of each other.')
