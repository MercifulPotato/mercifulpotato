You think impeaching him again and banning him on multiple platforms is going to de-escalate the situation? You know it will do the exact opposite. The Democrats and media companies want to poke and poke and poke until they provoke a reaction. You&#x27;re delusional if you think you can keep insulting the 74 million Americans who voted for Trump without destabilizing the country. But your brains are so broken by Trump that you can&#x27;t help yourselves and you&#x27;re destroying the country because of it. I didn&#x27;t vote for Trump in 2016 or 2020, but I understand the rage Trump supporters are probably feeling. And I know who is primarily responsible: it&#x27;s the same contemptuous out of touch elites that gave us Trump in the first place.')
