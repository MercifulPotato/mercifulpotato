So so many times I&#x27;ve put the wrong enum value in because it&#x27;s just an int and it matches another set of enums. I&#x27;ve taken to putting each set of enums into a separate file and separate folder just to help the compiler catch this. The project I&#x27;m working on now has about 25 separate enum files+folders. Gagh!')
