The use of the word &#x27;fish&#x27; to describe animals that live in the water predates biologists deciding they&#x27;d redefine the term unilaterally for the rest of society.  The novel Moby Dick explains in detail the difference between whales and true fish, but then calls whales &#x27;fish&#x27; in the rest of the book anyway.<p>If this line of argument doesn&#x27;t work, I point out that in a phylogenetic&#x2F;cladistic nomenclature, all tetrapods are fish and dolphins are tetrapods, therefore dolphins are fish <i>(and so are we.)</i>  Of course in the traditional nomenclature &#x27;fish&#x27; is a paraphyletic group that specifically excludes tetrapods.')
