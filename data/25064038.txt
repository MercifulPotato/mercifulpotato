They&#x27;re not always 1:1. Like &quot;Desktop&quot; for your background&#x2F;icons in an OS. Or &quot;window&quot; for a portion of your screen than an application uses. Or &quot;mouse&quot; because it looks like a mouse. These terms get rolled into use and kinda take on a meaning of their own in the context of computers. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s better examples of words that you&#x27;d never relate to their original meaning, but skimmer seems fine to me for this application.')
