For example, they provide a firmware for the Wyze Cam that turns it into a webcam, which I&#x27;ve been using for online education for the past few months.<p>For the past few days, I&#x27;ve done extensive research on smart watches and fitness bands. I looked into everything, from Apple Watch, Tizen, Pebble, WearOS, Fitbit, PineTime, etc. I haven&#x27;t found anything with such a good value as the Wyze Watch. Some of the hackable nRF52832 based devices (PineTime, Colmi P8) have similar prices, but they have a smaller display, no SPo2 sensor, and you basically have to write your own OS (InfiniTime, WASP-OS, Zephyr, RIOT).<p>I&#x27;m really impressed. I wonder if there&#x27;s a catch.')
