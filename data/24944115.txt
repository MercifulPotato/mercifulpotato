Third parties who achieve 5% of the national vote are eligible for public campaign financing in the subsequent election.  But would this be 5% of the first round votes?  Or 5% of the final round votes?<p>Maine uses IRV, so the first round votes will probably make sense for the purposes of qualifying for public campaign financing.  But if it were a Condorcet-style system you could have strange outcomes where a candidate wins the election, but has less than 5% of 1st place votes and therefore doesn&#x27;t qualify for public campaign financing.')
