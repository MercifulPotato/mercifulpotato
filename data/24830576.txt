Try to log onto a channel, but get presented with a &quot;We&#x27;ve detected something out of the ordinary going on.\nTo continue using Discord&quot; where my only option is to verify by phone, which I don&#x27;t want to do.<p>2. Occasionally, I&#x27;ll figure it&#x27;s worth a try in incognito. I get a step further, only to read &quot;New login location detected, please check your e-mail.&quot;. Go back to non-incognito, check email, open the verify link in an incognito window.<p>3. Instead of finally signing me in, it says &quot;IP address authorized&quot; and &quot;If you followed this link after trying to login on the desktop or mobile app, please go back and try again.&quot;.<p>4. Fair enough, time to log in, again. Submit credentials, get presented with the bizzarely slow fade-in recaptchas. Fail twice, succeed on the third time. Horray! I can see the channel!<p>5.
