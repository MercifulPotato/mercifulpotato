So, if they can get away with linking all of their ad targeting information now, in the early stages, then it won&#x27;t seem weird if they do it later.<p>To be fair to FB, this is exactly what they&#x27;re doing with integrating IG and FB messaging. It&#x27;s just that no one is really complaining about that.<p>Doing this in the middle of an anti-trust investigation seems ... bold, but it is consistent with their financial incentives.')
