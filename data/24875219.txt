One HUGE benefit that YouTube Music has is the available catalog. I like a lot of obscure music and remixes that no one else but YouTube has. I also agree that it&#x27;s ridiculous that YouTube Music doesn&#x27;t have all the features of Google Play Music. Still this was handled much better than most shutdowns where there is no migration path. I&#x27;m glad that Google is combining some redundant services. 5 more years and they might get their chat situation in order.')
