I.e. kmail would never remember that I want my email threads expanded (this example is not real, the kmail devs were very helpful with minimal info in this case). Does this really require I hunt down all this info from all around the place? Sometimes I don&#x27;t even know where to get the info.<p>What helps immensely (and I saw this in the Geyser MC project), the software can produce a snippet with all info the devs want with one command, and it even exports to pastebin taking out sensitive info. If you paste such a link in their Discord it even makes an overview with syntax highlighting in the chat. That really helps a lot on my (bug reporter) side. And thus on the dev side.')
