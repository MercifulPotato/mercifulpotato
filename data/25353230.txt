Mistakes are where we learn and letting engineers make mistakes and recover from them is part of letting engineers grow.”<p>So true. I often pity the young people who are starting now with complete micromanagement by JIRA, Scrum, daily stand up and pull requests. When I started out 30 years ago you could often go away and work on something for a month or more, try out stuff, screw up royally, learn from it and become a better programmer. These days it often feels like an assembly line where every step is optimized but no creativity is allowed. There is no better learning experience than to develop a system and after a few requirements changes to learn that the system was misdesigned. Good programmers will work through that and do better. Bad programmers will just shrug their shoulders.<p>Right now my strategy as a tech lead is to of ask mainly if something is holding people up, act on that quickly and be available for discussions, but otherwise I am trying to hold back and let people do their thing even if I don’t agree. But this takes strong nerves with line managers and project managers breathing down your neck.')
