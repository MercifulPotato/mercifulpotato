I don&#x27;t know FAA mandate but they probably have an altitude cap. All their systems and procedures will not work above a certain zone. We should not put more pressure on them. They have full hands as it is. They should focus on the things they do well.<p>There should be a FSA that FAA coordinates with for the low altitude region of launch, and above that the FSA handles all sorts of space traffic, satellites, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t know anything about this, but probably each launch has to mix between doing their own space window and launch path monitoring, and leaning on some group like NASA. This seems non-ideal. FSA could become the source of this.<p>I don&#x27;t think the coordination would pose a blocking challenge. And I think the scope of the space domain warrants its own agency.')
