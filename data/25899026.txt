So rather than be axed by management, why not propose a wacky wine club promo? This article alone could have saved a couple of people their jobs. And honestly, rightly so. $50k is not a lot in the grand scheme of things for an airline, but it just may patch a hole in the budget of ‘wine division’ of the AA catering subsidiary, or something to that effect. I’m sure it’s a modest coup for someone. I doubt it was dreamt up by the CEO and discussed at board meetings as a way to save the company or anything.')
