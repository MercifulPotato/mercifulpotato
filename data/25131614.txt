It is my default engine and, yes, some results do suck quite consistently.<p>I&#x27;m a bit lazy right now to remember all the problems it has, but some of the most obvious are looking up for news on recent events (especially something small, stuff that doesn&#x27;t appear in reuters and these sorts of media) and trying to find out some basic stuff about local shops and such (of course, I only know about how it feels in my location, not worldwide). On both occasions I pretty much always use &quot;!g ...&quot; right away, because DDG is just clueless about this shit. Google does this just fine (in fact, sometimes it&#x27;s even impressive: there are thousands of cities like mine, yet Google can often tell me where I can buy some stuff I&#x27;d have no idea where to look for).')
