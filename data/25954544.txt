The kind of hand over hand steering people are concerned about is simply irrelevant at highway speeds let alone F1 speeds. Itâ€™s the same reason they need to slow down to corner.<p>Anyway, big rigs have loose steering because they need precision at highway speeds.  The point is to minimize accident risks due to physics rather than any purely mechanical limitation.')
