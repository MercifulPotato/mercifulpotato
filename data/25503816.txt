Imagine you were stretching a rubber band. What&#x27;s in-between two points on that rubber that was stretched? Just rubber, albeit thinner and less dense.<p>In our universe, however, the space that&#x27;s created is the same as the space that was just there. It&#x27;d be like if the rubber band stretched, but didn&#x27;t lose any density while it did so.<p>Insane, I know.')
