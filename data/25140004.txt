It&#x27;s separate from self-esteem. Self-doubt has a way of creeping in and really making you feel like your contributions are not worthwhile.<p>Take breaks throughout the day and start with the assumption that you&#x27;re not an imposter and focus on doing your job and being a valuable member of your team without focusing on the &quot;accomplishments&quot; of others.')
