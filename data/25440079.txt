The government can&#x27;t afford things if the expenditures are more than the income, roughly speaking.<p>&gt; The money is always (well, almost always) going to come from taxes, a municipality or other local government can reduce services and infrastructure spending (opex and capex, roughly) and lower taxes, or increase services and infra spending and raise taxes.<p>In this context (eminent domain seizures), they can also decide they want to put some infrastructure somewhere that is already in use, and instead of purchasing that real estate, they can use their power of eminent domain and expropriate the land from the people who had owned it. That costs less than purchasing it on the market because they compel obedience via threat of physical force.')
