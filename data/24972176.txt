The meaning fits.<p>It&#x27;s unrealistic to propose that a <i>new</i> bridge would be built by private money. There&#x27;s plenty of private investment money floating around in the Bay Area, and it hasn&#x27;t come close to happening yet. And you have completely failed to respond to the concern that your proposed toll-refunding mandate would make a privately-operated bridge an even less viable investment than the non-starter it evidently already is. You&#x27;re just dogmatically asserting that the free market will always provide, when it looks pretty clear that the free market would just say &quot;no thanks&quot;.')
