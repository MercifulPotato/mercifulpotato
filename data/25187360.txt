I&#x27;ve gone to a guitar store, not unlike Guitar center, a couple of times with a friend who was interested in getting into it.<p>The salesperson was interested in selling an expensive ass guitar to a beginner and less interested with her concerns as a beginner.<p>She felt very uneasy about the whole thing.<p>Luckily she found a smaller teaching school where the sales person was more personable and even helped her find a nice used guitar at a reasonable price and she took the time to talk to her about how to go about beginning.<p>My point being: when some of the big guitar stores have a reputation of having people try push and rush to sell you expensive stuff and, also, chastise and sometimes even mock people trying out instruments. Then it&#x27;s no wonder people would go elsewhere to look for instruments, even online.<p>At least they can take the time and get comfortable and compare even though they can&#x27;t hold the instrument.')
