You write<p>f(n) \\lesssim g(n)<p>if there is an absolute constant C such that<p>f(n) \\le C g(n)<p>the meaning is completely clear and by rearranging an expression it can replace big O notation. For example instead of writing<p>f(n) = g(n) + O(h(n))<p>you write<p>|f(n) - g(n)| \\lesssim h(n)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;math.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;1793395&#x2F;who-introduced-the-notation-lesssim" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;math.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;1793395&#x2F;who-introdu...</a>')
