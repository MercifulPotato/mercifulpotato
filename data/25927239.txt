The application would be given a virtual home dir, and would try to access the &quot;~&#x2F;Downloads&quot; folder, for instance, and then this would take the form of a macOS &quot;Firefox wants to access your downloads folder&quot;. Then, OS can easily set up a mount on the container for that folder, with restricted perms.<p>Same with drag and drop. Data could be put into a folder in &#x2F;tmp, a mount could be set up whilst it uploads your photo or whatever to Facebook, and then the mount and the temporary dir could be deleted.<p>Having a &quot;shadow fs&quot; displayed to the container so it can function as if it is not in a container, but then when it wants to access the actual fs, it is done via either prebaked whitelist or user interaction&#x2F;confirmation, would be great because apps would not have to be modified and security would be incredible.<p>You could even have it write to shadow FS and that could be synced later.')
