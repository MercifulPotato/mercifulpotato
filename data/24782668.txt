They use their own proprietary ports.<p>Actually Apple is pretty standards compliant, sometimes excessively so.  I have no illusion that they are doing this out of the goodness of their hearts, but the idea that they &quot;don&#x27;t use standards&quot; is a canard.<p>For video they long used open standards (DVI, Displayport, HDMI, now standard DisplayPort over Type C); they were one of the first to adoptt USB (much to the gnashing of teeth on the part of previous apple owners), the iPod originally used firewire; and lightning when it came out was the only insert-either-way connector (apple was on the USB board that designed Type C, but lightning predates type C) and now they use Type C (much to the gnashing of teeth of various parties).  Their wireless chargers are Qi compatible, though their devices aren&#x27;t :-(.  Their USB implementations long required quite compliant devices rather than windows&#x27; &quot;just install a flaky driver&quot; leading to &quot;hey this USB thingie doesn&#x27;t work on Apple&quot;.<p>I had hoped this year they&#x27;d ditch lightning for type C on at least the high end phones but no luck.<p>On the software side, especially when they were the underdog they were quite standards compliant (image, music, video files, PDF, RTF etc) and are responsible for removing DRM from their music store.  They didn&#x27;t roll out their own formats until they were in a stronger position but have retained support for most of these old formats.')
