That means after a problem happens OCSP revocation takes up to 96 hours to be effective.<p>If you only issue certificates with lifetimes of 96 hours then OCSP didn&#x27;t add anything valuable - the certificates expire before they can effectively be revoked anyway.<p>Let&#x27;s Encrypt is much closer to this idea (90 days) than many issuers were when it started (offering typically 1-3 years) but not quite close enough to argue revocation isn&#x27;t valuable. However, the automation Let&#x27;s Encrypt strongly encourages makes shortening lifetimes practical. Many of us have Let&#x27;s Encrypt certs automated enough that if they renewed every 48 hours instead of every 60 days we&#x27;d barely care.<p>The solution to excessive OCSP traffic and privacy risk is <i>supposed</i> to be OCSP stapling instead, but  TLS servers that can&#x27;t get stapling right are still ridiculously popular so that hasn&#x27;t gone so well.')
