Do we return to the OpenOffice codebase? If so, we are setting development back 10 years. If we return to the LibreOffice codebase, well this is exactly what The Document Foundation is asking for. Except that at this point we will simply let OpenOffice be a redirect to LibreOffice because that is where the development is.')
