Item(by='59nadir', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606736313, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25251719, text='&gt; It&#x27;s funny you mention Stockolm syndrome, then continuing on with an anecdote how Windows always works for you.<p>I didn&#x27;t say &quot;Windows always works for me&quot;, but rather that these imagined conversations about issues like these aren&#x27;t a regular fixture among Windows users. The perceived polish of Linux that supposedly made things like these much rarer is just that, perceived.<p>Windows doesn&#x27;t always work perfectly, it just works for hundreds of times more people way more of the time than Linux. You seem to take someone calling this a &quot;meme&quot; as saying it&#x27;s not real. It&#x27;s not a joke as much as it&#x27;s just something that is and something that naturally happens in an ecosystem where nothing is made to work with anything else.<p>&gt; I had win8 installs that would search for updates for hours on end with no result, weird error codes from windows update, windows 10 updates that left the system unbootable, broken .NET installs that couldnt be fixed without a windows reinstall.<p>I&#x27;ve had equivalents of these (unbootable computer after an update being the most exact match) with OS X. It doesn&#x27;t mean that OS X isn&#x27;t all-in-all a much more well put together operating system than Linux + userland or Windows. Does that mean it&#x27;s perfect? No. But let&#x27;s at least establish that Linux is nowhere near close to offering the same quality experience overall as neither OS X or Windows, even in a ballpark sense.<p>As an additional point to this: Do you believe, once non-enthusiasts start using Linux, that issues will be <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> visible? I know what my bet is.')
