Item(by='VonGuard', descendants=None, kids=[25780278], score=None, time=1610642464, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25776500, text='I hear you, I grew up playing 2nd edition, and somehow the 5th stuff started off feeling empty for me, though I have to admit the rules are so much better and rolling is so much easier. Pathfinder is like doing math homework, every roll...<p>5th is finally starting to get some better flavor, however, now taht 3rd parties, and WotC seem to be filling in the gaps. Goodman Games has a line of reissued classic adventures, like Castle Amder and Barrier Peaks, and these books are fabulous. They&#x27;re updated for 5e, so they offer that old school charm in 5e rules.<p>Additionally, 5e has so little in the way of specializations and customizations for characters, but that&#x27;s being cleared up in the newest official D&amp;D book, Tasha&#x27;s Caldron of Everything. It&#x27;s got a bunch of specialized subclasses, like the Bladesinger, and a lot of more flavorful text and items to go with your campaigns.<p>I feel like 5e started off kinda bland, but has been becoming significantly more fleshed out and living over time. And that makes sense: it takes time to add to these worlds.<p>Oh, also, Kobold Press&#x27; Tome of Beasts 1 &amp; 2 are also fantastic 5e books. Great monsters.')
