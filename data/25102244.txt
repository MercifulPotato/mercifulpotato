Item(by='slantyyz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605456880, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25100889, text='For me, it&#x27;s simply grouping lights.<p>Example: in the winter months if I&#x27;m waking up to take out my dogs, it&#x27;s pitch black on the main floor, so a command like &quot;Alexa, good morning&quot; will turn on the lights for the path that I need to get to the back door and tell me what the outside temperature is so I can wear the appropriate coat.<p>The second most important use case for us (pre-pandemic era) was to have lighting routines that made it look like we were home while away on vacation.<p>I started with some wifi devices (WeMo) but eventually migrated to Z-wave, and found them to be much easier to setup and maintain (and generally more reliable) than wifi (ymmv, of course).<p>My Z-wave hub is basically a USB Z-wave stick connected to an old NUC that&#x27;s running OpenHAB in a Docker container. I rarely log into it or do any maintenance on it other than when I add new devices, which is almost never. I chose OpenHAB over HomeAssistant (YMMV) because I found it to be easier to write a couple of basic scripts to handle state notifications for my smart locks. I had been on SmartThings which was fine prior to getting smart locks and then turned into a major pain afterwards (one firmware update basically broke all my integrations, forcing me to do everything all over again).<p>Keep in mind, I didn&#x27;t really go so far as automating everything &quot;just because I can&quot;. 100+ nodes (as in the article) in a home situation just seems bonkers to me.')
