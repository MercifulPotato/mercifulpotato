After long enough being unable to find a reasonable phone that had 600MHz support, an SD card, and rootability, I gave up and got a samsung. The bootloader won&#x27;t allow anything.<p>I did a bunch of research as well, and recently bought a Motorola Edge[0] (not Edge+) which has pretty much everything you mentioned, including support for up to a 1TB SD card.<p>I haven&#x27;t rooted it yet, but I should have no problem doing so if&#x2F;when I decide to do so (when I require a feature I don&#x27;t have and&#x2F;or Motorola stops upgrading the OS).<p>Samsung says[1] there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem with locking&#x2F;unlocking the bootloader.<p>And other sites[2] confirm this for newer Samsung phones.<p>What&#x27;s more, there&#x27;s additional development work[3] on bypassing Safety Net as well.<p>Even more, moving away from Play Services and installing MicroG[4] addresses the issue as well.<p>I don&#x27;t even own a Samsung phone and I found all this out in less than five minutes.  I can understand if you don&#x27;t want to put in the time and effort, but just saying it doesn&#x27;t work (N.B., you didn&#x27;t mention the specific Samsung model you have which <i>may</i> complicate things, but none of the info I&#x27;ve seen -- including Samsung&#x27;s docs -- say that the bootloader <i>can&#x27;t</i> be unlocked&#x2F;relocked) when there&#x27;s ample evidence that most (if not all) Samsung devices can be unlocked&#x2F;rooted&#x2F;relocked and still pass safety net checks.<p>Besides, even if you don&#x27;t root the device, installing a custom recovery partition will allow nandroid backups[5], which are clearly superior to other backup mechanisms.<p>Regardless, I hope you get&#x2F;have the features and performance you desire, and are able to keep using your device long after Samsung stops supporting it (my HTC stopped getting updates with KitKat&#x2F;4.4 in 2015, but I&#x27;ve continued to update it and currently run LineageOS 17.1&#x2F;AndroidQ on it), as there&#x27;s no reason to buy a new phone as long as you can run recent software versions.<p>In fact, the only reason I purchased a new device was for VoLTE[6] support, which the HTC OneMax doesn&#x27;t have.<p>I wish you many years of quality use from your device.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motorola.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;smartphones-motorola-edge&#x2F;p" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.motorola.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;smartphones-motorola-edge&#x2F;p</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;r2.community.samsung.com&#x2F;t5&#x2F;Others&#x2F;Unlocking-The-Bootloader-Rooting-Your-Phone-and-Flashing-A&#x2F;td-p&#x2F;2496038" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;r2.community.samsung.com&#x2F;t5&#x2F;Others&#x2F;Unlocking-The-Boo...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getdroidtips.com&#x2F;how-to-unlock-bootloader-on-samsung-galaxy-phones&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getdroidtips.com&#x2F;how-to-unlock-bootloader-on-sam...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xda-developers.com&#x2F;bypass-safetynet-hardware-attestation-unlocked-bootloader-magisk-module&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.xda-developers.com&#x2F;bypass-safetynet-hardware-att...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;microg.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;microg.org&#x2F;</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;android.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;28296&#x2F;how-to-fully-backup-non-rooted-devices" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;android.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;28296&#x2F;how-to-ful...</a><p>[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Voice_over_LTE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Voice_over_LTE</a><p>Edit: Fixed link reference numbers and typos.')
