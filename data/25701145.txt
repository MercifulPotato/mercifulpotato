Your last point - about tension - is an interesting one - it&#x27;s the one where I found it hardest to comment. I think this was because the genre wasn&#x27;t one that I normally read, and I didn&#x27;t really know whether the degree of tension was appropriate for the anticipated readership. Someone else who looked at the same book said &quot;He doesn&#x27;t suffer enough&quot; and I found myself agreeing. I guess this is an example of the difference between me - who was in effect looking for technical plot consistency - and a professional editor who is aware of the genre conventions and reader expectations.')
