Or rather, you take one interpretation of the situation and then denigrate in over-the-top terms all the other interpretations.<p>An orchestra produces a single unique performance. The productivity of the system of producing single, unique performance has no changed.<p>You&#x27;re saying that this single unique performance can be reproduced - sure, that&#x27;s true but now it&#x27;s a different product. And certainly, that can increase the price of the final product. A programmer produces programs. Those programs are eventually reproduced on computers on a small or a large scale. A programmer producing a program used by few people still must be paid a salary similar to a programmer producing a program used across the globe - the cost of the program itself has to make up for this, if it doesn&#x27;t, the programming isn&#x27;t going to happen.<p>Moreover, the orchestra example is ... just an example. There are quite a lot of other fields requiring skilled workers, where the productivity has stayed fairly steady.')
