Item(by='sebmellen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607251664, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25322380, text='I had a similarly weird experience in Lisbon. The Airbnb could only be accessed through this app-controlled lock, and my data plan wasn&#x27;t working within the building. This meant I had to send the request from outside, and dash in to open the door while it was still unlocked (about a 20 second period).<p>The second day I was there, I came back from my conference early and couldn&#x27;t get the door to open using my trick. I called the owners, and they came to open the door for me, which worked fine with their physical keys. But, what do you know — their cleaning lady happened to be in the apartment! She clearly hadn&#x27;t been scheduled, and they were very surprised.<p>She left and I looked through my stuff — nothing missing, but a number of items in my bag had been rearranged. She had cleaned up the apartment too, but why was she going through my stuff? I can only think she was looking for cash or something easy to steal without being too noticeable.<p>Reported it to Airbnb but didn&#x27;t get a response.')
