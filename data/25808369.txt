As far as I know Trump is the only one continually advocating for a troop withdrawal in the Middle East.<p>Not to be pedantic but you&#x27;re conflating two issues: being anti-war and being pro-troop presence. One of the big reasons the US has kept a troop presence in the middle east is to deal with the human cost of the instability that was created in the 2000s by those wars of choice.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for all progressives but those that I know have both anti-war views (stop shit-stirring with Iran) and pro-troop presence (try to stabilize the region before withdrawal). I will admit that both have been going <i>very</i> poorly lately.')
