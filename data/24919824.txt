I chose it because (AFAIK) the barrier to entry for a career as an accountant is similar to that of a SWE. there aren&#x27;t many fields these days where completing a four-year degree gives you a good chance at a steady job with good pay. SWE is definitely an outlier when it comes to pay vs credentials. when I got my cs bachelors and starting working, I instantly hit the 90th percentile income for a person my age. a CS major is relatively difficult, sure, but it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> difficult. I have to assume that over time pay and opportunities for people with CS degrees (at least at entry level) will converge with pay for other similarly difficult STEM degrees.')
