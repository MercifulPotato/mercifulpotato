We don&#x27;t have a clock in the bedroom (like to keep it pitch black), so it&#x27;s nice to know what time it is.<p>My wife is a super light sleeper, and I get up first, and the watch gives me a perfectly silent alarm.<p>I have 4 kids, and the watch makes the perfect flashlight for when you have to get up at 3am and check on someone. It&#x27;s nice and dim, instantly available, and you still have two free hands (although they messed this up a bit with the sleep mode in the most recent version).')
