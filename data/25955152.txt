Yet only some lists support that. So you’re apparently expected to slide every list to see if it supports that paradigm. Instead of doing something like normalizing a small arrow on list items that support such a thing. Everything is hidden.<p>Burger menus are great. You’d never be able to fit all those options on screen at once, nor would it make sense for rare actions. But the burger menu gives people a place to put actions on mobile UI where others, like Apple, would just remove them and gimp the mobile experience.<p>It’s why all of Apple’s first party applications are so bad, like the podcast and news app. There are like zero options. Just add and remove and consume.')
