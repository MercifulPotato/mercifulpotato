I have been living on my own since midway through the pandemic, and have been enjoying it. My productivity has gone through the roof, and I feel grateful to be alive – I&#x27;ve enjoyed the ability to spend time rediscovering who I am when not constrained by constant micro-pressures of  social gatherings. The best is the endless ability to cancel social engagements without feeling any repercussions – there&#x27;s always the excuse of the pandemic.<p>My mother has also consciously decided to live completely on her own throughout this time, and I&#x27;ve seen her make some tremendous personal growth during this time (more than in the past 20 years, which were filled with a handful of male partners).<p>Being familiar with Japan&#x27;s recent problematic (lack of) discourse around the issue of domestic abuse, this statement (especially on the heels of the women <i>telling</i> the source that they have problems with family and boyfriends) seemed facile.<p>I&#x27;m startled by your use of &quot;indisputable fact&quot; there – anything branded as &quot;indisputable fact&quot; is a lofty claim, especially when it comes to lived experience or subjective states of others. We&#x27;re just willing to no longer investigate the cause of this sudden jump in suicides, because we can simply write it off as &quot;normal&quot; loneliness? I don&#x27;t like it when others presume to tell me what is &quot;normal&quot; for my (or any) gender, especially when a mysterious jump in mortality is involved.')
