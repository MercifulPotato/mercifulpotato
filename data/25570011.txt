I&#x27;m a bit older and my spouse is reaching the age where she hits her fertility cliff. We both see a society that makes having children more akin to a luxury good.<p>Many of my friends and coworkers have decided to have children and I watch how it seriously mars their ability to do the things they would like to do in life. The costs associated with a child are so high (USDA put it at ~$250000 for a first child from age 0-18[1]) the incentives are aligned against having children.<p>Many commenters are pointing out that population decline might be a good (something I agree with) but your point still stands. My SO and I are in a stable loving relationship and would be fairly good candidates for adoption but because the incentives are aligned against having children, adopting a child is still off the table.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fns-prod.azureedge.net&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;crc2015_March2017_0.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fns-prod.azureedge.net&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;crc2015_M...</a>')
