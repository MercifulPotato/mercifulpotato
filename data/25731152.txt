Item(by='dnautics', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610382413, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25729802, text='&gt; It&#x27;s frustrating to see that a private company&#x27;s bad behavior wound up being a stain for the government like this.<p>Do not be confused into thinking there was no government collusion.  Not only was solyndra a cesspool of revolving door players, it definitely knew how to play the government contracting game.  I used to deliver food for ill low income housing clients and on one complex I visited saw old solyndra tube on top of the building. Someone had to look at this project and see it as a cost plus opportunity for an unrelated and unnecessary product; and now that housing block is saddled with unsupported infrastructure.  Who is going to pay to remove those solyndra panels and put some other solar system up there?')
