Until fairly recently that was standard practice on any application.  With the ban the box gaining traction, most companies now just farm it out, you don&#x27;t have the check the box, they will do the background check.  And here is the kicker, you don&#x27;t have to give your consent in most cases as they are having a third party do the check on publicly available information. companies like goodhire, and many like it make the whole process cheap and easy.')
