But it is a good start.<p>What I recommend strongly is not to mix ORM with plain SQL in the same line of code.<p>The code should either be full ORM or plain SQL so that it is clear where the responsibility of protecting against SQL injection should be.<p>Edit:<p>Also it is easier to add extra layers of protection after a while if using an ORM then when using plain SQL. Because with an ORM I can redefine lets say the Repo.all or Query.all method to add extra layers of protection. But with plain SQL I need to edit every single line where the SQL statement is present.')
