The Iranian government keeps changing its story. They also focus on strange details, like that the gun had the capability to hit the scientist but not his wife. Machine guns have penetration and dispersion, so unless firing from the front, I don&#x27;t see how it could have minimized the chance of hitting a passenger next to the target. But then if firing from the front, you&#x27;d expect it would be likely to penetrate and hit someone in front or behind the target. It&#x27;s just such a strange detail that really doesn&#x27;t speak to AI at all.')
