Many will be gone in a few more years because they retire anyway, so you should have a plan in place to save their knowledge.<p>The above applies to everyone. When I was an intern the company folklore was full of horror stories because the last guy knew anything about a very profitable product died suddenly. (the product was for mainframes: clearly near end of life, but it was still mission critical for major customers and got had to get minor updates)<p>I&#x27;ve also known important people to find a better job. Even when an offer of more money gets them to stay, my experience is they always wonder if they made the right decision and so are never again as good as they were before.<p>Moral of the story: don&#x27;t allow anyone in your company to get irreplaceable. This is good for you too: it means you won&#x27;t stagnate doing the same thing over an over.')
