This is completely wrong.<p>For instance, I have Thoracic Outlet Syndrome. It&#x27;s something really fucking shitty that overhead sports players and computer nerds are prone to (along with those with connective tissue disorders)<p>It&#x27;s surprisingly super fucking hard to get right and general surgeons have fucked a lot of people up attempting to do it. Most famously, a Houston Astros pitcher was left paralyzed by the surgery, and his surgeon later ran into him homeless under a bridge. I think I have that linked in my more recent of comments.<p>Anyways, there are about 5 major hospitals in the U.S. with completely specialized Thoracic Outlet Surgery divisions within their vascular surgery wing of the hospital. These surgeons <i>only</i> do this one specific surgery - removing first&#x2F;cervical ribs, sometimes along with two other involved muscles. My surgeon is Dr. Dean Donahue of Boston Mass General&#x27;s Thoracic Outlet Surgery Program - arguably the most famous and successful practicioner of said surgery in the U.S.&#x2F;world.<p>Now, obviously, my condition isn&#x27;t some special case. There&#x27;s quite a few &#x27;rarer&#x27; super specific medical conditions requiring a single specific surgery that larger U.S. hospitals (think Mayo Clinic, Cedars Sinai, Mass General, Cleveland Clinic, etc) do have devoted wings for with surgeons that only do that singular procedure in their otherwise generalized division. Not just the &quot;Oklahoma Surgery Center&quot;<p>Sorry if I misinterpreted what you were saying or if this otherwise seems like I&#x27;m ranting and rambling haha. Not trying to rant - just wanted to inform&#x2F;give some insight.')
