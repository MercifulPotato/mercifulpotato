I.e., the people want more choice but the system does not allow for it.<p>IRV doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of gerrymandering either.<p>I&#x27;m completely with you on the distance vs. political opinions. There is something extremely powerful in electing one, who has personally convinced you, from your town to go and represent us all, but the world doesn&#x27;t operate on that scale anymore.')
