Seems like another incremental step forward. Google turned off the PR firehouse on Waymo over the past year, so I think many were starting to think the tech had hit a wall and wasn&#x27;t ever going to be able to get rid of the safety driver. I suppose this makes me cautiously optimistic. I don&#x27;t think self driving needs to handle all roads in all conditions to be economically useful.')
