Randomly pick 5 laptops, regardless of the price. So no cherry picking.<p>Use these laptops with Windows installed on them, for a reasonably long period, for example 1 month, as your daily driver. Perform varied tasks on them, such as printing, connecting to external displays, to projectors, other peripherals, playing modern 3D games on them, etc.<p>Then do the same with Linux.<p>I&#x27;m willing to bet $100 that on average Windows will run better on them, have a longer lasting battery life, better network connectivity, etc.<p>And if you&#x27;re trying to tell me that on average Linux runs better than MacOS on Apple laptops and desktops, then this discussion is not worth continuing, we both probably have better things to do with our time.')
