For example, if you want to just use a certificate or cryptographic key pair regardless of whether the private key is in a file or stored in a hardware module, CryptoAPI unifies that interface so that, if you do it right, you have two orthogonal pieces of code: one that locates the key to use and which adapter to use to talk to the underlying software&#x2F;hardware, and another to request cryptographic operations on an abstracted key pair. The fact that you&#x27;re talking to pure software or an actual HSM can be abstracted from the code that needs to sign a challenge.<p>The API is powerful enough that its abstractions work even for cloud based key storage. For example, AWS Cloud HSM support for CryptoAPI: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;cloudhsm&#x2F;latest&#x2F;userguide&#x2F;ksp-library.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.aws.amazon.com&#x2F;cloudhsm&#x2F;latest&#x2F;userguide&#x2F;ksp-li...</a>')
