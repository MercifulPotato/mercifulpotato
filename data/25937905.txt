WFH and Remote learning, lot of people bought new Desktop or Laptop. Which isn’t just Apple but across all computing industry, AMD, Intel, Microsoft etc. iPhone 12 was bound to sell with new design and 5G. But again number were way higher than even the most optimistic expectation. ( Mainly China’s uptake being a lot higher )<p>It is crazy to think back not long ago we thought we will hit the law of big numbers. And yet despite being a two <i>trillion</i> company they are still growing 10-20%!<p>And after 5 years, just like the Mac Pro they finally admit they made lots of mistakes in Mac development. Like MagSafe and SD Card. Hopefully someday keyboard and Trackpad.<p>The only thing left is the iOS App Store. Which is a complicated problem with no decent solution (yet).')
