Buildroot was created as a scrappy project by the BusyBox&#x2F;uClibc folks. Yocto is a giant industry-sponsored project with tons of different moving parts. You will see this build system referred to as Yocto, OpenEmbedded, and Poky, and I did some reading before publishing this article because I never really understood the relationship. I think the first is the overall head project, the second is the set of base packages, and the third is the… nope, I still don’t know. Someone complain in the comments and clarify, please.<p>Bitbake is the generic build system around which openembedded recipes (for particular packages) were implemented. Anyone could create a distro using those recipes, dates to the early to mid 2000s.<p>Yocto was&#x2F;is a project of the Linux Foundation, basically a working group, where they looked at the state of embedded linux and said, &quot;We want to contribute to this project with documentation and more recipes&quot;, starting externally but with hopes to get it mainlined. Poky was&#x2F;is their reference distro for this effort.<p>Nowadays all the packages contributed by the Yocto project have been consolidated into openembedded, but poky remains the reference distro.<p>tl;dr: Yocto is first and foremost an organization of people. Bitbake is the build system. OpenEmbedded is a community of distro-agnostic build system recipes. Poky is a distro maintained by the Yocto organization utilizing OpenEmbedded recipes.')
