This is the main thing I end up switching back to Google Maps for. Open Street Maps is good if I already know my address ahead of time, but at least the Android incarnation (Osmand+) has a search UI only a mother could love. Even if that worked consistently, it seems to just not have more than half of the businesses nearby. Am I missing an option somewhere?')
