I just got one and it&#x27;s able to drive two external 4K 60Hz displays (one usb-c, one displayport) from both my Intel MBP or from my Dell XPS 17, hot swappable. In the latter case, that&#x27;s over three 4K displays including the laptop. (I didn&#x27;t realize the XPS actually had &gt;4K resolution until opening the display settings tool).<p>I just started with this configuration two days ago, so we&#x27;ll see. It&#x27;s not completely glitch-free yet: I noticed the mouse (also plugged into the TS3+) glitched a bit yesterday, and once one of the monitors couldn&#x27;t be detected from the XPS once and required reboot. XPS also shows a low-power charger warning in tray when plugged into it, which I wish I could disable but oh well. Still, it&#x27;s worked way better than I&#x27;d expected so far with no hassle. Completely replaces my desktop setup and hot-swaps are generally seamless.<p>I haven&#x27;t noticed any major CPU or power spikes. Fan isn&#x27;t doing anything weird. But I&#x27;ll look out for it.')
