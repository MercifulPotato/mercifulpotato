Open standards. There is no one entity to control what frameworks are &quot;standard&quot;. Need for back compatibility of the web standards make them too simple and minimalistic. So you inevitably have a demand for power tools.<p>2. Many players are trying to capture demand for power tools. Of course their reasoning and approach differ. Often it becomes less about technology, but more about audience perception of the tool. Then we see more blogposts, podcasts, meetings, &quot;see how easy to create and app&quot; posts.<p>3. Web frontend is hard environment to model UX because too many moving parts. You have inherentedly stateful programm which should communicate asynchronously with at least 2 inputs-outputs: web server and user. Not speaking that it&#x27;s not enough to have framework with proper building blocks to model your UX, you have bunch of issues with dependencies, debugging and integrations with existing tools.<p>This makes hard to come up with a solution which can satisfy many people. Some people are infiltrated with ideas which are incompatible with particular framework ideology, and bam, you have 2 camps which &quot;push&quot; against each other.<p>Now you have demand for tools, but tools shitty in some ways, and it&#x27;s shitiness is covered with hype, brands and other forms  of forming opinion.<p>This creates a demand for a new thing after people get disillusioned via own experience. And we get yet another framework. Repeat every 4-5 years.')
