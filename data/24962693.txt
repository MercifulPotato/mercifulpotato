The org in its official function doing unofficial things without oversight? Or the individual working for the NSA spying on his ex-lover for blackmail material?<p>I mean, either you&#x27;re saying &quot;no one within the NSA has ever been a bad actor&quot;, or you&#x27;re saying &quot;the bad actions are acceptable collateral damage; no oversight needs to be applied to ensure the trade off between effectiveness and collateral damage is balanced&quot;, or you&#x27;re saying &quot;not ALL actors are bad&quot; and leaving it at that.<p>And...none of those strikes me as a particular defensible position to take.')
