Even the Republicans were well aware of this. In fact, 7 of the last 8 Presidential elections have ended with a Democrat getting more votes than a Republican.<p>Yet even with a 3.5 million vote lead, the perception was the election was on a knife edge.<p>This is ridiculous. The EC is an anachronmism and needs to be abolished. It made sense when it was established, but it&#x27;s clearly not working.<p>Same for the Senate. <i>70% of people are represented by 30% of Senators</i>.<p>You desperately need to fix your broken electoral systems.')
