Anything else will just lead to mismanagement.<p>Don&#x27;t make the mistake of ignoring physical reality when talking about economy. A market isn&#x27;t just a list of prices. Behind those numbers are real goods that exchange hands and have to be produced. If you just play around with some numbers you don&#x27;t change anything about reality. Government price controls such as minimum wages or maximum prices for goods are just that: Playing with numbers. Since the government absolves itself of the consequences of its policies it can promise the moon and get away with causing pain and suffering.<p>If you really want a solution then you should start by enacting a policy that combines both the physical and economical world and sets the right incentives. Instead of a minimum wage have a job guarantee, instead of enforcing a maximum price on private sellers have a commodity guarantee that you will sell and produce masks at a fixed price. Once you fix the physical world the economical portion will fix itself.')
