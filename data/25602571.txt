Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=[25602641], score=None, time=1609501223, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25601898, text='&gt; On the whole i think hacker news tends to be pretty positive to big tech.<p>Perhaps to a fault, the same applies to the CCP Bots you see here posting anytime anyone questions China: you have people here with self-interest guiding their words and creating rationalizations like those above stating how erroneous &#x27;the media&#x27; and &#x27;outsiders&#x27; portray them in a bad light and that some how they are poorly informed and thus their views are nothing more than unsubstantiated conjecture.<p>But one needs to only look at the recent behavior of Apple riots in India and Amazon exploiting warehouse workers and firing them during COVID due to reasonable concerns--like lack of PPE and distancing&#x2F;hygiene&#x2F;prevention methods.<p>Its so commonplace and thus very easy to realize that if these massive monoliths, who benefit from very skewed tax, legal and labur laws, are not going to put Human Rights&#x2F;Labor Laws before Profit or Market Share even during a Global pandemic, then they never will: and Governments on a whole are either&#x2F;or both complicit as they ignorant on their business models making legislation solutions entirely moot. And I&#x27;m not even going to mentioned Google as this rebuttal would never end.<p>But nothing changes those objective truths regardless of how much you may want to sugarcoat things, and the fact that so many here still think FAANG is the <i>end all and be all</i> of Tech shows just how misguided if not entirely indoctrinated (from within or otherwise) they really are and how easily they are bought off with the illusion of prestige, a meaningless title and an often over bloated salary and by extension a sense of self worth for the things they&#x27;ve actually bring to the World often, most notably: Social media that creates discord and division and devices that promote further dependence on self-infatuated naval gazing while our Environment and hapless languish in mines and suffer ever greater exploitation, and these businesses make them increasingly more within the closed source, planned obsolesce paradigm business model. Not to mention the depression and suicide these addictive things are meant to create in a sort of intention span casino addiction model.<p>So, no, I don&#x27;t think what you&#x27;re saying is true, and what you are referring to is told with very obvious biases.<p>People should be critical of these exploitative and frankly often unnecessary and cancerous business models, the problem is that they wield so much power and money they simply destroy any competition they may have had in the past, assuming they didn&#x27;t acquire them and we get less choices due to these monopolistic practices.<p>I think it was Chamath that said it best when he describes what banks and big tech excel at that most the Industries can&#x27;t as the &#x27;intellectual lobotomization&#x27; of a generation(s) best minds as they spend(t) their talents and drive to often pointless (facebook) and often nefarious ends (credit default swaps, naked short selling&#x2F;high frequency trading algorithms etc...).')
