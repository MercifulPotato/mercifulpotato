So you do this, ready? Everyone continues to drive exactly the way they do right now. All revenues go into one big bank account.<p>Next, you provide incentive payments for drivers proportional to the extra amount they brought in above and beyond the minimum wage for the hours they drove, as a slice of the pool of revenues after subtracting out minimum wages and benefits. Then you stack rank your drivers at the end of each half, and fire the bottom 20%.<p>I&#x27;m not even advocating this approach, I&#x27;m just saying there are ways of incentivizing this that are shown to work. This part here isn&#x27;t rocket science.')
