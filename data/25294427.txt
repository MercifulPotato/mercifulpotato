I&#x27;ve seen some stuff that gets off in the weeds, but ignores the mechanism of T-cell and B-cell mediated immunity and the most plausible mechanisms of transmission at an aggregate level, and that only focuses on primary outcomes of clinical trials, while ignoring secondary outcomes.<p>But I haven&#x27;t seen anything that was written in a way that would convince a mildly skeptical human (and I&#x27;ve spent some time behind a micropipette) that vaccines do nothing to prevent contracting and spreading viruses.<p>I&#x27;m coming to this with an open mind, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m being a jerk about anything. I shared a quote from the CDC at face-value. You&#x27;re just some faceless dude on the internet. Why should I believe you over the CDC?<p>I promise I&#x27;m not masterminding some elaborate FUD campaign to undermine your premise. You&#x27;re just saying something that&#x27;s super-counterintuitive and then getting angry at me because I don&#x27;t see clear evidence for it in what you presented.')
