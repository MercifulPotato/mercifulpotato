Item(by='nullc', descendants=None, kids=[25567782], score=None, time=1609222221, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25567154, text='&gt; I researched this and found that Bitcoin had no initial capacity limit<p>That is simply untrue.  From the very first version it had two capacity limits, an explicit one (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trottier&#x2F;original-bitcoin&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src&#x2F;main.h#L17" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;trottier&#x2F;original-bitcoin&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;src...</a>), and a smaller implicit and unintentional one (of about 500k) owing to the maximum locks that could be grabbed in a single BDB transaction.<p>Satoshi later reduced the explicit limit further and provided no explanation for doing so ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bitcoin&#x2F;bitcoin&#x2F;commit&#x2F;a30b56ebe76ffff9f9cc8a6667186179413c6349" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bitcoin&#x2F;bitcoin&#x2F;commit&#x2F;a30b56ebe76ffff9f9...</a> ).  However, there was no issue with spam at the time or previously, nor mention of spam, and the network already had a separate and highly functional spam limiting mechanism.  Had he intended to make the limit simply temporary he could have trivially programmed it that way-- e.g. as we did when we discovered the ~500kb limit, we wrote a rule that limited blocks to 500kb and then expired a few months later.<p>The claim that it was a &quot;temporary anti-spam limit&quot; is a novel construction that I don&#x27;t believe I saw ever claimed until many years after that change.<p>At least by the time Satoshi went inactive he was well aware of the trade-offs: &quot;Bitcoin users might get increasingly tyrannical about limiting the size of the chain so it&#x27;s easy for lots of users and small devices.&quot; ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitcointalk.org&#x2F;index.php?topic=1790.msg28917#msg28917" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitcointalk.org&#x2F;index.php?topic=1790.msg28917#msg289...</a> )<p>Perhaps you should consider conducting &quot;research&quot; by having an open discussion with an actual expert rather than just reading manipulative tracts designed to sucker people into buying alternatives? :)<p>I&#x27;m happy to direct you to primary reference material even though you continue to treat me rudely and disrespectfully.')
