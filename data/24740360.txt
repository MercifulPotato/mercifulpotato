Item(by='627467', descendants=None, kids=[24740805], score=None, time=1602350212, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24740154, text='Sounds wasteful but if we assume normalization of online ordering for clothing (where good fit is important) then this is probably the most efficient way to handle this situation. I suppose ordering a single item, trying, returning then ordering 2 more times until you get the right fit: that sounds a lot more wasteful than order 3 items in one go and doing a single return.<p>Now, IMO, ordering clothes (and shoes, or anything you&#x27;re supposed to wear and where fit is important - at least important for a substantial demographic) through online shopping just doesn&#x27;t seem to make as much sense as other things.<p>I personally rarely buy online unless I&#x27;m talking about staples like shirt and tees that I&#x27;ve tried from certain brands and know how it fits (so don&#x27;t need returning).<p>As with other things... this huge shift to online ordering may make from efficiency perspective only when you ignore externalities and subsidies.')
