Who has ever said the problem is solved with just one thing?<p>It&#x27;s certainly a very important part of the solution. Solving climate change is absolutely impossible without electric vehicles and better batteries. This is not just about driving your SUV to your cabin, it&#x27;s about transportation of goods, farming, mining etc. We&#x27;re also seeing that there&#x27;s overlap in development of EV batteries and grid batteries (at least for short term frequency regulation).. so there&#x27;s some synergies there that will be important for increasing the share of renewables.<p>It just happens that personal cars is the easiest vehicle to implement as BEV first. If rich western countries didn&#x27;t buy them, and China didn&#x27;t have the foresight to push BEVs hard, the development could easily have taken 10-20 years longer.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s a very western-centric view.<p>Cars are used in non-western countries too. Now that batteries for vehicles are getting cheaper, you&#x27;re starting to see BEVs become viable at the very bottom of the market as well. Cheap BEVs and cheap renewable energy will be <i>huge</i> for developing countries. You&#x27;re already starting to see renewable micro-grids giving a much lower barrier to get access to electricity. Importing oil is expensive for a developing country. Importing refined gasoline is even more expensive.')
