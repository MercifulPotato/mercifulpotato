Item(by='didibus', descendants=None, kids=[24804119], score=None, time=1602873966, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24801542, text='&gt; So you&#x27;re saying the only courtesies we should render to others in life are ones that we&#x27;re duty-bound by license agreements or other contracts to give?<p>Isn&#x27;t that the whole point behind the rule of law and the civil society?<p>Anything that isn&#x27;t well understood or known in advance of someone engaging in an activity, and then later faces unfair retribution because apparently they didn&#x27;t do what wasn&#x27;t told to them that needed be done, or did something that wasn&#x27;t told to them shouldn&#x27;t be done.<p>All these &quot;social norm&quot; sounds like guilt trip and power grabs to me. You did something you said was free and that you were giving it to me no string attached, then you come back and guilt trip me saying that there were in fact strings attached and that you expected things in return.<p>Now, yes I understand that maybe when you said hey this is open source with Apache license, you had in mind an audience of students, or one man startups, or hobbyist, or amateurs, and hadn&#x27;t really thought if it applied to big corps. And I actually wonder how the courts normally handle this, when someone who put the conditions forward first was in a position where they couldn&#x27;t have anticipated the event and thus couldn&#x27;t have pre-conditioned it. I&#x27;m not too sure how to handle it myself, but here I&#x27;m guessing is a lesson to learn for others, choose your license carefully, think about the various possibility.')
