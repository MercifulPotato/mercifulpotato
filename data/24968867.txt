There have been specialised 1MLOC programs checked with a model checker, but the techniques don&#x27;t generalise. I would be interested in a source to your claim about the Space Shuttle software, because even though that&#x27;s both high-cost and niche software, I think you might have the details wrong. Anyway, I encourage you to try to affordably write ordinary software in this way. This is certain to win you some high-profile award, as no one has been able to do it so far. Either you succeed or you fail, but there&#x27;s really no point in insisting it can be done without pointing to anyone who has done it.')
