Ethereum is oil. Yes, it has value, but only when it is used to get you something else.<p>Regarding &quot;commerce&quot; with crypto, I mostly agree, but the reality is that for payments to become a common use case we still need to build <i>A LOT</i> of critical pieces - chiefly: have a reliable&#x2F;cheap system to get stable currencies [0][1], lower the transaction costs[2], make it easy for people to request[3] and accept payments online [4] and build some permissionless system to settle payment disputes [5] as well as to get insurance and the ability to do chargebacks. These things will take time to get right, but this should not mean that they should be facing eternal and constant unfounded criticism or accusations of fraud&#x2F;malice. There are lots of people working on crypto who don&#x27;t care about the price fluctuations and are not doing it just for the quick buck - they should be supported, not discouraged.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;synthetix.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;synthetix.io</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;makerdao.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;makerdao.com</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raiden.network" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raiden.network</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;request.network" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;request.network</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hub20.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hub20.io</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kleros.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kleros.io</a>')
