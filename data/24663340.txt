In Europe on the other hand the contract is just one piece of the puzzle and the judge can add, remove or modify clauses in search of the true pary intentions; in case of conflicting elements, the judge may refer to what is applicable under the usual rules for such contracts and even change the contract type. That&#x27;s why Tivoization with GPL v2 is unquestionably legal in USA, but there is still a certain legal uncertainty in Europe, because there is no supreme court decision.<p>EDIT: clarifications')
