This article details nicely how it all plays out:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;05&#x2F;01&#x2F;neutral-vs-conservative-the-eternal-struggle&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;05&#x2F;01&#x2F;neutral-vs-conservativ...</a><p>&gt;The moral of the story is: if you’re against witch-hunts, and you promise to found your own little utopian community where witch-hunts will never happen, your new society will end up consisting of approximately three principled civil libertarians and seven zillion witches. It will be a terrible place to live even if witch-hunts are genuinely wrong.<p>&gt;...<p>&gt;The equilibrium is basically what we see now. The neutral gatekeeper institutions lean very liberal, though with a minority of conservative elites who are good at keeping their heads down and too mainstream&#x2F;prestigious to settle for anything less. The ghettos contain a combination of seven zillion witches and a few decent conservatives who are increasingly uncomfortable but know there’s no place for them in the mainstream.')
