However, <i>most</i> people that complain about not being able to run Linux on a M1 can be just as productive with the alternatives on macOS.<p>For 99% of other things that run in a terminal, you can get it to work in FreeBSD&#x2F;macOS. Also, for Python folks, there is anaconda distribution that is agnostic to the underlying OS. Ditto for node or ruby development. Also Gui Emacs and vi have decent ports to macOS.<p>That said, I guess if you are doing some custom server side development that really needs Linux, you will have a hard time with M1 - virtualization and emulation don’t mix and your code might not be portable enough.')
