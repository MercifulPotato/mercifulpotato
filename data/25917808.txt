This only becomes an issue if we&#x27;re headed in the wrong direction, or focusing on a sub-problem that would be better addressed in a different way, or if we have no plans to fix the other attack vectors.<p>But the steps we&#x27;ll take to attack fingerprinting are very similar to the steps we&#x27;ll take to attack supercookies, so there&#x27;s no harm in grabbing the low-hanging fruit first.<p>Supercookies clearly have some value to advertisers and other bad actors or else they wouldn&#x27;t be used. There&#x27;s value in closing off that specific tracking method while we continue to try and figure out the harder problem of how to standardize headers, resource loading, etc...')
