There will always a be a market (and a non-zero price) for it, and given current trends in fiat money management the price would recover eventually.<p>&gt; The $100 million cash injection into bitcoin sounds like a lot, but it’s small potatoes. That money will cover the network’s operators—the bitcoin miners—for only six days.<p>Missing context. The average economic cost of production for an ounce of gold is in the ballpark of $1000, and with annual new supply of about 3500 tonnes that adds up to about $112B spent digging an inert shiny metal out of the ground. I&#x27;m not going to attempt to quantify the costs of storing and transacting gold; suffice to say that it&#x27;s inefficient and expensive.')
