Which they are legally allowed to do so with Apache 2.0? They even mentioned and I quote:<p><i>&quot;We collaborate with cloud service providers, including Microsoft, Google, Alibaba, Tencent, Clever Cloud, and others. We have shown we can find a way to do it.&quot;</i><p>What they are not happy with was the TradeMark. Amazon usage of that Trademark to mislead customers and this isn&#x27;t some recent things either. It has been going on for 5 years. ( And yes the court should be used to settle that. )<p>So majority of HN; including its previous threads with 1000+ comments, is basically making <i>allegation</i> that Elastic is making the changes because of their Business Model. <i>Until that can be proved, allegations remain merely assertions.</i><p>But right now it is being stated as <i>Facts</i>. And it is now being spin into ethical debate.<p>And I was under the impression, should Amazon be forced to fork it, which they did as announced, would have to use a different name. Instead they choose to use ElasticSearch again.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elastic.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;why-license-change-AWS" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.elastic.co&#x2F;blog&#x2F;why-license-change-AWS</a>')
