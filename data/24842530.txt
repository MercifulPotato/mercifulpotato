So forgive it in advanced, but why have an AMD specific backend at all? Couldn&#x27;t you just use AMD&#x27;s HIP&#x2F;HIP-IFY tool on the CUDA backend and get an AMD friendly version out?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ROCm-Developer-Tools&#x2F;HIP" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ROCm-Developer-Tools&#x2F;HIP</a><p>I realize these sort of tools aren&#x27;t magic and whatever it spites out will need work, but it seems like a really good thin starting place for AMD support with a lower overhead for growth.<p>After the original CUDA bits can &quot;&quot;cross-compile&quot;&quot;, the workflow is greatly reduced, right?<p>Workflow:<p>- update CUDA code<p>- push through the HIPIFY tool<p>- Fix what is broken (if you can fix it on the CUDA side)<p>After enough iterations, the CUDA code will grow friendly to HIPification...')
