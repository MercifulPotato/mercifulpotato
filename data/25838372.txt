There&#x27;s a limit on how lightweight a CRT can be, compared to what amounts to essentially a large chip. Maybe that wasn&#x27;t so bad. Also, unless this breakthrough no longer used an electron gun, they are power hogs.<p>&gt; to force the usage of HDMI cables<p>What&#x27;s preventing one from driving a CRT with a HDMI signal?   You can generate the analog signals the CRT needs quite easily. This is in fact done by dirt cheap dongles today.<p>&gt; where the game would raytrace the audio, calculating it reflecting, refracting and difracting around the 3D models, allowing for sound simulations that let players to figure out the environment by audio alone<p>Why can&#x27;t we do this today? This can in fact be done by GPUs. Possibly even in the CPU.<p>The way I understand there are a few reasons why people stopped buying sound cards:<p>* Capabilities such as MIDI and pre-loaded instruments were no longer used. Games had more space to burn so they just used digitized waveforms<p>* The built-in audio became &quot;good enough&quot;. Any built-in cheap can output audio at high sample rates. Decent audio can be provided even from the analog outputs, not to mention digital signals carried by optical outputs, HDMI, Display Port.  Some of these may not even be routed through the audio card<p>* Similarly, many people use USB headsets. They have their own audio device. In fact, many computers have multiple - in my case, my camera has one, the Oculus has another, so does the monitor. All through USB or DisplayPort<p>* Most sound processing tasks are not really that taxing on a modern system. Thief might be an exception and even then, given some AMD and NVidia offerings, this is probably doable without dedicated audio processing hardware<p>* Also Creative had a chokehold on the industry as a whole. Lots of libraries and products were purchased or killed. They still make audio cards today, but I can&#x27;t understand why.')
