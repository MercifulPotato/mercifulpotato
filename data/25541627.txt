Also, it&#x27;s been 10+ months, so to the degree that developed countries like the US lack sufficient PPE manufacturing, it&#x27;s certainly not down to resources or capabilities (or anything besides political will in the US considering the DPA could be invoked at any time).<p>Also, most countries still seem to be ignoring the best&#x2F;cheapest way to control spread via rapid testing and isolation. This has been not only modeled extensively at this point [1][2], but also proven to be effective by sports leagues (NBA, MLB) and Universities (look at where UIUC has kept their numbers vs the state: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.illinois.edu&#x2F;COVIDTestingData" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;go.illinois.edu&#x2F;COVIDTestingData</a> )<p>[1] Larremore, Daniel B, Bryan Wilder, Evan Lester, Soraya Shehata, James M Burke, James A Hay, Milind Tambe, Michael J Mina, and Roy Parker. “Test Sensitivity Is Secondary to Frequency and Turnaround Time for COVID-19 Surveillance.” Preprint.
