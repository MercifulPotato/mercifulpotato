I personally wouldn&#x27;t enjoy a book that revels in torture or violence, but I&#x27;ve read the BOTNS series many times (5 or 6). Sevarian clearly doesn&#x27;t enjoy his path nor does he &quot;revel&quot; in it and if anything he generally tries to avoid violence. Gene Wolfe as a man clearly doesn&#x27;t focus on violence and certainly doesn&#x27;t celebrate it, it&#x27;s just a small but real part of the world both in reality and BOTNS, and I think it&#x27;s an important thing we have to explore in art, which is the violence of man to man, why it exists, why we do these things.')
