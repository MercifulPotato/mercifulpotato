The question was not &quot;is the doomsday clock moving closer to midnight&quot; and safety is non synonymous with time on the doomsday clock.<p>And it really just detracts from a well written and reasoned counter argument to what Steven Pinker said. I tend to agree with the article. And it is good counter to the old &quot;don&#x27;t mind the gangs, they only kill each other&quot; claptrap really.<p>The core point this article raises is that it is not clear why homicide rate should be accepted as the sole and primary measure of safety. And here you come and suggest that instead we should take the doomsday clock ... which I would argue would be a step back.')
