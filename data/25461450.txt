The author makes too incredible fallacies here.<p>The first is assuming that enough vaccine could have been manufactured at any one of the three points he listed to have a significant effect. The mRNA vaccines require very specific and unique manufacturing techniques, not to mention medical grade manufacturing capabilities and capable staff. Every single bit of information I&#x27;ve come across indicates that both Pfizer and Moderna put the pedal to metal on building out manufacturing capabilities and although they have been stockpiling vaccine prior to approval and that still amounts to less than they&#x27;ll be likely be producing a month from now.<p>The second is that his math seems to imply that the pandemic stops killing people almost immediately after vaccine sales begin. Again, this is completely implausible. Even with the current small stockpiles of vaccines and targeted vaccinations of the most vulnerable populations it will likely be months before we start seeing an effect deaths due to vaccination. Implying that this was possible 9 months ago with a tiny fraction of the number of vaccines we have now is ridiculous.<p>There is certainly room to examine and critique the FDA&#x27;s highly cautious processes, but at worst they may have delayed things a week or two for the very first people getting vaccinated and likely not all for the other 95% of the US population.')
