The average cost of a bitcoin transaction is currently ~$7.5USD[1]; nobody in the unbanked world is spending the cost of 1-2 Nokias to make day-to-day purchases.<p>&gt; Another example is how it is providing a way for people in hyper-inflationary economies like Venezuela to store value.<p>This isn&#x27;t true. Zelle&#x27;s ability to store actual USD make it the preferred means for storing digital currency safely in Venezuela right now[2]:<p>&quot;Ecoanal√≠tica, a local consulting firm, estimates that 17% of transactions at retail establishments in Caracas go through [Zelle] and that other Venezuelan cities are seeing similar usage levels. The actual figure may be larger, considering the data do not include smaller shops.&quot;<p>Accusing others of being ill informed or dishonest while yourself pushing forth maximalist narratives that aren&#x27;t grounded in reality is a bit rich.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ycharts.com&#x2F;indicators&#x2F;bitcoin_average_transaction_fee#:~:text=Average%20Bitcoin%20transaction%20fees%20can,from%200.603%20one%20year%20ago" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ycharts.com&#x2F;indicators&#x2F;bitcoin_average_transaction_f...</a>.\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;news&#x2F;features&#x2F;2020-11-11&#x2F;zelle-has-turned-dollar-starved-venezuela-into-a-cashless-test-lab" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bloomberg.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;news&#x2F;features&#x2F;2020-11-11&#x2F;zelle...</a>')
