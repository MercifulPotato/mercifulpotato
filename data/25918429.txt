Item(by='evanelias', descendants=None, kids=[25919013], score=None, time=1611681306, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25917500, text='With a typical sharded relational database setup, each sharding key value maps to exactly one shard.<p>There should be replicas of that shard, which can be promoted in case of a master failure. But in rare cases all replicas may also be degraded or inconsistent and therefore non-promotable. When this happens to a giant monolithic non-sharded database, the impact is far more catastrophic than when it happens to a single smaller shard.<p>In any case, replication is a separate concern from sharding. Each sharded database replica set (traditionally 1 master + N replicas) has a data set that is unique &#x2F; independent of other sharded database replica sets.<p>That said, some of the &quot;NewSQL&quot; distributed databases may arrange their data in more complex ways. [Edit to clarify: I mean in respect to the <i>combination</i> of both sharding and replication. With a traditional sharded relational database, you have replica sets where each replica contains the exact same shard or shards; with a NewSQL distributed DB, data may be replicated in a more complex arrangement]')
