Almost all the issues I&#x27;ve had with Emacs plugins have boiled down to poor interactions between Emacs and external software (wrong versions, wrong paths... etc), and Nix could fix basically all of it.<p>As a bonus, using Nix to manage Emacs dependencies would also give me full control over exactly which version of each package to pull in. This would create much more of a &quot;distro&quot; experience without needing any extra infrastructure.')
