With 1000 paticipants the data would probably already have been better then most research that has ever been done in this field.<p>Thanks to the support of this unbelievably kind and helpful community we have now reached more than 6100 participants,  collected more than 160.000 votes and nearly 800.000 datapoints in our database.\nThe amount of extremely valuable and helpful data is just beyond believe for us - and I cannot thank you all enough for all your support, effort and positive feedback!\nWe are now on the edge of creating one of the most if not the most profound studies in the field of breast surgery ever - and the amount of extremely helpful knowledge we can get from the data is just overwhelming.<p>Thank you HN for this wonderful opportunity, all your support and all your fantastic feedback and kind help!')
