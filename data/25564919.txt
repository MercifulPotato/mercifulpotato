Ever since I bought a 2-in-1 device with a pen, I lament at the dearth of applications that make good use of pens&#x2F;styluses. It&#x27;s a really powerful mode of input, but you can&#x27;t treat it as just a funny mouse.<p>Also strongly seconding the graph point. Over the past few years, I&#x27;ve learned to see directed graphs everywhere (particularly in task&#x2F;project management, something I rant on every now and then). It&#x27;s a truly powerful mental model, it&#x27;s a natural model for representing quite a lot of things, and yet it&#x27;s also terribly underutilized on the UI&#x2F;UX side.<p>Currently, I&#x27;m thinking about writing my own todo app ( :) ) with a strong graph twist. I&#x27;ve already switched from org-mode and all the Trellos&#x2F;planners to <i>Microsoft Project</i>, of all things, precisely because it understands that tasks form a graph and not a shallow tree. But MS Project&#x27;s UX is quite clunky if you want to use it as a day-to-day task management tool. I think there&#x27;s a lot of space for improvement here.<p>(A nice side effect for using MS Project to break down my own work is that when my PM asks me about my progress during our 1:1s, I just show her the GANTT chart, which cleanly communicates my plan, the order of things, their interdependencies, and estimated delivery date. I&#x27;ve learned to appreciate GANTT charts myself, too.)')
