Singular &quot;they&quot; has existed for about as long as Modern English, but generic &quot;he&quot; was significantly more common throughout the 20th century. Given how long idioms take to change, generally speaking, I think it should be unsurprising that this usage of generic &quot;he&quot; remains common.<p>The classic paper on this is &quot;Androcentrism in prescriptive grammar&quot;, from 1974, which presents the argument that singular &quot;they&quot; was more common before the prescriptive grammar movement in English, which greater increased how common generic &quot;he&quot; was[0].<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cambridge.org&#x2F;core&#x2F;journals&#x2F;language-in-society&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;androcentrism-in-prescriptive-grammar-singular-they-sexindefinite-he-and-he-or-she1&#x2F;5F82DDFEC41B3D2BC5E55C29B74310D1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cambridge.org&#x2F;core&#x2F;journals&#x2F;language-in-society&#x2F;...</a>')
