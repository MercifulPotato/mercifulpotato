Obviously living in London is not like living in some police state.<p>The same goes for China even. Public camera surveillance I think mostly does what it&#x27;s supposed to do with very little intrusion into people&#x27;s daily lives, in contrast to old school police stops and frisks. Travelling I&#x27;ve had more bad run ins with corrupt cops in Bulgaria than I had in Beijing.')
