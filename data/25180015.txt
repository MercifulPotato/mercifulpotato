And, that mostly relies on parents, role models, and culture.<p>The government forgiving debt one time isn&#x27;t going to cause to hurt personal responsibility. It is a small gift to try to fix a system that is super broken. And, it might be the only thing politically possible at this time (which sucks).<p>When I graduated I had ~$40k in debt, if $10k of that would have been forgiven I would have cried because it would have helped me so much. It also wouldn&#x27;t have changed the incredible lengths I went to paying that off as fast as possible. It also wouldn&#x27;t have caused me to make <i>more</i> financial mistakes during school that got me to that point. I did as well as I could have with my 17 to 23 year old lizard brain.<p>IMO I think it is a stupid move, because like you said it is unlikely to fix a broken system. I&#x27;d rather we spend the money to boost unemployment or give everyone making under $25k a year a lump sum. Both those would have a better effect on the short term economy to coast us through the current situation...')
