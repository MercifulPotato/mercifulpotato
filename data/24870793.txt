I say that as somebody who obtained a PhD in NMR spectroscopy and worked for 15 years on structural biology problems.<p>I&#x27;ve come to see SB as a visualization tool that helps form hypotheses, but not an actual method by which most protein structural&#x2F;function problems can be directly solved.<p>The techniques which seem to provide the most utility are fluorescent imaging with light microscopy, often at low magnification.  These are more amenable to scale-up and machine learning, both of which are likely to be necessary to unlock the next level of understanding biology.')
