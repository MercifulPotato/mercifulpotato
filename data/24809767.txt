I live in Brazil, and Slack is often somehow unavailable: images not loading, message delays, failure to load threads, and the built-in bot commands (not third parties) not responding. And mainly, voice calls having all sorts of connection issues imaginable.<p>In the last 3 months our team has had to (against company policy) fall back to Discord to be able to do our daily meetings about 6 or 7 times.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t run Discord on a large company either, but not for stability&#x27;s sake, but because their (free) screen sharing is possibly the worst if you want to share a desktop rather than a game (it is very much optimized for low delay, and the downscaling makes text unreadable).')
