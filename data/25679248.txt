What Tesla did with their high-performance EV cars was to prove that electric did not equate to a milk float, and they shut up the performance-car obsessed pistonheads and the car press with their 0-60 times.<p>But this is turning into a penis-waving &#x2F; megapixel arms race, where EV journalism is obsessed with only two metrics - range and performance.  We&#x27;re at the point now where EVs are generally faster than their ICE counterpart (due to smooth power application, consistent torque and no requirement for gear changes), with a range that will meet the needs of 95%+ of daily commutes.<p>There are a whole range of different types of EV vehicles, in terms of size, luxury, and purpose to meet different needs, but the reviews seem to obsess over a drag race.<p>What we need now is a good EV charging infrastructure.  Widely available rapid charging that will give your EV 2 hours of driving for 20 minutes will mitigate the need for bigger batteries.  And not just for Tesla.')
