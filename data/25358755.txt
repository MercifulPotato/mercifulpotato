E.g. i live near Glasgow, Scotland. There&#x27;s a few really cool Space firms here but the larger ones appear to have strong collaborative elements with other firms in Europe (and in some cases, ownership models now that span Europe).<p>In farming and food supply there&#x27;s a lot of large impactful collaboration across Europe.<p>Transport and logistics is another one where specialist firms, a lot of them Dutch for some reason, have all sorts of unexpected collaborations.<p>In Scotland we have a few small parts of Europe&#x27;s wind turbine manufacturing industry but that&#x27;s grown thanks to some euro collaborations.<p>There&#x27;s quite a lot if you scratch the surface.')
