With a traditional pension, the company needs to guarantee the availablity of funds for retirees. With a 401k, each individual employee is required to gamble their life savings on the stock market.<p>The result is that the company doesn&#x27;t need to give a damn about long-term stability, they can focus on short-term gains for a carousel of owners that each demands a quick return and cash out. As a bonus, the 401k system forces the government to bow to the whim of the stock market because every citizen is now clinging for dear life onto the same mechanism the owning class use to grow their hoards.<p>It&#x27;s a win-win-win for the rich:<p>* they don&#x27;t need to pay retirees<p>* they can squeeze more money out of companies at the expense of customers, workers, future owners, and the environment<p>* they can get leverage over the entire society by credibly threatening the lives of millions of retirees dependent on their table scraps')
