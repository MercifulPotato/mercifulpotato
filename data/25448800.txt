It&#x27;s REALLY not that hard to think for a second and remember why having a single file which can be:<p>- Edited, annotated and commented<p>- Approved with explicit markers<p>- Digitally signed by auditors and reviewers with tamper protection<p>- Rendered on anything that has a semblance of interactive UI with graceful degradation<p>- Archived on any kind of file storage<p>is insanely useful and valuable for massive worldwide industries.')
