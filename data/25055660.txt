We didn&#x27;t see any issues in any non-contested areas. We&#x27;re seeing serious problems in Detroit, Philly, Atlanta, Milwaukee, Las Vegas.<p>But we didn&#x27;t see any issues at all in Miami, or Cleveland, or Iowa City, or Cincinnati, or Dallas, or Nashville, or Houston. All of the other states and cities were able to get their ballots counted.<p>The irregularities in these key cities is highly suspected, especially after one State senate race was already overturned in a manual recount, where they discovered 6,000 votes were cast to the wrong presidential party due to &#x27;bugs&#x27; in the voting machine software .. and that software is used in 40+ counties. All of those votes are going to need to be manually counted now.<p>As more work is done and the recounts being, I predict the differences between the hand and machine counts is going to be a significant indicator of election interference.<p>This is on its way to be the most contested election in history.')
