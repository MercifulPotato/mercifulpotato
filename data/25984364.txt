Much larger than the few names that have been on the news recently. There have been plenty of believable reports about funds that already made crapton of money on this attempted squeeze. Now, that everyone&#x27;s eyes are on $GME, many more will make fortunes riding the stock down. Believe me, they are very happy about it. That kind of predictability on the market happens rarely, and is a gift for the funds.')
