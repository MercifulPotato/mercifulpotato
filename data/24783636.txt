Switching to USB-C now turns all the existing Lightning accessories into more e-waste and all the existing Lightning cables into e-waste. Given that wired charging will likely go away in a few years, it doesn&#x27;t really make sense to change everything to USB-C now just to make it go away altogether in either an environmental sense or a business sense.')
