Ironically I had planned on settling but instead came to realize what a great country I came from, Norway. America has many qualities but I had to see America to realize all the qualities of my own home country.<p>Health care was one of them. I never really liked health care in Norway. I didn&#x27;t think doctors was all that eager to help often. In the US I kind of experience the opposite, but I slowly realized there was a very dark side to this. All too often I saw that it was just a show to please the &quot;customer.&quot;<p>Basically in the US I saw little patient and health thinking and much more of a profit and customer thinking in health care. So often suggestions and procedures where obviously followed for pure profit motive. I discovered on may occasions how I would be given useless drugs and suggestions just to drive profits.<p>I think all health care systems are flawed in some way. Norwegian health care is no exception. But in the US I saw that it was possible to do much worse. The sad irony of this is that this happened while US doctors from my impression are exceptionally skilled. Problem is that they are in a system which push them to think about money rather than health care.<p>A US system where incentives go realigned to serve people rather than profits could quite possibly turn into one of the best health care systems in the world.')
