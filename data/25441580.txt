In economics, it&#x27;s possible to create a mathematical model that demonstrate anything you want. How was what John Von Newman said? &quot;Give me four parameters and I will fit an elephant&quot; or something like that.<p>The private sector invest to get profits. If it doesn&#x27;t get profits it will not invest.<p>If the private sector investment fall, and nothing compensate it, the GDP will fall.<p>If the GDP fall the population will suffer.<p>So, in order to keep the economy going, the government share of GDP will grow (we can see a good example now with the pandemic).<p>When those think tanks, like the one of your link, ask for a reduction of the government spending, normally what they are asking is put my profits before the welfare of the population. As they can&#x27;t say it that way, because it would be too obvious, they say: &quot;trickle down economics&quot;.')
