He was excited to show it off. It was embarrassing. It played the wrong song. He asked it to increase the volume, which it did on the second attempt, but then it was too loud to hear him give the command to decrease the volume. He tried stopping it with his phone and couldn&#x27;t. Ended up having to press a button on the thing (I think? Or he unplugged it). Quite literally the worst possible demo.')
