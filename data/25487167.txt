To be &quot;irresponsible&quot; one first needs a responsibility, and I don&#x27;t think Martin has any responsibility on the matter. He has no authority, he isn&#x27;t a historian or a linguist; he&#x27;s a storyteller.<p>I repeat, the most that can be inferred of him as a person regarding his story and his comments on it (based on what&#x27;s said on the matter in this article) is that he&#x27;s ignorant of his own ignorance, and a blowhard (IMO).<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think there is anywhere that Devereaux even implied <i>maliciousness</i>, just <i>irresponsibility</i> and <i>moral failing.</i><p>I don&#x27;t see how saying that someone has &quot;moral failings&quot; is not calling them &quot;malicious&quot;. At most, it can be argued that &quot;malicious&quot; is a stronger word, but at that point we&#x27;re arguing tone. The intent is similar.<p>For instance, I only used the word &quot;malice&quot; because that&#x27;s how the saying goes. It was a little hyperbolic in context, but you can replace &quot;malice&quot; with &quot;moral failing&quot; in my previous comment if you so wish[1]; I don&#x27;t think the message I was trying to send would change if so.<p>But that&#x27;s mostly beside the point, I take it you agree with my original comment then: the article does have a negative moral judgment of Martin. The person I originally replied to asserted that there wasn&#x27;t.<p>[1]: &quot;don&#x27;t attribute to moral failing what can be attributed to incompetence&quot;.')
