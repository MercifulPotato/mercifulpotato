If a new organization needs a large block of ip addresses, they just use IPv6. The biggest reason IPv4 persists is because deploying IPv6 can be very expensive for legacy users: new equipment, retraining, hiring. For a large organization, planning and executing such a deployment can take years. There are a lot of fresh new telecom providers in India who do not have that kind of baggage, so they chose to deploy IPv6 networks from the start for their cellular internet. You&#x27;ll notice that if you&#x27;re on a cellular network, even in the U.S., you will have an IPv6 address. If &quot;the market&quot; ever tries to price gouge for IPv4 addresses to the point where deploying IPv6 becomes the cheaper option, then organizations will just use IPv6 instead.')
