If the company has core expertise and advantages that can deliver a decisive win in a known-lucrative market, then it&#x27;s a no brainer. But if that&#x27;s not the case, why run around chasing shadows everywhere, instead of focusing on harvesting the markets where you&#x27;re already winning.<p><i>&quot;But if you don&#x27;t expand into other markets, you&#x27;ll eventually die!&quot;</i> Sure, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing. The purpose of a corporation isn&#x27;t to continue existing in perpetuity, but rather, to maximize returns for its investors. You found a gold mine? Great, go mine it until it runs dry, then close up shop and call it a day. There&#x27;s no need to spend half your profits on a wild-goose chase for other gold mines (blackberry investing in self-driving cars anyone?) - if that&#x27;s what I as an investor want, I can just use my dividends to invest in other companies or startups that are aiming to do exactly that.<p>I&#x27;d rather invest in a company that sticks to the things that it can reliably excel at, and direct its profits back to me, so that I can then invest it in other companies that I trust in other fields. A company that is spending half its profits trying to be something it&#x27;s not - that&#x27;s my worst nightmare as an investor.')
