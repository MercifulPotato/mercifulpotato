The persistent voice channel is the absolutely crucial benefit above and beyond the &quot;click-to-start-a-call&quot; UX on other platforms.<p>We only pay $75&#x2F;month, for two levels of server boosting. It&#x27;s so underpriced for the corporate usecase, it&#x27;s practically criminal. We&#x27;d probably be willing to pay four or five times as much, especially if it would allow us to host video&#x2F;screen-shares with more people.<p>I appreciate that Discord is gamer-focused branding, but their inability to launch more or less the same product under a professional brand is astounding. They&#x27;re leaving huge sums of money on the table. For example, being able to run a public Discord instance for customer support, with individual rooms per customer, and customer screen sharing and get <i>anybody</i> in the company to leave their team office on the private instance and join the support call in <i>two clicks</i> is <i>mind-blowing</i>.')
