It’s as impervious to censorship as the blockchain being used to directly store the short messages.<p>This is really quite a sensible approach for member.cash as it looks to gain a footing as a safe harbor for censored conservative voices.<p>Many are asking why not Mastodon. The “Member.cash” protocol could ship inside of a native desktop application which scans a general purpose blockchain <i>already on your computer</i> for embedded messages. Ideally this would be done with a thin client, so that nobody has to download terabytes of data.')
