Typically these things paid $2-4k&#x2F;month (not inflation adjusted). That said, these were all in suburban or urban areas, and if it’s easy enough to move it to your neighbor’s pole you might not have much negotiating power, but you might be able to get more from them if the lease expires while you still own the house.')
