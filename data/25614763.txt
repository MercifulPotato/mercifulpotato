I asked her, &quot;are you happy with the CCP government?&quot;<p>She said that people in China simply do not think of it in those terms. Being &quot;happy with the government&quot; struck her as a particularly Western way of framing the question. I pressed her further and asked if she thought that they governed in a way that improved people&#x27;s lives or made them worse. She said that she thought they improved people&#x27;s lives, and that a country like China needs a strong government to hold it together, and that the CCP is succeeding in that respect.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this is a representative view, but take it for what it is: an account of what a single Chinese lady told a random person on HN.')
