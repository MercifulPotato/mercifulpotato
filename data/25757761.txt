Seems incapable of fostering even the hardiest extremophiles, so the chance of astronauts leaving behind biological material, or dehydrated tardigrades trapped in epoxy doesn&#x27;t concern me too much.<p>But having said that, I do like to hope we will discover much, much more about our nearest neighbours and who knows? Maybe life is much more versatile than we know it to be now. I never want to see that pursuit muddied or compromised by negligence on our part.')
