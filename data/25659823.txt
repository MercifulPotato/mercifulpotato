The interviewer gave me a choice of languages, as I recall in fact he said &quot;use a language you&#x27;re comfortable with&quot; and I thought to myself, what does this prove?  I can google the answer and paste it in without him knowing.  Whereas, I can explain instantly how I would do it, too fast to have googled it, and he could maybe interactively ask me &quot;what about this condition? how would you check for errors?&quot; etc. The other thing is, he was unwilling to answer any of my questions until we got through this exercise, and I felt he was being rude and somewhat arrogant though I was being quite polite. I&#x27;m more than happy to show off my coding skills - I know lots of languages - just wanted to cut to the chase.  Maybe I was too impatient.  Or, you know, what they say about trusting the first impression is true!')
