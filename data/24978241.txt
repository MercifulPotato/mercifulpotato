Conclusions based on it occasionally resembling reality are exceedingly rare and merely coincidental - it&#x27;s like a form of astrology with more equations and charts.<p>And the real clincher is the advocates are only interested in defending their ideological agenda like some kind of religious zealot.<p>When anyone walks in thinking they already have the answer before hearing any of the questions, watch out - especially if it&#x27;s the same exact answer every time.')
