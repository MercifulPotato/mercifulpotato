Anecdata: I was a mechanic quite a while, and while my coworkers were decent, I know that there were enough other shitty people in the trade that none of the parts stores in town could keep a female delivery driver on staff. I never knew of a female delivery driver that lasted over 2 months; and I had 2 black drivers comment along the lines of &quot;those jackasses as shop X called me a n* b&#x2F;c we didn&#x27;t have something in stock&quot;. Delivery drivers weren&#x27;t especially high-turnover positions, normally drivers lasted long enough I would end up knowing them by name.<p>And even though I felt my coworkers were somewhat OK, they would still make remarks (especially homophobic &amp; racist ones) that would be at least grounds for disciplinary action in most white collar fields.<p>That (along with RSI and the pay) was one of the reasons I left the trade. I enjoyed the job, it is really satisfying to have that sense of accomplishment at the end of the day, but I was frankly tired of having to be around&#x2F;associated with crappy people.')
