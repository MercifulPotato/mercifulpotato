I wrote a web interface for a crappy 20yo DSP last year, the thing doesn&#x27;t even have an MMU and only 32MB of RAM. I basically put all the code in the browser, on the device there&#x27;s only a very simple C HTTP server that serves the static files and blobs of data. In the end the UI looks fairly modern and responsive even though the backend is potato hardware.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say that client-side JS is underrated though. If anything I&#x27;d argue that the modern web heavily abuses it. Try browsing twitter or youtube with Javascript disabled for instance. The site simply won&#x27;t work.')
