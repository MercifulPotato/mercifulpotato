These include ... Sweden&quot; and it lost the sight of the forest for the trees.<p>If you can&#x27;t go to the doctor, can&#x27;t buy products in stores that have an 18+ requirement, can&#x27;t vote, can&#x27;t drive, can&#x27;t travel, can&#x27;t buy a train or buss ticket, can&#x27;t get social security unless you fight with bureaucracy for several years and still likely loose, can&#x27;t have an bank account, can&#x27;t buy a card at a swim&#x2F;gym, well, home much of a voluntary scheme is that? I guess there is voluntary, and then there is voluntary. In a similar way its voluntary to have an bank account but you can&#x27;t pay rent, get social security money, get paid (by most companies), buy products in what seems to be the majority of stores, or travel by buss&#x2F;train&#x2F;plane unless you got a bank account. It is voluntary in terms that you will not end up in jail if you don&#x27;t have it, but living without is made extremely difficult.<p>It is interesting that in UK, the requirement for ID card during elections depend on where you live. Northern Ireland must have it, while England, Wales or Scotland do not require it.<p>Going back to the Scandinavian countries, Norway which do not have an national identity cards do still require a photo ID when voting. Instead of a national id card they use their passport, driver license or banking ID, in which case one of those serve the purpose of authentication.')
