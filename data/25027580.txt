Item(by='simonebrunozzi', descendants=None, kids=[25029454], score=None, time=1604859300, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25026446, text='I have been an operating partner at an investment firm &#x2F; VC firm for the past ~1.5 years, and have co-founded a micro-VC firm [0] with two other friends 6 years ago. This is to give you a sense of my limited, but higher-than-zero experience in the field.<p>It seems to me that VCs gain mostly from informational asymmetry, and from some form of arbitrage. Most VCs are punished or rewarded over the course of several years, that&#x27;s why reputation and &quot;fame&quot; are still fairly important in the VC world.<p>Lately I&#x27;ve been thinking about how I would start a new VC firm knowing what I know now, and how I would make it different (better) than any other VC firm out there. It actually is a very, very interesting mental exercise.<p>I don&#x27;t have an answer for you (btw, if you&#x27;d like to brainstorm this with me, feel free to reach out, contact details are in my HN profile), but I&#x27;d probably start by asking several startup founders what they would like in an ideal VC firm. I would then ask several LPs, even though I suspect this aspect boils down to &quot;convince me you&#x27;re going to make me more money&quot;.<p>Anyway... thoughts? Things I should read? People I should talk to?<p>[0]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;m14t.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;m14t.com&#x2F;</a>')
