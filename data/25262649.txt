Why are there still weeding-out classes? How many doctors, surgeons, programmers, engineers would there be in the world if it wasn&#x27;t for these classes? The Montessori education system and the like seem so superior. College should be pass&#x2F;fail.<p>Honestly, that&#x27;s typical of most Biology lower division courses. The theory goes &#x27;if you cannot pass this, you have no chance of the MCAT.&#x27; which may be true but some of us had no desire to be a physician. Someone replied to such an absurd structure explained to me that&#x27;s &#x27;how the system works.&#x27; Many of us that finally passed would not have anything directly to do with medicine and would AT BEST be considered ancillary service status to Medicine, and we were not amused. I personally will only take Industry-centric certifications, and I will never consider going back for anything degree related.<p>Google really is making the smartest move out of all the FAANG corps in that regard, by placing grater value on their own rather than degrees.<p>With that said, that&#x27;s really what its there to do, isolate those who can commit to high loads of dated and rather antiqued (my near College credit HS Biology graded us on Kingdoms as Domains were already well established in the University lectures I attended) rote learning the best and &#x27;thining the heard&#x27; for the upper-divisions which were super-capped when I was in University as all fields in Biology were impacted.<p>I at least thought now with Online learning being the default for so many it&#x27;s sad to see the tech still hasn&#x27;t solved this problem of mainly distribution&#x2F;class seats.<p>I think it&#x27;s one of the 2 elite schools in the UK (Cambridge or Oxford) that have an actual in-person skill assessment for your final rather than a test and most of your grade depends on that. My Inorganic Chemistry professor said his final exams were always the most preferable, albeit impractical, way to go about it. As a regular at his office hour lectures, I wish I had the pleasure of seeing what that may have been like.<p>&gt; My SO once TA&#x27;d for a pre-med class. Holy hell, the students were something else as compared to other disciplines.<p>Been there, seen that as a Biology major just trying to get my foot in the door to get a graded paper during office hours. It&#x27;s really sad now that I think about it as an adult that left the Industry long ago, you have no idea the weight on those kids shoulders to make it pass the openly touted &#x27;filter&#x27; process, be it self-imposed or from their family. Its a sad reality how few end up using it all in these 2 horrible job markets for young inexperienced graduates.<p>My heart goes out to anyone who has to graduate in this Market, 2008 was bad but I think this may end up being worse as automation wasn&#x27;t as big of threat as it was in 2008 as it is now in 2020 with COVID.<p>PS: Also, its well known amongst Biology majors that adderall abuse doesn&#x27;t just start in Medschool, its a well established habit by undergrad possibly even the HS level for some.')
