Item(by='aranelsurion', descendants=None, kids=[24676089], score=None, time=1601730493, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24669734, text='&gt; Game modding is often brought up as another use case, but straight piracy often requires additional effort over just modding games for technical reasons (you need to bypass game authentication and&#x2F;or redirect all file access, not just the modded bits), so I don&#x27;t buy that argument.<p>Yet once you disable signature checks in your OS, it could be used by the user for any purpose, no? Isn&#x27;t that the main point of rooting your device, having ability to do whatever.<p>Then it comes to where you draw a line. If you allow me to run any program w&#x2F;o checks, I can install RetroArch for emulation, or a save manager to save me from NSO tax, so I can backup my saves without paying a monthly fee. If you allow me to run kernel extensions, I can do stuff like overclocking or use my xbox gamepad with nintendo console, and if you unlock the bootloader, I can boot into Android.<p>Once you unlock all those capabilities to a point where I can boot any OS, you&#x27;d essentially turn a purpose-built device to a general-purpose computer, and building general purpose computers is not a crime (yet? :). I don&#x27;t see PC makers or Microsoft being accused of enabling piracy, yet their platforms have the same freedoms.')
