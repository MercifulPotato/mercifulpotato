Item(by='kazinator', descendants=None, kids=[24772442], score=None, time=1602635902, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24771271, text='How about this: let&#x27;s retire &quot;begging the question&quot; entirely.<p>It&#x27;s an awkward phrase, which doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense with respect to either of its intended meanings. The original meaning is rooted in mistranslation of Greek to Latin to English, so it can hardly be upheld as correct in any sense.<p>The &quot;raises the question&quot; meaning is more plausibly connected to the plain syntax of the phrase, in fact. That misuse exists precisely because that&#x27;s how native English speakers hear it, when they are not familiar with the clumsy idiom from the realm of formal reasoning.<p>To say that &quot;beg the question&quot; cannot mean &quot;raise the question&quot; is a bit like saying that one cannot say &quot;kick the bucket&quot; to describe the action of kicking a bucket, because someone has already decided that it&#x27;s an idiom meaning &quot;to die&quot;. Except that &quot;to kick the bucket&quot; is perfectly grammatical, whereas &quot;to beg the question&quot;  isn&#x27;t, because the direct object of &quot;to beg&quot; has to be an agent which can grant a wish or supply something. The correct syntax would be &quot;to beg for the question (to be asked)&quot;. &quot;The point you have raised practically begs for the question to be raised that ... blah blah&quot;.<p>Thus, it may be time to lay &quot;begging the question&quot; to rest. A good way to do that may be to declare it archaic.')
