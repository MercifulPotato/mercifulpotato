But it&#x27;s not right. It&#x27;s always been an artificial interpretation <i>superimposed</i> on reality. It&#x27;s never been reality itself.<p>Pirsig continues:<p>&gt; When this duality is completely accepted a certain nondivided relationship between the mechanic and the motorcycle, a craftsmanlike feeling for the world, is destroyed. When traditional rationality divides the world up into subjects and objects it shuts out Quality, and when you&#x27;re really stuck it&#x27;s Quality, not subjects or objects, that tells you where you ought to go.<p>Pirsig concludes:<p>&gt; By returning our attention to Quality it is hoped that we can get technological work out of the noncaring subject-object dualism and back into craftsmanlike self-involved reality again, which will reveal to us the facts we need when we are stuck.<p>What Pirsig is saying, in this case, is that trying to have good ideas isn&#x27;t helpful because you&#x27;re still stuck in a mindset where you are distinct from your ideas. Instead, you need to <i>embody</i> your ideas somehow; you need to remove the barrier between you and what you&#x27;re thinking about.')
