If you did amniocentesis on all babies, it would of course increase the diagnosis rate even more.<p>Whether this is a bad thing, as he claims, depends on whether you believe screening was being done optimally before, and that will depend quite a bit on things left out like the utility of not having a Down baby. (He doesn&#x27;t present his working out the entire scenario, as it&#x27;s just an aside, but hopefully before Jordan went around telling people how to change their prenatal screening systems, he did work it out a little bit more than back-of-the-envelope.)')
