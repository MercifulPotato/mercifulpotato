Looking at or working with the &#x27;dual&#x27; of something can give additional insight or allow another way of working. For example, Fourier Transform can be considered a type of duality.<p>I&#x27;m not clear what computational techniques are expected here - I personally don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a very well-formed problem.')
