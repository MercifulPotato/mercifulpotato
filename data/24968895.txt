How long until Silicon Valley eats that industry?<p>I can imagine lifelike movies that render characters to the users preference in real-time.<p>Talk about “representation”!<p>I can imagine as well dialects, language, etc being rendered in real time to adapt to what the user prefers. You and another person could watch the same film and talk about the same story but have totally different experiences on what the characters looked like, talked like, and even said within some parameters.<p>Making a movie with humans will be a prestige event like riding horses today or driving an ICE in the future. They don’t be able to compete with rendered film at a mass scale due to cost. Rendered films could be built and distributed cheaply and cost a fraction of a real movie to watch.')
