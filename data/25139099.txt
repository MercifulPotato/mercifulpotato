There&#x27;s nothing they just clearly do better than the competition(except having more memory, which is kind of indirectly is analogous with Ryzen generally having more cores than the Intel chips in the same price tier), and still somethings they do a bit poorly in, but AMD is no longer embarrassingly behind. Of course this may not pan out the same way as Nvidia isn&#x27;t up against the same kind of wall Intel was in the CPU market, so AMD might have a tougher time keeping up, but I&#x27;m hopeful that competition is back in the GPU market and will stick around.')
