That is what a government is for after all.<p>To be clear, i think airbnbs should be subject to appropriate taxes in order to pay their share of that sort of thing.<p>I&#x27;m also not sure why this would be such an issue with airbnb relative to normal long term rentals. Its not like an airbnb uses roads &amp; electric grids differently than a normal tenant.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not opposed to Airbnb as long as they are subject to the exact same standards and laws as hotels<p>Why not the same standard as BnB&#x27;s or traditional short term rentals of small dwellings? Its not like hotels have ever had a monopoly on short term rentals to tourists.')
