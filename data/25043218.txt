Full armor is effective in the context of a larger fight.<p>Individually, a knight on foot isn&#x27;t catching anyone and can probably be poked until exhausted with any stick longer than whatever weapon he&#x27;s carrying.<p>Mounted, someone in the ground has little to no chance at all if the horse is capable of moving.  On clear ground, the horse is the weapon.<p>From the wiki page on Agincourt:<p>&quot;Recent heavy rain made the battle field very muddy, proving very tiring to walk through in full plate armour. The French monk of St. Denis describes the French troops as &quot;marching through the middle of the mud where they sank up to their knees. So they were already overcome with fatigue even before they advanced against the enemy&quot;. The deep, soft mud particularly favoured the English force because, once knocked to the ground, the heavily armoured French knights had a hard time getting back up to fight in the mêlée. Barker states that some knights, encumbered by their armour, actually drowned in their helmets.[&quot;')
