As a business owner, you have the freedom to go this route. As a public company, you also have the freedom to go this route as long as the board&#x2F;shareholders agree (as they did in Amazon&#x27;s case.)<p>If a business owner wants to re-invest for growth and shareholders agree I do not see an issue. Without that, we would never have Amazon, FB, MSFT, or almost any large company (whatever you think of these companies aside)<p>As an Engineer, I think re-investment is awesome. Compare this to the old mentality of squeezing a company until it has no blood left (as Private Equity companies often do.) As long as the company is profitable and re-investing, this is a huge net value to society IMHO.')
