It’s definitely a gamble. Unfortunately, people just out of school lack the experience to judge, so some get lucky and some get taken advantage of. My advice is to treat options like a lottery ticket, make sure you get paid well in cash, and then startups can be a heck of a lot of fun. They won’t pay a google compensation, but enough to be comfortable, and hey, maybe you get lucky!<p>Early non-founder employees do tend to get screwed relative to the business vultures who show up later, the CTO getting $10 million&#x2F;year brought on after the company has gone public but did nothing to get it there is just wasteful corporate cronyism.')
