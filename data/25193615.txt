Those overarching rights are still a patchwork between states.  Many states give protections that go beyond the requirements in the US Constitution -- this is completely legal and not uncommon.  The Bill of Rights mainly defines which laws are illegal -- it does <i>not</i> prescribe what <i>is</i> legal.<p>This is currently what is the case with shall-issue vs may-issue, at least until SCOTUS clarifies otherwise.')
