It felt pretty good.  At first.  Then I felt worse.  WAY worse because I knew I had hurt the person I had yelled at.<p>So I think you&#x27;re right that while it is a release, it&#x27;s an anti-productive one.<p>One analogy I saw once likened it to having a balloon.  You forgot to take out the trash this morning--the balloon got blown up a little.  You got stuck in traffic--the balloon got blown up a little more.  All those little things happening throughout the day and blowing up that balloon a little bit more each time and pretty soon that balloon is going to violently pop.  We can choose things in our life that release that balloon periodically however, and in doing so it never gets so full that it pops.<p>To me, there is no difference between lashing out online or in person and is more akin to that balloon popping (or, at the very least, adding air to it) than it is releasing air from it.')
