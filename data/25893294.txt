Modern administrations on the right consistently outspend modern administrations on the left for example. Which would have been unthinkable 50 years ago, but happens regularly today because on the right there are now different driving priorities.<p>All of which is fine. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with any of that so long as those on the right are representing the interests of their supporters. Like it or not, that&#x27;s what democracy is about. But it leaves many, many people in society with no &quot;political home&quot; so to speak.')
