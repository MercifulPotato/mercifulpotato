Any one who has ever built anything beyond examples and tutorials, something production worthy and used by hundreds of people - they will attest to how immature Julia is.<p>That&#x27;s not the fault of the programming language per se... just that it takes 10+ years to get up to speed in terms of tooling and engineering worthiness.<p>In addition, there are a lot of problems with the language itself some of which are highlighted in the top comment of this thread.')
