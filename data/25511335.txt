Bitcoin is not a security because it hasn&#x27;t been issued to collect funding.<p>To me the distinction is very clear and simple. However if I really needed money I still would probably issue an ICO and claim it is not a security because there is a big possibility that it will go unnoticed as SEC goes only after the bigger fish.')
