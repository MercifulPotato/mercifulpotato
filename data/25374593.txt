The problem is that it&#x27;s no longer disqualifying.<p>If one person believes the Earth is flat, that&#x27;s not an issue. The problem is that much of the country has organized itself into information bubbles. Those bubbles can be large enough to span entire congressional districts and even entire states. Those states elect representatives and senators. These days, the Senate and House can be split by a single vote on some issues. We live in a world where there&#x27;s a very real possibility that a state will elect someone to office who believes things as wild as &quot;the Earth is flat&quot; and they will be the deciding voice on critical issues facing us today.')
