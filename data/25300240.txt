My work pc is a hp probook 430 g5 (~2 years old) with a matte screen.<p>The one that I would take out in the garden when it was sunny was the mac. Sure, I could see myself in it, I had to set the backlight to 100%, but it was possible to focus my eyes such that the text on screen was actually readable. Of course, this implies black text on white background and to sit in such a way as  not to have too contrasty a background.<p>The matte screen of the HP was completely useless. It was just a big blotch of white, it was next to impossible to see the text. I even took out an actual external monitor once to try it out, a Dell P2415Q with a backlight that&#x27;s blinding inside. Same problem.<p>Now sure, when there&#x27;s not a high level of ambient light, the matte screen is more easy to use as there are no reflections. But as soon as there&#x27;s a source of light that shines on it (and there are cases when you can&#x27;t control it) it&#x27;s game over.<p>Protip: clean the macbook screen from time to time. Even if it doesn&#x27;t <i>look</i> dirty. I wear glasses, so I use the cleaning spray on the screen. It always amazes me how much better it is afterwards.')
