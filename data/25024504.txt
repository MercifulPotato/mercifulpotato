He has authored a number of books in cryptography, and has thought cryptography in major places. He has been involved in the creation of many cryptographic algorithms. His contributions have been mostly in the area of symmetric crypto, but that doesn’t imply that he doesn’t understands well asymmetric crypto, especially the RSA.
