Even if we manage to terraform Mars, it&#x27;ll still be a tough place to live.<p>Space stations however - you can make them however you want.  I&#x27;ve seen concepts of rotating habits that are so massive that there&#x27;s no &quot;roof&quot; on the inner-side, only walls to stop the atmosphere leaking out.  No idea if that would actually work or not, but it looked cool.')
