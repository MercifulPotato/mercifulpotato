But that isn&#x27;t what he said. He just said &quot;and get into a really provocative situation&quot;. He also said he hadn&#x27;t changed his mind from when he said &quot;If a woman is a bitch, or hysterical, or bloody-minded continually, then Iâ€™d do it.&quot;<p>Reacting to verbal abuse with physical abuse usually just escalates the situation. So it would be bad advice even if he meant what you think he did.')
