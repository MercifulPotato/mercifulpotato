Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611806392, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25935222, text='&gt; If you set it up to sell when the prices drops to $320, you are guaranteed that it will sell at a price below $320, not that it will sell at $320.<p>IIRC, that’s closer than the naive interpretation (“you will sell at exactly $320 if the price drops to or below that level”), but it&#x27;s still not quite right. Unless I&#x27;m mistaken, a stop-loss @ $320 is actually “if the price is at or below $320, submit a market sell order”. In theory, it could execute above $320, though at or below is vastly more likely. And, as you note, you aren&#x27;t guaranteed it will execute at all.')
