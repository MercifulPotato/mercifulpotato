Anecdotes are not theorems, invalidated by one infidelity. Your objections are pedantic and irrelevant to the author&#x27;s purpose in relating it.<p>Furhermore:<p>&gt; Stocking up a cave with food...<p><i>According to the driver, the women would reportedly illegally cross the river to prostitute themselves in China before the winter to obtain rice to survive.</i><p>&gt;... keeping a small fire going inside with whatever flammable material is available...<p><i>and the nearby land so denuded of firewood that they would otherwise freeze to death.</i><p>&gt;...eating little and sleeping a lot to make the food last longer.<p>Well, yes - that was apparently the point of relating this anecdote. As we can see, the story as presented is close to what you consider plausible, especially as we know there actually was a severe multi-year famine in North Korea not so long ago.')
