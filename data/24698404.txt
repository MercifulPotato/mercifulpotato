The inventions you are talking about are a product of both hard work and laziness.</i><p>The kind of &quot;doing nothing&quot; that helps with creative thinking is very different from the kind of &quot;doing nothing&quot; that results from laziness.<p>&gt; <i>On a less serious note, I&#x27;d say that 90% of my programming work is driven by laziness. For instance, I test things in advance or design them in a certain way so I don&#x27;t need to worry about them in the future.</i><p>That&#x27;s not being lazy, that&#x27;s long-term thinking and defering gratification â€“ which is the opposite of what people typically mean by the term &quot;laziness&quot;. In your post, you&#x27;re conflating two concepts:<p>1) Defering productive work until a later time to free time for near-term non-productive activities (&quot;being lazy&quot;).<p>2) Spending more resources (time, energy) near-term to be more efficient overall (&quot;being inventive&quot;).')
