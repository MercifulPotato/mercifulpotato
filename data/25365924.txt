Like the only reason a new apartment is so expensive is because it has a gold-plated toilet or something, and if only the developer had built an apartment without a gold plated toilet you could afford it. But in Minneapolis, for example, a 2 bedroom apartment in the nicest building in the city, with a built in pool, car wash, and cigar lounge, is $2000 per month. That barely gets you a spot in someone&#x27;s living room in SF.<p>This proves that it is not luxuries that make &quot;luxury apartments&quot; expensive in SF. The only luxury is having a roof over your head.')
