My thinking is &quot;possibly, but likely to a lesser degree&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;m convinced that if some developer had sought to replace svn by thinking <i>directly</i> in your terms-- i.e., how can I seek to decentralize this thing-- they would have ended up with a complicated mess of a system which would be even worse at handling issues of data integrity for the end user.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the fetish for decentralization. Why isn&#x27;t the focus instead on finding the low hanging fruit of simple, centralized software which can be easily tested and quickly deployed to defend against the dark patterns we know are used to manipulate people online?<p>With all the (duplicated) effort to build decentralized systems that necessarily rely on gold being found at the end of open research rainbows, we could instead already have a deep set of contingencies for, say, the impending milestone when Google finally defeats the ad blockers that keep HN in its cush little bubble.')
