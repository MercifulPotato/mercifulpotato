Item(by='dfabulich', descendants=None, kids=[25451458], score=None, time=1608167385, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25450158, text='&gt; SHA-1 is only broken for collisions<p>Only… broken… for… collisions.<p>This is going to be my last reply to you, because this response is so confused that I think you&#x27;re beyond help.<p>SHA-1 is used to validate long messages.<p>1. The sender, Alice, computes the (relatively short) SHA-1 hash H of a long message M<p>2. Alice cryptographically signs the hash H with a signature S<p>3. Bob can verify the whole message by verifying that the hash H is correctly signed, and then re-computing the SHA-1 of the entire message M, to verify that his computed hash matches Alice&#x27;s hash H.<p>If Eve can compute a &quot;SHA-1 collision,&quot; Eve can make a fake package X (like, say, malware instead of a real software package) that has the same hash H as the message M that Alice has signed. With that, Eve can trick Bob into accepting her malware by presenting Bob with her fake message X and Alice&#x27;s real signature S. This works, because Alice really did sign hash H, and X and M have the same hash; their signatures have &quot;collided&quot; with catastrophic results.<p>To say that SHA-1 is &quot;only broken for collisions&quot; is to say that SHA-1 is broken for <i>PGP.</i><p>Anyway, I&#x27;m done here. I hope we both agree that you deserve PGP.')
