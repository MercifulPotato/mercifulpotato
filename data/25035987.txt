The CP world is a hivemind, and there are some weaponized autists in there who have compiled information and articles <i>for years</i>, and certainly know the actual science behind vaccines &amp; their historic risks far beyond what your typical self-proclaimed scientific-thinker <i>thinks</i> they know.  So when propaganda hit pieces like this come out in that world, and someone drops a bomb of 50+ contradicting factual articles into the thread, opinions are formed and solidified.<p>It&#x27;s a shame so many adults seem to have forgotten what their parents told them about lying.')
