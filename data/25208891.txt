There is nothing &quot;uniform&quot; about the news provided by MSNBC and OANN. Though I imagine that what we have now is not the kind of diversity of thought that Chomsky was hoping for.<p>I&#x27;ve never heard of OANN until like yesterday. So I&#x27;m very curious where it&#x27;s coming from. Wiki suggests it has been around for 7 years but I&#x27;m guessing it gets no views. Chomsky is not referring to some tiny venue.<p>He&#x27;s talking about PBS, NPR, Fox, msnbc, News corp, ATT, time, CBS, and Disney.<p>They are virtually all the same. The beauty of capitalism is when something like this happens, if you can provide a new product that isn&#x27;t what everyone else is providing. You can crush the competition. Hence why suddenly OANN is a thing? Though I&#x27;m looking at their wikipedia and apparently all they do is report on &#x27;conspiracy theories&#x27;.<p>Which makes sense to me. Anyone outside the unification will be attacked as such.')
