Perhaps in another reality or dimension it is conceivable for people to come together and form a truly resourceful world government.<p>Wait till you see how the lack of world coordination keeps this virus thriving in half of the planet.

The UK had it long coming, the country lives in the 19th century, never moved towards becoming a modern republic. And now, people are shocked we voted out of the EU.
