It&#x27;s not surprising that for inputs satisfying an inequality, the result also satisfies one. A simpler example is: If I subtract 1 from a positive integer, is the result always positive? That also has an exception. That&#x27;s all due to 1 being an exceptional (the smallest possible) positive integer. Similar to how 0 is an exceptional natural number.')
