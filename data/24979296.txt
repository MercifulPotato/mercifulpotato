It primarily affects poorer consumers since it is effectively a tax on the end user rather than the company.<p>- Some countries aren&#x27;t free to set their own rates. For example, in the EU the standard rate cannot be set below 15% without first changing EU law (and convincing a majority of Member States to agree to do that) so it&#x27;s not very competitive.')
