Partially because, well, here you are, ostensibly arguing for higher taxes, but also because the effective tax rates (in the US) on individuals have skyrocketed by... ~2% since 1979? It&#x27;s hardly like the vast populace is voting anti-tax consistently - that flies in the face of both tax rate history and government spending (and the populist movement in general!). So, TLDR: _some voters_ will always vote for lower taxes.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.taxpolicycenter.org&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;historical-average-federal-tax-rates-all-households" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.taxpolicycenter.org&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;historical-averag...</a>')
