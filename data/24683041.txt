In france you can be tied up in litigation (tribunel through appeals) for 10 years easily on an employment termination (my info is from 2016 time frame so may be dated). There is no such thing as at-will employment.<p>Also, noncompete&#x27;s are weird. If someone is receiving full pay on gardening leave they can work for someone else. If you instead have them work till end of notice period you can usually pay some % of salary (ie, 50%) to totally block their ability to work for any competitor.<p>So you can&#x27;t fire the horrible workers (without insane headaches) and you CAN block good workers from moving too quickly to competitors (ie, take a year or two out of their working life for a price - which is usually tied to cash salary and is low). All to say - not the fluid labor environment that startups would generally be at home in.')
