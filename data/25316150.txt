This has to be considered.<p>I&#x27;d personally ramp up non-smoker protections first in particular protections for kids (even within their own families), and then ramp up measures to prevent people from starting to smoke, like a ban on advertisements for smoking, a ban of &quot;branding&quot; on cigarette packs, making access to cigarettes harder. Measures and even incentirives to help people stop or at least reduce smoking will also help.')
