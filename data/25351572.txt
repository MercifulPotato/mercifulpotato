Item(by='nomy99', descendants=None, kids=[25356447], score=None, time=1607462770, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25345511, text='the current airpod pro&#x27;s don&#x27;t &quot;just work&quot;. On numerous occasions the right&#x2F;left airpod gets unpaired. The charge level of each piece is independent, which is odd considering both are placed in&#x2F;out of ear simultaneously. There are even issues with the UI on the iphone to show the charge level. I have to open&#x2F;close between 2-3 times to be prompted with the screen.<p>Having said that, as a whole, the airpods do &quot;just work&quot; more than other bluetooth headphones, especially with the case that holds a charge.')
