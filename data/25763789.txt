There&#x27;s a lot of rumors and the prefered one it&#x27;s Apple make too much money of apps and if they gave the PWAs the possibility to receive notifications this will hurt them. But I don&#x27;t rly believe that. Pwa are great but not rly ready to replace native apps. We always have clients that want native apps even if a basic web site (not a pwa) do the trick.<p>&gt; Are there workarounds?<p>None.<p>&gt; If this doesn&#x27;t exist, should it? And would people pay for it?<p>I&#x27;ve already ear that solution (here I think?). But yeah if this doesn&#x27;t exist it should be invented. And if ppl don&#x27;t want to pay for it, you can have a free version with sponsored notifications.')
