What I really can&#x27;t stand about tipping is that most of the time it goes to some dumb &quot;tip share&quot; scheme.<p>My wife (then GF) worked at several restaurants in college and they all had tip shares.  Even hosts and kitchen staff were included in the share.  They were all payed under minimum wage, but the restaurant had to pay the difference if the tips alone didn&#x27;t bring their wages up to the minimum (which happened more often than not).<p>I realized that when I tip, I&#x27;m usually not rewarding the waiter&#x2F;waitress.  That reward usually gets split across dozens of people and my waiter&#x2F;waitress likely sees none of it.  Worse still, most of the time it isn&#x27;t even a bonus to their wage.  The $5&#x2F;hr-ish is effectively deducted from their tips so I&#x27;m just paying their wages so the restaurant doesn&#x27;t have to.<p>What a scam.  Regardless what you think of tipping, tip shares should absolutely be illegal.')
