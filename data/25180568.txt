For a PM it might be: identify a problem based on data or customer feedback, conduct user research, ideate with design, get input from external stakeholders, build with engineering, run an A&#x2F;B test and rollout successful variant.  All of these things may be necessary activities in different contexts, but it&#x27;s also very easy to lose the forest for the trees.  The bigger and more complex a company gets, the easier it is to get lost in the process and over-index on the wrong details.  I can&#x27;t count the number of times I&#x27;ve heard lip-service played to &quot;being data-driven&quot; as an excuse to avoid tackling the bigger but less quantifiable problems of how a product is failing to meets its customers&#x27; high-level needs.')
