Item(by='buran77', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609848217, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25644223, text='&gt; You&#x27;re making a claim<p>My claims are common sense and supported by the real life: regular people don&#x27;t know what ECC is, and those who do find the problem&#x27;s impact is too minor to get palpable benefits from fixing it. Why are you being pedantic if you aren&#x27;t actually going to bring arguments at the same level you expect from me?<p>&gt; If you actually do a fair test, and put them side by side while explaining that one protects them from memory errors and the other looks cooler, you can&#x27;t assume they&#x27;ll all pick the LED.<p>Isn&#x27;t this exactly the kind of claim you yourself characterize one paragraph above as &quot;useless&quot; because &quot;you have no related data, and logic could support multiple outcomes&quot;? Sure, if people were more tech-educated then my assumption might be wrong. But people aren&#x27;t more educated so...<p>The benefits of LEDs are hard to miss (light) all the time. The benefits of ECC are hard to observe even in that fraction of a percent of the time. Human cellular &quot;bitflips&quot; happen every hour but they don&#x27;t visibly affect you so you also consider it&#x27;s not an issue that demands more attention, like constant solar protection. People aren&#x27;t keen on paying to solve problems they never <i>suffered</i> from, or even noticed, especially when you tell them they happen so often still with no obvious impact. Unless they have no choice, like OEMs selling ECC RAM only devices.<p>Sell me ECC memory when my (actual real life) 10 year old desktop or 5 year old phone never glitched. Sell me ECC RAM when my Matlab calculations come back different every time. See the difference?<p>&gt; When people never even think of ECC, that is not evidence that they wouldn&#x27;t care or know about it in a head-to-head competition.<p>Well then, I guess none of us has any evidence except today people buy LEDs not ECC RAM. Educate people or wait until manufacturing process and design are so susceptible to bitflips that people <i>notice</i> and it will be a different conversation.')
