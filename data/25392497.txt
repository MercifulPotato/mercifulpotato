I will be very happy to see human studies that prove otherwise. It&#x27;s be shown that AZD1222-vaccinated macaques still spread virus, with upper respiratory viral loads the same as controls.<p>From a personal perspective, no, because my age-based health risk, and my local community transmission rates approach zero, so vaccination has negligible upside at this point in time and space for me.<p>I might see data that could change either perspective and my willingness to be vaccinated. Also if I need to travel internationally I may be willing or forced to do so.')
