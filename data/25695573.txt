People’s words are rarely as enlightening about their value system as their actions. By promoting the posting of bail for those arrested during protests in which much harm was caused those that promoted that bailout show that they are interested in continuing those actions. If Democrats such as Sen Harris held as a value the true problem of process as punishment and the unfair cash bail, there was plenty of time before and after that point in history to promote it. By choosing that point in time they actions spoke louder than words as to what they value.<p>I’m glad that the president elect has spoken against cash bail although it seems to be a subject out of his federal expertise.<p>NPR and particular parts of the organization are ostensibly nonpartisan but are in such alignment with Democratic Party positions value-wise that the assertion of nonpartisanship is a distinction is without a difference. I write and think that as a lifelong listener. By promoting “In Defence of Looting” when they did it was clear that it wasn’t a random book review but an editorial statement of what behavior was acceptable and a dramatic non-denunciation of extra-legal actions taken by people peripheral to the protests of the period.<p>Would you be willing to wager something about some concrete action a Biden administration could take about cash bail that would indicate a care for the topic outside of the quadrennial BLM protests? It might be a block grant to assist municipalities in decreasing cash bail or a regulatory restriction on funding that encouraged the same, or some other class of concrete action that wasn’t just words.')
