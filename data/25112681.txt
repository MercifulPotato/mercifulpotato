And probably a few others as well, I&#x27;d expect any website connected to Århus to use some other similar spelling.<p>Also LinkedIn doesn&#x27;t seem very easy to deal with in general. I&#x27;ve been trying to find a way to categorize my contacts since forever (personal&#x2F;business&#x2F;school), but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way. All the boards where people write have some rep pasting in a standard non-answer.')
