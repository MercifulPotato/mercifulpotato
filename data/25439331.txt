(I am a math major).<p>However, most of the people I interact with find my exposition methods curious in sense of structure. So, I shared this study with some of my friends, and they agreed with the study too. When I pointed out my surprise to them, they told me that I speak like a computer program in the sense of structure of exposition.<p>So, I guess I agree with this study in general, and actually would love to know what&#x27;s going on in my brain.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I am fluent in 4 natural languages from two different families and I&#x27;m learning a fifth language. Also, I&#x27;m fluent in multiple programming languages.')
