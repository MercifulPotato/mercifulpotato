If we build nuclear plants to fulfill peak energy demand (which coincides with a lack of energy production from solar) then there&#x27;s not reason not to just run the nuclear plants 24&#x2F;7 and skip building solar altogether. This is why nuclear power and intermittent sources end up being a dichotomy in practice.<p>Solar does provide a good way to mitigate carbon emissions in the meantime, even if it&#x27;s role in a fully decarbonized economy is dubious. It&#x27;s fast to build and makes a good complement for gas plants. Turn off the gas when the solar cells are collecting, and you can save a good deal of emissions.<p>Solar also has niche use cases that make sense even with nuclear power. Rooftop solar is a good way to offset air conditioning energy use. In this case, the solar energy collected by the panels are intrinsically connected to the power demand of the air conditioning unit. Plus the energy production and energy demand are co-located.')
