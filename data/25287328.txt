I call it the Hipster Driven Development phenomena* and it&#x27;s just getting worse with every year. People just start by discarding established best practices in the name of being unique and cool and then wind up to the inevitable conclusion - the established best practices were there for a reason.<p>There&#x27;s been many such trends to name a few - discarding years worth of stable codebases to try out some shiny new framework, throw away proven technologies to trade for some perceived developer convenience (Eg. PostgreSQL to MongoDB), labeling known terminologies to sound cool (Hacker vs Growth &#x27;Hacker&#x27;). All these hipster moves come with a huge cost - they cost morale, time, money, teams, relationships. It just feels so unnatural to accept this as the norm.<p>In comparison, I just feel like some old dude from the 1950s rambling though these things have started to happen only the last half of the decade or so. Where did we go wrong?<p>Edited for OT')
