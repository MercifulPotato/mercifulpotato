I&#x27;d like to see a citation of a single unarmed revolution that succeeded.<p>edit: the armed right wing of the US could easily decide that they didn&#x27;t like the outcome of the election, and change it. The volunteer military and national police forces entirely constructed to prosecute the drug war are overwhelmingly right wing. Second amendment warriors tend to own more guns than they have fingers and toes. That the civil service and the majority of patrician-generals at the top support the result of the election would be no hindrance.<p>The purpose of being armed is really to force the opposition to massacre you. A right-wing revolution as described above would probably have fewer than a couple of thousand casualties. It&#x27;s very easy to still feel like the good guy if the only casualties of your revolution were a few of your most deeply committed archenemies (i.e. a few lefty militia types.) It&#x27;s a lot more difficult when you&#x27;re hurling artillery into normal civilian neighborhoods.<p>There were plenty of Northern Irish neighborhoods into which UK military and the police simply couldn&#x27;t operate without negotiating with a representative of that neighborhood.')
