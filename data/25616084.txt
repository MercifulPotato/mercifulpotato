Item(by='Nextgrid', descendants=None, kids=[25616219], score=None, time=1609618693, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25615394, text='OSM has the same problem as many other open-source projects: not enough focus on branding and user experience.<p>Right now, if I want to use OSM on my iPhone and I search &quot;OpenStreetMap&quot; in the App Store I get various applications under various, unknown names. The closest to an &quot;official&quot; name would be OSMaps, but it turns out even that one isn&#x27;t official and has no navigation capabilities.<p>On Android, I don&#x27;t have a phone to test with but seems like the most popular option appears to be OsmAnd. Again, not only is the name cryptic but doesn&#x27;t imply anything unless you&#x27;re already familiar with OSM. &quot;Google Maps&quot;, &quot;Apple Maps&quot;, etc in contrast automatically imply what the app is for even if you&#x27;ve never heard of the brand itself.<p>If OSM wants to succeed in the consumer space, they need to release an official, &quot;reference implementation&quot; of a mobile client with an UI comparable to the competition that a layman can understand and use even if they have no idea what OSM is nor are interested in contributing.')
