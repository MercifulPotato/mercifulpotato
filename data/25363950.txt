Although Movable Type was one of the earliest and most successful source-available blogging platforms, there were a bunch of others soon after. They all had similarities in functionality, by nature of being blogging software, but they weren&#x27;t exactly &quot;clones&quot;. WordPress was actually a fork of another early blogging software, b2&#x2F;cafelog.<p>When Six Apart made Movable Type&#x27;s license more restrictive in 2004, a portion of the userbase jumped over to WordPress. Another thing in WP&#x27;s favor was ease of hosting, due to being written in PHP, vs Movable Type&#x27;s Perl. This all led to a lot of momentum for WP; Automattic was founded <i>after</i> that, in 2005.')
