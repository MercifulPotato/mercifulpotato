Everyone has the capacity to exhibit this trait or be seen to exhibit it, when refracted through the non-objective lens of someone else&#x27;s bias and perception. For example, a politician for partyX is seen to be an earnest &#x27;straight man&#x27; who cares deeply by his supporters, while supporters of partyY view him as a reckless oaf.<p>To promote the use of personality traits as a predictor of success is naive at best.')
