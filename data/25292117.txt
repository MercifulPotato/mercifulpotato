In amateur radio, FT-8 is a slow, reliable, long distance serial protocol often used for hobbyist DX (long distance goal) communication.  So likely, yes, they have a minimal shell or REPL-style debugger, where they can at least query variables, and change the machine state.  Most aerospace devices use single-user Real Time Operating Systems, which have guaranteed timing on programs running, but to a technician end-user, the feeling is similar to an old Unix system, with similar tool names.<p>You can deploy via compilation, with SBCL, or LLVM, etc.  But I&#x27;ve mostly seen Lisp (well, I&#x27;m looking at Schemes, specifically) extending a compiled app.  It&#x27;s been pretty trivial connecting Racket to my compiled C functions, and I&#x27;ll try Guile later, and for me it&#x27;s mostly been a rapid-development tool to work with my WIP C library.')
