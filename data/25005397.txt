A lot of the most talented move to the US for higher pay, which most &#x27;average&#x27; people probably dont notice but as someone who takes pathology courses for fun online I&#x27;ve noticed we don&#x27;t get the &#x27;best&#x27;.<p>The major thing beyond that perception though is you get a ton of doctors offices who work like mills, they try to get as many patients as possible through each day as possible. Even &#x27;family doctors&#x27; as a opposed to &#x27;walk-in clinics&#x27; where you don&#x27;t need to be a &#x27;member&#x27; with a specific doctor.<p>It&#x27;s because in Canada the get paid for 15 minute (or optionally 30min) chunks regardless if they saw you for 2minutes or 15 minutes. So there&#x27;s always this underlying pressure to get you out the door.<p>You have to learn to really pressure them to take your conditions seriously and take them time to review your condition.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong though, I&#x27;m otherwise a die hard capitalist for most areas and still think that public health <i>insurance</i> (not hospitals or doctors) is the moral and better choice. Healthcare insurance lacks many benefits of a market and places like the US meddle with them to death anyway where they aren&#x27;t true markets, so they might as well be public. Just like prisons, some things should be run by the state, just very few things.')
