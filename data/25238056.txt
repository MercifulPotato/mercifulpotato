I believe you should support your local store as long as you can afford it. It&#x27;s more work, money, and time off your day but it&#x27;s likely you waste the extra time Amazon convenience gives you with browsing HN, or the like, anyways. Local business also most likely have picked up curbside for convenience.<p>It&#x27;s in Amazon&#x27;s best interest to shutter all locals aside from what they own (Whole Foods, Amazon Grocery, etc). Their ultimate goal is automating everything they can to remove the human element and maximize revenue. You can see other businesses like Starbucks taking over as well in different fields. In my opinion it&#x27;s a matter of time until Amazon starts their own attempt at local cafes.<p>We had presidential candidates in the US like Andrew Yang that recognize this effort and want to get ahead of it with UBI but I&#x27;m sure you know how that turned out. If the government isn&#x27;t going to support local businesses in dire times, who will? And who wants to live in a boring world where there are no local shops?')
