Whether it runs in a service or in a monolith isn&#x27;t the deciding factor of wether its good or bad.<p>Architecture and design is. A 100 services app with 5000 lines of code each could be really badly designed and entangled, and \na monolith with 500.0000 lines of code could be very well designed...<p>It&#x27;s about code quality, right abstractions, decoupling, cohesion. Correct domain modelling Etc.<p>Microservices are just a tool, but you have to have a good design first.')
