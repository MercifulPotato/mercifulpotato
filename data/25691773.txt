There are other easy ways to go from an author&#x27;s name to the list of their publications; often copying and pasting the name into Google is enough.<p>My point is that a search interface is usually more convenient. And as you noted, &quot;We have ArXiv, BioRxiv and MedRxiv (...)&quot; - that&#x27;s already too many places to click through, particularly if all you have is a title and&#x2F;or DOI. It&#x27;s a standard UX problem - single interface to all data of interest is always better than multiple specialized interfaces to subsets, particularly if you&#x27;re not initially sure where to look for a thing. I mean, it&#x27;s manageable when there are three, but it&#x27;ll become a huge burden when there&#x27;s 20.<p>&gt; <i>But if it was legal to operate, do you think it would be exactly the same as it is now, and that it would have no popular competitors&#x2F;alternatives?</i><p>Of course it would be different and there would be competitors. There&#x27;s a lot of space for quality-of-life improvements in SciHub model. But in that reality where it&#x27;s fully legal, I&#x27;d still prefer for the competitors to compete <i>just</i> on UI, and not on the data set. Exclusivity is bad for users. I wouldn&#x27;t want scientific papers to become a repeat of video streaming (half a dozen competing services with garbage UX and mutually exclusive collections) or IMs (have to install half a dozen apps to cover all my acquaintances).<p>And to extend my thought from prior comment:<p>&gt; <i>Why don&#x27;t we have one single webpage where all journalists write all their articles without any organization other than a search box?</i><p>Notice the modern media consumption patterns. The publisher doesn&#x27;t matter. Only individual articles do. People land at articles through Google queries and links shared on social media. I believe scientific papers show the same pattern to a large degree.')
