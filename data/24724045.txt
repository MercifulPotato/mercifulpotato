Item(by='yourapostasy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602191880, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24720706, text='With IBM Cloud, this is more a Cort√©s-like point of no return, sink the ships (not burned like popularly thought), only move forward from here, do-or-die type of move.<p>The other comment threads here are correct: IBM Cloud is struggling for relevance. There are some interesting ideas percolating around, but productionalized operations leaves <i>a lot</i> to be desired compared to AWS. They&#x27;re in a very distant fourth or fifth place with the likes of Oracle Cloud. I&#x27;d possibly place IBM Cloud even behind Alibaba Cloud.<p>The general idea is that once IBM Cloud sheds the chains of Legacy IBM, IBM Cloud will really take off, since it is <i>finally</i> rid of that pesky, low-margin cruft dragging it down. That &quot;cruft&quot; is why IBM Cloud is even getting warm introductions and walking through the door at all, powered by high-levered sales spiffs to bundle IBM Cloud.<p>Post-split, IBM Cloud is going to spend massive amounts of time and money trying to get their foot in the door, to get back to <i>status quo ante</i> of easy introductions, swimming upstream against AWS, Azure, and GCP once they separate from IBM-not-IBM. IBM Cloud will also get dragged into brutal discounting wars against Oracle Cloud and everyone else&#x27;s Me-Too Cloud. IBM-not-IBM will initially proclaim a &quot;close partnership&quot; with IBM Cloud, but once freed from on-high diktats to always use and shoehorn in IBM Cloud, they&#x27;ll gravitate in a few years to a vendor-agnostic-but-really-only-top-2-or-3 partnerships. If vendor-agnostic cloud even becomes realistic in a revenue-impacting way by then.<p>I expect IBM Cloud will hold onto RedHat post-split, and will likely try to use RedHat as their warm introduction channel. I hope IBM Cloud surprises all of us with something good.')
