I just picked up a trailer of toilet paper in Portland, bound for Ontario CA.<p>The guard handling the paperwork asked me &quot;Are you able to sign online?&quot;<p>I desperately tried to come up with a snappy &quot;yep,&quot; it sounded like such a good idea. But I finally had to say &quot;I&#x27;m not sure what you mean.&quot;<p>He handled it, gave me my bill of lading, and away I went with toilet paper in tow and paperwork in hand.
