The rename broke the (also networkmanager) channel bonding configuration, resulting in them being unreachable and requiring a physical visit to get them back online.<p>Networkmanager adds a lot of automagic, but outside of simple widely used configurations (&quot;laptop with wifi&quot;) it causes unpredictable and unreliable behaviour.<p>I especially like the standard fedora server install where the nics present during the install all get DHCP enabled on them, but only those nics. So if you move a network card to another PCI slot after the install it will mysteriously not work.   ...  I see nothing wrong with not automatically bringing up interfaces on a server, but mysteriously bringing up some and not others makes for mystifying and difficult to diagnose issues that no one seems to know how to fix.')
