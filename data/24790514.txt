It&#x27;s been so long since I found basic networking mystifying that I&#x27;m not sure how to explain it to someone who doesn&#x27;t have the same intuition. If you have something that&#x27;s very specific, maybe make a guess on how it could be generalized and then test that guess. Try to build a mental model, and test that model.<p>I don&#x27;t like using systems that are complete black boxes, so whenever I use something, I try gain a <i>reasonable</i> understanding of how it works under the hood. If a system claims to make X easy, I want to know at least what is <i>involved</i> in accomplishing that, even if the implementation details aren&#x27;t relevant knowledge. I don&#x27;t often need to dig into the nitty-gritty of how the Linux TCP stack works, but even having a broad idea of how the TCP <i>protocol</i> works is pretty useful, and especially how it relates to other networking protocols.<p>I guess for practical networking, it helps to first focus on IP addressing and routing; ie. how does a packet sent from your computer  <i>actually</i> get through all the switches and routers to the destination computer? The short answer is that every node (including your computer) makes a routing decision on where to send the packet, and then it&#x27;s sent forward. This happens at each &quot;hop&quot; until it appears at the  end (or gets dropped by a firewall).<p>And from this simple logic and some fancy tools to help you make <i>dynamic</i> routing decisions in response to changes in network topology (router went down? update local route information and send the packet to the other router that&#x27;s still up), you can build the internet in a fault-tolerant manner.')
