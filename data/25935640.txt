As in &quot;scientific forestry&quot;, &quot;climate science&quot; (scientists who study Earth&#x27;s climate call themselves meteorologists), &quot;scientific racism&quot;.  Is &quot;computer science&quot; an exception?  I&#x27;m not game to speculate.<p>Which actual scientists describe themselves that way?  We&#x27;re physicists, geologists, botanists, psychologists or whatever.  When someone says they&#x27;re a scientist, it suggests that they&#x27;re not part of any actual scientific discipline, but making a false appeal to authority.')
