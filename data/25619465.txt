Like zero effort to connect the evidence presented with the assertion.<p>Notably the evidence presented has plain gaps. Consider the second link: &quot;Goldstein&#x27;s attorneys were unable to argue for protection under the First Amendment because the Supreme Court had ruled in 1915 that movies lacked such protection. (That ruling was overturned in 1952.)&quot; That final parenthetical is critical because it suggests that a modern court would not rule the same way the court did in 1915 given similar facts.<p>To be clear, I don&#x27;t have enough context to evaluate the merits of the statement in full just noting why it may have come across as glib and hence downvoted.')
