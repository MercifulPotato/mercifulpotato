Specifically, it fails to even offer what any physical theory must: a quantitative prediction.  Compression, in your view, can be allowed to produce variable amounts of heating, for the same change in density.   Since you aren&#x27;t making a quantitative prediction, how is what you are saying even testable?<p>(The answer is that compression produces a specific amount of heating when it is adiabatic, and additional heating comes from dissipative processes that are occurring alongside the compression, but that are not themselves compression.)')
