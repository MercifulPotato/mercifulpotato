You don&#x27;t have to go far north for the sun to be kind of useless in winter.<p>An interesting side-note, there&#x27;s a theory that Europeans are so white because the gulf-stream makes it warm enough for farming grains despite being quite far north.. and so you don&#x27;t get much Vitamin D from the sun all of winter, and you don&#x27;t get it from your food (like the Inuits do, from eating a lot of fish), so white skin is a &quot;hack&quot; to try to maxize vitamin D production, despite the obvious downsides.')
