As an engineering manager, all of my stakeholders do not care or consider code quality or tech debt. Period. At all.<p>I have to burn bridges, cash in hard won favors, and be generally super pedantic and unpopular any time I have to defend technical quality as a worthwhile goal. I have to give presentations, scour months worth of incident postmortem data and exhaustively lobby for every single millimeter of leeway to protect technical quality. It is universally viewed as the number one thing “getting in our way” and preventing us from having greater delivery speed or agility to experiment with new features.<p>This article seems to describe a fantasy world where technical and product leaders care about code quality and are supportive of the efforts required to maintain it.<p>I have never encountered any place of business where this is remotely true.')
