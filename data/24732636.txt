Item(by='cma', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602266727, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24732293, text='&gt; I donâ€™t believe Apple can dictate what ProtonMail is sending to its user via email.<p>They already supposedly went after apps that linked to a privacy policy on their main website because the main website itself had premium options for sale.  If you can&#x27;t link to legal policy etc. because it might be a level or two of indirection from offering a premium service for sale through the site you have to do something like a special site just for Apple users.  I can totally see them going after email and arguing Proton mail could hide those notification emails from iOS users if they contain links to premium.')
