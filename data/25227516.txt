I&#x27;m saying that the broken, imported, duplicate keychain is half-baked because it failed to import cleanly due to a lack of features. Ultimately, I had to give up on that and start from scratch with my backed up key (where the primary isn&#x27;t detached).<p>I initially tried to fix this by messing with my GPG keychain, because my underlying assumption was that they shared keychains. Imagine my shock when I realised my assumption was wrong! Fortunately I didn&#x27;t lose anything important. Either way, having to maintain separate keychains is already enough of a deal-breaker for me... Maybe it will improve over time. I guess I&#x27;ll have to wait and see, as I didn&#x27;t back up my TB68 profile, so I can&#x27;t downgrade :(')
