I certainly hope not, but I have no faith in our government&#x27;s various administrations here to begin with, especially given that we are likely only at the beginning of these types of conflicts.<p>(Obligatory note that I am not defending any given platform, group of people, or anything of that matter, as I find it much more interesting to talk about how systems like this may play out instead)')
