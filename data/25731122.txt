It&#x27;s mostly good, if small, but with one really big problem: you can block trolls, but trolls can always create new accounts and come back.<p>It&#x27;s probably impossible to create a decentralised social network where don&#x27;t constantly have to reblock the same trolls but also don&#x27;t get locked into a tiny closed community. I want to be able to talk and share with the whole world, but I don&#x27;t want to have to block the same assholes over and over again because they keep making new accounts. And I assure you that trolls can get pretty bad on any open, decentralised system. They certainly do on Diaspora.<p>Maybe something where your network only expands through trusted nodes in your network: if a friend follows a lot of trolls, maybe keep him as a friend, but don&#x27;t allow your network to expand that way. But someone else might follow a lot of interesting people, so open up your network a bit more in that direction.')
