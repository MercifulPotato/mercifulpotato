Having any GUI be your first interaction with Git is a disaster. Right now the only way to learn Git is via book or man page, and command line. All the decent GUIs I have used assume you already know Git. They are great and powerful, but they don&#x27;t help at all with the onboarding process. If you know of one, please share. I had to stop using GUIs completely and learn with Git command line. Then the GUIs made sense.')
