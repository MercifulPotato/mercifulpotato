As opposed to rubygems (the first dependency manager although as you say not originally built-in to ruby) which has system-wide install, but always let you have more than one version installed.<p>Without fixing that one way or another, there&#x27;s no sensible way, true. virtualenv is certainly <i>one</i> way to fix it. I wonder if there would have been a more rubygems way to fix it.')
