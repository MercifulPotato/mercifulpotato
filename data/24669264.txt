Fortunately, the internet is levelling this somewhat.<p>When teaching at a college level, I used to go out of my way to provide any historical resources.  I want my class to be fair to everyone involved.<p>I <i>also</i> used to redraft my exams and assignments every single year.  This is quite a lot of work and a lot of professors simply won&#x27;t do it.  However, if you don&#x27;t, then some students will take advantage of it, and your class isn&#x27;t being fair to everyone.')
