For example 660nm light can be combined with methylene blue to make it toxic, which is taken advantage of in photodynamic therapy (PDT).<p>I did some research on PDT as an undergraduate in university and the absorption of light by cells. I&#x27;m not in the medical field, but from what I understand most of the biological effects from lower energies just come from the heating of cells.<p>Wikipedia has a very brief chart on the biological affects of non-ionizing radiation: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Non-ionizing_radiation#Health_risks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Non-ionizing_radiation#Health_...</a><p>And don&#x27;t forget simple facts like bright lights can blind people. Blanket statements like &quot;(non-ionizing) light isn&#x27;t dangerous&quot; often have holes in them.')
