I cannot take the concept of afterlife, for example, in Christianity seriously: either praising the Lord for eternity on Heavens or suffer in searing flames in Hell. In addition, such important decision is made based on how dedicated you were in following one of the many ancient moral codes, that is far from being universal and timeless. And then the very grand and picturesque  Judgement Day, that belongs more to the realm of fantasy literature... I may imaging myself ending up with a belief that my soul will be dissolved in or unite with the universe in some way - like people feel under psychodelics or in deep meditation.<p>If you cannot find answers and comfort on the topic of mortality in religion, I would suggest to check Stoicism, Hackagure the way of the Samurai, or even Objectivism. I want to explore the latter after listening to Lex Fridman&#x27;s podcast: youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SOr1YYRljV8')
