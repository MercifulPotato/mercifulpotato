Bad habits often come back to bite as your victim base grows outside of that which you can contain. You can bleep with the 95%, but not the 5%. The 5% have big counter weapons.<p>If it&#x27;s shown in a court of law that the politicians lied and harmed sales of voting machines, the politicians deserve to pay painful penalties.<p>Same for Covid lies.<p>That being said, I don&#x27;t trust computerized voting machines, as least those without paper backup. However, they&#x27;ve been dodgy for decades. To complain <i>only</i> when you lose an election makes you look like a hypocrite. If you really care, focus on improving the next election.')
