Actually in my view Sketch never had a chance to replace Illustrator or Affinity Designer. Figma? For collaboration if use case is demanding it may be. But suddenly UI design field is filled with decorators doing boxes with drop shadow but having &quot;Designer&quot;opinions. May be I am in mostly silent minority of professionals that don&#x27;t search and prize tools over essential skills. As a designer your work must be detached of workflow sentiments. Tools are tools. Nothing more. I can make a great UI with Inkscape any day I want. I can implement and test it in pure HTML&#x2F;CSS prototype. So what? On Apple and cloud computing in general. I like owning things, call me old-fashioned, boomer, or whatever. When I own a piece of software, I can use it without someone logging my mouse and keyboard, without fear of losing internet connection. Is this a small thing to behold?')
