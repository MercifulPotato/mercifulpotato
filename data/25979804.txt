Matrix has a really good solution for end to end encrypted group chat, so I haven&#x27;t seriously looked back at XMPP since then. They were the first ones with a decent solution to the most important feature I needed in decentralized group messaging, so they won IMO.<p>I tried a couple times to build out my own clients&#x2F;bots etc for XMPP, and it just seemed way overly complex. I had to bundle something like 30 megs of jar files for a simple hello world app.<p>Also some silly things like ejabberd refusing to hash passwords in their user database because they were &quot;already encrypted with SSL&quot;. It was all just a frustrating mess, and a security nightmare.<p>Matrix, with Element, has a pretty web frontend that does encrypted messaging right. If XMPP has anything like that, please do let me know, but every time I&#x27;ve glanced back at it, it seems stuck in the stoneage of messaging apps, still working on getting a committee together to form the standards for even the most basic functionality that everything else had 10 years earlier.')
