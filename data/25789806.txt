Item(by='rosmax_1337', descendants=None, kids=[25800003], score=None, time=1610711612, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25785191, text='One of the main problems with banning political subjects on the site is that it favors the mainstream political ideas and disfavors the alternative political ideas.<p>This makes it essentially a political move on HN mods side, ie. not neutral at all, even though it &quot;bans everything equally&quot;.<p>Mainstream political ideas disseminate through all other sorts of sites like Twitter, Facebook, Youtube or even cable news. Whilst alternative ideas do not. (Arguably not even on Reddit anymore)<p>Whilst you can certainly make the argument that what we post here doesn&#x27;t matter because there isn&#x27;t a million users on Facebook that it might reach, I think reaching the correct people, even if only less than a hundred, is worthwhile and arguably more impactful.<p>Now, with the way the world is moving forward right now, with Twitter and Parler, it turns out that allowing political subjects to be debated isn&#x27;t exactly a neutral stance either. That it is essentially a stance that is &quot;for&quot; the alternatives, at least according to some powerful people in control.<p>Which puts the HN mods team in a damned if you do damned if you don&#x27;t kind of seat.<p>I think in a more healthy world a site like this could and should stay on topic, avoiding political subjects outside the occasional coding-language or distro flamewars. ;)<p>But since the world is arguably terminally ill right now, HN should continue on it&#x27;s current trajectory and &quot;keep siding with the alternative political ideas&quot;, and allowing politics to be discussed.<p>I don&#x27;t want to come off as accusing them of actually siding with any side however, I&#x27;m just stating that in the current climate, they come off that way whether they like it or not. In my personal opinion, a forum that allows moderated political debate is truly neutral, period. But my personal opinion doesn&#x27;t set the tone for the political climate just yet.')
