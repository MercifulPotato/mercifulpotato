The M1 is pretty cool but jesus christ not only did it take them 2 years to fess up going &quot;sorry we got caught that our keyboards were trash...&quot; but they KEPT SELLING THEM! For the cost of an Apple product, that&#x27;s downright unacceptable. Those should&#x27;ve been recalled on the spot. But oh no, Apple cant have a recall. Gimme a break. They only care about their consumers with endless pockets.')
