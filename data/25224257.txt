I don’t know if they said, but I think those were conducted by different engineers.<p>That’s not infallible, but they’re committed to it being an ok metric—-it’s already what determines who they’re hiring. If you think that their decisions in on-sites are sufficiently bad, you probably should give up on the idea of optimizing how phone screens are conducted--it would be wasted effort, and you&#x27;d have no idea how to make sure it worked.<p>You can easily imagine that these results are just noise, but it’s more difficult (though hardly impossible) to spin a story in which it’s making their process worse. I think it would require that these interviewers have a knack for selecting weaker candidates who can still pass the on-site.')
