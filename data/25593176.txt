Completely overlooking that glibc was created in 1987 and opposed to musl which was released in 2011.<p>* ignores the fact that a lot of effort had gone into hardening openssl, and seems to think supporting OS&#x2F;2 and VMS equates to bad code security<p>* seems to misunderstand the purpose of long-term support kernels, which rather ironically contradicts there first point about frozen updates... author should do some basic reading here, which directly contradicts the states there ate only two releases of kernels stable and LTS (there are actually four categories of releases, and don’t necessarily happen for security reasons): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kernel.org&#x2F;category&#x2F;releases.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.kernel.org&#x2F;category&#x2F;releases.html</a><p>I am still reading through it, there are interesting points made but I’m definitely taking it with a grain of salt given the above!')
