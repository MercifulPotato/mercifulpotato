An X client is an application that uses the X protocol (e.g., Firefox, GIMP, LibreOffice) while an X server is an implementation of the X protocol that handles the rendering.  Note that an X server and an X client don&#x27;t have to run on the same machine; if I log into a remote server and execute LibreOffice, LibreOffice is still the X client and my machine&#x27;s X implementation is still the X server, despite the fact that LibreOffice is running remotely.<p>XFree86 is a specific X server implementation, though it has been superseded by X.org sometime around 2004 due to a license change from the MIT license to the 4-clause BSD license, which is incompatible with the GPL.  X.org is by far the most dominant X server implementation in the free open source software community, but it is not the only implementation; off the top of my head there were proprietary X server implementations for SunOS and NeXT.')
