Obviously we&#x27;d all love it if our infection numbers were lower, so what? If achieving low infection rates would be simple we&#x27;d all be doing it, it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s not.<p>I feel there&#x27;s also some weird fallacy in this, the authors say infection numbers need to stay low in order to make contact-tracing work. That&#x27;s what we did all summer, but then all of the sudden, infection rates exploded. Which, to me, sounds like contact-tracing alone doesn&#x27;t really solve our problem here it&#x27;s not this magic bullet that once you reach a certain threshold you&#x27;re good to go. The other thing being masks. I&#x27;ve personally seen very strong adherence to mask-wearing in public throughout Europe in summer and autumn - again that, too, did not prevent this wave from happening. One cannot help but wonder how much those masks really help (especially the cloth types, proper ones probably help better).<p>I feel many virologists and epidemiologists are trapped in this spring 2020 way of thinking, they focus on masks and lockdowns - instead we need to start focusing more on super-spreader events, centralised quarantines, intelligent mass-antigen testing, technology-facilitated tracing, and active protection of the vulnerable with proper face-masks (Germany distributed them just this week...) and mass-screening.<p>We&#x27;ve also completely thrown over board many of our learnings from the aids epidemic - you won&#x27;t defeat aids by banning sex. It just won&#x27;t work... It&#x27;s incredibly difficult, expensive and probably impossible in the long-run to control and ban these aspects of human life, just like banning small human gatherings is - we&#x27;re social beings after all. The only way is public education that builds up individual responsibility (start using condoms, etc.)')
