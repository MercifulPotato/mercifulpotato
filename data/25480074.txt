The core issue here is that the government hasn&#x27;t really taken any action. There are &quot;rules&quot; but they are full of loopholes and totally unenforced.<p>2 cases in particular stand out to me:<p>Compliance with mask wearing on TFL is less than 50%. &quot;Covid enforcement&quot; officers walk around about one train in 50, and despite it being 8 months since this started, &quot;I don&#x27;t have one&quot; is an acceptable answer to why you&#x27;re not wearing a mask.<p>Supermarkets continue to be rammed, but staff aren&#x27;t required to wear masks. Nor are they enforcing the requirement on customers beyond the door. One staff member with covid will rapidly infect a few 1000 people given how busy they are on a Saturday morning. Wtf aren&#x27;t staff required to wear masks?<p>The attitude here is rapidly becoming &quot;why should I bother if no one else is?&quot;. And frankly, I think the government know and encourage this. Its all but policy. Time and again we see them decline scientific advice, then act surprised when infection rates spike.<p>I&#x27;m especially frustrated as my best friend lives in Melbourne. Despite lockdown starting at basically the same time, and some crazy bad luck&#x2F;incidents, Melbourne is back to BAU.')
