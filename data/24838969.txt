The problem does lay with the abuse of the unlimited services. We&#x27;ve been offering our unlimited backup for 10+ years now and our only price increase was from $5 -&gt; $6&#x2F;month after 10 years of keeping them steady. It&#x27;s possible to provide the service, but we have some natural &quot;gates&quot; that were built into the product to help mitigate abuse. Primarily our unlimited backup service is for Mac and PC computers â€“ we don&#x27;t back up NAS&#x2F;Servers&#x2F;Linus machines.<p>That helps quite a bit because it reduces the outer-bound of how much data can store with us from typical Mac&#x2F;PC devices. Granted we do have people with 80+TB backed up with that service, but that VAST majority store A LOT less. The average is low enough that we can continue to provide the unlimited service - kind of like a buffet model. Some will eat more, most will eat less and buy a drink (Extended Version History).<p>Keeping it to Mac&#x2F;PC only does make Linux, NAS, Server folks unhappy, but thus far no one has been able to crack the code on an unlimited, fixed-rate service that can back up those devices economically, but if we figure it out we&#x27;ll let folks know :D')
