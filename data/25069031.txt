As said in other comments, I believe most people wouldn&#x27;t want most of the things the author describes.<p>If I want to cook at home and have to order everything, I assume it won&#x27;t just be there in 5 minutes. And then what? If everything is shared does someone come pick it up when someone else needs it? Do I take it somewhere?<p>Also, are people delivering these things? Or robots? And how can this be free?\nHe also mentions that most work can be done at anytime. Well, if the premisse is order everything I need, even for cooking, that has to be done right away, no?<p>I might be totally off, but this doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me.')
