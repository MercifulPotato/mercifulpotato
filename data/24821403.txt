You can follow any account on any server&#x2F;community from just one account. That&#x27;s the big difference&#x2F;selling point. It&#x27;s the &quot;local timeline&quot;, an optional discovery feature, that adds the incentive to create more accounts; but there are definitely ways to circumvent it. Many communities expose their timeline publicly and there&#x27;s almost always a public profile directory so you can see who&#x27;s on that server&#x2F;community to follow them.')
