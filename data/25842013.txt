By default it screenshots everything, exports a PDF, saves like 4 different HTML copies and submits the link to the wayback machine. It also tries to extract important text, and stores that separately. You could easily configure it to only extract text, turn off some HTML extractors, or disable the PDF and screenshot captures if you want to prioritize disk space.')
