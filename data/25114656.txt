I wanted to go in a different direction and examine how technical design decisions in the kernels affected everyday use, which is why there&#x27;s so much time spent on filenames.<p>Ultimately, though, it&#x27;s just a highly selective overview of the operating systems at the time, with a few historical asides. (I&#x27;m particularly proud of digging up the part about case-insensitive filenames using less RAM in the DEC SIXBIT encoding.)<p>I haven&#x27;t updated it significantly since 2014, so it is probably out of date in spots. However, much of it is still holds true today. I continue to use both Linux and Windows on a daily basis, and I still occasionally run into the same old problems with path lengths, filename restrictions, and file locking semantics.')
