(I disagree, but wrt the industry, not specific listed companies.)<p>Yes, they&#x27;re taking a loss (at least on paper) for some of these investments. But I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s largely by choice, both by voluntary &quot;offset&quot; investments, and operational decisions. That&#x27;s the (financially) delusional part.<p>As I said, we&#x27;re seeing the bigger companies sell off infrastructure it can&#x27;t market as being green. [1] Here&#x27;s Shell&#x27;s refinery sell-off, and attempt to rebrand the remaining refineries as &quot;low-carbon chemical parks.&quot;<p>As travel picks up again, someone is going to pick these smaller refineries up for cheap. At least a couple of them specialize in jet fuel, which, post-covid, will be in sufficient demand for the foreseeable future. The buyers will make money. Shell and Shell&#x27;s investors will show it as a loss.<p>Same goes for fracking. If Shell (or whoever) is, for example, voluntarily buying carbon offsets or similar for fracked wells, they may show it as a losing investment. The buyer might pick it up, drop the voluntary offset purchases, and make it financially viable.<p>B) Another thing done is shifting costs:<p>A company buys (mandatory) wetland property for mitigation credits for a pipeline project, that&#x27;s deemed profitable, as-is. They also have a fracking well that&#x27;s profitable. The division that owns the well will then buy carbon-offset credits from the division that bought the wetlands. Where you once had two profitable projects, you now have one profitable project, one project that shows a loss, and a chunk of revenue written off for capital expenditure, another chunk written off for buying green offset credits, and a huge net savings overall due to carbon credit deductions and reducing taxable revenue on paper.<p>Now the company might internally think those optional credits are a required cost of doing business, for branding and politics. But that doesn&#x27;t mean the fracking itself isn&#x27;t profitable.<p>Or that a different company wouldn&#x27;t show it on paper as such.<p>This is the type of stuff that gets confusing when you start looking at the financial analysis stuff that you refer to.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.icis.com&#x2F;explore&#x2F;resources&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;29&#x2F;10569069&#x2F;shell-to-reduce-refinery-portfolio-to-six-sites-from-14" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.icis.com&#x2F;explore&#x2F;resources&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;29&#x2F;10569...</a>')
