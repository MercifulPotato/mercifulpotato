MS is very good at making available their documentation, and almost all of their modern stuff (.NET Core, etc) is developed openly on GitHub.<p>But other companies that aren&#x27;t as engineering-driven like SAP, Oracle, yeah - I can see them doing that.<p>The only advantage I can think of is one of cross-promotion or referrals from Microsoft&#x27;s own consulting division. (I&#x27;ll admit I have no idea who MS&#x27;s Consulting customers are - I thought everyone went with Accenture, IBM, Capita or Atos).')
