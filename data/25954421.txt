But Tesla<p>1) still has a lot of scaling to get through before they reach anything close to the sales volume of their competition. Elon talks a lot about scaling but Tesla is still microscopic compared to other manufacturers. The business operations of a much larger company will present challenges in communication, structure, quality assurance, legal liabilities in various jurisdictions, not to mention the struggle of sourcing battery components. Tesla scaling is not as easy as spinning up additional Kubernetes pods.<p>2) The competition WILL electrify. Tesla is not likely to have more than 6 models in the coming years yet they will compete with hundreds of models from different companies that cater to different niches. Any company that offers an electric vehicle with physical buttons instead of a touchscreen has my attention.<p>3) Tesla workers will unionize and&#x2F;or mature away from the company. I grew up around Detroit and witnessed a lot of labor dynamics with the UAW. Assuming Tesla succeeds in preventing a union the workers will eventually cash out their stock and leave for better offers at other automotive companies or spin off their services into tier automotive groups. Why write software for Tesla robots when the robot company will hire you to write software for all auto companies?')
