Eventually I just chose good old GPL and decided against BSL-like licenses for a number of reasons.<p>GPL is a fine balance. When you are small, your greatest risk is not an existing or future competitor: it is death by obscurity. To that end, you don&#x27;t want to slow down adoption by choosing a license that screams &quot;$$$&quot; or makes somebody&#x27;s legal team uncomfortable. In any case, if a big company wants to copy you, they will and can with the resources they can throw at it.')
