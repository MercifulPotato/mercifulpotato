Rendered at 30 Hz, a one frame latency translates into 30&#x2F;30 mm which is 1 mm. A 1mm gap between the cursor and the thing you&#x27;re dragging is definitely perceptible, and this is for a relatively slow drag. It&#x27;s at least enough to destroy the illusion that the thing is locked to your cursor.')
