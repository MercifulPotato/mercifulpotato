Hopefully there&#x27;s some sort of system for keeping around all those individual branches that made it out to prod, however briefly, for future debugging&#x2F;auditing purposes if you ever need them.<p>It&#x27;s never fun to have to be doing &quot;what code was running at this time&quot; investigations, but every once in a while it&#x27;s the only way to really get to the root of something.')
