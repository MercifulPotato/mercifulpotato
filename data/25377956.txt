While many things are easier said than done, I believe this is important enough to the community that it could happen.  My main concern with such a distro is security, a team developers providing security patches would be the most critical part of such an entity.<p>Hopefully before CentOS 7 goes dark in 2024 there will be viable alternatives.  Right now, having to compile against custom libs not shipped with the distro (for example, modern OpenSSL) is a small price to pay for having another 3 years left to decide on best course of action to get off CentOS.  Still, it&#x27;s a terrible position to be in for those who upgraded to CentOS 8 already (as we were just about to do).')
