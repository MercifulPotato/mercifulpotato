By your logic an independent Hong Kong is as natural as Brooklyn being independent from the rest of New York.<p>My first point is that Hong Kongers of course should have had the right to vote on the handover back to China. They were not offered that and we can&#x27;t go back.<p>My second point is that we shouldn&#x27;t just assume Chinese are some sort of hivemind of people of a single culture. Native Hong Kongers are not somehow culturally pre-ordained to be part of China. Even ignoring that the PRC is breaking its treaty agreement, their voices should not be ignored due to some idea of inevitable PRC rule.')
