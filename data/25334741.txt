Even if you ignore his multiple sexual harassment scandals, it&#x27;s very clear that he&#x27;s a hypocrite on this issue and therefore should not be taken seriously on this or any issue. After all, he claims to want to solve big problems, and ostensibly there is no bigger problem in his world than this. And yet, he wants to cut and run; why?<p>Well, it starts with the fact that he&#x27;s only got one hammer, and that hammer is to give the white kid from Stanford $10 million, and then backup that investment by subsidizing losses in a race to monopoly. If and when it works, Rabois then takes the credit. But this is a problem that he can&#x27;t solve, certainly not in the way he solves things, and even if he did, it would run up against the libertarian fantasies that infuse every tweet he writes. As opposed to admitting failure and admitting that his narrow-range expertise doesn&#x27;t apply to everything, he runs to Miami instead, proving that he&#x27;s simply a rent-seeker fraud there to sap the area of its resources until the resources are dry, complaining the entire time about how unfairly he&#x27;s been treated in that he hasn&#x27;t been getting his ass kissed in the manner in which he&#x27;s become familiar.')
