Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=[25545947], score=None, time=1609011778, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25545775, text='Yes, of course Tesla hasn&#x27;t solved it yet, because no one has, and in fact it probably isn&#x27;t possible to solve without some magic tech that doesn&#x27;t exist yet - it <i>might</i> be possible to fix with LIDAR, but obviously Tesla doesn&#x27;t have it.<p>All of these systems have to ignore stationary objects ahead of them, or the car would be emergency braking in too many daily situations to be usable.<p>Simple case, at 150km&#x2F;h you are travelling at 41m&#x2F;s. The stopping distance at that speed is roughly given as 130m[0]. So the car would need to see and recognize objects at least ~150m ahead to stop autonomously from that speed. That&#x27;s just physically not possible, the cameras on the Tesla don&#x27;t have enough resolution to do such a recognition. Instead, a radar-based distance measure is used - but again, even if the car detects that you are rapidly approaching &quot;something&quot; 150m ahead of you, that information is nearly useless. At that distance, you cannot differentiate between a stopped car 150m ahead of you, an overhead sign, or a large rock next to your lane which poses absolutely no danger whatsoever - it all gives the same signature. LIDAR doesn&#x27;t have that range either. And then of course even if the car could reasonably detect that there is something ahead of you that you are absolutely 100% definitely heading towards, it has no idea if the road doesn&#x27;t curve in such a way that you would avoid it. Famous case of adaptive cruise systems freaking out at bends, because according to the radar&#x2F;image recognition you are CLEARLY heading for that telephone pole standing next to the road - but of course the road curves so you aren&#x27;t actually going to hit it. Problems like that.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.random-science-tools.com&#x2F;physics&#x2F;stopping-distance.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.random-science-tools.com&#x2F;physics&#x2F;stopping-distan...</a>')
