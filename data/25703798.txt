How so many of us were never taught about the impact of credit card loans and inflation on our financial situation. So as I&#x27;ve read more about how a brand new car is the worst thing you can do with your money, I dug deeper into how money can make money.\nAs I started investing right after university, I thought the web would be a better way to track dividends automatically, instead of manual google spreadsheets. So this is my project I work on weekends mostly, trying to visualize dividend stocks and what passive income I can expect. It&#x27;s always half baked project because there are so many exchanges and stocks that all have their own problems and it&#x27;s hard to automate from free data sources.\nI really like building the project I use myself! Hopefully, it will last!')
