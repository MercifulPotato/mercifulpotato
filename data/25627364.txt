Personally, I find the square brackets and curly braces to be just enough additional texture to make the code plenty readable, as long as you&#x27;re using a good autoformatter. (Letting people make their own decisions about code formatting in any lisp seems to be a very quick route to a very bad time.) What I find, though, which makes me sad, is that many people knee-jerk reject any non-ALGOL syntax (Lisp, but also Smalltalk, ML, Prolog, whatever). To the point that I fear that not being able to understand the syntax becomes a point of pride. It reminds me a bit of the sort of asymmetrical intelligibility of Metropolitan French and any of the Canadian dialects, a situation where I also get the impression that the difficulty in understanding is more than a little bit deliberate.<p>So there&#x27;s that. But I also do find that Clojurists have not been immune to some of the snootiness that seems to infect most functional language communities. And I wonder if some of the reaction comes from that, combined with Clojure maybe bumping into the rest of the world more often due to its identity as a JVM language.')
