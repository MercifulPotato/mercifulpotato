From the politifact review:<p><i>Ramsland lists &quot;Fenton&quot; without specifying Fenton City or Fenton Township. But the turnout Ramsland lists for Fenton does not match the turnout in either jurisdiction.<p>The actual turnout statistics reveal the inaccuracy of Ramslandâ€™s numbers. His figure for North Muskegon is off by a factor of 10: The actual number is 78.11%, not 781.91%. For Zeeland Charter Township, he inflated the turnout nearly sixfold. For Grout Township and the City of Muskegon, his number is more than triple the correct number.</i>')
