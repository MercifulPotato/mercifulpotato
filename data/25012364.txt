The perspective is interesting.\nFrom my own experience at first I felt the same, but soon after add noise cancellation headphones (almost everyone has), less cords eg Bluetooth, usb-c monitors, and ability to shift adhoc into smaller teams and groups when required I find it becomes such a winner.\nA lot of people seem setup or mark a desk as theirs, with books or custom Sun Station or whatever, and most people seem to respect this and get others needs. \nHot desking obviously works differently for different types of work and or personalities.')
