But my setup is quirky and hard to customize. (Well, hard to customize for other people, anyway.)<p>Nix had a learning curve, but once I got over the initial hump, I stopped wanting to manage software any other way.<p>To get from my setup to what I&#x27;m thinking of here, I&#x27;d need to organize it as a package that&#x27;s convenient for others to depend on, fill in a bunch of missing systems and factor out support for specific languages and tools into some kind of module-style config system. Thinking about it now, it&#x27;s probably just a few days&#x27; worth of work.<p>Emacs, by the way, <i>does</i> work as an SSH client (via TRAMP). I do all my work on remote servers by SSHing from a local Emacs. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it works well enough in practice that I haven&#x27;t tried finding anything better.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tikhonjelvis&#x2F;dotfiles" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tikhonjelvis&#x2F;dotfiles</a>')
