You can say that this is hypocritical of Google, which I actually don&#x27;t really agree with.<p>Even if we take it as fact that she was somehow going to be releasing something very damaging and that Google was weary of that (which I already think is quite generous to her), I would imagine that her role as a researcher is not to be an in-house whistleblower but rather to be someone who helps Google mitigate the biases etc that they may be perpetuating. If that&#x27;s the case, her first job is to serve Google and help them address these shortcomings and her second role (if there even is one) would be to publish this for the community at large.<p>Most companies will not let people publish their findings at all, and I think this is something that sets Google and a few other companies apart from the pack. The fact that there even is a mechanism to share results outside of your employer is really rare.<p>So, even if Google said &quot;wow, this is spot on and will make us look terrible&quot;, they should be 100% able to tell her &quot;don&#x27;t publish this, instead let&#x27;s work to fix this and then possibly publish a post mortem&quot;.<p>Google is ultimately a company, not a democracy.')
