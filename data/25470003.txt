Obviously, too much of this will render a codebase a nightmare to maintain as bugfixes and feature enhancements have to be applied in multiple places.<p>I have found that starting with duplication is by far the easiest and most flexible way to work through problem domains that are complex. Once you have a really good grasp of the modeling, then you can iterate and decide on normalization where appropriate.<p>Thinking about this from an analytical perspective - If you build your application with duplication by default (i.e. define a domain model for each logical use case&#x2F;scenario), then you will have an excellent analysis already in front of you regarding which business types should be normalized and which ones might be a little bit trickier to make common. Many times it is impossible to fully explore a problem domain until you have already written software against its entire extent.')
