There&#x27;s already free solutions out there, what&#x27;s the added value? Workspaces are easy to replicate using Firefox&#x27;s containerised tabs and the vertical tab structure can be replicated with something like Tree Style Tabs. The remaining minor improvements are nice to have but certainly not worth $20 in my opinion.')
