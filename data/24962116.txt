But only customers who already have internal dev teams. The way we phrase is internally is &quot;we want our deliverable to be a git repo, and only work with clients who know what to do with that&quot;.<p>This implies a bunch of stuff - for example, ongoing server maintenance etc. is seldom a problem, since our clients already have their own devops teams.<p>Other dev shops can target the other way - non technical clients, for whom the dev shop becomes their entire technical staff. Those contracts are often quite different, and just to continue with the example above, often will include some kind of ongoing devops work (which may be more of a profit generator than the actual project itself!).')
