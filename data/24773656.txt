Item(by='SiVal', descendants=None, kids=[24773687], score=None, time=1602656021, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24773224, text='Treasure Island in the middle of the bay was military because of its militarily strategic location. That strategic location gives it both breathtaking views and easy access to SF business. When the military left and said the city could have it, the city gov&#x27;t declared that one of the uses of this incredible windfall was to build low-income&#x2F;homeless housing projects on the island. They claimed that &quot;justice&quot; meant that the poor had as much right to beautiful views as the rich. I suggested that if their goal was to house the needy, they could house far more of them by developing the spectacular real estate for the rich and using the tax revenue to fund housing and services for a much larger number of poor elsewhere than by insisting that a few of them be housed with million-dollar views. They reacted with the predictable Godwin&#x27;s Law economic and personal analysis, so I wished them luck with their homeless utopia. I have no idea what eventually happened to housing projects on the island (I left them to it), but it came as no big surprise that as tech wealth exploded in the city, it somehow didn&#x27;t translate to better housing for the poor.')
