On mobile right now so this isn&#x27;t comprehensive but a few advantages jump to mind.<p>1. Compression&#x2F;deduplication. Your data will (generally speaking) take up about half the space it did before even including the multiple file versions.<p>2. Automation. You won&#x27;t have to manually do anything after you configure a schedule once.<p>3. Management of multiple backups.<p>4. A really nice native GUI<p>5. All the advantages that backup with file versioning has over sync (which is what it looks like you have). Safe from ransomware (you&#x27;ll have an older version always even if your infected ones get synced accidentally), projection from human error by being able to revert to older versions, etc')
