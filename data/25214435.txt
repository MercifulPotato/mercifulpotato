When this happens, it descends into a never-ending cycle of more login screens and then more reCaptchas.<p>But thankfully eBay have taken note of the dozens of complaints about this on their user forums, dating back to 2018 and rushed their best people in to fix it.<p><i>[That last sentence was dripping with sarcasm, in case anyone unfamiliar with the company thought eBay ever took any notice whatsoever of their users&#x27; concerns]</i><p>I&#x27;m not a violent person at all. But if I ever meet the person who spawned reCaptcha and all its equally annoying clones, which are a pox on the internet, I won&#x27;t be responsible for my own actions.')
