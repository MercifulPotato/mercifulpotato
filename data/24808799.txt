I can do everything I possibly need on Windows; Visual Studio, gaming, VS code, docker, node, browsing, whatever. I absolutely think Linux is so much better for servers since it can all be done from the command line..NET Core was a game changer in that regard, but I&#x27;m still perfectly fine with Windows desktop.<p>I think it comes down to what you prefer, are you a tinkerer or just a user? I just want my desktop to run, I don&#x27;t care what drivers I&#x27;m running or anything like that. Windows comes with the computer, I&#x27;m used to it and I&#x27;ve never had the problems described by people. I can plug in any peripheral and it just goes, it&#x27;s frictionless for me. As far as restarting I&#x27;m fine with it, I don&#x27;t run my computer 24 hours a day, I shut it down after work until I need it for gaming or other reasons, I&#x27;m not running software for the space shuttle so I don&#x27;t need 10 nines uptime')
