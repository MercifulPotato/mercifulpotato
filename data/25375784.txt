There are still a few gaps on the Balkans but other than that, any considerable future widening (and thus weakening, as the quality position would call it) would involve pushing hard towards Russia, Arabia or not towards but into Africa. If there was some UK long game of shaping the EU into some form of smaller version of the UN paper tiger, brexit should be seen as a mission accomplished victory lap.')
