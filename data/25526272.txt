Item(by='mudita', descendants=None, kids=[25526400], score=None, time=1608803892, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25524397, text='Yeees, but the problem Jtsummers mentions is that often the label gets “internalized as a quality of themselves”, so especially men sometimes thing that it’s their own preference, when they just never had the right space to discover the joy of dance. I think that dance is actually a very universal human thing and that there’s a strange alienation from dance and our bodies going on in western culture, especially for men. This cultural alienation is so deeply embedded in our identity that it’s often a blind spot, where we don’t even notice what we miss.<p>I myself thought that I didn’t enjoy dancing, would never be able to enjoy it and that I had zero interest in learning dancing until I eventually discovered that I do actually want to learn to dance, which started a journey which ended up with me becoming a professional dancer.<p>But I agree both that not everyone has to dance and that pressuring people to dance is not the right strategy for showing them the joy of dance.')
