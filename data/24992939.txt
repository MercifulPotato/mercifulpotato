Money laundering through real estate is ancillary -- a bug -- and attempts are made to stop it. Regularly. Up to and including Vancouver instituting a 15% tax on foreign buyers and New Zealand banning non-residents from buying real estate.<p>Cryptocurrency is designed specifically, by virtue of its decentralized and trustless nature, to facilitate money laundering. It was a design goal. This is what it&#x27;s <i>for</i>. That and of course, collecting the proceeds of ransomware. Another way of describing &#x27;money laundering&#x27; is transferring value, without the permission of a centralized government authority, with the intent to conceal the source of funds (hey it&#x27;s your money right?).<p>That it has yet to achieve the same scale is not relevant.<p>All sorts of illegal activities aren&#x27;t done at scale, that doesn&#x27;t mean they shouldn&#x27;t be policed. Otherwise you&#x27;ll be pointing to the small scale right up until the moment it&#x27;s not small anymore, and then it&#x27;s too late.')
