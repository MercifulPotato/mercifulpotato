Once you understand the (admittedly bad) syntax for &quot;pointer to function returning type&quot; as opposed to &quot;function returning pointer to type&quot;, most declarations you&#x27;re likely to find aren&#x27;t hard to read.<p>I mantain some C code as part of my job and I don&#x27;t recall declarations ever being a problem to mentally parse.')
