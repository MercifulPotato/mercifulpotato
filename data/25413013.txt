In fact, NOT joining the party can be a signal and a problem, which might complicate business setup, banking applications, things like applying for a car plate, etc.<p>This is false information, I&#x27;d say the b word actually if you are really Chinese (you need to be a Party member to apply for car plate? WTF...)...You do need application to join the Party, and not joining the party is perfectly OK (China only has 100M Party member). It was only in decades ago that joining the Party was kind of automatic because there was not much private economy, definitely not the case for today. A lot of people still apply and join, for their own benefit, but it&#x27;s a choice, not a mandatory (Neither me and my wife joined and our careers were pretty good).')
