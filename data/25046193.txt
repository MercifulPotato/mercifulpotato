But thanks to the flexible nature, toss in a little logic when needed for example, he can quickly churn out some non-trivial SQL to do the job.<p>Of course may other ways to do this kinda job, but for him this is quite productive. He starts by writing the query he needs for doing one update, then just stuff it into Excel, replacing fixed values with cell references and copy formula down all rows and copies result back into interactive SQL editor.')
