As you point out, the company is under no obligation to do what is &#x27;fair&#x27; for my work and it is my negotiating skills&#x2F;power that will dictate how much I get paid. Fine, I accept this.  However, on the flip side, a company should not expect my undying loyalty, working for free after hours, or take one for the team to get that release out etc. And no I will not be joining them on those bonding, team-building zoom meetings and&#x2F;or retreats (will they still be a thing in a post-covid world?). Sorry its just business, maybe if you paid me equally for my work I would be more open to the above.')
