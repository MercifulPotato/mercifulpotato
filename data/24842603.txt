I could have used the exact same sentence to describe how I feel using macOS for work after being used to Linux (GNOME) for 8 years.<p>When you use something for a while you learn to avoid all the bugs and the UX starts to feel natural. Any switch will end up in you running into new bugs and finding the UX odd, no matter if it is to or from macOS, Windows, GNOME, KDE or otherwise.<p>I would say that I run into 10x more bugs on macOS than GNOME. But that probably isn&#x27;t because there are 10x more bugs. There is likely a comparable number on GNOME but I have learned to subconsciously avoid most of them.')
