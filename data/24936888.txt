They&#x27;re very unpopular, and few countries have been able to implement them successfully.<p>It&#x27;s still worth trying to pursue a more popular version of a carbon tax because of how efficient they are, but we need to acknowledge their political shortcomings. Perhaps we could pair a carbon tax with an annual distribution of revenue raised to everyone - a carbon bonus - so people see a direct benefit too instead of just the tax.<p>Regardless we need to explore other solutions too, since it&#x27;s not going to be enough to stop the climate from destabilizing further.')
