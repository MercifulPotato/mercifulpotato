The reason they walk is that it has a much lower risk of injury and puts less stress on the body than most other forms of cardio exercise (perhaps excepting a stationary bike) and our bodies are good at naturally finding a pace we can sustain ~indefinitely.<p>It feels like a bit of a hack when you go for a 2hr walk and end up burning almost 800kcal listening to music, talking to people on the phone, maybe taking care of chores like paying bills.')
