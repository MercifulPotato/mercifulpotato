Once you get your head around it, it’s fast and capable – until you run into a corner case it doesn’t support (attributed text was the big one for me). Then you end up needing to wrap UIKit, which is straightforward except there is a new set of corner cases to deal with, eg. content sizing, embedding in native scroll views, etc. It all does work in the end but it takes a while to get there, and I know I’ll be replacing a lot of code as SwiftUI evolves.
