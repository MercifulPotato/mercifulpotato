It&#x27;s bad that it was done under the auspices of war and creating machines for killing and destruction. It&#x27;s good some of those machines didn&#x27;t get used.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate that humans can find the resources for war but can&#x27;t find the resources to help fellow humans. But in some sense, the department of defense is a massive jobs program not just in the direct hires but also in the large military industrial complex of military contractors (and you see this in the way politicians work to keep military bases open and contracts for useless jets going) that, as long as we don&#x27;t go to war, is arguably a net positive.<p>I wish we could admit how much of a jobs program it is and use that money and effort directly for good things.')
