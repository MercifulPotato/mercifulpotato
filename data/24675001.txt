You&#x27;re immediately throwing out the possibility of being able to serialize and then deserialize data in basically any programming language.<p>I shudder at the idea of an API that accepted NestedText, where I&#x27;d need to worry about whether my floating-point output was compatible with its floating-point string parser. Yikes. I want the serialization format to handle that. Isn&#x27;t a major criticism of JSON that it doens&#x27;t have a built-in datetime representation?')
