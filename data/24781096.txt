And emulation is tricky even when dealing with simpler things like computers or Hawking&#x27;s Voice emulator where the original worked based upon the assumption of transistor noise.<p>Even if we could get every last neuron modeled accurately without the hormonal issues there would be major emotional differences from things like not having any fear or dopamine and a configuration that expects them.')
