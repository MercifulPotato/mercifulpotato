The refusal to wear masks, the inability to agree on basic facts, the wildfire spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories.<p>IMHO the only way out of this hole is by doubling down on critical thinking education. Education that focuses not just on skills for a labor market, but skills for <i>thinking</i>. Being able to separate fact from fiction, ‘feels from reals’.<p>An aside: I’ve often felt that writing longhand on paper produces a different result than typing. Something about the deliberate pace. Technology has given us awesome powers, and the ability to blast out our stream of consciousness at hyper speed. We would do well to slow down a little, reflect more, try to fully grasp issues and consider the sources and validity of things before we share them out.<p>But above all, we need to find our way back to truth through science - not just what feels good, but what we can sort out through the full power of our mental abilities.')
