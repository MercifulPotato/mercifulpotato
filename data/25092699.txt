I don&#x27;t think so.<p>I see a problem in a generalization of the kind done in the title of the article.<p>Facebook is not &quot;the Internet&quot;. The Austrian court rule does not apply to &quot;The Internet&quot; at all. It applies to Facebook and Facebook only. If someone published the same content on another platform then the court would have to rule again.<p>I see the real problem in Platforms like Facebook becoming the only means of speech on the Internet for the majority of people. Censorship on Facebook happens on a global scale without any state intervention already. (Edit: And that is not because Facebook is evil but because some content is bad for business. And that will be true for any service that aims to be a somewhat neutral and profitable platform.)')
