IIRC  one of them censors aircraft on the owners&#x27; request but because they&#x27;re lower profile lots of planes that are blocked on Flightaware are still visible. One of them also has an API that returns &quot;interesting&quot; aircraft (military, government, owned by celebrities etc) which is fun to look at<p>Edit: I think it&#x27;s Opensky that filters their data. Not many planes are filtered but their coverage also isn&#x27;t as comprehensive as ADSBExchange. For one specific usecase I did find Opensky&#x27;s API easier to work with')
