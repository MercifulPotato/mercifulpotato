But if you&#x27;re going to frame someone, why would you do it in such a batshit insane way?  Bizarre.<p>If these claims are true, surely some journalist would have noticed the same things?  Maybe they have and I completely missed the story?<p>Edit: after reading the post article, there are quite a number of things that aren&#x27;t so easily explained away by the oddities pointed out in that Twitter thread.<p>If our self-proclaimed trustworthy legal and journalism institutions were less theatrics-based, the actual truth of these allegations could be uncovered without too much effort.  But perhaps there&#x27;s no budget remaining (in <i>any</i> governmental agency, or <i>any</i> journalism outlet) after the multi-year investigation into the alleged Trump&#x2F;Russia collusion.  Whatever the reason, I suspect that for some unknown reason, this issue will be added to the ever growing pile of &quot;things that we know(!) are fake news, even though we don&#x27;t actually know because we did not investigate them&quot;.<p>EDIT: Interesting (but not surprising) that this article is [flagged], further demonstrating the wide variety of ways in which the distribution of <i>certain categories of ideas</i> can be controlled, even without a central coordination authority.  Ideas do very much seem to behave like living organisms, with human minds as their unwitting hosts.<p>“People don&#x27;t have ideas. Ideas have people.”<p>― Carl Jung<p>Mind Control: How Parasites Manipulate Cognitive Functions in Their Insect Hosts<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.frontiersin.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;10.3389&#x2F;fpsyg.2018.00572&#x2F;full" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.frontiersin.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;10.3389&#x2F;fpsyg.2018.0057...</a><p><i>Neuro-parasitology is an emerging branch of science that deals with parasites that can control the nervous system of the host. It offers the possibility of discovering how one species (the parasite) modifies a particular neural network, and thus particular behaviors, of another species (the host). Such parasite–host interactions, developed over millions of years of evolution, provide unique tools by which one can determine how neuromodulation up-or-down regulates specific behaviors. In some of the most fascinating manipulations, the parasite taps into the host brain neuronal circuities to manipulate hosts cognitive functions. </i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;1988&#x2F;10&#x2F;30&#x2F;are-ideas-viruses-of-the-mind&#x2F;46be1345-4067-4f90-a3ae-bd5dd811fc02&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;opinions&#x2F;1988&#x2F;10&#x2F;30&#x2F;a...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Memetics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Memetics</a><p>EDIT:<p>The Twitter thread:<p>&quot;So just so I follow this story: Hunter Biden, who lives in Los Angeles, decides to fly 3000 miles across country, to drop off 3 MacBook Pros at a repair shop run by a blind guy who charges the insanely low price of $85 (because there aren&#x27;t repair shops in LA). He drops them off, signs a contract for repair and then disappears.&quot;<p>Sounds fishy.
