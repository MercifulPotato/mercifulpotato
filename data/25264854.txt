Same for bacon. You can have highly processed food without chemicals: You can make processed cheese at home without the vats [1]. Not all &quot;chemicals&quot; are unnatural things that we didn&#x27;t eat before, and some of the &quot;chemicals&quot; are preservatives, basically making them preserved foods.<p>We didn&#x27;t really have frozen foods before refrigeration became common.<p>Bread in the 1800&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t very pure if you were buying the cheap stuff [2]. We weren&#x27;t really eating &quot;pure and natural&quot; stuff before, and have been experimenting with different chemicals and things for eons. Some were fine (I&#x27;m guessing lutefisk isn&#x27;t really bad for you despite the lye, same with pretzels), others weren&#x27;t (lead whiteners, for example).<p>Just because one agency sees things as generally safe and has messed up doesn&#x27;t mean <i>all</i> agencies have done this nor does it mean they are always wrong. Just like the fact that coke will clean battery terminals doesn&#x27;t mean it is bad to have occasionally. Heck, eating lemons will destroy tooth enamel, but yet the juice will help keep scurvy away.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;qlJ30PGUk8Y" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;qlJ30PGUk8Y</a>\n[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.victorianweb.org&#x2F;science&#x2F;health&#x2F;health1.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.victorianweb.org&#x2F;science&#x2F;health&#x2F;health1.html</a>')
