Gift cards, if you already know someone was going to spend their own money somewhere anyway, are an OK way of displacing cash they were going to spend anyway (and often perceived as more socially tolerable).<p>Kids meanwhile?  Ask the parent, it&#x27;s OK to bring an idea of your own to that parent, or just get a theme, but ask the parent.  That allows for co-ordination of who&#x27;s getting what type of gift and also helps get the gifts that the parent will let the kids have.<p>This xmas &#x2F; fall gifts season (various birthdays) a brand of magnetic edge building walls (piccaso tiles, I think?) was the rage with some family I gave gifts to.  I hope they like the mother-load hoard of tiles that are in the que for Xmas.')
