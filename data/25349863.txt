The capabilities a process (or, a &#x27;component&#x27; in Fuchsia&#x27;s model) use&#x2F;consume are <i>explicitly</i> given to it. And this scheme is implemented in a way that is easy to see and account for where&#x2F;from these capabilities are going to&#x2F;from. An process can do nothing that is not provided by the capabilities it got during creation.<p>Of course, components might be buggy&#x2F;malicious and leak capabilities. But the security holes bottleneck in this capability routing scheme, so even with buggy&#x2F;malicious components, it&#x27;s much easier to audit and fix. And from an attacker perspective, it&#x27;s much harder to reach a component given the routing path of capabilities that it&#x27;s received.')
