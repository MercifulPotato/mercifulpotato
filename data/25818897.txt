Once all of the ingredients are measured, then combining them when needed becomes far more efficient, instead of context-switching.<p>Alternatively, use a scale. Keep your dish you&#x27;re baking on the scale, and just keep adding stuff until the right amount of weight is added. IMO, the scale methodology is far easier.<p>----<p>As far as &quot;chopping an onion&quot;, there&#x27;s a safe way to slice food. You want the knife to be very sharp, then when you do a slight &quot;slicing&quot; motion, you can feel the bite. When you feel the bite, that&#x27;s when you can press down, knowing that the knife won&#x27;t slip on the onion and slice off a chunk of your skin.<p>If you push down before you feel the bite, you may have the top of the knife slide off the top off the onion and onto your fingers. With a dull knife, that&#x27;s not a big deal (but a dull knife means you&#x27;re not really going to be cutting very quickly...)')
