I heard about hegemony, and how theories of cultural transmission have changed over time.. I heard of Edward Said and his The Myth of the “Clash of Civilizations”, I heard of Virilio&#x27;s &quot;Pure War&quot; of technology vs humanity... but I can&#x27;t recall any discussion of a culture war.. which leads me to suspect that this phrase is actually just made up by a group of people who want to bring the ideas of violent struggle into their discourse about who the world ought to be.. and journalist have unwittingly picked up the phrase and reified it(another nifty media studies word). There aren&#x27;t two side to a culture war, there isn&#x27;t any war. from what I&#x27;ve heard of fascist ideology, and how it glorifies violence and war, it&#x27;s not surprising that the phrase would arise.')
