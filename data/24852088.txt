Outside a few areas,  most geothermal plants are quite small: I doubt we&#x27;ll ever see one over 15MW in Canada, for example.<p>A 7MW plant doesn&#x27;t sound like much, but if you&#x27;re cookie-cuttering 9 of them along a line, costs come way down since they&#x27;re all essentially identical. I did some back-of-the-envelope calculations and if we did all the larger (over 15000hp) natural gas compressor stations in the US and Canada, we&#x27;d be looking at something like 42TWh per year of generation. That compares to 68 TWh for all deployed utility solar (2018 tho).  That&#x27;s just gas compressor stations, which are about 15% of the industrial heat generated in the US.')
