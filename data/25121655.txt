Yes, gmail in general makes it difficult to spoof the email in the From header (it will replace it with your own if you try in the general case), but there&#x27;s a huge but, if you gave gmail itself access to use that e-mail.  i.e. I can be compsciphd@gmail.com but if billgates@gmail.com was convinced to allow me access to send emails as billgates@gmail.com (either via cooperation or a technical or sociological hack) then i can do that without having access to the account.  and this permission is permanent.  as far as I can tell, it irrevocable and to other gmail users there is no indication that other accounts have this permission for your email.<p>so what do we learn<p>1) can&#x27;t 100% trust DKIM to believe who an email was sent to unless you actually retrieved it out of said user&#x27;s email spool\n2) can&#x27;t 100% trust DKIM to believe who actually sent an email (even on gmail)<p>now, do I think DKIM gives anywhere close to 0% trust.  No, I think its much closer to 100 than 0, but one has to understand the limitations and most people who discuss it, don&#x27;t seem to understand them.<p>the threat is a hack playing a very long game.  If one doesn&#x27;t view that long game hack threat as serious, then its close enough to 100% (especially if gmail rotates their keys even without making the private part public), but if a long game hack threat is a serious thing, then it drops.')
