The machines&#x2F;algorithms&#x2F;authority structures and so forth are in place in large part to provide that confidence.<p>The issue today is that the leadership (in many areas of life from business to military to government), who make the decision to kill&#x2F;censor&#x2F;interrupt business&#x2F;etc or not, are saying &quot;we have to follow the data&quot; without having any understanding of what that really means.<p>Ultimately, this creates false confidence both in the decision-maker and those that are following their lead. I find it unlikely that there would be anywhere near the same willingness if the &#x27;intelligence&#x27; many of these decisions were based on didn&#x27;t <i>seem</i> as rich and unmistakably correct as it often does.<p>Of course, the practical effect here is that leadership gets to blame the algorithm&#x2F;model&#x2F;data instead of having to accept the blame themselves. If only those <i>pesky engineers and nerds in the lab were better at the job</i> we&#x27;d bomb less foreigners.')
