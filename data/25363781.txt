Life costs are nowhere near quadruple, in fact they are roughly equal to lower in the US.  I have no idea where you think this costs more, but I feel like this is a politicized statement taking averages and applying them to a subset of people who have the necessary affluence where the transition makes sense.  Increased medical costs which impact uninsured or underinsured people in the US basically don&#x27;t exist for tech workers who have high-quality employer-paid medical benefits in the US, as a simple example where this line of reasoning is flawed.<p>Social safety nets are something that only really matters to people who think they may end up using those social safety nets.  People are often wrong about this, but that&#x27;s just how people think.  A lot of the affluent people who see themselves becoming more affluent in the US clearly understand it&#x27;s partly due to not having to cover the social safety net for others.  Actions speak louder than words.<p>2. and 3. I don&#x27;t understand your &quot;what?&quot;.  In regards to #2 and #3, there&#x27;s a massive difference in lifestyle and freedom of choice in your daily life when you own a sizeable single-family home on a city outskirts or in a suburb vs live in an apartment in the middle of a city.  Each of these has pros and cons and attracts different people at different stages of their life.  Meaningfully, the sizeable single-family home on the outskirts is mostly out of reach for people in Europe, even highly skilled individuals who would be solidly middle class in the US.  This is only one of the myriad differences in lifestyle and freedom and how it affects daily life for someone living in both places.<p>A simple example from my own life, is that a good friend of mine moved near me from Germany because we both have a shared interest in racing cars.  While Germany has fantastic things like the Nurburgring where you can simply drive on during open days to the public, TUV regulations and the significant increased costs of components, as well as difficulty in owning enough property to have space to work on your own cars makes it a lot more difficult to be a serious hobbyist gearhead in Germany vs the US.  Here, he has a decent sized single-family home with a 3-car garage with high ceilings and a lift, as well as easy low-cost access to 6 race tracks within a one day drive, all at a fraction of his salary.<p>Obviously, YMMV and there is no one-size-fits-all answer.  I loved Europe, but I came back to the US after many visits and living in Europe on a temporary residency for a year, largely for many of these same reasons myself.  My sample set may be biased, but the Grandparent asked why some Europeans want to move to the US, I&#x27;m just sharing the reasons which were expressed to me.  You may disagree with them in your own personal opinion, but it doesn&#x27;t change that these are reasons which matter to some people.')
