They have decided to stick with python 2 at least for the foreseeable future, because the work of porting to python 3 is seen as too expensive and risky. This is a company that sold for over $2 billion to a much larger, much more enterprisey company. I wouldn’t be even remotely surprised if they’re still on python 2 in another ten years.')
