Majority of Turkish citizens are not happy with him.<p>Western world keeps doing the some mistake  (if not on purpose) as they do with Russia, skipping that difference when bringing up all the negativity about him. As Putin, this just helps him solidifying his base, by using this to create a common enemy outside of Turkey.<p>With that said, I don&#x27;t believe even Erdogan himself wants to have any fight with anyone outside of Turkey but just trying to protect country&#x27;s interest internationally. That&#x27;s why although his support is in a band of 30-40%, a solid 85% of Turkish people are supporting his international policies.')
