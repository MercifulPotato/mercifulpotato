But the hw for LKA and adaptive cruise control can do a lot. That&#x27;s all that Comma AI&#x27;s Open Pilot needs, and a Toyota with TSS 2.0 is considered the best platform for Open Pilot. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s self driving but using Open Pilot gives you a really nice hands free experience driving on the highway.')
