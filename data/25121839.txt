Very few are choosing between &quot;secure job with a future&quot; and &quot;zero-hours contract gig economy&quot; and preferring the latter.</i><p>Exactly my point. So accusing these companies is hitting the wrong target.<p>One should also realise that these jobs are very low productivity so cannot pay much. If for the drivers the choice is this or no job then people should complain about the economic situation not these companies.')
