I would summarize it as &quot;good life, good sleep, good learning&quot;. And yes, order matters.\nThe fact is that recently I was completely in my midlife crisis and was at probably 50% of my mental stamina (memory loss, lack of interest, poor focus, and <i>insomnia</i>). I was ok with the fact that I was getting old and accepted all that as normal. Then things changed (my mortgage ended, my children went out of the primal-youth zone, I lost a really demanding job). Now things are really different. I sleep well, things seem to really get into my mind much like it used to be during my youth. \nI am not so sure I understand what is happening. But I definitely consider my previous state as impossible to learn anything whatever method I use.\nI am slowly getting out of that.\nAnd I now force me into a mental diet to avoid any unnecessary stimulus that would bring me back to my previous state. \nSo my learning experience is that external conditions are supremely important. The method comes second.\n[And yes, supermemo is pretty cool]')
