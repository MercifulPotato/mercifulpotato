It&#x27;s nice being able to make something that responds to user input in a way that feels instantaneous. When you strip out the complexities of Operating systems, and the software they run that competes for resources, you can make programs that are a pleasure to use, and do a specific job well.<p>I&#x27;ve been working mostly with Arm Cortex-M, like STM32. Give it a shot - it&#x27;ll at least broaden your horizons. The Rust toolchain and peripheral access crates make getting started easier than with C toolchains.<p>It&#x27;s easy to spin embedded into a multi-domain learning experience. Ie, firmware, PCB design and ordering, enclosure machining, PC-based update tools, part choosing etc.<p>It feels...liberating: If I think of an electronic device I&#x27;d like to exist, I have the tools available to make it happen. Nothing I&#x27;ve done in Python, Javascript, etc provided this.')
