This means you have to have a level of competence - across your organisation (including how you store, retrieve data, and how you recognise customers) - before you start storing their data.<p>Really if you can&#x27;t established a way to recognise customers how can we (as customers) expect you to competently do 2FA and competently store data without losing it.<p>It&#x27;s like complaining that your kitchen shouldn&#x27;t have to keep track of expiry dates of meat; if that&#x27;s too onerous for you then you&#x27;re showing you&#x27;re not competent to run a kitchen.')
