It&#x27;s not a question of <i>if</i> I&#x27;ll forget it, but <i>when</i>. And when that time comes, I&#x27;m able to do a search and remind myself of my thoughts about the book&#x2F;article&#x2F;podcast&#x2F;whatever.<p>With that out of the mind, how to do that is easy. Just annotate whatever you&#x27;re consuming, then look through those annotations, and paraphrase them in a way that it makes sense for you. I do that after every few book chapters, or every few articles in my Pocket with a tag `extract`. I can automate that as well, but annotations alone are not &quot;knowledge&quot; that belongs in my knowledge base.<p>I also pay attention to properly reference stuff, so that I could easily back up my claims in whichever circumstance I need to do so. This is the most common use case of retrieving info from my knowledge base. I vaguely remember something, I look it up in my kb, and I can phrase it better and back it up with sources if I think it&#x27;s necessary.')
