Item(by='cambalache', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608071466, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25432540, text='A couple of comments, it&#x27;s pretty funny to say this site tends conservative when all the heavy downvoted comments are all conservatives. HN and &#x2F;. &quot;used&quot; to be, not right wing, but libertarian, but since the escalation of the woke brigade most people have been silenced, it is not useful to lose your job over some comments. Btw, weird that the crazy story about the new McCarthy-style list of the NVIDIA researcher has not reached the site (or I havent seen it more probably).<p>The other thing to have in mind is that this exaggerated dynamic not only happens in the US. So everytime you read something like &quot;500!!!! journalists detained&quot; in China&#x2F;Mexico&#x2F;Uzbekistan, 10% are actual journalists, and 90% are people who was in the protests filming claiming they were filming with their phones. Far from me to defend an authoritarian regime, I mention this because it seems is a blind-spot many Americans have. The same exaggerations  made by the media in America (the result of a polarized society) usually happen elsewhere too')
