Correct me if I’m wrong.  Ponder that for a moment.  Classical Chinese poetry is one of the treasures of world literature...<p>If Taiwan was the vanguard of preserving the world treasure of Classical Chinese culture, then haven’t they earned the right to be China?<p>But where does that put the Han empire that controls such a large chunk of Eurasia?  Is it fair to call a government that destroys the best part of your past a China?  Even Japan and the European colonialists didn’t try to rip out China’s artistic and religious heart.<p>Say you have a house with two brothers.  They inherited some fine porcelain plates, cups, etc..  But one brother, within living memory, became a raving drunk for a decade and broke a lot of the pieces.  Fortunately, the best pieces were hidden away in a separate closet the other brother kept that the drunken brother couldn’t get at.  Maybe it is good to keep that good china in that separate drawer in case your brother decides to go on another drunken rampage and break everything...')
