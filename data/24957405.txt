Item(by='smnrchrds', descendants=None, kids=[24957678, 24958446, 24957452], score=None, time=1604208358, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24957363, text='&gt; <i>It means people want to kill her, and the police can&#x27;t provide 24&#x2F;7 protection to guarantee safety.</i><p>But why shouldn&#x27;t they protect her 24&#x2F;7? It is sending organized crime a strong message that they can threaten anyone (perhaps with the exception of high politicians) to do anything. The chilling effect this must have on potential witnesses, whistle-blowers, and resistance must be worth something to the public. Now, no other attorney or insurance adjuster would dare raise a concern that might negatively influence the income stream for organized crime. The criminals will get richer and more powerful and more brazen.<p>EDIT: Imagine if we did that with politicians and judges too; not provide them with security when they need it [1]. What kind of world would we be living in? Organized crime could dictate every law and decide every case they want. I am sure that no cop would tell a supreme court judge, &quot;Your honour, as long as you don&#x27;t continue ruling against the mob, your life will not be in danger. But if you continue doing what you were previously doing, we cannot guarantee your safety.&quot; In the current climate, I guess we don&#x27;t have to worry about this specific scenario. With no attorneys willing to take cases against the mob, it would never land on a judge&#x27;s desk.<p>[1] I understand for Americans the <i>when</i> qualifier may sound weird. But here in Canada, we don&#x27;t lock up high ranking officials 24&#x2F;7 for the rest of their lives. A supreme court justice went missing for a short while last year and that triggered a police search.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbc.ca&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;clement-gascon-mental-health-1.5136015" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbc.ca&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;clement-gascon-mental-healt...</a>')
