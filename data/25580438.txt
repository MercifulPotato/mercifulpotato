Their only way out is fighting for a job, but jobs are scarce, and the situation will get worse exponentially due to technological unemployment.<p>That&#x27;s not an ideologically-constructed problem.<p>It&#x27;s pure logic. What is ideologically-driven, in my opinion, is claiming that &quot;other jobs will be created, so no need to worry&quot;. Which implies, on the other hand, that the poor deserve being poor, due to their own negligence, lack of education, or laziness. We don&#x27;t need to care about them. We provide a capitalist system which rewards the brave and the competent, and it&#x27;s meritocratic. That is pure ideology, not based on reality.')
