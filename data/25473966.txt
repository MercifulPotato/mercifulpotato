Then use google scholar or your bibliography tool of choice to see who&#x27;s cited it. It takes a little work but just burn down the list reading abstracts as well as noting how heavily each of these papers has in turn been cited. Those are likely the most influential derived works. It&#x27;s common for grad students to do survey papers as well, so keep an eye out for those as they often give you a great roadmap to the current state of things.<p>Also pay attention to authors.
