Finally we can do the kind of web performance improvements we couldn&#x27;t do on the old platform. But to boot, we gained 10-20% on the First Render metrics. \nAnd because of the whole new way we deploy, we went from a 27% hit ratio (of popular pages) to 96% in the CDN. That means ~70% of the time you gain about 300-500ms on the initial load. \nAnd besides, before, cold cache misses in the CDN would result in a backend server rendering whereas now a cold cache miss just means an S3 lookup.')
