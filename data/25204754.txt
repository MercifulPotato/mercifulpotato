Apple believes strongly in retain-and-release &#x2F; ARC. It has designed its software that way; it has designed its M1 memory architecture that way. The harmony between those design considerations leads to efficiency: the software  does things in the best way possible, given the memory architecture.<p>I&#x27;m not an EE expert and I haven&#x27;t torn apart an M1, but Occams&#x27;s Razor would suggest it&#x27;s unlikely they made specialized hardware for NSObjects specifically. Other ARC systems on the same hardware would likely see similar benefits.')
