You are still avoiding answering my criticism of your original thesis.<p>Edit: I’ll append the approximations at the base of my heuristic:<p>* I only care about marginal $deltas when comparing<p>* an extra shipping container costs $10000<p>* one cubic metre holds 1000 one litre boxes<p>* a charger costs Apple $5<p>* total marginal $delta shipping costs are less than 10 times the delta in shipping costs<p>* Apple use 20 foot containers<p>Although on second thought, they must use planes otherwise inventory in transit would be astronomical, but I still believe that marginal savings from not producing a charger dominates (by over 10x) the savings from smaller packaging.')
