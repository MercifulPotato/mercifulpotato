However, this alone is the primary reason I may never move back. Itâ€™s too damn hot and only going to get hotter. I now live somewhere that has 4 seasons and where I can turn off the air conditioning for weeks or months at a time. It turns out pleasant weather is a pretty important factor for me and, I imagine, many other people as well.')
