That line is just a fragment of the post, which specifically has this line:<p>“ We all like to think that collaboration, harmony and love drives innovation but much of innovation is built around intense rivalry and competition as well.”<p>Keyword here is “as well”. If you feel the need to respond or vote someone down please read the post carefully rather then respond or vote baselessly.<p>More clarification is necessary. Competition is the driver of natural selection. Your entire biological form exists as an evolution of winning traits because your ancestors out competed and defeated others who fought to reproduce so someone else could take your place.<p>Competition is therefore a primary driver of your existence while collaboration is secondary. It’s not that competition <i>can</i> lead to benefits, the phenomenon that occurs is that collaboration can actually work but only as a tertiary driver behind competition.<p>See communism if you want to know the results of a society formed with collaboration over competition as the primary driver.')
