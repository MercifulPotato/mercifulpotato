People were incensed at this mainly because of Airbnb operators taking over so many buildings.<p>The local food bank has seen a jump in people homeless or paying more to rent farther from the urban center or suburbs. It&#x27;s almost entirely due to Airbnb operators &quot;renovicting&quot; people. So a protest donation of anti-STR people gave to the same food bank in the amount of nearly $13,000 at last count.<p>Many people in my small town hate Airbnb due to the sudden, massive, and negative change it&#x27;s caused in local housing.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.journalpioneer.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;provincial&#x2F;short-term-rental-protest-on-twitter-collects-10000-for-pei-food-bank-529346&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.journalpioneer.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;provincial&#x2F;short-term-re...</a>')
