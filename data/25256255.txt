If no one is allowed to start an interaction then how is it supposed to start?<p>&gt;The victims here are mainly the people who are forced to cope with that crap, but never asked for it, and don&#x27;t wanna date any of those people for whatever reason.<p>It seems to me like a simple fix; when someone approaches you you tell them &quot;sorry not my type&#x2F;interested&#x2F;looking.&quot;<p>Or just block messages from people you don&#x27;t know.<p>I&#x27;m not keen to destroy all social interactions for the sake of the people who cannot handle them.<p>&gt; Yet we still don&#x27;t have filters for dickpics and sexual harrasment.<p>I see where you&#x27;re coming from, but I disagree with your solution, which is to just prevent any interaction that&#x27;s sexual in nature (although dickpics are not the same thing as what op was suggesting).')
