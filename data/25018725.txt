Remember that whole &quot;no taxation without representation&quot; thing a couple of centuries ago and how badly that turned out?  Rural areas are where all the food, agricultural and mineral resources of the United States are produced, not to mention the source of the majority of its armed forces, so trying to disenfranchise them isn&#x27;t going to end well.<p>And the minority isn&#x27;t small either: the last time I checked, even in archetypically left-leaning California, about 1&#x2F;3 of the vote went to Trump; for the other two west coast states, the tally was closer to 40%.<p>The answer, of course, is to focus on uniting the nation, not division, even if it means not all the changes people want happen as quickly as they would prefer.  &quot;<i>Politics is the art of the possible</i>&quot; after all.')
