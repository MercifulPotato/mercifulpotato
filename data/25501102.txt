Obviously you need to know electronics too but 80MSPS will let you get away with a lot (The term is signal integrity) of bad circuitry (as I can attest to...).<p>Verilog isn&#x27;t too bad as long as you treat it as a description of a circuit (in a language from the past, not even mentioning VHDL...)')
