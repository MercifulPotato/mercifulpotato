You have turned nearly every reply into a combat. Each one a chance for you to claim you were slighted by big bad bullies.<p>And rather than taking the explicit feedback you&#x27;ve gotten, instead you&#x27;ve imagined some sort of conspiracy against you.<p>&gt;&gt; I just have too much experience in the industry to throw away my time and play with toys.<p>Seriously, get <i>out</i> of here trying to gaslight everyone by acting like you came into this thread with a genuine sense of curiosity.
