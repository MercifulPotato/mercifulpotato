Item(by='zimpenfish', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607256586, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25320880, text='&gt; that it is possible to run, for many years (life?) without destroying your joints.<p>I knew a few people who&#x27;ve done well over 200 marathons (a couple are well over 500, one is over 1500 IIRC, one did &gt;250 in a calendar year) without destroying their joints.  Now it might be that their running style (invariably &quot;slow and easy&quot;) that lets them do that many marathons also contributes to them avoiding this issue.')
