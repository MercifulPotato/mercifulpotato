Item(by='culturedsystems', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603535489, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24873792, text='I&#x27;m also on Android in Europe, with no YouTube Music subscription, and it lets me play music in the background, without ads, if it&#x27;s either on the device or in the &quot;Uploads&quot; section (which is where it&#x27;s put music I&#x27;d purchased on Google Play Music). So it looks like they haven&#x27;t completely removed that functionality, although the interface for accessing it is significantly more annoying.')
