I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s now so my memories aren&#x27;t so fresh but I do wonder what utopian school the writer went to, if this really is unfamiliar.<p>It does sound like, in the interest of making progress rather than perpetuating our own pains, that this teacher could use some support. Sounds like someone who wants to do well but is getting frayed by the difficult situation. Could a substitute take a couple periods here and there to give time for grading? Could there be some curriculum flexibility given the extra administrative? I don&#x27;t know the answer but the nice thing is that it&#x27;s a non-public school so they may have some autonomy to help.')
