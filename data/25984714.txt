Various intel&#x2F;etc products have done that, which provides a fast tier of memory that you put in a local NUMA domain. Then put the actual DRAM in its own domain.<p>The problem so far is that strategy doesn&#x27;t actually work well for most applications because they aren&#x27;t sufficiently NUMA aware to take advantage of it. Instead what ends up happening is the &quot;fast&quot; ram ends up being a LLC tier.<p>It all ends up sorta being a physics thing though, it seems as you increase capacity, distance tends to grow as well. Meaning that there will be a limit to how much RAM they can toss on package and still gain a latency advantage over just soldering it to the board.')
