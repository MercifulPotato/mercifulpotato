Item(by='zzzeek', descendants=None, kids=[24926263], score=None, time=1603935245, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24925810, text='I&#x27;m not familiar with any UI bugs of any kind, but we don&#x27;t use the &quot;live editing&quot; feature, maybe that&#x27;s where you had problems.    The big issue with Gerrit is on the &quot;getting plugins to work&quot; side of things, as they are kind of ad-hoc and almost totally undocumented, as well as the access model is too complicated but once that&#x27;s all working, there is no need to deal with it.<p>nitpicky culture, we maybe have that problem with Openstack where there are thousands of developers, but for our projects in SQLAlchemy we&#x27;re a team of about five people and I&#x27;m more or less a BDFL type of role, to the degree that we are nitpicky about things it only prevents much bigger problems from happening later, if a review has little things that are bugging me I&#x27;ll just fix them myself and push a new change up rather than bothering them with it, also something you can&#x27;t usually do with pull requests.')
