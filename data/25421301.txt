I am not associated with the OpenLibrary project, so the following answer might not be completely correct. I think the goals of OpenLibrary extend beyond just loaning&#x2F;borrowing books. I believe the original goal of the project was to catalog all books. You could reach out to the OpenLibrary folks to see if they have a search filter for only books available for borrow or if they are planning on making this available.')
