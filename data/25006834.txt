Item(by='finn_american', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604661792, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25003999, text='Lots about this already in other comment threads, but a first hand experience to share here.<p>Let&#x27;s cut to the chase: if you&#x27;re in tech, and you&#x27;re any good at what you do (you know who you are), you likely shouldn&#x27;t waste your time on Helsinki or anywhere in Europe.<p>Let&#x27;s start with the money...<p>In Helsinki as a software engineer you&#x27;re looking at 3kEUR - 7kEUR monthly salary before tax. Only the flashiest software consulting firms will pay ultra senior people 6k (you&#x27;d better have 10+ years of experience to even broach the topic!). In Finland, if you make 6 kEUR a month you&#x27;ve &quot;made it&quot; and your colleagues will be openly jealous (yes, really). Stock options in Finland are a joke, you will receive perhaps a tenth of what you might anywhere in the US (if even), and they will be non-qualified options in American terms, there is no such thing as an ISO here.<p>Taxes? Your all-in income tax will be 40-50% on that 6k income. Plus 24% VAT on anything you buy in a store. And as a completely medieval twist, food is exorbitantly expensive in Finland because the &quot;reduced&quot; VAT on that is 17% (by comparison in most civilized countries groceries are taxed at like... 1-2% if at all).<p>If you want to convert what that means to SF terms, using the last year&#x27;s USD&#x2F;EUR FX rate and some cost of living stats from Numbeo, you&#x27;ll find that you can multiply a Helsinki monthly salary in Euros by 12.5 and then again by 2.02 to arrive at a yearly USD salary in SF equivalent (there is a quirk about vacation money in Finland, hence the 12.5 instead of 12 months).<p><i></i><i></i> So the Finnish tech pay scale scales to.... 75kUSD - 150kUSD if you were in SF, given FX and Cost of Living adjustments outlined above <i></i>*<p>In SF you&#x27;re looking at 100kUSD - 250kUSD per year, and lower taxes across the board, realistically. In SF if you agree to a 120-150k salary, you&#x27;re either quite early in your career or are one of the first employees at the company and receiving a handsome options grant. (and again, in Finland, you won&#x27;t get nearly the same options, think missing-a-zero territory, really).<p>Which brings us to our second point. Talent pool and work ethic.<p>I&#x27;ve spent the last couple years hiring in tech extensively in Helsinki. I know the talent pool reasonably well. There are certainly some diamonds in the rough but on the whole it&#x27;s very weak.<p>Anyone who can get a job in the US has already done so and left, not just because of the massive economic incentive, but also because A-players want to work with other A-players. Smart motivated people want to work with other smart motivated people. The best want to learn from the best. It&#x27;s as simple as that.<p>Most of the people you&#x27;ll work with in Finland are very nice, but more than a few are also keeping detailed records of their contractual 15 minute coffee breaks. It&#x27;s a &quot;punch in. do work. punch out.&quot; kinda place on the whole. There are obviously exceptions and I am exaggerating a bit to get the point across, but the overall vibe is that going the extra mile is rare and frowned upon (you wouldn&#x27;t want to make everyone else look bad!).<p>The same work ethic issues seem to apply to founders, who are often all too happy to put the brakes on their company to take a monthlong vacation in the summer. While that&#x27;s great for work-life balance it&#x27;s just not business smart if you&#x27;re trying to get a startup off the ground.<p>On the other hand, is it a nice place to live? Yes, yes it is. Stuff just works. You&#x27;re not accosted by homeless people on your way in every day. You get the sense that perhaps those taxes are actually buying something useful and relevant.')
