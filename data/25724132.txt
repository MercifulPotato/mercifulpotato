For about 2 years they had cnn playing on a tv near the break room, so as I refilled my water bottle, I got to see what cnn thought was the most important (Trump) news.<p>They spent a week on how much diet soda he drank. They had experts on saying why it could cause mental problems and that they should use the 25th on him.<p>They spent several days when he had 2 scoops of ice cream at a White House dinner, while his guests only got one scoop. I wish I was joking about this, but I am not. I sometimes wonder what Wolf Blitzer thinks as he’s commenting on some of these stories. Such a name, wasted.<p>Those are the two most comical, but the scary thing is all news is biased. Two sides of the same coin.  If you don’t think so, I suggest you search out other sources.  Why wouldn’t they be biased?  News today is about making money, and cnn and others cashed in on the hate for trump.')
