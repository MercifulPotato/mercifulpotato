Item(by='pron', descendants=None, kids=[24961750], score=None, time=1604257192, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24961454, text='There are various avenues of research in this area (you may want to look at David Harel&#x27;s Behavioural Programming [1], and for more deductive approaches look at Back&#x27;s refinement calculus, which is very similar to what you have in mind), but to date, we do not have any methodology that allows us to either synthesise or verify programs that correspond to specifications that are routinely written and verified in TLA+; we&#x27;re nowhere even remotely close. It&#x27;s comparing a battle-tested, industrial-grade tool with hints of more or less promising directions in the lab. The gap between the lab and the field is so large that we must be careful to treat them as almost two different worlds.<p>[1]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il&#x2F;~bprogram&#x2F;more.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il&#x2F;~bprogram&#x2F;more.html</a>')
