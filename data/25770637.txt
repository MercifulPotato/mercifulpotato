Equally obtuse are the people who think &quot;Those scientists cannot communicate with the common man&quot;, well guess what, that skill is distributed almost randomly among that lot, so for every scientist with an opaque style there is a wonderful communicator. The same happen in IT&#x2F;CS and in any other field.')
