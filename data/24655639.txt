But it&#x27;s not keeping people from being musicans.<p>Im 57, and have been playing the piano for 50 years. (I still practice 2 hours&#x2F;day).<p>The problem with piano isn&#x27;t reading the music, it&#x27;s getting your hands in the right place, at the right time, with the least amount of effort, to be able to control the keys the way you want to.<p>Most of my practicing is getting from one place to another on the keyboard. I&#x27;m practicing the space &quot;between&quot; the notes (or positions on the keyboard; I start off by &#x27;grouping&#x27; things).<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m amused when I see &quot;learn keyboard&quot; systems that somehow make you believe the problem is simply seeing a C# two octaves above middle C on the staff and figuring out where it is on the keyboard. You can learn all that in a week. The rest takes years.')
