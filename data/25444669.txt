The goalposts were always about data collection.<p>&gt; fake accusations of privacy violations.<p>There is a real privacy violation going on here. The author has simply externalized it from his app&#x27;s code. My point was that privacy can be violated outside the app itself and in the ecosystem where it is consumed. A publisher who cares about that, like GGP claimed to in the original comment I replied to, would work to mitigate that data collection as well.<p>To take the argument to the logical next step, it&#x27;s like saying you can get my app, which doesn&#x27;t collect any information at all, for free; however, to get it, you have to link your Twitter and Facebook accounts to the store website and share that you downloaded the app on those platforms.')
