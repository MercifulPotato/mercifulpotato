I&#x27;m confident we will be able to eradicate this virus with vaccines, like we have (mostly) done so in the past with diseases such as polio or tetanus.<p>No of course they&#x27;re not a majority, but there are enough out there that it reduces herd immunity; I&#x27;m not epidemiologist so I can&#x27;t really make an argument as to how much, but it will be &gt; 0.<p>Yeah polio is unfortunately a perfect example of how one community for whatever reason choosing not to vaccinate leaves a reservoir for the disease and prevents total eradication. I&#x27;d be <i>delighted</i> if I&#x27;m proven wrong and we manage to eradicate Covid-19.  I&#x27;m just personally skeptical compliance will be high enough to do it considering the anecdotal data just watching people wear masks now, which is frankly a much lower bar.')
