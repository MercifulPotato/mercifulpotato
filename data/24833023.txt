So armed with a Z-80 manual and a memory map of the system you could probably do basically anything.<p>Since the system used block character graphics (like ANSI block graphics), and a memory-mapped display, accessing them from assembly language (or any language) seems like it would be trivial unless they somehow kept the video RAM address and character set a secret.<p>However, it doesn&#x27;t look like Radio Shack provided official source listings for their firmware the way IBM (and perhaps other companies) did. I expect that greatly helped with the development of software and tools for the IBM PC, as well as the development of compatible machines.<p>As much as I like modern computers and smartphones (and systems like the Raspberry Pi) which have absurdly higher speed and greater storage than vintage machines, it&#x27;s always amazing to consider the explosion of creativity and fun that people managed to have with these pioneering &quot;personal computers.&quot;')
