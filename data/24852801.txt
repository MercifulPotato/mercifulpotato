Item(by='foresto', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603318322, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24846394, text='I look forward to more ARM boards getting mainline kernel support for exactly this reason.<p>&gt; Better buy a RPi4 with a NAS Hat<p>Do you know of such a HAT that does USB-attached SCSI Protocol correctly and reliably, and passes through SMART reporting without meddling, and doesn&#x27;t inappropriately spin down the disks under its control? I wouldn&#x27;t mind bookmarking such a thing if it exists.<p>I considered the RPi for a recent NAS build, but I didn&#x27;t want the higher CPU load imposed by a USB-to-SATA bridge (as compared to native&#x2F;PCIe SATA), nor did I want to play chipset roulette looking for a SATA bridge free from the problems I mentioned above.<p>I ended up using a RockPro64 with a Marvell 88SE9235 PCIe SATA card. It works well, and boots mainline Debian with no vendor blobs. Assuming the electronics don&#x27;t wear out, I expect it will continue to run fully-updated linux for a long time to come.')
