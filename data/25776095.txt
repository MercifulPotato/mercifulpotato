Back then being recorded was a big deal and quite rare, so what little of it survives to this day was probably not representative of the bulk of how people talked.<p>Also back then people traveled less (especially in the lower classes) which probably made accents stronger and more easily identifiable. Now it&#x27;s routine for people of all classes to move to a different part of the country for studies or work, and you have mass media spamming a somewhat &quot;standard&quot; Parisian French across the country.<p>And speech is still the main interface of communication. In general when people send casual texts they&#x27;ll try to emulate the spoken language, including nonstandard inflections and spelling changes etc...<p>If anything on average we probably pay a lot less attention to the written word than we used to because we use it so much more and for much more casual conversation. Few people used to write &quot;wanna grab sumthin 2 eat?&quot; a few decades ago.')
