To me, this issue transcends politics and reveals a part of human nature that is beyond the definition of politics. I thought it would prompt an exploratory discussion of the matter and of human nature.<p>Unfortunately, many events which in reality exist with or without politics (like race-based hatred) are tagged with the political label. This also makes these events harder to discuss in an objective manner because an element of partisan thinking enters the fray: &quot;does my party support this or not?&quot; vs &quot;do I believe this is right or not&quot;.<p>EDIT: There have been many front page posts about the genocide of Uighur Muslims in China. Is that considered political as well?')
