I only played it this year because my computer was unable to handle it. I was disappointed with how easy and short the game was. Style over substance for someone who enjoys Baba Is You or Riven.<p>Anyway, the first several negative reviews read like this: &quot;Are you seriously looking for a negative review? Come on! The game is amazing! Buy it!&quot;<p>I hate the people who don&#x27;t cast their vote to represent just their opinion, but rather try to get the score where they think it belongs.<p>&quot; Absolutely amazing dont listen to the &quot;gamers&quot; that havent even played it yet and just love to get on a hate train. &quot; (10)<p>&quot; A fantastic game troubled by some technical issues. It&#x27;s obvious that right now it doesn&#x27;t deserve that 10&#x2F;10 (with some patches tho? possible), but I&#x27;m still scoring it like that to counter all the review bombing GTA kiddies (more depth, rotfl) and trolls that haven&#x27;t even seen the game. &quot; (10)<p>The above from the most overhyped game of the year.')
