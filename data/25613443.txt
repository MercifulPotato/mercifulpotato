If a release contains a hundred changes from a dozen teams, there’s no way a VP or CTO sitting on top can understand them all in any depth, so “performance improvements + bug fixes” may well be the full contents of the 30,000 foot view.<p>That doesn’t mean it’s impossible to produce more detailed notes for a big application, but it’s a pretty involved process basically requiring a “release note manager”, not something that happens by default.')
