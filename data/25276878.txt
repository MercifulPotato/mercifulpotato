Permits&#x2F;taxi drivers license, if that&#x27;s what you mean, isn&#x27;t much more than a minimum qualification requirement and not a hard limit.<p>&gt; Do you view this as a negative? because I do not<p>Yes? Because that&#x27;s a ~100 year regression in most developed nations and I empathize with the people on the receiving end of that kind of hat-in-hand relationship. To not see this as a negative suggests to me a worryingly low empathy with the less fortunate and perhaps even nostalgia to a strict class-society, because that&#x27;s the end result of a race-to-the-bottom unfettered capitalism.')
