I ask that you be a bit more precise in your advocacy.<p>I can replace a sorting method having O(N log N) time with one having O(N^2) time, without changing the type. But it will certainly have an effect on my system, and if the run-time is too long, may result in an unsafe system (eg, in a real-time control system which requires a maximum response time).<p>While I know what you mean, &quot;bad code&quot; includes things like unacceptable performance.<p>I also find it hard to understand how to apply type systems to algorithms. What is the type of an algorithm which returns a graph diameter, and how does it differ from one returning the graph eccentricity or other graph property?<p>(That&#x27;s where &quot;same values for the same arguments&quot; comes in, but that&#x27;s that hard part of the problem, yes?)')
