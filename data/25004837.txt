You just need to run a one liner to install and run the cluster. My only gripes is the internal certs only has 1 year expiration and to rotate it you&#x27;ll have to restart the cluster a few months before the expiration date (it won&#x27;t rotate the cert unless you restart it near the expiration date). It would be great if the internal cert has long expiration time (RKE has 10 year expiry by default) or provides manual control for rotating internal certs.')
