As a dev, you don&#x27;t see the HTML elements you are used to, and as a user, some things will behave strangely or not work at all. I can spot a Flutter web app in about 3 seconds (I have a web developer background).<p>In my opinion, Flutter for web makes sense when you already have mobile apps and you want to offer your services on the web quickly. You can build your existing mobile apps for the web in a matter of hours in most cases. However, if your company realizes that the web platform is important for the customers, it makes sense to invest time to migrate off of Flutter web to React&#x2F;Vue&#x2F;Angular, or if you want to share code or you just like Dart, you can also use AngularDart.<p>Flutter for web might be overhyped, but for some purposes, it makes sense as a temporary solution, as a quick win.<p>It&#x27;s also important to keep in mind that the web offering of Flutter is not yet stable, so the team is very much aware that it&#x27;s &quot;not there yet&quot;.')
