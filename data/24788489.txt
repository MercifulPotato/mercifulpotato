If it&#x27;s not a useful tool, it will be discarded. Probably a more useful tool, like hyperbole, decontextualization, gross mis-interpretation, or just adding &quot;new facts&quot; will be used.<p>I think it&#x27;s naive to say that laissez faire speech is going to solve all issues, just like it&#x27;d be naive to say that peaceful protests would be a viable path to democracy in North Korea.<p>(Personally, I&#x27;d like to see bias recognition, propaganda recognition, and the ability to shift perspectives taught.
