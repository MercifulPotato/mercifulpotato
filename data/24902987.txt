The one I use for YouTube is currently less than half a page of shell script.  I never download VEVO or other videos that have enciphered signatures (most videos I encounter on web pages don&#x27;t), so there is no need for Python or any other slow scripting language and fiddling around with Google&#x27;s Javascript player.  Funnily enough, my scripts hardly ever break.  When they do break because of some YouTube change (only once so far), I can fix them in a fraction of the time it takes for the yt-dl project to respond to user complaints and make necessary fixes.<p>I doubt the press nor anyone else really needs yt-dl if all they are doing is downloading unprotected videos.<p>Even if someone wants to download VEVO or other protected ones, they don&#x27;t need youtube-dl to do it.  It is trivial to get the download URL for these videos with any &quot;modern&quot; browser.  For example, in Chrome, open Developer Tools Network tab, type &quot;videoplayback&quot; in the search box, copy one of the URLs (alt-click) and remove the &amp;range= parameter from the URL.<p>I wonder if the RIAA will ever go after persons trying to make money by offering anti-circumvention services, e.g.,<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.gitnol.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.gitnol.com&#x2F;</a><p>I find all those websites trying to sell so-called &quot;video downloaders&quot; very annoying.')
