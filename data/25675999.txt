What right does Texas have to make PA enforce their own laws? PA can choose not to enforce their laws if they want. But Texas, and six other states, claimed this would have diluted their own votes for the Federal Government.<p>I do not believe the standing issue here, because there is literally no other court for Texas to sue in.
