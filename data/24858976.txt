Item(by='q3k', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603380151, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24858951, text='The server doesn&#x27;t need to store the certificate, or even a mapping from certificate to identity. Just retrieving information encoded in the DN or SANs of a certificate presented by a client is enough to tie the connection originator&#x2F;client to an identity. I mean, it&#x27;s a design decision, whether you want to have a layer of indirection there - but keeping it without one allows TLS client certificates to be fully stateless, and be used across multiple backends that do not share any session&#x2F;mapping store between them.<p>In addition, if I&#x27;m being picky, TLS 1.3 changes how client certificates are used, and they are now not part of the initial handshake.')
