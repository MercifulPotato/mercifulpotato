It is very weak. This press release is like saying when the documentary about how bad McDonald is for you (Super Size me) came out, McDonald&#x27;s issues a statement saying, oh but they (filmmakers) were not fair, they did not show you guys the steps we take to keep harmful bacteria from your food and ensure we don&#x27;t poison you.<p>This whole Press release is about the &quot;Steps&quot; they have taken, very few of them tell us about these steps in detail or how we can verify them. There is no pledge to do better or a consequence to not meeting these goals. If feels to me that FB is mega coorp where the people in it want to do better but the machine is so much bigger than the people in it they are currently lost on how to do it without torching the whole company')
