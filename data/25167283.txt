The one that bit me was Rails automatically piping a class method from Model into the Model&#x27;s CollectionProxy, effectively making class methods into scopes. We use this pretty extensively at work for complex scopes, so this is one of the reasons I&#x27;ve not been able to get complete buy-in for sorbet. Is that better in tapioca?<p>(Also: Thank you for sorbet! It&#x27;s the biggest reason I continue to use Ruby for my personal projects.)<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chanzuckerberg&#x2F;sorbet-rails&#x2F;issues&#x2F;104" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;chanzuckerberg&#x2F;sorbet-rails&#x2F;issues&#x2F;104</a>')
