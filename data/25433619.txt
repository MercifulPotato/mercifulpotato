Used the open source variation of Chrome OS: Chromium OS. They have a nice hardware compatibility list. In my brief experiments with them, it worked well. They gave away the OS and charged for support in large deployments. I hope they&#x27;ll survive this acquisition.<p>I personally think they will. In a time when many schools are short of money, it makes sense to allow deployment of Chrome OS to existing hardware. Allows Google to expand Chrome OS&#x27;s base while working within budgets that don&#x27;t allow for mass purchases of new machines.<p>For those looking to try Chrome OS on their personal equipment, there&#x27;s not only Neverware, but there&#x27;s also the Brunch Project. The Brunch Project uses the official Chrome OS images and provides a way to install them. Neverware sometimes lacked certain features because of their use of Chromium OS, but the Brunch Project avoids that problem by using the official images.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sites.google.com&#x2F;view&#x2F;brunch-project&#x2F;downloads" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sites.google.com&#x2F;view&#x2F;brunch-project&#x2F;downloads</a>')
