I think the debate is around whether they should have those protections,<p>But if they can take away Facebook&#x27;s First Amendment rights, they can take away yours or mine.  And I&#x27;m not okay with that.<p>&gt;given that at present they are virtually a monopoly within their sphere and people don&#x27;t have viable alternatives to use once they are kicked off of Facebook.<p>I don&#x27;t use Facebook (I did, ever since they opened up to non-university emails until 2014) and I have no problem staying in touch&#x2F;sharing&#x2F;communicating with other people at all.<p>And until there&#x27;s a decentralized, privacy and content ownership protecting social media platform (I do have a Diaspora account and even ran a pod for a while, but I don&#x27;t use that anymore either) that I want to use, I&#x27;ll pass, thanks.<p>So no.  Facebook isn&#x27;t required at all.  There are many other ways to communicate with others.<p>Don&#x27;t like Facebook?  Vote with your feet.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt.  Really.<p>&gt;BTW, my private property rights can be overridden whenever the government or utilities or even neighbors can show a public need.<p>That&#x27;s absolutely true.  But your First Amendment rights cannot be overridden by the government.  Of course there are noise&#x2F;disturbing the peace&#x2F;public nuisance ordinances, but your (and my) free speech rights aren&#x27;t absolute either.<p>Edit: Fixed typos.')
