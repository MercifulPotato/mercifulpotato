Even ignoring things like solid module support and libraries you&#x27;ll find your Rust programs to be much fewer LoC (assuming bug&#x2F;LoC is the right metric) for equivalent functionality.<p>I agree that rewrites have the serious potential to introduce new bugs and the cost is rarely worth it if the codebase is actually that stable and low througput, but the reality is that most aren&#x27;t. A one time high cost in exchange for introducing 70% less bugs over a period of N years starts to look like a good trade off.<p>Yes, complexity is the root of all evil. I can get onboard with the whole statement except the &quot;no matter what language you use&quot;. If you have the ability to use any language that enforces memory safety, we should use it.')
