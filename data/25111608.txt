Well, if the language prevents e.g. reference rebinding, there can&#x27;t be done much.<p>But not being able to put _anything_ into a variant severely limits the way it can be used for abstraction. Especially for library authors, because they might not no what their users will pass them. So when they write a generic method, that uses variants under the hood, they would have to &quot;pass down&quot; the restrictions to the user and tell them not to pass e.g. void. Same for the interaction of two libraries.<p>Or am I misunderstanding the constraints here?')
