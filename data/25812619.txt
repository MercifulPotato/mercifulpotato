It&#x27;s a debian stable xen PV VM stored on a LVM logical volume, so easily moved between hypervisors, or cloned, if ever necessary. It runs at a load average of 0.01.<p>In my specific ISP environment it&#x27;s the same person that admins the X.509 private root CA PKI so we&#x27;re well equipped to deal with running it in a purely intranet environment with no access to the global routing table.<p>For widespread non technical random end user use? Totally agreed it&#x27;s not ready yet.')
