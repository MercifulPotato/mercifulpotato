Then there are also non-cash costs, like 5 weeks of paid holidays (or did unions actually achieve the 6th one? It&#x27;s 30 years I lived in Sweden...)<p>And you might need an office, equipment, and what not. So the cost can easily be 6-7 kEUR even if the developer sees only 4 kEUR on their payslip.<p>A few might earn (significantly) more. But that&#x27;s more likely in corporations higher levels than for open source related development work.')
