Like walking inside a sphere without knowing it.<p>For example, maybe I read articles like this one for a full decade and tried at least one time to find fake news and rabid content on Facebook. So I started looking, but lo and behold, the recommendation engine never hooked me up with the ICE Facebook group, or a proudboys group, or one of the zillion other nasty echo chambers these articles keep mentioning.<p>Did any of the articles <i>you</i> read for the last 10 years give a name to this phenomenon of keeping a user in a cordoned off area with their custom-sifted content? I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;ve never actively searched to see if such a term exists. But you&#x27;d think after all this time an article that uses such a term would have eventually been posted to my wall.')
