Why on earth did he leave his family for the Netherlands?  And why there was the 18-month legal struggle?<p>I believe the struggle was because judges are not as easily fooled as the general audience. They need real proofs, not just his own words and some scars on his hand.<p>All this looks very much like he just invented this horror story to get a refugee status in a rich European country. As for me, I&#x27;d rather believe the Chinese government who says it is fake news than this Kazakh-Uighur.<p>Another question: why not Kazakhstan if he&#x27;s half Kazakh? Why first Turkey and then the Netherlands?')
