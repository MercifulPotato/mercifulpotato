They exploit&#x2F;prey upon people&#x27;s desire to be a part of something larger than themselves. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there&#x27;s merely a couple handfuls of people all trying to outdo each other developing these conspiracies that keep to the Q lore&#x2F;universe while spreading like fire. I don&#x27;t think these people actually believe any of these conspiracies. They simply want to come up with ways to make <i>other</i> people believe what they want them to and act out on those beliefs.')
