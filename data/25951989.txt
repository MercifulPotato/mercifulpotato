Extra points for saving more than two sets.<p>- [ ] let me choose my own font, regardless of what the book says. (Pallatino, or TeX Gyre Pagella, is my preference.)<p>- [x] let me set main font size<p>- [ ] let me set margins and line spacing<p>- [x] scroll by changing pages, not scrolling down a column. No animations.<p>- [x] must respond to keypresses for next page and previous page. Extra points for keys for table of contents and next&#x2F;previous chapter.<p>- [x] footnote support<p>So by my standards, it&#x27;s almost there. It would be nice if, after I turned a page or three, the icons retreated further, or at least did not overlap the text.')
