It is possible to communicate with a native executable using a JSON protocol over IPC, if that native executable is registered using a manifest file (See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Mozilla&#x2F;Add-ons&#x2F;WebExtensions&#x2F;Native_messaging" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.mozilla.org&#x2F;en-US&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Mozilla&#x2F;Add-ons&#x2F;Web...</a>). so it would be possible to use a wrapper executable that communicates with the extension using native messaging, and invokes gpg as needed. However, as I understand it, the native executable would need to be installed out-of-band (meaning it isn&#x27;t part of the extension bundle itself).')
