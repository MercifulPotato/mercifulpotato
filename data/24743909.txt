Used it in frontend until now.<p>The JavaScript-ecosystem just isn&#x27;t very productive [1] for multiple reasons. The language is untyped. You have no multi-threading. It&#x27;s hard to debug. You have to spend many brain-cycles on learning Browser-problems, which muddles your understanding of the language. The web-way of: we can fix it and everyone will reload the browser, leads to a &quot;don&#x27;t care&quot; attitude.<p>For web&#x2F;backend this is approachable, though still not good.<p>For build-systems this is terrible. Why? Because if a bug shows up in a build-system you stop a million developers from being productive. The bug won&#x27;t get fixed right away, most will just work around it, use different plugins, copy&#x2F;paste yet another webpack config etc.<p>Plus JavaScript tends makes people realized what FP is, and they all start putting functions in their functions and making everything modular and plugin-able. (See high-order-components in React). While this can be nice, it leads to even more confusing bugs.<p>Writing plugin-architectures is hard in any language. Writing it in JavaScript is a recipe for disaster.\nHence the modern JS-ecosystem.<p><pre><code>  [1]\n  Google: nullpointerexception        -&gt;   4.360.000 results\n  Google: undefined is not a function -&gt; 800.000.000 results</code></pre>')
