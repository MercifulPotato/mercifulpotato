I didn’t see those.  How does he have public receipts for something he never paid for?<p>Edit:  Never mind.  I saw it.  It’s a quote, not a receipt.  I just can’t believe someone would take a laptop to a random, low quality based on the price, repair shop for data recovery like that.  “Hi.  Can you get my sex tape, crack smoking video, and incriminating, politically sensitive emails off this thing?”')
