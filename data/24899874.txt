Two devices with completely different use cases.<p>If your primary goal is to buy a no-compromise device for photography, obviously you should get a full size camera.<p>But 99% of the time, you&#x27;re going to have an iPhone in your pocket and no camera on hand. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s great to have an excellent camera in your phone. You can always augment with a DSLR for special occasions, but it&#x27;s not like a DSLR and iPhone are interchangeable.')
