They&#x27;re been cleared by an EUA for emergency use. We don&#x27;t know how safe they are for long term use yet, since those trails are still ongoing - Pfizer&#x27;s 3rd Phase trials run till the summer of 2021, and Moderna&#x27;s trial runs till mid 2022. We&#x27;ll have more concrete answers then.<p>That&#x27;s why an Emergency Use Authorization is just that - there&#x27;s an emergency. The FDA is well aware that long term safety is still unclear, but given the circumstances, the risks posed by vaccination for the general public are outweighed by the benefits.')
