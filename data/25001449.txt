Maybe an addition to drive the author&#x27;s point home would be Microsoft having acquired Yammer for internal communications, but that would be about acquisitions and not bundling.<p>Even then, Microsoft could compete because they bring the full weight of Microsoft period. It goes with the point about enterprise being &#x27;lazy&#x27;, but also because Microsoft has an army of sales people who will take people out and a huge reputation. Slack didn&#x27;t have a sales team in the sense of what the expression evokes.<p>&gt;<i>When Microsoft approaches that same client, they pitch a single line item that encompasses the majority of day-to-day workplace activities. Slack naturally looks weaker on this expanded playing field.</i><p>Again, we&#x27;re comparing cars and pillows. A more apt comparison would be internal communications, and Slack clearly wins.<p>It won with an approach of precisely avoiding the enterprise procurement trap, just like Yammer did, with a &#x27;bottom up&#x27; approach where users start using the product without needing procurement or permission, and then these companies going to management to sell <i>control</i> over what the already active users in a namespace are doing.<p>Even then, it wasn&#x27;t until Slack raised a billion dollars that the really reluctant and sensitive organizations were onboarded, because Slack became expensive enough that it became unlikely a competitor of a client organization would buy the company they relied on for internal communications.')
