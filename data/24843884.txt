It wasn&#x27;t FizzBuzz exactly, but if I&#x27;d thought to ask FizzBuzz, he&#x27;d have busted that as well.<p>&quot;Write a function that takes a set of numbers [array, list, or equivalent] and returns the average.&quot;<p>Couldn&#x27;t even <i>get started</i>.<p>I was the third interviewer. He&#x27;d BSed his way past the phone screen and two others and I caught a whiff of &quot;Johnny can&#x27;t code&quot; and decided to check by asking him one of our new college grad questions.<p>There have been many more who bombed terribly in a manner that leaves me doubting whether they could solve FizzBuzz given an hour.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt your beliefs, but I am surprised that you&#x27;ve not found any candidates who cannot possibly code at all. That probably speaks well to whatever upstream filtering process your firm is using (it would be ironic if it was &quot;coding FizzBuzz using this online coding platform&quot;).')
