I guess in theory the expectation is that cars will calmly drive behind my slow bike until there is room to pass, however long that may be, but I know that people are going to get impatient, and that just makes it feel less safe, or inappropriate. I feel like at any second I&#x27;m going to get startled by a loud car horn right behind me, which is very distracting.<p>So for me the sharrows do make a difference, since they make it feel safe to use more of the road, which makes me do it.')
