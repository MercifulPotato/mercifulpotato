Item(by='lhorie', descendants=None, kids=[24723570], score=None, time=1602187737, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24723048, text='&gt; This actual paint time is surely not any different than if you rendered the exact same application from pre-hydrated HTML though.<p>Well, it&#x27;s different in different ways, depending on which goalpost you&#x27;re standing on. If by that you mean do SSR, then run React on top, then you&#x27;ve just incurred the same TTFP as plain HTML, plus the cost of React hydration, plus potentially a second repaint (or even third and fourth repaints, depending on how your data trickles in). In the wild, this pattern gets particularly egregious when people decide that it&#x27;s ok to have loading icons and widgets pushing each other down as data comes in.<p>If you mean to compare to client-side rendering without SSR, then you&#x27;re still looking at the cost of at least two repaints (the initial TTFP repaint, plus any repaints from data fetching after that).')
