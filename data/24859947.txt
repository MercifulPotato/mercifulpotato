Subluxation of the ulnar nerve is what they told me it was - I could feel the nerve popping over my medial epicondyle. We tried steroid shots to reduce inflammation, but it came back after about nine months. It got so bad that I couldn&#x27;t fully extend my arm or bring it in past ~45 degrees from extended. The inflammation showed up on an MRI. I had surgery to relocate the nerve to the inside of my elbow and have largely recovered from it, though it does flare up every so often.<p>The scare got me very interested in accessibility and I&#x27;ve looked into using Talon with eye tracking and stenography via Plover to improve my ergonomics, but I&#x27;ve never fully committed to any of them, but I&#x27;d love to know what communities exist. A Kinesis Advantage and a vertical mouse seem to keep it at bay on all but the longest of work days.')
