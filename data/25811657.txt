It&#x27;s at best a clumsy statement and at worst an endorsement of slavery (!), all for reducing coffee costs by probably a few percent.<p>A moral choice, based on values, would be to never buy coffee from Nestlé brands and instead buy from companies that guarantee that their suppliers don&#x27;t use forced labor.')
