(E.g. give China a binary choice:  Pick one, either (a) provide us a complete explanation of why you did the things that make you look guilty and let us see some evidence to back up that explanation, or (b) we&#x27;ll assume it <i>was</i> negligence, and try to recover the costs of the virus by putting a ton of tariffs on your goods.)  I don&#x27;t even think Trump&#x27;s said the words &quot;Chinese virus&quot; for months.<p>But who knows, maybe world powers have some secret agreements about how to handle bioweapon accidents?  Maybe China&#x27;s people and our people got together back in March or April, they privately admitted it was an accident and privately made some concessions, on the condition we don&#x27;t publicly blame them, keep everything they said super classified for at least 70 years, and they don&#x27;t publicly criticize US bioweapons programs if we don&#x27;t criticize theirs?  I&#x27;m just guessing here, but it seems plausible.<p>The one new argument I&#x27;ve heard only today is the argument &quot;But how did it get all the way from where wild bats are to Wuhan?&quot;  (From two different sources, OP is one of them, I believe the other one was from CBS News on Youtube.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22805043" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22805043</a>')
