Then you get it updated and running. A couple days later you decide not to use it, so you go to uninstall it. The uninstaller fails for who the f knows why so you delete the folder on your drive, but your OS still think it&#x27;s installed. So you figure out how to manually remove it.<p>this is <i>incredibly better</i> than the &quot;web scenario&quot; which is (and I got burned by this two times - there won&#x27;t ever be a third time), &quot;you come back to the app two months later, except the company has shut down and all your data removed&quot; or &quot;you come back to the app two months later, but you now have to pay for the superior tier if you want to be able to edit your stuff because some features you were using have been moved in that tier&quot; (hello genmymodel), or &quot;you come back to the app two months later and it&#x27;s now super slow and has a couple annoying bugs but you can&#x27;t downgrade because it&#x27;s a web app&quot; (hello asana).')
