Item(by='trinix912', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607353426, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25331788, text='The way certain languages are ranked in the article is really weird. For example, JavaScript is ranked above Java although it&#x27;s dynamically typed, which the author lists as bad at the beginning. What seems to rank it somewhat high is &quot;the ecosystem&quot;, which is kind of hard to define (did they just look at the number of NPM packages?), and for that matter, Java has a really big number of libraries as well.<p>Then somewhere in the middle the article just takes a major plot twist and takes on functional languages as being the solution to <i>everything</i>. While I personally like F#, I find it really confusing that it still gets the &quot;like&quot; for its &quot;ecosystem&quot;, although the article then proceeds to explain it&#x27;s &quot;rather small&quot;.')
