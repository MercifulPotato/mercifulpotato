Linked lists aren&#x27;t that useful either. If you&#x27;re iterating over the entire list and making changes in the middle, you&#x27;re better off rebuilding the list as a vector because lower memory overhead makes two vectors smaller than one linked list. The most frequent uses of linked lists that I&#x27;ve seen are lock-free, concurrent data structures and hashtables that save insertion order.')
