This prevents me from using my terminal&#x27;s scrollback to read and&#x2F;or copy the text.  If it comes up in a pager, I either have to re-run the help command every time I want to read it (super annoying when I&#x27;m trying to build a command line!) or open yet another window on my screen.  And depending on the terminal, this might overwrite a part of the scrollback buffer I had important context in.<p>If I want to page the help output, I will pipe it to a pager myself.<p>If the help text is really so unreasonably long that it&#x27;s unsuitable for --help, hide it behind some other option that --help points me to.<p>Git does this (effectively treating &quot;-h&quot; the way every other CLI treats &quot;--help&quot;, and &quot;--help&quot; as a request to open a man page), and it&#x27;s incredibly annoying, because <i>no other CLI I use works this way</i>, so it screws up my muscle memory in a way that impacts both my usage of Git <i>and</i> of everything else.')
