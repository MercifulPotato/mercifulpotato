First time I hear that anyone is using this for subscriptions, aren&#x27;t you from Germany? :-) SEPA direct debit is also used here (Slovakia) but usually to pay for internet&#x2F;phone&#x2F;electricity&#x2F; and other bills, you basically give them a mandate to draw up to a certain amount and you can revoke it anytime. \nDebit (or less common credit) cards are I think pretty common for subscriptions but I haven&#x27;t heard about any shady tactics of preventing you from unsubscribing, I guess that&#x27;s because all of that is regulated. And in worst case I guess I could call my bank.')
