In the current climate of covid, these numbers are set to grow exponentially, which means almost every business will operate in the cloud somehow.

Our app empowers teams to execute and ship products faster.<p>We started with automating AWS and Google Cloud Platform and making it a lot simpler to deploy, scale and secure a cloud infrastructure.
