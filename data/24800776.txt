I almost missed that, but can confirm.<p>On a past project we had two DDR RAMs and a NOR Flash on the same bus. There was one hardware engineer, and he laid out the memory subsystem in about a day. (The power supplies were dramatically more complicated.)<p>It <i>almost</i> worked first time. I noticed about one memory error per day per device, which I repro&#x27;d with repeated `md5sum &#x2F;tmp&#x2F;largefile`.<p>We just dropped the clock rate in U-Boot.<p>Failed devices? Heat it up with a hot air gun for a while. Fixed 90% of them. Still doesn&#x27;t work? Throw it away.<p>There are no mysteries, just stuff you don&#x27;t know yet.')
