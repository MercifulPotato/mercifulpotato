When two trading venues for the same instrument exists, say, in Europe and the US, there is no benefit to any participant for a price disparity to exist for a long period. If $GOOG tanks 10% in a day, and a retail investor buys $GOOG at its old price in Europe, who is better off? Similarly for a seller in Europe, what if you were fleeced 10% because your holdings moved favourably in the moments before you sold?<p>HFT also makes trading cheaper for everyone. Much of the time these firms are primarily competing with each other. One way that competition manifests is in the bid&#x2F;ask spread. With firms fighting for order flow, if they can improve their offer by a single cent to ensure price-time order book priority then they&#x27;ll improve their price. For Joe Retail buying or selling that instrument, he just received a small improvement on the spread as a side effect of essentially duelling titans.<p>There are more aspects I&#x27;m not smart enough to discuss, like how HFT basically enables entire asset classes through dynamic hedging. The only reason that option markets exist on most stocks is because there is an HFT counterparty that sold you the option rapidly buying and selling the underlying stock to ensure its exposure to the position was only the premium you paid for the option.<p>HFTs also provide some market stability, first through increasing liquidity having a volatility smoothing effect, and second through so-called &quot;volatility compression&quot; as a result of option market dynamic hedging causing HFTs to buy when others are selling and sell when others are buying. This one has a darker side as depending on their aggregate positioning, HFTs will eventually begin to dump just like everyone else.<p>I believe HFTs are also necessary for exchange-traded funds to be priced correctly and function correctly. That&#x27;s essentially because two markets always exist for an ETF: a primary market between dealers and the fund where creation&#x2F;redemption units are traded, and the secondary market where regular folk buy its shares. Given the prevalence of ETFs as a retail investing vehicle, if they were mispriced this would be potentially disastrous for individual investors.<p>Probably a bunch more good reasons for HFT, I&#x27;m not sufficiently versed in this stuff')
