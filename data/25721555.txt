I&#x27;m sure it just means that after midnight their S3 and RDS services are going read only until they&#x27;re done taking their data out. Maybe make a final backup of their databases and put it in a bucket.<p>I&#x27;d be a bit more disturbed if AWS was going to remove read access after midnight.')
