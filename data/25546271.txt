That has a primarily tactical objective. Not terrorism.<p>Killing someone who owes you a debt, on the other hand, is terrorism because it serves no tactical purpose (you definitely won’t get your money) it is only meant to instill fear in your other debtors.<p>There is certainly a lot of gray area here, but the that doesn’t render the underlying definitions pointless.<p>I’d be curious to hear your definition of terrorism though, as it seems to differ from mine!')
