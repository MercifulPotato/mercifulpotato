I live at sea level in the bay area but regularly spend a week at a time at 8000ft near tahoe. I&#x27;ve never thought twice about it.<p>When we went to Peru, we flew in to Cusco which is around 11,000ft which seems like &quot;not that much higher&quot;; however, the decrease in pressure and O2 content is exponential, the the transition between &quot;no problems&quot; and &quot;some problems&quot; may be abrupt. My wife is fitter than I am, but seemed to have had more issues on our first few days, despite us both taking Acetazolamide (although we didn&#x27;t bother until after arrival).<p>Another factor is that speed of ascent factors into onset of sickness; flying in to a high altitude can be worse than ascending over a period of days, as it takes time to acclimate.<p>Physical fitness doesn&#x27;t seem to have a lot to do with how a given person will respond to altitude. I believe women and older people are slightly more likely to respond poorly, but it&#x27;s kind of a crapshoot.<p>We hiked over 15,000ft but it definitely sucked at times -- tingly hands and feet related to the drugs, I believe.<p>Funny thing was, after &gt; 1 week at that altitude, we both stopped taking our drugs the morning of our departure. Our flight was delayed by a few hours and by 1pm I started feeling the onset of symptoms again, wishing I had taken my dose that morning.')
