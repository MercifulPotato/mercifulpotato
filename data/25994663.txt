For example:<p>- GRID added a 40-car race mode that&#x27;s &quot;just not possible on consoles&quot;. (Unfortunately there were rarely enough Stadia players playing GRID for matchmaking 40-car races to work well!)<p>- Orcs Must Die 3 added Stadia&#x27;s &quot;Stream Connect&quot; feature, which is basically like screensharing with people in your party. They also apparently increased horde sizes on Stadia compared to other platforms.<p>- The Hitman series added Stadia&#x27;s &quot;State Share&quot; feature, which lets players set up scenarios and create customized game states that they can share with others to play.<p>- Dead by Daylight and Baldur&#x27;s Gate 3 added &quot;Crowd Choice&quot;, which lets streamers create polls for in-game choices that automatically selects an outcome based on viewer votes (e.g. choosing whether the streamer is a killer or survivor in DbD)<p>- Outcasters uses Crowd Play which lets stream viewers instantly jump into games with the streamer they&#x27;re watching<p>- etc<p>There&#x27;s a lot of cool stuff that can be enabled when the hardware runs on beefy cloud servers. Although it would be cool to see what novel functionality Google&#x27;s internal studio would have showcased, I also think it&#x27;s pretty important to focus on getting &quot;real&quot; games and encouraging devs to take advantage of cloud-specific functionality.<p>There&#x27;s probably something to be said for the Ubisoft+ model (basically a separate, smaller streaming service on top of Stadia&#x2F;Luna&#x2F;etc), but I don&#x27;t think cable-like &quot;channels&quot; bundles are the way to go for streaming of any kind.')
