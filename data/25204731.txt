Like with 32 bits, you can&#x27;t have one memory address per person on the planet earth, at 64 bits, you can have 1 pointer per atom that makes up the planet earth, and at 128 bits we&#x27;re talking 1 address per atom in the known universe (or something like that, I haven&#x27;t crunched the numbers exactly, this is more to give a flavor for the order of magnitude we&#x27;re talking).<p>So if you cut off the top 8 bytes of a 32bit register and leave yourself with 24 bits, you can&#x27;t even give a pointer to each person in Tokyo, but you cut off the top 8 bits of a 64 bit pointer you can still give a pointer to each atom of every human being on earth?')
