If it happened to FB it can happen to anyone else, especially to small companies or people with less financial power to fight in court. It means it can apply to the entire Internet presence in Austria.<p>2. If any country can do such a ruling, then the entire Internet (see #1) is either abiding to all rules, being reduced to almost zero, or cut out extreme countries. This means Austria should be excluded from Internet? In the end Internet interlinks come from neighboring countries and an Austrian court cannot force them to connect the country to the rest of the world.<p>Not very sound logic, but the conclusion is quite scary to me.')
