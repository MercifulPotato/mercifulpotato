Because some of the founders were... low church Christians who read the bible as they saw fit, this thesis can be maintained by citations back to the original claimant. Argument from authority at its best.<p>Of course, this view of the founders unravels pretty quickly when reading their personal writings or the federalist papers.<p>John Jay comes to mind, perhaps a second tier father but none the less a fairly &#x27;orthodox&#x27; christian at least by american protestant standards.<p>My suspicion is that this book is motivated by the desire to undermine the Christian foundations of american to make further secularization &#x27;natural&#x27; and &#x27;in keeping with our foundational documents,&#x27; rather than the clear departure that it plainly is.<p>Professors are people too, with their biases and ideologies.<p>I myself am happy to bean increasingly secular nation, but I dont share the authors desire to erase the past')
