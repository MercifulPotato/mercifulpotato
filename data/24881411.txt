They’re  supposed to remove the need for trust, but they don’t, they just shift the need along a bit. There always needs to be an element of trust somewhere or it all falls apart.<p>For blockchain logistics, you have to trust that the information entered is correct in the first place.<p>For smart contracts, if you don’t trust the legal system or the other party enough to use standard contract law, you still have to trust that they will  abide by the contract (and if the legal system is in such poor shape that you don’t trust it, or the transaction is by nature illegal, then the other party has even less incentive to follow the rules).<p>It’s not possible to create a purely technological solution to what is essentially a people problem. Our entire civilisation is built on trust, our systems are built to reinforce trust and to provide consequences when it’s broken. Things go badly fast when trust fails and no amount of clever sums can change that.')
