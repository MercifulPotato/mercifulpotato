I&#x27;m a very concilliatory person, and I always try to be courteous, but I couldn&#x27;t calm any of them down (even when I was flying first class for a business trip!).<p>One gal even made me take off the mask and put on a surgical mask (which <i>she</i> gave me, she wouldn&#x27;t let me wear my non-vented N95) in front of a security camera. That was pretty embarrassing, to be holding up the line, and felt like a scene out of a dystopian comedy.<p>I can only reason that it&#x27;s for liability reasons, and the airlines don&#x27;t want to be sued for someone getting infected.<p>But then again, people right behind me had cloth masks on with their noses exposed, who obviously didn&#x27;t care, and they didn&#x27;t get a second look. Neither did the airlines keep the middle seats free like they had promised too. Clown world.<p>Once I was on the flight I put my respirator on with a hoodie over it and slouched against the window, and they didn&#x27;t bother me.')
