As did much of the Far East. Why not the Middle east?<p>There are lots of theories, of course, but one I find interesting is that East Asia, in addition to never being colonized to the same extent as most places, emerged with national boundaries largely intact. The Middle East was under foreign control for, well, basically forever (Romans -&gt; Ottomans -&gt; mandates) and ended up with some pretty weird national boundaries. This encouraged a lot of strife.<p>There&#x27;s also the oil theory; countries with huge natural resources seem to often struggle to develop normally.')
