Though yes, the configuration is maybe harder than it should be simply because it isn&#x27;t on by default.<p>A lot of the complexity in the configuration system exists to enable a lot of configuration options. I have some ASP.NET applications that get some configuration from Environment Variables on the host machine, some from environment-specific config files, some from a configuration service (specifically Azure Key Vault), all without any of my DI-injected downstream components specifically needing to know which source provided specifically which configuration key. For the DI injected things it is just `config[&quot;db-url&quot;]` or maybe type-safe class if I DI-inject an IOptions&lt;T&gt; (or add my type-safe classes directly to the DI without the IOptions&lt;T&gt; wrapper, which is another configurable option).<p>It&#x27;s absolutely a very complex system, but with great complexity comes great flexibility (to badly paraphrase the Spider-Man mantra).')
