We were proposing to do the CAD&lt;-&gt;SIM part.<p>My error was to want more too early, and try to mix in some of the pragmatics while still doing the designs, i.e. to start looking at the FAB part, which should be down the line.<p>Another really fun sub-part of this project was Ian Piumarta&#x27;s from scratch runnable TCP&#x2F;IP in less than 200 lines of code (which included parsing the original RFC about TCP&#x2F;IP.<p>It would be worth taking another shot at this goal, and to stick with the runnable semantics this time around.<p>And to note that if it wound up taking 100K lines of code instead of 20K, it would still be helpful. One of the reasons we picked 20K as a target was that -- at 50 lines to a page -- 20K lines is a 400 page book. This could likely be made readable ... whereas 5 such books would not be nearly as helpful for understanding.')
