While I&#x27;ve found HTTP-only to be most common, sometimes these redirects do support HTTPS but hand out the main site certificate without updating it to include the vanity domain, resulting in a certificate error (however, this new built in HTTPS only gives you a HTTP warning in this case rather than a certificate error, unlike HTTPS Everywhere&#x27;s EASE).  Some sites also have HTTP only redirect from example.com to www.example.com.')
