Must&#x27;ve been a good school, or maybe even country.<p>Fights and bullying were extremely common in my schools (went to several), though they were the standard public ones (I&#x27;m not even sure there were private schools at the time). Late 90s to very early 00&#x27;s.<p>I see nowadays it&#x27;s much less common, as kids are all on smartphones, they&#x27;ve got no time for any physical activities. Silver linings, I guess. Kids still exclude the less &quot;cool&quot; ones, but at least no one (or fewer of them) gets spit on and beaten up.')
