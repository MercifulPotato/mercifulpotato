Here in NZ most of our cattle are grass fed with very little feed transportation. Some farmers do use feed pads but when they do they are being fooled by the big dairy companies putting pressure on the farmers to get the milk solid production up. The tends to mean the farms revenue goes up but the costs go way up so they increase work and decrease profit. So not many of them keep up the practice. I&#x27;m guessing our climate allows us to farm differently, as we have few droughts and warm winters.')
