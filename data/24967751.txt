In 2009 the pundits said the Republican Party was over. The economy was in shambles and Democrats had just acquired control of the house, senate, and executive branches.<p>By 2016 the Republicans had it all back as well as 34 governorships. It took only 2 years to get Congress back.<p>People spoke of a Democratic Party that had no future and even the chance of a constitutional convention if republicans could get a few more seats in 2016.<p>It’s easier to make a claim for power when you don’t have it. Governing is harder than organizing and campaigning. Both parties over the last 2 admins could have done whatever they wanted at certain points but still weren’t able to. We don’t have M4A and we never built the wall.<p>Democrats will get power, be accused of overreach at some point from republicans and of not living up to promise by some democrats creating disillusion. And then pass the power back.')
