In September a new CEO joined. Having listened to their plans, I was excited, new ideas, a firm direction. I decided to stay<p>a month later, I resigned. They were a bully who perceived any geniuine question as a challenge. Good people, coming out of meetings trying not to cry. I was coming out of meetings feeling like I was being beaten up.<p>My last day is next Thursday. People keep telling me how envious they are of me. I&#x27;m feeling guilt for leaving them in the lurch.')
