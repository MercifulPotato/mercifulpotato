Skiiers are already &#x27;being active&#x27;, they&#x27;re bundled up and prepared for cold, and &#x27;doing an outdoor activity&#x27;.<p>That said - Montreal &#x27;defeats winter&#x27; with weekend long raves in the dead of winter, getting more &#x27;bundled up&#x27; for &#x27;outdoor dining&#x27; might possibly be a cultural shift that could be made if enough people were on board and it became &#x27;a thing&#x27;.')
