Item(by='thethethethe', descendants=None, kids=[25393247], score=None, time=1607728448, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25391408, text='&gt; It&#x27;s a chat app<p>I think you are reducing my argument a little here. I mentioned in my previous comment there are other benefits to working with large b2b companies other than the raw merits of a single provided app by itself.<p>&gt; I very strongly disagree with the notion that integration into a locked-in ecosystem is a legitimate reason and not an abuse of power.<p>I disagree with you here. There are many legitimate business (and personal) reasons to stick with an ecosystem. If that wasn&#x27;t the case, then people wouldn&#x27;t pick those products. Open standards with interchangeable clients and servers do exist right now, IRC for example, though nobody uses them because companies like Microsoft provide a hosted solution that provides more value.<p>&gt; You can ask yourself this, if every software company waas forced to implement transparent protocols and APIs, so that clients can freely choose their end-user software, what would the market share look like? If it would look different than it does now I think you can make a strong case that consumers are being deprived of choice.<p>This would be nice but I don&#x27;t really think things would change that much. As I mentioned above, open standards already exist. We have email protocols, IRC, RTF, LaTeX, etc and people don&#x27;t use them (with the exception of email). Forcing companies to open their APIs wouldn&#x27;t force them to integrate with each other and, if they did, imagine being Slack in a world where Google, Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, IBM, etc all had different APIs you had to integrate with and their products were already integrated with each other? That would be pretty expensive to implement and maintain and would definitively put you at a disadvantage due to your relative lack of resources.<p>Also, if all APIs were forced to be transparent, companies would still be able to build ecosystems that are more comprehensive and desirable than a patched-together set of disparate clients and hosts setup by some IT admin. A company which does one thing well, even if compatible with all other, like services (which would be an incredible feat) would never be able to ensure that their product would integrate better into every major company&#x27;s ecosystem, putting them at the same disadvantage.<p>Additionally, there is real value with consolidating your software services under one company. You only have to manage one account, you might get a better deal because you are buying multiple services at the same time, all support would be centralized and bundled with other services you are buying.')
