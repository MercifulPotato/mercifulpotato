It&#x27;s a point that you made a massive oversimplification and yourself opted out of thinking. You just basically said, lockdown = bad consequences, non-lockdown = good consequences. non-lockdown could have had 2x, 4x, 10x, 100x, 1x, 0.5x the infections. We don&#x27;t know which. You ignored all those possibilities and their repercussions and just stated lockdown has been disastrous implying that non-lockdown would have been less disastrous. you don&#x27;t know that. I for one believe non-lockdown would have been more disastrous. Hospitals would be more full, more people would be dying, people would be even more desperate than they are, the result would be an even worse economy and more suffering')
