The fact that each user thinks that their one use-case is &quot;all the app does&quot; is fucking brilliant product design.<p>I&#x27;ve had over a thousand Uber rides (used it to commute) in 10+ countries and it&#x27;s obvious there the way it seamlessly adjusts to each region but even otherwise I think I could have guessed just from the difference between SF and Seattle. There was a sort of joy of opening the app in a new region and finding unique options. Some sort of (maybe intentional) superstar-level product design.<p>Rickshaws in Seattle? Cash payment in India? Uber Taxi in SF? Sweet!')
