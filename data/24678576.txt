Item(by='cies', descendants=None, kids=[24682670, 24678827], score=None, time=1601815231, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24678505, text='&gt; I would argue that your argument is nice in theory, nonsense in practicality.<p>Well, it already is encoded in law. Most countries prohibit hate speech and&#x2F;or inciting violence, while most people consider that free speech is protected in those places. So it&#x27;s already practical.<p>&gt; Who decides what speech is hateful or violent and should be limited? You, me, Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un ?<p>This gets coded in law and jurisprudence and gets enforced by police. Just like any other unlawful acts. Again: this is already how it works in most developed democracies.<p>&gt; How easy is it to label something as hateful and ban it? Very easy.<p>See my other comment about pesticide. Please answer that question. Inciting hate&#x2F;violence is quite easy to detect in practice.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s the flaw in your argument, the human element.<p>Please explain. I dont get it. It&#x27;s all down to culture, true. But that does not prevent it from being pretty much universal.<p>&gt; The revolution to create America had violent and hateful speech towards the British crown.<p>Yes. Which was behaving intolerant and violent in the first place!! Just like now with police brutality in the US: so much violence from them that expressing&#x2F;inciting hate toward them becomes acceptable in my book.<p>&gt; Private companies can do what they want, but in public sphere the parent poster was right free speech exists to enable dissent, not support the status quo.<p>Dissent have no need to exist when there is no oppression&#x2F;violence&#x2F;exploitation&#x2F;marginalization. Hence dissent is the best example of &quot;intolerance of the intolerant&quot;. Thanks.')
