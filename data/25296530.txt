Particularly in markets with network effects or other winner-take-all dynamics. You&#x27;re either first or you&#x27;re dead. And at least one of your competitors will be investing big on VC-powered hyper growth. Slow and sustainable growth may increase short-term survival chances, but guarantees that you lose in the long-term.<p>If Instagram or AirBnb didn&#x27;t plan for rapid scalability, and focused on short-term sustainability instead, they&#x27;d almost certainly be footnotes. It doesn&#x27;t mean that a startup pursuing an expensive hyper-growth scalability strategy is a good investment. But a startup building a social network or B2C marketplace will never conquer the network effects without that ingredient.')
