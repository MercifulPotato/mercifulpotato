It&#x27;s neutral (i.e. unaffiliated with either party), operates on an email distribution model, and strives really hard to keep news from being sensational. It also links to primary sources as much as possible. For example, in today&#x27;s TNP email:<p>- Twitter permanently suspended President Trumpâ€™s account, citing &quot;risk of further incitement of violence&quot; (source).

No &quot;interpretation&quot; on what the implications on free speech or whatever are - that&#x27;s left up to you, the reader. The source linked is Twitter&#x27;s blog.<p>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and I love it.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thenewpaper.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thenewpaper.co&#x2F;</a>')
