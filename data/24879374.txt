At its heart are four stars known as the Trapezium, but you rarely ever see them as they over-expose so easily. With as many exposures they took to make this panel, I was hoping to have seen the Trapezium. It&#x27;s not hard to understand why, as you loose so much other detail and brilliance of the nebula if you do expose for the Trapezium. There&#x27;s no wonder this patch of the sky is one of the most photographed of the entire sky.')
