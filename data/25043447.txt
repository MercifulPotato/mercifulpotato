Italians eat them generally with fork &amp; knife, but if you want, you can fold the slices 2x (sides to eachother like you would do and then fold the point into there as well and then you can pick it up by the crust).<p>The basic thing which I have seen as big difference; you have to cook these pizzas from going into the oven to plate in &lt; 90s (usually it&#x27;s less than that; in my oven, when it&#x27;s perfect, it takes about 60s) and then <i>immediately</i> eat it. If you leave it only for a bit even, to me it is no longer good.<p>That&#x27;s where the low moisture (which here they equate with lower quality, not sure if that&#x27;s true, but more moist is considered better) mozzarella comes in handy; if you want to serve slices over a period of 30min or you want to deliver a pizza etc, you really cannot use this Italian style as far as I have seen and tried.')
