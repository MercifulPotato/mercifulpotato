If the phenomenon you describe is real, and you think it&#x27;s also present in audiophile circles, then you agree with the post you replied to in the first place.<p>Your earlier allusion to &quot;not program the computer&quot; is a bit strange. Nobody is saying &quot;stop listening to music&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s fine to spend a little extra on actual good quality headphones. Or to push for certain software design for good&#x2F;pragmatic reasons.<p>It&#x27;s less fine if the headphones are completely overpriced because of unsubstantiated claims or unproven features. Same as it is less fine to push for some software design because of infatuation&#x2F;obsession&#x2F;narcissism despite significant downsides.')
