I&#x27;ve been trying to convert from Mac to Linux recently and after having tried a couple of distros like Pop and Neon settled on fedora, mostly because of all the modern stuff in there (GNOME on Wayland with zoom supporting it OOTB, btrfs). After having used it for a week intensively, I have experience way too many issues (zoom freezing other windows, firefox crashing when resizing the window and DevTools open where I was thinking is it the React website that I&#x27;m just building?, Wifi dropping in the middle of a zoom session and not auto-reconnecting) let alone the different keyboard mapping which I have found too limiting (as everything is done with Ctrl when there are so many other meta keys and Ctrl is just the worst from a positioning perspective as I have to use my little finger instead of thumb like on macOS. Also, fedora asks for too many OS reboots and I don&#x27;t like to restart the full dev environment all the time.<p>So far, I have converted back to macOS, which is equally bad from UX perspective, especially the hardened security - I just don&#x27;t want to opt into every program getting the permission to run, send notifications, access this and that. It&#x27;s just too much.<p>I think I will give one of the more non-corporate Linux distros a try. Or, maybe it&#x27;s Pop, but ideally it should be Debian based, just not with the &quot;outdated&quot; experience.')
