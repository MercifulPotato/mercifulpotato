Otherwise, lump-sum payment for home office upgrade is probably good. 30k is excessive by any standards. 10k should probably be enough to buy a good monitor, desk, camera, some digital whiteboard, etc. It&#x27;s unconditional, i.e. it&#x27;s always 10k, no questions asked.<p>(2) What for? They just gave you a lump sum. Google is not a builder, its a software company!<p>(3) ??? How can you come up with this? Why would I work remote, just because someone else works remote. I makes zero sense. This rule would effectively eliminate remote work. If you work remote, it&#x27;s your business. There should be policies in place to foster inclusion of remote workers. However, there could still be the option for &quot;fully remote teams&quot;, which is generally a better choice.<p>(4) Again, Google is not a builder or telecom service. If you want to work from home, make sure you move to a place with a good internet connection..<p>Tzzz. Expectations people really have. How about Google also does your laundry, takes care of your child while you WFH, so you don&#x27;t get distracted and perhaps prepares lunch and pads you on the back after 5pm for a job well done?')
