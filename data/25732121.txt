The entire iOS devices ecosystem brings clients exclusively to the AppStore and its apps. They also have a network effect for purchasing more simply for device&#x2F;OS interoperability (think iPhone + Watch). By allowing the installation of a general purpose OS they are giving up a chunk of the profit from those apps and they cut down their own user base, thus making the ecosystem slightly less valuable as a whole.<p>One option would be to allow the installation of an alternative OS only after the device is out of support at least for an image win but this might not justify the effort.<p>I hope this gets regulated in the future so manufacturers are forced to remove any locks preventing the installation of 3rd party software (even make resources available for developers) the moment they stop providing &quot;adequate&quot; support.')
