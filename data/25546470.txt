I definitely don&#x27;t think people should deliberately breed animals as pets. but we already have an unnaturally large population of cats and dogs and we have not been entirely successful at preventing them from reproducing on their own. just leaving them be is not an option, as that would devastate the prey population. if the alternative is euthanizing the majority of cats and dogs that currently exist, I don&#x27;t think we have to feel bad as individuals about keeping a few in our homes.')
