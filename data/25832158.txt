Why not take advantage of the first?<p>It even has the advantage of being a revenue source for the government, rather than a revenue sink. The government has to tax something, why not externalities?<p>Around here, the government decided to tax plastic shopping bags. Geez, just put a tax on it instead. Raise the tax until plastic shopping bags become scarce enough. Then if someone <i>really</i> wants a plastic shopping bag to use, say, to clean up after their dog, they can if they&#x27;re willing to pay. Much better than being charged with a crime.')
