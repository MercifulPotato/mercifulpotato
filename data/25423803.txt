Item(by='gens', descendants=None, kids=[25423977], score=None, time=1607982392, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25423622, text='That is what i said, that it can be optimized away.<p>&quot;exist&quot; is the wrong word, &quot;is useless&quot; would be better. It is like.. you have a spanner in a box labeled &quot;a&quot; and you have a box &quot;b&quot; that has a piece of paper that says &quot;look in a&quot;. You ask for a spanner and you get told to look in box &quot;a&quot;. The box labeled &quot;b&quot; is then completely useless. One day some guy, weirdly named &quot;compiler&quot;, decides to trow away box &quot;b&quot;, and nobody cares.<p>But we have to assume that a compiler will compile the program just as we wrote it. Otherwise we are not talking about the language, but about the compiler. This is gone off topic, if there even was one.')
