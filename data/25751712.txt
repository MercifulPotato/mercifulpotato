The world view that percolates across all those articles is one that praises hustle culture, a mechanistic optimization of life, rationality fetishism, &quot;hacking&quot; social relationships, founder&#x2F;mogul worship and many other ideas that support entrepreneurial success as the fundamental arbiter of value and moral worth. I even saw a few people sincerely believing thar systemic poverty could be alleviated with some bootsrapped startup concept. Essentially a mix of sociopathy and technocracy that can also paradoxically function as a guiding light for non-sociopathic people.')
