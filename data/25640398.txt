Considering your own example: might that not send you one a path to change the fraction of time you do something you don&#x27;t like.<p>And what&#x27;s wrong with &quot;making someone else money&quot; if it also provides you something you want (presumably in this case, also money)?  If you were earning money &quot;making someone else a meal&quot; would that be equally bad?')
