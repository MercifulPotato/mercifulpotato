Personally, I&#x27;m used to having to debug, alter, or otherwise hack games in order to play them. I&#x27;m also more tolerant of bugs and glitches. I&#x27;ve found that I gravitate more towards Early-Access titles on Steam than big &quot;AAA&quot; titles.<p>I realize most console gamers aren&#x27;t necessarily technical people, but when did gaming become so entitled? Is the mainstream PC gaming market this spoiled also? I&#x27;ve heard mostly good things about CyberPunk from fellow PC gamers.')
