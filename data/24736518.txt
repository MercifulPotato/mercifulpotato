They also want the best of class software. GIMP is not Photoshop by a large margin, for example. Ardur is too little to be compared to Logic or Cubase or ProTools (even without the issue of plugins). And so on...<p>&gt;<i>Same goes for video editing as well - there&#x27;s kdenlive, OpenShot, DaVinci Resolve, Lightworks, and yes, even Blender can do it. But, nope. People want Premiere, Sony Vegas, and Final Cut - the rest doesn&#x27;t even cross their mind.</i><p>No, many would be happy with DaVinci Resolve. But then they&#x27;d need many other parts of a video&#x2F;post production workflow still not available on Linux in good form or any form.<p>It&#x27;s not just &quot;you&#x27;re a videographer, you use Premiere on Windows, just switch  to Davinci on Linux&quot;. Because I also e.g. might use AfterEffects, tons of video plugins not available on Linux, Photoshop and Audition for post-production work, several post production utilities, drivers for different peripherals I use for video, and so on. Oh, and plus all the saved presets and automations and such they&#x27;ve made for those.<p>DaVinci on Linux is great, but only solves a small (albeit core) part of the workflow.<p>Also, it&#x27;s very understandable that professionals have invested in learning programs and constellations of programs.<p>Would a heavy Emacs user move to another platform that doesn&#x27;t have Emacs - but offers e.g. Jove?<p>So it&#x27;s not about unwillingness to move from Photoshop to say Gimp and Krita because they&#x27;re &quot;different&quot;. It&#x27;s that Gimp and Krita are quite behind in several aspects, and that their presence only solves a small part of a professional (or hobbyist for that matter) workflow.')
