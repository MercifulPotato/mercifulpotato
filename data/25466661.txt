I love their software.<p>Excellent business model, I get to keep the software I bought when the license expires. Never forced to continually pay for something you don&#x27;t see value in updating. I think that&#x27;s one of the key factors which drives them to continue to improve their products. If future version of their products wasn&#x27;t vastly improved over the previous then people wouldn&#x27;t upgrade because their current version serves them perfectly fine. And if you don&#x27;t like this years update, maybe you&#x27;ll like next years. No downsides whatsoever.<p>Never used any of their TeamCity&#x2F;Spaces stuff but it looks cool. I can definitely say I&#x27;m a fan of their IDEs though. Use them every day.')
