AWS has policies on account and password recovery that even include a notarised affidavit.<p>It might help to further separate your AWS account from the Amazon account you use to shop with, since there&#x27;s a chance Amazon might be trigger-happy with banning if you violate one of their shopping policies with too many returns.')
