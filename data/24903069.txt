Sure, I&#x27;ll load the page and watch in browser tools to see what&#x27;s in the html and what&#x27;s coming back to XHR calls, but when I&#x27;ve got a directory full of previously used example code to fire up that uses Python&#x2F;Selenium and deals with &quot;boilerplate&quot; parts, it&#x27;s a much easier decision to jump that way than the first time I stared at the BeautifySoup documentation.<p>(When the only tool you have is a nailgun, every problem looks like a messiah...)')
