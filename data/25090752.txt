That&#x27;s my solution to the problem of no good Linux laptops. I&#x27;ve got a desktop at home now, and when I go back to the office, I&#x27;ll pick up a mini desktop. I&#x27;ll keep an old MacBook in a drawer if I need to take it into a meeting. When I used laptops only, they were just plugged into a monitor&#x2F;keyboard&#x2F;mouse at all times anyway.')
