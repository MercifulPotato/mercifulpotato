Item(by='arsome', descendants=None, kids=[25991851], score=None, time=1612204896, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25991543, text='&quot;Just AES encrypted&quot; is a pretty limited way of looking at things. AES offers plenty of ways to screw things up, off the top of my head with my limited cryptographic knowledge: how do you do random number generation? How do you deal with password-based key derivation? Is it resistant to GPU bruteforcing? Did you pick a good mode of operation for the use case and are you properly managing IVs? Do you authenticate encrypted data?<p>As far as I&#x27;m aware the newest KeePass format seems to do these things well (they switched from a custom AES-based KDF to using Argon2 recently), but I&#x27;m not sure if KeePass XC does the same and I&#x27;m certainly not qualified to review these things perfectly myself.')
