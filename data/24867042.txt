For example, many users store their email on remote servers rather than on their own client machine. Doing so allows users to gain the benefit of regular backups and remote access, but it also places a great deal of trust in the server. Since most email is stored in plaintext, a compromise of the server also implies the loss of confidentiality and integrity of the email stored therein. Although users could employ an encryption scheme ( e.g., PGP), such measures are not widely adopted, require action on behalf of the sender, and only provide partial protection (the email headers remain in the clear).<p>We propose an alternative solution that begins with the server encrypting newly arriving email, including the headers, body, and attachments, using a public-key encryption standard. Unfortunately, this approach also prevents users from remotely searching their email. To solve this problem, we present Secure Searchable Automated Remote Email Storage (SSARES), a novel system that offers a practical approach to securing remotely stored email while allowing privacy preserving searching. SSARES uses a combination of Identity Based Encryption and Bloom Filters, revealing little information about search keywords and queries. SSARES remains largely transparent to both the email sender and recipient. We present an evaluation of our system based on our preliminary prototype, and identify areas for future improvement.<p>---')
