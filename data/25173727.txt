The ones I wrote are in a language that&#x27;s not the easiest to read (though I did end up getting the performance to justify the language choice), but if any related questions come up feel free to contact me and I&#x27;ll do my best to give a coherent answer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ammkrn&#x2F;nanoda_lib" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ammkrn&#x2F;nanoda_lib</a><p>This paper on Lean&#x27;s type theory dovetails nicely with any of the kernel implementations:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;digama0&#x2F;lean-type-theory&#x2F;releases&#x2F;tag&#x2F;v1.0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;digama0&#x2F;lean-type-theory&#x2F;releases&#x2F;tag&#x2F;v1....</a><p>Also this article is really neat, thanks OP. These kinds of visual representations and other alternative mediums you can use to document stuff are (imo) a really important and under-explored area.')
