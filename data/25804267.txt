When DSL first started appearing they just kept doing it. The idea was to not keep unused connections&#x2F;IPs up, since you didn&#x27;t have a router you would need to reconnect manually.<p>Also, it made it harder to run servers until we had services like DynDNS.<p>On newer connections it isn&#x27;t common anymore, especially if you have a voice service.')
