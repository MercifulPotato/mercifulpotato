Saying &quot;brilliant&quot; about this pile of garbage is just ridiculous. I don&#x27;t care how complicated technology, I care about the result. I see results from the RTX-reflections - they are great and it&#x27;s not some kind of trick or simplification or &quot;optimization for performance&quot;. I see the opposite about DLSS - huge FPS boost, but the price is upscaling which looks like cheap upscaling. You can do the same in many games, even old games, using a &quot;rendering resolution&quot; setting or something named like this. I would be happy to jump into the wagon of those who love the new shiny tech called DLSS, but for that, I need to see opposite results. Right now it&#x27;s a disaster.')
