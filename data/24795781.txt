It&#x27;s one of the reasons, though granted not the only one, why Usenet was a <i>hole</i> and people migrated to saner pastures when they were available. What makes you think it&#x27;s any more feasible when it&#x27;s &quot;now you just need to go <i>administer</i> your ration of racism and transphobia and personal threats&quot; on a millions-to-billions scale?<p>If you&#x27;re being legit with your post, you&#x27;re falling for a tremendous okeydoke here on the part of people who wish to do civil society harm. Literally all this approach accomplishes, <i>literally and exclusively and without exception all it does</i>, is cede the public square to people who want to export misery or deal with the exporters of misery--a vanishingly small fraction of the decent people out there.
