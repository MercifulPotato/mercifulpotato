He found illegal behavior in a spy agency, but he also exposed legitimate activity.  Sure, NSA was spying on Angela Merkel and other allies.  You might agree with Henry Stimson, that &quot;Gentlemen do not read each other&#x27;s mail&quot;, but the reality is that countries spy on one another.  Snowden might deserve whistleblower protection for some of his revelations, but not all of them.')
