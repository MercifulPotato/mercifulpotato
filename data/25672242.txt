Many shops advertise their numbers to call on whatsapp (they may not even be able to accept phone calls&#x2F;sms over other than WiFi&#x2F;data).<p>If you order a delivery or taxi or other service, the person will inevitably try to whatsapp you if they need to get a hold of you.<p>Some countries have mandated their own version of WhatsApp so they can do the spying instead of WhatsApp (UAE has BOTIM for example), but the same critical nature of this application is there. Merchants, workers, and other important non-colleagues &#x2F; non-friends &#x2F; non-family only accept or expect communication through WhatsApp')
