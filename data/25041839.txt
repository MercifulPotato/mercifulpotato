With a lot of logic running in per-origin processes, this may only bring down one tab instead of the whole browser.<p>Edit: Or maybe the error handling can avoid killing a process? This is what the paper says, but I feel like a child process would almost certainly be killed:<p>&gt;  Code elimination is trivial because we nullify unused code with illegal instructions based on known binary function boundaries. Once the instructions triggers a Chromium’s error handling routine that catches an exception, an error page shows an “Aw, Snap!” message by default instead of crashing a whole Chromium process.
