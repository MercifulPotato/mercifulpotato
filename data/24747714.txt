Like, if you have a static image on screen, it does not refresh. A CRT is <i>always</i> refreshing at x Hz.<p>On LED backlit displays, it&#x27;s the cheap PWM brightness controllers that can be noticeable. They&#x27;re supposed to pulse hundreds of times a second to maintain the brightness setting, but as you go lower, it can be noticeable and tiring on the eyes.<p>On LCDs, refresh rates matter only in constantly changing pictures, like movies and games.<p>On a CRT, you&#x27;re exposed to the constant refresh flicker even if you&#x27;re editing a file or reading an article.<p>All in all, I&#x27;m happy with LCDs. Even in games, they&#x27;re enough for me, I&#x27;m not <i>that</i> competitive.')
