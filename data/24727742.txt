I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s particularly <i>likely</i> to have been a conspiracy.  Just speculating.  If I <i>were</i> to try to put an illicit backdoor in a compiler, I would try and make damned sure it&#x27;s not traceable to me.<p>It&#x27;s a very subtle thing.  You have to submit a patch with an <i>improvement</i> (or, at least, an apparent one) to the compiler, which also contains your backdoor.  You have to ensure said patch doesn&#x27;t immediately cause test failures in gcc, or in projects using gcc.  If you can manage that, though, it&#x27;d be very difficult to prove that you were responsible, which is why I think the targeted attack is entirely plausible.')
