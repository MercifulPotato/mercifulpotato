Item(by='throwaway9d0291', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608204613, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25453948, text='I&#x27;ve seen references to this sensor before and find it a bit concerning that there&#x27;s no information about how to properly use the CO2 sensor.<p>This sensor uses a SenseAir S8, which like most CO2 sensors, has an automatic baseline calibration algorithm enabled [0], which expects to see pure, undiluted fresh air at least once every 8 days. The only way to disable it is explicitly, through the MODBUS interface [1].<p>Leaving it enabled makes perfect sense in a business or businesslike environment because these environments will be completely unoccupied overnight and have air conditioning, which usually does a daily fresh-air purge, ensuring that the sensor will have regular exposure to fresh air.<p>However in a residential environment, the auto baseline calibration often doesn&#x27;t make sense, especially in winter. When the windows are closed and&#x2F;or people or pets are around, it&#x27;s very rare for the sensor to see uncontaminated fresh air, so it will see say 500ppm of CO2 and assume it&#x27;s fresh air when it really isn&#x27;t. I have measured this and it&#x27;s a real problem.<p>In a residential environment, unless you&#x27;re sure you have good, frequent exposure to pure fresh air, you&#x27;re better off doing a fixed calibration once a year or so.<p>AirGradient also seems to be a hardware-only design. The ESPHome project [2] has great software support for a variety of sensors (including the SenseAir S8, so it should be compatible with the AirGradient hardware) as well as a very well-documented hardware project [3]. After trying my own Arduino-based software and then ESP-IDF, I find esphome much more pleasant to work with.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rmtplusstoragesenseair.blob.core.windows.net&#x2F;docs&#x2F;publicerat&#x2F;PSP107.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rmtplusstoragesenseair.blob.core.windows.net&#x2F;docs&#x2F;pu...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rmtplusstoragesenseair.blob.core.windows.net&#x2F;docs&#x2F;Dev&#x2F;publicerat&#x2F;TDE2067.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rmtplusstoragesenseair.blob.core.windows.net&#x2F;docs&#x2F;De...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esphome.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;esphome.io&#x2F;</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nkitanov&#x2F;iaq_board" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nkitanov&#x2F;iaq_board</a>')
