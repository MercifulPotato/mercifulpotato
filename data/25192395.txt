His position was never just that you shouldn&#x27;t be forced into wearing a mask; he was against masks period. He refused to wear one publicly while mocking others for wearing them. He explicitly turned masks into a political issue claiming that people wore them just to express their disapproval of him. He even refused to wear a mask while touring a mask factory.<p>So again, this _clearly_ had nothing to do with freedom or totalitarianism.')
