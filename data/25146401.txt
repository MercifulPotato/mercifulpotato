IIRC, if someone sends you an MMS it will jam up the SMS app (not sure if it is&#x2F;was a modem firmware or app issue or if it&#x27;s been resolved yet or not)<p>3) Error recovery... hahahaha.  Umm, no.  I still see a fair number of messages re: people needing to tweak the modem due to text messaging issues.<p>4) Battery life is far better than it was but not as good as it needs to be.  If you use the phone moderately, it should make it through the day.  Heavy usage can kill it in a couple of hours.<p>5) Other than <i>possibly</i> Verizon, I think it&#x27;s been confirmed working on all the major carriers and MVNOs.  I only single out Verizon because IIRC they have&#x2F;had a policy of needing to whitelist devices so I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s an issue there or not.<p>If you liked SailfishOS, there is some activity re: getting it running on the Pinephone: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.pine64.org&#x2F;forumdisplay.php?fid=126" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.pine64.org&#x2F;forumdisplay.php?fid=126</a><p>Basically you&#x27;re asking if it&#x27;s &#x27;daily driver&#x27; ready.  My opinion is not currently, but opinions vary on this point.  That said, if you&#x27;re a heavy Linux user with an interest in mobile you might want to pick one up... it really is a fantastic little portable Linux device.')
