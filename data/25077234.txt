I tend to be fine with inqueries from this audience even if it&#x27;s not necessairly project related, although bonus points if they are.<p>- If you were specifically trying to hunt down a point of contact for me and me alone, that&#x27;s probably fine too.  No untargeted and untailored recruiter spam!  And likely not as part of a wider recruitment drive, even if you&#x27;re &quot;tailoring&quot; your recruitment pitches.  ...if you&#x27;re offering me a job specifically to continue working on one of my many abandoned FOSS side projects that you, personally, as another developer have been using - or because we&#x27;ve worked together in the past and want to again - that might be OK ;)<p>- The recipient might redirect you to other channels they see as better fitting - obviously, respect that if they do.')
