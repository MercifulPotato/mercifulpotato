For sending RTMPS from RTMP you will need another server &quot;listen&quot; with no &quot;ssl&quot; option and &quot;proxy_ssl on&quot;, since the module has no native RTMPS capabilities, in order to get RTMPS as both server and sending client.<p>For RTMP auto-publishing to multiple servers, you will want the &quot;push&quot; directive, and don&#x27;t forget to give it a &quot;name=&quot; option, or it will grump. I struggled to get the &quot;pull&quot; directives to always work consistently and quickly.<p>If you want lower latency, make sure your source stream has small keyframe periods and that they match &quot;buflen&quot; directive; I opt for 2 seconds. But if using HLS, there isn&#x27;t that much more you can do on that front.<p>³ <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arut&#x2F;nginx-rtmp-module&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Directives" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;arut&#x2F;nginx-rtmp-module&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Directives</a><p>⁴ <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nginx.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;stream&#x2F;ngx_stream_core_module.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nginx.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;docs&#x2F;stream&#x2F;ngx_stream_core_module.html</a>')
