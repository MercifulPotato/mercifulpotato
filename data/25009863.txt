Only the CPU-cores (&quot;Zepplin&quot; maybe, or whatever they call them now) are 7nm TSMC.<p>So AMD&#x27;s strategy also leads to lower fabrication costs: because they can make a far cheaper 14nm chip to handle the slower portions of I&#x2F;O (talking to RAM, or PCIe), while the expensive 7nm parts of TSMC are used only for the cores &#x2F; L1 cache &#x2F; L2 cache &#x2F; L3 cache.')
