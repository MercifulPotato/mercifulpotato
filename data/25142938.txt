Surely not.<p>There is plenty of &#x27;rigged election&#x27; fear to go around, for sure.  Donald Trump overperformed expectations in both 2016 and 2020, so it would be just as rational for Democratic voters to wonder if someone had their thumb on the scale as it is for Republican voters to feel that way because he lost.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very easy to meddle with our elections and I think any discrepancies are likely to be innocent mistakes.  I don&#x27;t doubt that foreign governments play games with us, but I expect they limit themselves to social media manipulation and not actually trying to muck with the voting process.')
