He was a Republican, and freed the slaves, so both political parties like him.  That makes removing his coin somewhat difficult.<p>I grew up in Illinois (&quot;Land of Lincoln&quot;) and it was one of the only states where you could pay toll with the penny, because Lincoln was such a powerful symbol.   I guess that got killed off in 2017, however.  (You can&#x27;t use any coins now, it seems.)<p>(While researching this comment, I found it hilarious that IDOT had a COVID-19-related unpaid toll relief program, but they accidentally sent people $0.01 invoices because of how they &quot;leveraged an existing system&quot; to generate invoices.  Another use for your penny!)')
