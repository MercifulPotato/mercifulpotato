In effect, there&#x27;s no choice but to pull the <i>entirety</i> of search out of Australia, or pay whatever arbitrary price the arbitration process comes up with. It&#x27;s like forcing internationally-owned supermarkets to stock newspapers at a price determined initially by the Murdoch press and in the case of disputes by a protectionist government panel, or leave the country entirely.')
