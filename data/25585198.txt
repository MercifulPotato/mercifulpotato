You have to go to a place that is open from 8:30 to 4:30, get a ticket number, wait a long time for your ticket to be called, go to a teller with various paper documents: lease agreement, cable bill, title, birth certificate, etc. Also the new thing people will need is Real ID, so yet another trip where the hours are even more constrained. And sometimes your documents will be rejected for various reasons, and you have to start over.')
