Item(by='johncalvinyoung', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608139729, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25441953, text='I read longform articles and journalism voraciously. When I&#x27;m not pulling overtime at work, I usually read 20-50 in-depth articles a day. But the challenge is how widely I read. Sure, there&#x27;s a bunch at NYT (which I subscribe to), and a bunch at open-access blogs and journals around the net, but the middle are tough.<p>I might normally want to read, over the course of a month, 10-15 articles from each of 15 different paywalled magazines or newspapers. Which is more than the 2-5 free articles typically allowed past their paywalls, but little enough (especially compared to 15 or more competitors) to justify $15-25+ a month per source. Maybe if I was a Wall Street trader the WSJ and Bloomberg are no-brainer expenses, but right now I wouldn&#x27;t get enough value from them to justify their sky-high subscription costs, but I would like to read a decent handful of articles a month. A few publishers, like NYT or WP, have picked up on this market, and regularly discount to capture various price points, but lots have held onto a &#x27;big subscription or none&#x27; model.<p>What I really want is an (expensive) subscription to something like Spotify Premium across publishers. I&#x27;d happily fund the pool to the tune of $50-100 a month, if it could get me access to my top 15-25 paywalls. Everyone gets some, some get close to standard subscription rates, but it&#x27;d just enable me not to have to worry about whether I&#x27;ve used up my free articles for the month at each origin. And it&#x27;d also let me contribute to lots of magazines and things I do appreciate, just not $25&#x2F;mo appreciation.')
