Signal&#x27;s privacy policy says they don&#x27;t collect and store sensitive info, but how is a list of everyone you&#x27;ve been in contact with not sensitive?<p>Sadly I&#x27;ve had very little luck getting my family to move to Signal and less luck getting them to use Jami. The bulk of my communications are unsecured SMS&#x2F;MMS. It&#x27;s such a basic function that I&#x27;m surprised open source solutions aren&#x27;t better. Whatever they&#x27;ve become Signal had a pretty great interface.')
