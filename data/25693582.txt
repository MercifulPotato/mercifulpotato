He refused to call in the national guard to secure the Capitol, and published a video saying he loves the rioters instead.<p>And then people are arguing that you shouldn&#x27;t go ahead with impeachment because of political calculations that it might fail.<p>What is the thing <i>for</i> if not exactly this?!?')
