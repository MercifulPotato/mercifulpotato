I get the superficial appeal of this. But there are dozens of popular Javascript CDNs available. What are the chances that your user has visited a site which uses the exact same CDN as your site?<p>Quite high - if you&#x27;re using the Google CDN I&#x27;d imagine.<p>&gt; Speed. You probably shouldn’t be using multi-megabyte libraries. Have some respect for your users’ download limits. But if you are truly worried about speed, surely your whole site should be behind a CDN – not just a few JS libraries?<p>(a) Some websites&#x2F;web apps do actually need to load a lot of JS to function properly (e.g. Google Maps).   \n(b) Putting the HTML of a website into a CDN introduces extra complexity around making the html stateless (cookies, user data, etc.) + the issues that come from having to cache bust the CDN every time some dynamic content on the page is updated<p>&gt; Versioning. There are some CDN’s which let you include the latest version of a library. But then you have to deal with breaking changes with little warning. So most people only include a specific version of the JS they want. And, of course, if you’re using v1.2 and another site is using v1.2.1 the browser can’t take advantage of cacheing.<p>Yeah, don&#x27;t use library&#x2F;latest.js. But then this basically boils down to the same argument as point 1 (&quot;Caching&quot;).<p>&gt; Reliability. Is your CDN reliable? You hope so! But if a user’s network blocks a CDN or interrupts the download, you’re now serving your site without Javascript. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing – you do progressive enhancement, right? But it isn’t ideal.<p>Fair enough - depends on your CDN. The Google CDN is probably more reliable than whichever one you&#x27;re going to pay for instead (not every site can&#x2F;should be put on Cloudflare for free-ish).<p>&gt; Privacy<p>Yup - this is the real valid issue IMO<p>&gt; Security. British Airways’ payments page was hacked by compromised 3rd party Javascript. A malicious user changed the code on site which wasn’t in BA’s control – then BA served it up to its customers.<p>If OP had actually read his own link, they would have seen that the British Airways JS in question was loaded _from their own CMS_ - not an external CDN. Ironically, in this case - it probably would have been harder to hack the CDN.<p>Plus, always use SRI.')
