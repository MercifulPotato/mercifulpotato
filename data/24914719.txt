Not only because I can&#x27;t socialize like I did before, but also because I had to stop practicing my sport. My sport was one of the main things that kept me sane. I work out at home now, but it&#x27;s nowhere near the same thing as going to practice 3-4 times a week.<p>On top of that, my wife left me in January before the pandemic hit. We&#x27;re now going through the legal stuff, which is pretty stressful.<p>And I&#x27;m potentially dealing with some health issues. Still waiting for an appointment with my primary care provider.<p>I&#x27;m doing therapy. It&#x27;s been keeping me barely sane. My weekly therapy session is the thing I look forward to the most during the week.<p>I&#x27;m a senior engineer at a large tech company. I&#x27;m paid a very handsome salary and quite a lot in RSUs to care about some of their systems. Given my position as senior, I&#x27;m expected to make big, important decisions, and to mentor people in the team.<p>I can&#x27;t do any of that right now. I&#x27;ve been feeling like I&#x27;m scamming the company, because there have been entire weeks where I literally didn&#x27;t work. And it&#x27;s not because I don&#x27;t want to, but I sit in front of my laptop and feel totally overwhelmed by everything and completely blocked mentally. My manager is actually aware of that and has been very understanding, but I still feel really bad about it.<p>I don&#x27;t want to quit to take time off though. I feel like that&#x27;d be worse, and I&#x27;d probably just spend my days in bed not doing anything. I can still code - I do my own coding in the evenings, and that&#x27;s been going quite well (nothing that will make me money though). I just can&#x27;t be expected to <i>care</i> about stuff and to be involved as if my life depended on the services we build. There&#x27;s no space in my head for that.<p>If I could get a job where I&#x27;m basically assigned tasks to code things to spec, done, next, that&#x27;d be perfect.<p>Does that even exist though?')
