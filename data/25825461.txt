Designing a simple language is fine. I like simple languages a lot. Go was designed not because simple languages are good for some jobs but because Google decided their engineers aren&#x27;t up to using more powerful tools.<p>I don&#x27;t know Go. I&#x27;ve only written about 200 lines of it. I don&#x27;t pretend to know whether or not it&#x27;s any good. What I do know is that the reasoning behind it is bizarre to me.')
