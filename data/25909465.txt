Membership of the ring in Horovod is static - you can&#x27;t recover from a failed worker. You would need to build a consistent hashing ring (like a DHT), so that workers could identify and agree on failing workers (heartbeats) and evict them. None of those goodies in Horovod yet.<p>The workaround is to have a chief-node do periodic checkpointing of the model weights and epoc&#x2F;iteration, so that you can recover from the checkpoint if a worker fails.')
