If you were simply a programmer or techie, working on DBs or frontend development, or whatever, it&#x27;s completely okay. It&#x27;s completely okay if you were in a management position overlooking technical stuff like this too.<p>If you were a techie who worked on features that are questionable (eg, tracking users accross sites, shadow profiles, collecting data without consent, etc), I will possibly still hire you, but I will ask you how you felt working on those features.<p>Simply because I would not feel comfortable with someone working in my company who had no doubts and was completely willing to work on stuff like that. Personal preference. Ethics and morals are important to me.<p>If you were in a management position, and were in charge of unethical features and privacy-invading practices such as the ones mentioned above, I would not hire you.')
