I am not surprised if I am wrong about that. It wasn&#x27;t the main deciding factor for me...<p>My primary factor was &quot;Actor Model&quot; and I was struggling with Erlang&#x27;s lack of static types, so that put Pony in the focus. An Actor Model framework on top (I recalled there was one for Rust) had given me &quot;questionable&quot; results with Akka (due to compromises&#x2F;constraints in the JVM and Java&#x2F;Scala).<p>HTH')
