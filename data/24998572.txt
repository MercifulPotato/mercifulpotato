We help consumer apps to scale with AI-based insights and growth experts. We are launching our AI insights platform. Think of Amplitude or Mixpanel but not only shows you the data, it analyzes it, interprets it, and delivers an actionable recommendation that if applied will improve your marketing KPIs.<p>Every day, marketers need to make complex decisions based on a few data points and on intuition. These are multi-million dollar decisions that critically affect the app’s unit economics. Bad marketing decisions lead to bad unit economics. \nThis happens because producing actionable insights is hard and requires a lot of manual work. Analytic tools have fallen short in interpreting data.<p>We’ve faced these managing multiple campaigns for the largest apps in Latam.\nInspired by the teams in Lyft and DoorDash, we built our own Budget Allocation tool for our Growth Consultancy business and have now decided to open it to the public. \nThe main cases marketers find Winclap useful are:\n1- Better allocation of their marketing spend: understanding how much they can profitably scale in each channel, and which channels they should downsize.\n2- Testing new channels: predict ROAS on channels and GEOs the app hasn’t been launched yet.\nThese two are especially important now with Apple’s iOS 14 new privacy policies. \nUnder the hood, we have developed technology for ingesting marketing data, an Airflow based infrastructure that automates ETL and executions of AI models that help us detect outliers, predict revenue and analyze millions of different possible allocations. \nWe are really excited that our early users have seen ~ 20% improvement in ROAS and CPA. \nWe are launching a private beta today, which will have a 3-10 days onboarding period, but we are working on getting that time to 24hs.\nI’d love to hear which use cases you can think of for this!
