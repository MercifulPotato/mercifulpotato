Item(by='solinent', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604535714, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24994463, text='I think if you just decriminalize it instead of completely legalizing it then usually what happens is people will successfully hide it so they don&#x27;t give away their dealer, and the cops get to go after a potential larger offender as well instead of having to convince the locals the small time users aren&#x27;t criminals. Based on my experience in Canada. Of course, then the dealer will try to upsell their users to harder drugs so there&#x27;s trade-offs there.<p>Ultimately it&#x27;s the same as drinking though, just be considerate and hide it from the kids!')
