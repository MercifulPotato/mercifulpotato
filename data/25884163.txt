One man was arrested with a pickup truck full of napalm.<p>At least some subset of the Capitol rioters absolutely intended to cause &quot;explosions, gunfire, and mass loss of life&quot;. I think you&#x27;re being dishonest pretending this was only a bunch of goons posing for instagram.<p>This is similar to the way people remember Columbine as a school shooting, but the two murderers actually built a large number of IEDs including propane tank bombs. If they hadn&#x27;t been such incompetent bomb-builders, hundreds would have died and the event would be remembered as a bombing akin to Oklahoma City instead of mere mass-shooting.')
