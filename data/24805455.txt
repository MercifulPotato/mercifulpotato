The side effects weren’t bad enough for me to want to make it less potent. Also worth noting that it sounds like it wouldn’t work for something diffuse like B cell non-hodgkins lymphoma.<p>“Here’s how Shasqi’s treatment works: Say a patient has a tumor in her breast. The first step is to inject a biopolymer—naturally occurring molecules—into the tumor that essentially function as a magnet. Next, the patient will receive a modified version of the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin, which has been chemically “switched off” so that it’s about 80 times less toxic. But once the drug gets to the tumor site, the biopolymer “magnet” pulls the drug in, causing  a chemical reaction that switches the drug on to its full effect. The end result? Higher doses with fewer side effects (or at least that’s what Shasqi is hoping the clinical trial will bear out.)“')
