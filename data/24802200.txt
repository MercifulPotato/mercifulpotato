Water didn&#x27;t go black but it fizzed up pretty bad and had a lot of crap in it by the end. Couldn&#x27;t even see the bottom of the wash bucket by the end.<p>Dunno what you did that yours turned black, are you sure you didn&#x27;t get a bunch of soil in the water? There shouldn&#x27;t be tar or ash on live weed plants.<p>It does make me question smoking any undipped pot though.')
