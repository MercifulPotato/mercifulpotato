You often see him being filmed jumping on his bicycle - I mean, here, in the Dutch news. He is doing that deliberately to invoke national pride.<p>Compare image searches: &quot;Mark Rutte fiets&quot; (the prime-minister, apparently thousands of results), &quot;Hugo de Jonge fiets&quot; (the most media-friendly deputy prime-minister, no relevant results)<p>Also, there are frequent news stories within the Netherlands that are just &quot;look, the Royal Family cycles&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s something the Dutch are very proud of. Strange to claim otherwise.')
