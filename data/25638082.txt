If you&#x27;ve done it for companies, you can ask for recommendation &quot;letters of recommendation&quot;. They&#x27;re written by your clients clearly state the impact and outcomes you produced for their business. They&#x27;re useful to include in the package you send to future clients.<p>&gt;<i>- Does companies need a person like me? I mean they might want to experiment on a new product idea. Instead of hiring or allocating a team for it. I can help them build their MVP in the quickest way possible for a reasonable amount of money.</i><p>There certainly is a need, although projects don&#x27;t die for lack of good design or front-end generally, but for failing to nail down the problems, jumping directly to solutions, and not getting the scope right. Basically, it&#x27;s cool that you are a strong designer and a strong front-end developer, but I think these will amplify your ability to help them nail down the problem and scope of the product or prototype.<p>&gt;<i>- If so will they be willing to pay like $50k-$75k for 2-3 months of work?</i><p>Companies are willing to pay that and more, but it depends what they&#x27;re paying that for. If you&#x27;re selling outcomes, peace of mind, and make problems disappear, then if you don&#x27;t make that at first, you will if you deliver. It pays to deliver. Repeat business with large organizations is pretty good once you&#x27;re reliable.<p>Caveat emptor: we make custom, turn-key, machine learning products for large enterprise. The front-end&#x2F;webapp is included in the package, it has never been the whole package. YMMI.<p>&gt;<i>- Have anyone doing this already? How we name these roles? Contract MVP Builders?</i><p>Consultant? There are many scenarios: one scenario is the client organization doesn&#x27;t have someone to do it, in which you can fit right in. One other scenario is the client organization <i>does</i> have people who can do it, but they&#x27;re in way over their heads with a lot of work, and you&#x27;ll either be augmenting that team or you&#x27;ll work in your corner with interactions depending on your mission and how what you&#x27;re building interacts with what&#x27;s existing.<p>&gt;<i>How can we approach this?</i><p>Do you have a company?
