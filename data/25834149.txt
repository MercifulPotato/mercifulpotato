That means something. The monarchy serves as a kind of sacred cultural identity and attacking the monarchy is like attacking the society itself.<p>Places like England have more evolved monarchies, where saying something against royals won&#x27;t land someone in jail, but the same sentiment is there. The only way to &quot;dismantle it&quot; is to wait and do it in steps over generations. Even Thailand is doing that now. The royals are largely symbolic and don&#x27;t exercise direct political power. But there&#x27;s still a strong cultural attachment.')
