It only shows that under the default of 2018 BOP.<p>If you select the last primary tab and look at the 4 years tally, you will see a picture rather more inline with the &quot;folk knowledge&quot;, including that while Californians have had a BOP just shy of positive from 2017, their negative BOP in 2015 and 2016 puts them rather into the negative for the 4 years period. Less so than the tri-state or Colorado, but the picture you&#x27;re painting is at best misleading.')
