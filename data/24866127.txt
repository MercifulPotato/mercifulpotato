Instead, it seems that the ability to appreciate nuance atrophies.<p>Legal language may be more formalized than everyday language, but there is still lots and lots of ambiguity.  The idea that there is a single correct interpretation of &quot;the law&quot; is nothing more than collective self-deception.')
