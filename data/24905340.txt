How about: nobody in your house&#x2F;dorm unless they live there, &#x27;outdoor beer gardens&#x27; only, limit 2 beers.\nHave a &#x27;dance party&#x27; in a big open parking lot to break the social malaise. Otherwise threaten <i>expel</i> students who break the established rules for putting other people&#x27;s lives at risk.<p>We have almost stopped talking about &#x27;isolation&#x27; and we have no support for it. In Taiwan, they send you home, show up at your door with masks, call you every day to check up on you. That kind of &#x27;nudging&#x27; would be hugely impactful, it&#x27;s also a form of tracing.')
