For likes of depression (or addiction) that reciprocity can narrow and narrow to the point of only moping around and doing whatever maintains the depression.<p>Which means avoiding depression maintaining behaviors is <i>one</i> of the multiple things to do in order to prevent it, or prevent a relapse, conversely it will indeed be incredibly hard to treat it with only reducing screen time.')
