Many of the Linux package managers (e.g., Apt, Portage) permit this; for example, on Gentoo, I install Steam by adding Valve (&#x2F;Steam) as a place that the package manager can obtain packages from.<p>That&#x27;s not to say Apt&#x2F;Portage are by any means perfect; the nature of how they are configured is definitely not going to be friendly to your typical Windows user. But I think it is <i>possible</i> to wrap that in a UI that adequately expresses &quot;okay, you&#x27;re adding the ability to install software from this vendor, and [the package manager] will help keep it patched &amp; up-to-date.&quot;<p>I think we also need to combine that with better security models, so that desktop software isn&#x27;t necessarily granted access to everything by default.<p>But UI design trends have spent the last decade &quot;simplifying&quot; UIs down so much that they fail to solve the problem at hand.')
