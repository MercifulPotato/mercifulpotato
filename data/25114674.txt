That&#x27;s always been true. This particular writing was of a quality that I think few of us could match. That it was about something fairly &quot;normal&quot; doesn&#x27;t change that.<p>I also wonder just what aspects of what she wrote about you consider &quot;normal&quot;. Maine has a small population, there are very few fishermen working today. What are the elements here that are &quot;just normal life for a lot(most?) people&quot; ?')
