Here’s my theory on why that is, but what do you think?<p>Creating educational content in this space is difficult because the basics (I’m thinking of things like using the terminal, some understanding of how networks and computers work, an understanding of how to use an IDE, how to compile code, build a project, etc) are literally more than the majority of people will ever learn. So you either assume nothing of the reader and are always spending time teaching the basics before you get to the stuff you’re trying to teach, or you create a barrier to new people entering the space.')
