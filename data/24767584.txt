(I&#x27;m not sure why I was so stubborn about those things.)<p>My biggest breakthrough was discovering that real reviews are just as problematic as fake ones. People rate products in weird ways, e.g. This purchase makes me feel safe...5 stars, or, This product is great but I hate the company&#x27;s politics, 1 star.<p>Automating the detection of these quirky characteristics is a technical challenge beyond my capabilities, however. I didn&#x27;t count on so much manual legwork as I expanded the project.')
