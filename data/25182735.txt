Item(by='furyofantares', descendants=None, kids=[25192119], score=None, time=1606095042, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25182293, text='Except all the multibillion dollar advertising mega corporations happen to sell directly to the people who want to affect your behavior to their benefit.<p>You could argue that it just happens to also be to your benefit by chance, but that&#x27;s certainly not where the incentives lie.<p>By comparison, companies like consumer reports, which instead directly sell you information to influence your behavior to your benefit are tiny. The advertising industry is nearly a trillion dollar industry -- if a large amount of that value is going to the consumer why hasn&#x27;t there been massive innovation in selling to it directly to the consumer?<p>GP&#x27;s comment about selling us shit we don&#x27;t want&#x2F;need is a hard pill to swallow. It&#x27;s highly counterintuitive and demeaning to our sense of agency -- just like so many results in modern psychology.<p>But I think that view also misses the bigger picture twice. First, because while the consumer-producer relationship is positive sum and that&#x27;s the whole reason it exists, pricing is not. If advertising makes it easier to connect with a product you want, then the price can be raised. We should think about how advertising makes the things we want more expensive.<p>But second, I think we should also think about how the relationship of advertiser to producer may not be positive sum. Producers compete with each other in a fashion that isn&#x27;t positive sum, and advertisers sell to all producers. That&#x27;s an arms race. I can&#x27;t effectively start a business without using advertising because all my competitors use advertising. Advertising doesn&#x27;t account for a trillion dollars in demand per year -- it just siphons it from producers by selling them the same arms they sell to their competitors.')
