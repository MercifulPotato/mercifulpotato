Class methods are responsible for upholding the class invariants. That is, it provides you a way to encapsulate internal state. Of course all your class methods should be responsible for upholding that - but if you find that there are too many methods, you perhaps need a rethinking of architecture. \nPerhaps adding a wrapper class over an inner class? The inner class is the only thing responsible for upholding said class invariants, but the outer one can access it in different ways, without hurting the invariants.')
