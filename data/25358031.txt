Look at Webkit, Google forked it and derived chrome so they can have more say. Android Kernel Team didnt back port their changes to Linux kernel for yrs. This has more to do with politics and less to do with development. My guess is Fuchsia may have reached a point of internal abandonment like most google projects which is when they thought of the last effort to salvage it before ditching it completely.')
