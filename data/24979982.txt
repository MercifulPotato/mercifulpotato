By issuing treasuries a government loans economic power from markets in addition to what it gets from taxes. In a limit everyone will work for a government, so the system effectively degenerates to a centralized planned economy. Of course, in a capitalist society people will loose their trust in a government long before that.<p>In a well working system this additional power is used to accelerate economic growth, so interest rate is compensated by additional taxes, otherwise government has to allocate bigger ratio of allocated taxes to service its debt or loan more and more. The first option is not popular with politicians for obvious reasons, while the second one can not continue indefinitely. More you try to load from market, higher rate will be required (i.e. market will trust a government less), higher the rate, more difficult it will be service the acquired debt (i.e. a government will have to be really efficient with its spendings, otherwise we return to the step 1).<p>Arguably market trust in the US government has already passed level of sustainability, so it has chose to loan from the non-market source, which I believe in the end degrades trust into the whole dollar-based economy.')
