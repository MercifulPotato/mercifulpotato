The browser is an exceedingly important piece of software.  For some people, the cost of switching to something other than Chrome is too great.  Maybe Firefox doesn&#x27;t work well.  Maybe they hate Safari.  Maybe their favorite extensions aren&#x27;t available.  Whatever the reason, the cost of switching is greater than the price they put on their anti-Google stance.  And that&#x27;s okay.<p>Personally, I switched from Chrome to Firefox a long time ago.  But I still use plenty of other Google products.  I&#x27;m overall anti-Google, but I&#x27;m not a religious about it.  I disconnect from Google where I can, and support products that match my views when I can.<p>If anything, I&#x27;m surprised the percentage of non-Chrome users your site encountered was as high was it was.  Makes me kind of hopeful.')
