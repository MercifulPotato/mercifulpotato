I’m assuming they had two kinds of users. Spreaders, and targets. Our employee was a spreader, sending this bug out to his&#x2F;our network. Once the targets were hit, they’d be selected out of the spreader pool (so the hackers could remain undetected).\n- The hack relied upon identifying ,mutually high volume (trusted) email senders.\n- The hack had something to do with leveraging the platform of Notion.io. Unsure if there is a bug on that platform which was also being abused, or if they just have a good system for hosting phishing pages.\n- The user’s authenticated sessions seemed to be hijacked and replicated across the globe in headless chrome browsers, which appeared to renew the session until the hack ended.')
