Why can&#x27;t Microsoft just be up front about the status of these things, so that people don&#x27;t pick them for greenfield projects?\nWhat are the actual &quot;live&quot; platforms for running Orleans? I don&#x27;t want to deal with running clusters and nodes, the closer to &#x27;serverless Orleans&#x27; the better for me (Functions Durable Entities etc is not the same thing)')
