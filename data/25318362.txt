Item(by='1vuio0pswjnm7', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607202411, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25313480, text='&quot;Nearly 70% of smart TVs and 46% of game consoles were found to contain hardcoded DNS settings - allowing them to simply ignore your local network&#x27;s DNS server entirely. &quot;<p>To be fair, Pi-Hole hardcodes &quot;default&quot; (suggested) DNS settings, too.  While the user can change defaults, it is well-known that in most cases, the majority of users do not change them.<p><pre><code>    curl -s  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raw.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;pi-hole&#x2F;pi-hole&#x2F;master&#x2F;automated%20install&#x2F;basic-install.sh |grep -C3 8\\.8\\.[48]\\.[48]\n</code></pre>\nIMO, the best DNS-based solution for controlling the HTTP requests that applications can successfully make, e.g., to ad servers&#x2F;trackers, is not to point them (directly or indirectly) at third party DNS caches.<p>Sending the user&#x27;s DNS queries to an online ad services company (Google) is a interesting default for a project whose raison d&#x27;etre is the existence online ads.  Perhaps if the online ads industry began to fade, so too would the need for Pi-Hole.<p>After decades of running own root and other authoritative servers on localhost, I would still do it even if online ads were not a problem.  I like the speed, reliability and control.')
