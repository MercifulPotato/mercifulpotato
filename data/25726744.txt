From what I see it is used to send SMS and maybe Email as well. So I could understand that it would prevent login, registration and password reset if that service is offline, but it shouldn&#x27;t allow any of these without authentication.<p>Unless the software skipped authentication entirely when this service was unavailable, which I find hard to imagine. But that seems to be what is claimed right now.')
