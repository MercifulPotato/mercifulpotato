I&#x27;ve heard of browser extensions doing this, but I would be unsurprised if mobile apps did it. Every holiday I do a sweep of my parents&#x27; devices to make sure they haven&#x27;t installed anything silly (my mom somehow always has three or four different weather apps). I&#x27;d suggest giving it a look the next time you can.')
