The only difference is are you in VAT system or not (there are rules when you have to go in). If you are not in the system you cannot offset the VAT but you are not required to collect it also, so whatever you charge you keep . Please give me the example where you are required to collect but cannot offset. \nThere are per countries some special cases, for some type of items, where the full amount will not be recognized  but those are exceptions.')
