Here in Chicago, a residential street parking permit costs $25 per year per car and allows you to park in a specific zone near your residence.  24-hour permits for visitors are sold in sheets that end up costing just slightly more than 50 cents each.  The program more or less brings in revenue to pay for itself but makes getting street parking much more fair.')
