The piece is crafted to present the case in a way that&#x27;s immune or resilient to typical and expectable attacks. It underlined the core failings of the concept behind a CoC, and it provides a concrete example of how people use CoCs as an oppression tool that&#x27;s leveraged to manipulate and condition groups to follow the leader&#x27;s bidding.<p>&gt; Here, I think the story is pretty much just: people screw up<p>It really isn&#x27;t. This isn&#x27;t a mere &quot;whoopsie&quot;. This is a CoC working exactly as it&#x27;s supposed to work. By design. This is exactly what they were created to achieve. A community member said something, some people didn&#x27;t approved based on their personal tastes, and thus they proceeded to leverage their CoC to persecute and punish that individual to keep the community in line.<p>There is absolutely no other use for a CoC. This is precisely what they were created for. This is no accident or mistake.')
