I have always seen the HN crowd as being mostly pro-Apple.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m wrong though - it might depend on the thread. Whenever I put out an anti-Apple sentiment on a pro-Apple article thread I usually get massive amounts of disagreement.<p>My own dislike for Apple goes way beyond their protectionist policies. Maybe if I didn&#x27;t hate the Mac UI with that hideous global menu bar and horrid window management, I could be more forgiving towards their politics. Heck, I used Windows as my main OS for decades until I finally switched to Manjaro and XFCE for the sheer convenience of running Docker and npm&#x2F;yarn smoothly without all the Windows cruft slowing me down all the time.<p>It&#x27;s funny though - I do less tinkering on my Linux desktop than I ever did on Windows (or my Mac), since everything just works the way I want it to in Manjaro. I think my first week using it, I had to figure out how to write an xdotools script to get window snapping in XFCE. Never had to touch it since. My Mac has broken things like Karabiner, Better Touch Tool, Little Snitch and so forth after many updates - so much so that I just stopped reinstall them. Luckily, I only have to use it once in a while for doing the occasional Mac&#x2F;iOS thing.')
