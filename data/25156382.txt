My argument is that a few simple, low impact measures would be enough to drop the effective infectivity of the virus low enough that it would fizzle out.<p>What&#x27;s the difference between a virus being extripated from a population, and a virus &quot;fizzling out&quot;?<p>If it&#x27;s not extripated, then it will immediately start spreading again as soon as those measures are lifted.<p>&gt;&gt;That wouldn&#x27;t 100% eliminate the virus, as it would continue to spread and pool in countries without those guidelines.<p>Note that I didn&#x27;t say that you argued for eliminating the virus from the entire world. I said that you are advocating extripating the virus from one particular country, and I argued that that would be extremely difficult to pull off and then maintain by physically isolating that country from the rest of the world.')
