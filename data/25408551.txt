With the Fed printing money tho at record rates this would be the time for a shift to happen.<p>The problem is there is no alternative.  The Euro has it&#x27;s own structural issues and as we saw in March when folks got scared they sold alternatives like Bitcoin down hard.  In short, there is no alternative without international cooperation to make a change which doesn&#x27;t appear likely any time soonish.')
