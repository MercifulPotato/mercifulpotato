Apple isn&#x27;t going to be selling the M1 to other companies and other companies have proven they don&#x27;t have the mettle to spend what Apple is spending to make chips like this. Really, AMD should be a little worried since they have some counterparty risk getting all of their chips made by TSMC. At least Intel controls their own production.')
