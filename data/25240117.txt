They&#x27;re all running at maybe half their rated clock speed.<p>Are you saying it&#x27;s an unfair comparison? The Intel Macs are operating in the same environment as the M1 Macs. It doesn&#x27;t matter if the Intel parts could be faster in theory, because you&#x27;re still dealing with battery and size constraints. If you want unthrottled Intel CPU in a laptop, your only options are 6 pound, 2 inch thick gaming laptops with 30 minutes of battery life. Now comparing <i>that</i> (or worse, a desktop) to M1 is unfair.')
