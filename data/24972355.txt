That&#x27;s a Fourier transform in a certain sense, and you&#x27;d use that to make a spectral analyzer. But what about the Fourier transform of an image, according to the frequency components of objects in the image? Like fence posts at a regular spacing, and such?<p>Well you might be excited to learn that optical lenses actually compute the Fourier transform of their input image:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.mit.edu&#x2F;2.710&#x2F;Fall06&#x2F;2.710-wk10-a-sl.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.mit.edu&#x2F;2.710&#x2F;Fall06&#x2F;2.710-wk10-a-sl.pdf</a> (the ideal thin lens as a Fourier transform engine, PDF)')
