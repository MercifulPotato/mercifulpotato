If your audience can&#x27;t understand this:<p>&gt; If you see a red highlight, your sentence is so dense and complicated that your readers will get lost trying to follow its meandering, splitting logic â€” try editing this sentence to remove the red.<p>... the problem probably isn&#x27;t you, but that you have the wrong audience to start with.<p>I&#x27;m guessing that this is just using a combination of Flesch-Kincaid, for readability scoring, and probably some libraries by Wooorm for detecting complex words and passive voice, among other things.  Maybe I&#x27;m wrong.<p>What makes a sentence bad isn&#x27;t necessarily how complex it is, but how much it is able to communicate with a given density.  There&#x27;s no way that traditional readability algorithms like Flesch-Kincaid can possibly score that.  What would be more useful would be something that could detect vagueness of text, but haven&#x27;t tried to solve this problem in the past, I found no such thing in existence.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that readability scores aren&#x27;t <i>useful</i>, but they always need to be taken with a grain of salt and be used more as a guide than anything else.')
