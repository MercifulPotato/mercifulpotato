But if a place doesn&#x27;t have much inbound tourism, doesn&#x27;t have lots of people able to afford international travel, and doesn&#x27;t have the kind of internal mobility common in the developed world, it would make sense that they might not get hit very hard without taking much in the way of special precautions.')
