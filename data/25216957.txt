As I read, the NYT called them up with threat of a story about discrimination, and gave them 48 hours to investigate the allegations. If someone did that to you, and you had done nothing wrong, it would seem you might say something about this journalist drive-by. If not then perhaps the public might believe the stories, not realizing you were put under the knife of the NYT with 48 hours to respond.')
