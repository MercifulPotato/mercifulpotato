On garbage day you&#x27;ll find some of the homeowners view it as &quot;garbage lane&quot;. Not that many, though...I think some of my fellow cyclists &quot;relocate&quot; garbage cans in the bike lane to the other side of the road, or well down it. There are a few houses where the homeowners really don&#x27;t have that many options (bottom of a steep driveway) and those ones at least make an effort to minimally encroach.<p>Illegally parked vehicles don&#x27;t last long around here ;)')
