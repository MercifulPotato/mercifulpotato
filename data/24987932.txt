(Imgui&#x27;s inter-frame state is essentially a list of top-level windows, a list of pressed buttons and the ID of the active&#x2F;focused widget -- that&#x27;s enough). This makes ImGui perfect for inserting it into the traversal of complex data structures and ensures perfect synchrony between UI and data. This is an area were classic GUI tooling often struggles; sure it&#x27;s totally possible to do with e.g. Qt but making a scene graph accessible as a Qt model likely amounts to a few thousand lines of code, but is comparatively trivial with tightly-coupled ImGui code. Embedding GUIs into a 3D viewport is also something these frameworks aren&#x27;t generally designed to do, but is the easiest way to do it with ImGui.<p>That being said, real GUI frameworks like Qt are a much better choice for 97 % of &quot;end-user tools&quot;, because they have all the bells and whistles you do, in fact, want to have in a desktop application (RAD tools, proper layout system, proper menu&#x2F;action system, accessibility integration, state inspection etc.)')
