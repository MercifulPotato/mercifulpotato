Being Anglican is as close as he got to fascism.<p>Also, calling him anti-semitic makes sense only if you call pretty much everyone else in the world, up to and including the jewish community, the same name.<p>He engaged in some stereotypes about jews (both positive and negative)<i>in his personal correspondence</i>. As well as many other stereotypes about everyone else from the British to Americans.<p>If you are going to be mining personal correspondence for stereotypes of drunk irish or lazy spaniards, then I&#x27;m sure you can find all sorts of names to call Eliot, but doing so says more about the cherry-picker&#x27;s ethics than it does about the poet&#x27;s.<p>In Eliot&#x27;s actual behavior, he promoted the careers of jewish poets and writers, actively sought out their contributions to his literary magazine, and did not discriminate against them.')
