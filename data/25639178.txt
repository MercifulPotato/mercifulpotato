I&#x27;ve been using Kubernetes since the very beginning, been actively working at scale, and worked across the stack and with diverse technologies. I&#x27;m looking to help small dev teams increase their velocity by implementing best-practices of Devops: CI&#x2F;CD, Kubernetes Deployments, and effective Monitoring frameworks.<p>I&#x27;m available for consulting on your initial setup, for fixing your build, as well as on retainer for operational Oncall. I&#x27;m actually quite busy at the moment, but happy to have a conversation if you&#x27;ve got something small or forward-looking, or happy to forward it on to my network.<p>My resume: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;resume.gauntletwizard.net&#x2F;ThomasHahnResume.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;resume.gauntletwizard.net&#x2F;ThomasHahnResume.pdf</a><p>My LinkedIn: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;thomas-hahn-3344ba3&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;thomas-hahn-3344ba3&#x2F;</a><p>My Github: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GauntletWizard" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GauntletWizard</a>')
