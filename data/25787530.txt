Unfortunately it was more or less abandoned and eventually removed.<p>It would have been nice to see it expanded instead. A full on node environment would be a bridge too far IMHO but it would have been great to have added a good way to reuse modules and some more GUI niceties.<p>It did have full access to the current web page so there would have been security issues with new coders copy&#x2F;pasting code from the internet. But a revised version could give it its own isolated environment by default.')
