Don&#x27;t fully sacrifice living with the goal of doing it later. I realize I&#x27;m not old by any stretch, but I&#x27;m at 40 next year. I&#x27;ve definitely made some sub-optimal decisions with money, but the experiences were mostly worth it. My retirement goal is to be able to do it by the time my kid is out of college - 14 years from now, unless she&#x27;s smart and does the 5th year I never did. Anyhow, I digress, but I&#x27;m glad we traveled, ate, bought a house, sold a house, moved around a bit, etc. because even as income continues upward (along with some wealth if that&#x27;s what you want to call our tech equity comp), life still gets harder in non-financial areas.<p>I&#x27;m convinced the worst thing we do to our kids is shove them through school and stick them behind a desk the day they&#x27;re done. I didn&#x27;t break into tech until my mid 30s, but for the folks who came out of college doing this, you have a legitimate shot to be set before you turn 40. That said, if I could rewind, I&#x27;d happily push my own retirement goals back a few more years in exchange for a financially secure year off in my 20&#x27;s or early 30&#x27;s.')
