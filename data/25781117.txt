He talks about how Trump was the only one even pretending to listen. Now, hilariously, instead of taking his lead the liberals have decided to call 1&#x2F;2 the county raciest and sexist.<p>I hate Trump and always have, but I see what he did and why it worked. I also see why insisting that 1&#x2F;2 the country only liked him because they are raciest is just making things worse. LOL, this country deserves to fail.')
