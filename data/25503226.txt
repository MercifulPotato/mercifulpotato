I&#x27;ve had friends say they got used to it.<p>I can... almost... think of it like an off-road motorcycle with a handlebar and no instruments.<p>But personally I couldn&#x27;t buy in.<p>Related, I think the controls on the model 3 have also been over-minimized.  The scroll wheels have the feel of a $3 computer mouse, and autopilot overloaded on the gear selector is cheap, not elegant.')
