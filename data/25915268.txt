Item(by='DCF', descendants=None, kids=[25928568], score=None, time=1611665728, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25912906, text='&gt;<i>But one guy taking a negative expected value bet and winning big doesn&#x27;t really help all the other little guys on WSB who got roped in to buying GME at 100+ today</i><p>I don&#x27;t disagree with your post overall, but do want to give some credit to the particular user being discussed. He had a solid bull value thesis that was well thought out and not at all based on memes, with the short squeeze potential being a mere afterthought. He has a great youtube channel where he explains his thesis in-depth. While he posts occasionally on WSB he does not seem to fit the wild gambler image that WSB has.<p>I don&#x27;t have enough experience or knowledge to speak intelligently on whether his play was actually negative or positive expected value but it was not a random gamble.<p>Just felt the need to throw this out there because with all the attention this is getting I&#x27;ve seen him unfairly (in my opinion) being grouped with the admittedly large amount of people who are essentially just gambling.')
