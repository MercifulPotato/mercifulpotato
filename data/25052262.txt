I met Martin at VMware in 2014-2016, where he was leading the SDN (Software Defined Networking) team after the company he co-founded, Nicira, was acquired by VMware in 2012. Martin also (co?)invented Openflow.<p>I didn&#x27;t work closely with Martin, but I&#x27;ve noticed multiple times how good he is at vision, strategy, understanding tech and predicting where it&#x27;s going. Not surprised he led the investment in Isovalent, which I believe is a very promising company.')
