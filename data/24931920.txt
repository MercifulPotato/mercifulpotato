I&#x27;d like to think it&#x27;s because I inspire and make things interesting and fun :-)<p>Like you I have found the younger ones care a lot about self development.<p>A small number of those have been difficult to work with, wanting to prove how &quot;right&quot; they are to people who are effectively above me in some hierarchy, which boils down to being argumentative, not caring about my point of view and making things more office-political than they needed to be.<p>Mostly, though, I found younger ones friendly and eager to learn things and have challenges, somewhat self-conscious and self-doubtful, and having a more modern social conscience, e.g. climate concerns.  Overall pretty nice people.<p>Although I&#x27;ve seen projects where there was way too much copy&#x2F;paste, it&#x27;s been from all ages.  Maybe different reasons underlie why though.  At times I almost seem to specialise in writing scripts to de-duplicate other people&#x27;s giant copy&#x2F;pasta code and detect variations to maintain its behaviour :-)')
