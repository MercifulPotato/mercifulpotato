Once I buy a phone (second hand, 1 year old) I don’t have to think about getting another one for at least 3 years since Apple will support it for at least that period.<p>Cost - I normally get last years model second hand for £400-600. Generally I end up approx £100-£200&#x2F;year when averaged over the remaining support period with a £100-£200 resale value at the end, beating all decent androids in price too.<p>Consistently - My phone is a tool. I need it to get out of my way. I can’t be dealing with learning a new text message apps quirks every 2 weeks (Allo, Hangouts etc).<p>Privacy - Apple, at least at the moment every move Apple makes seems to be in the opposite direction than most of its competitors. The illusion of some androids being cheaper is shattered when you consider that <i>you</i> are being sold too.')
