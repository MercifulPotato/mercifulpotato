Sure, such preppers do exist, but they are an extreme minority.  The media focuses on them because they are the most entertaining.  Practical preparedness is <i>boring</i>, at least in the TV sense.  The average prepper is more concerned with weather events(inc. fires, earthquakes), civil unrest, pandemics, etc.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;ve met some preppers IRL that are kind of delusional, but even they aren&#x27;t &quot;doomsday&quot; preppers.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever knowingly met a &quot;doomsday&quot; prepper.<p>Unfortunately, I do think that the media&#x27;s mockery of prepping did nothing to encourage people to prepare in a practical way, and if anything it <i>discouraged</i> people who have a distaste for things they believe are right-wing.<p>In my opinion, prepping needs to be rebranded.  We should probably drop the term &quot;prepping&quot; all together and just call it something like &quot;civil preparedness&quot;.  A little promotion from FEMA would help, too, especially if done under Biden, since FEMA has pretty much abandoned any meaningful public communication about preparing people for emergencies. FEMA, and formerly the US DoD as well as Office of Civil Defense, used to publish more literature on emergency preparedness and response, but you&#x27;ll notice that after the late 1980s those efforts significantly declined.<p>In any case, the title of the article implies that lots of preppers are &quot;crazy folk&quot; and provides what seems like an alternative that is <i>not</i> crazy.  The reality is that this article describes <i>exactly</i> what at least 95% of preppers do.  Well, besides the zombie apocalypse part.')
