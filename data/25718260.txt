Cast iron is supposed to be a bit of a compromise because it can hold the heat better, but you can&#x27;t toss it around the way you would with a normal wok.<p>As to carbon steel, I&#x27;d say go for it. I think you&#x27;ll find it a lot less fussy than you have been told.<p>Also, I&#x27;d say stir fry definitely qualifies under the &quot;something specific&quot; where you would want to use the high heat settings on the stove.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lodgecastiron.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;cast-iron-wok?sku=P14W3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lodgecastiron.com&#x2F;product&#x2F;cast-iron-wok?sku=P14W...</a>')
