Toyota and VW can ramp up as much as they want, but they&#x27;ll probably have to buy the batteries from Tesla.<p>Tesla is not without its problems, but I think it&#x27;s a bit naive to focus on the solved problems as limiting their potential. It&#x27;s also the wrong thing to look at - Tesla is concerned about dictating the future of transportation and energy, selling cars is a means to an end.')
