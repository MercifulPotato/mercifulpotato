I was young and didn&#x27;t have the kind of capital to do that myself. It was in the depths of a shitty economy and this hypothetical start up wouldn&#x27;t have had much of a moat, so I don&#x27;t think that it would&#x27;ve been easy to get outside capital either. And what would the pitch be? We can do this non-unicorn company&#x27;s job better and still not be a unicorn? This was right round the beginning of the whole &#x27;everything has to be a unicorn&#x27; thing, or at least my awareness of it.<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate that the only way to capture the value of my innovation might have been &quot;well, just be an owner instead of a worker.&quot;')
