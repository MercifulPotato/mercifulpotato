The patent just takes the guitar and stabilizes it in a horizontal position, instead of a vertical position, allowing you to do something different with the same instrument. Nothing about the guitar itself changes whatsoever, but the orientation provides for the guitar to be used differently.<p>The better analogy would be, say, if you took an SL-1200 (a turntable manufactured for DJ&#x27;ing) and it rotated it &quot;battle style&quot; - same instrument, same accessories, but a different orientation resulting in a fundamentally different use of the device.')
