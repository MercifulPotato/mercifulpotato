I thought taking the hassle out of swiping could give my app an edge over Tinder.<p>It was working fine for a week or so before Facebook caught up and revoked my API keys (effectively killing the app). They didn&#x27;t give any reason besides some vague recommendation to review their Terms of Service. A few months later at their F8 developer conference they announced they&#x27;ll be launching their own matchmaking service which will work pretty the same way I built my app.<p>Moral of the story: never trust big tech.<p>P.S. I open sourced the app a few years ago: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitbucket.org&#x2F;stonepillarstudios&#x2F;workspace&#x2F;projects&#x2F;NEC" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bitbucket.org&#x2F;stonepillarstudios&#x2F;workspace&#x2F;projects&#x2F;...</a>\nFeel free to fork &amp; revive.')
