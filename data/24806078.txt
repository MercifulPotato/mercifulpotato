I&#x27;ve come across it several times but never ended up trying it.<p>This however makes me sad. We&#x27;ve got a champion who is maintaining a piece of software that&#x27;s quite frankly pretty core to privacy and security in today&#x27;s heavily tracked world.<p>Obviously it&#x27;s not just gorhill either. It includes the many people who have raised PRs, lowered the ticket burden of uBO, but also the many people who maintain some amazing lists. For that, all of these people have my gratitude.<p>The reason this makes me sad is because this is the second time things like this happen. The second time gorhill&#x27;s efforts are being shat on by some random person. This was completely reckless action by jspenguin2017. It&#x27;s one thing to want to make money for your efforts, it&#x27;s another to want to make money from the man hours spent by the uBO and list&#x27;s maintainers.<p>If jspenguin2017 truly means what he says in his posts and regrets his action, I hope he considers donating all of the money to gorhill &amp; co.')
