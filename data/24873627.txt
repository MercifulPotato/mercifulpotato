If California has a single voter more for Biden and Trump, it&#x27;s the same as if nobody in California voted for Trump. If your state has 100 electoral votes and the voters are split 50-50, the fair thing to do would be to allocate those electoral votes 50-50. Instead it&#x27;s all winner take all, making people further feel like their vote doesn&#x27;t matter. The probability that your vote is the swing vote is so low compared to a simple popular vote for the vast vast majority of voters, so at least with regards to the presidency, they have a lot less reason to even vote.')
