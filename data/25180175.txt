In fact it makes a rather weak assumption: reality is only that which we can demonstrate and prove using the scientific method.<p>Science only lays down the principles by which scientific discovery might be made, and leaves the description of reality as whatever the outcome of that process might be. It’s something that rational human beings enjoy because it has offered great predictive power which has benefited humanity immensely, in addition to providing theories for how the world works.<p>The best thing about science is that it allows you to completely change the description of reality if a better theory comes up. This is one of the main reasons why this framework has been successful: it is adaptable and accepting of new realities.')
