In the bad old days, being rejected or embarrassed in front of your tribe meant you were socially, reproductively, and possibly literally dead. In tribes of 100 people, it made sense to respond strongly to rejection of all forms. In today&#x27;s world, it doesn&#x27;t. You get rejected (for jobs, for romantic partnerships, etc.) a lot more, but it&#x27;s usually harmless. It&#x27;s &quot;a numbers game&quot;; but our wetware hasn&#x27;t caught up. Which is why people are so averse to taking social risks, breaking rules even when they should be broken, and pointing out bad ideas.<p>Thing is, in the office world, we&#x27;re back in those small tribes where each minuscule rejection or aggression is a possible threat. We&#x27;re back in the world where being disliked by one or two of the wrong people means catastrophe. So, that&#x27;s an environment in which is really does make sense to play it safe.<p>Challenging bad ideas benefits the company. It almost never benefits the person raising the issue. If you&#x27;re wrong, you look like an idiot. If you&#x27;re right but not convincing, you look like an idiot. If you&#x27;re right and you are convincing, someone higher in the power structure will take credit for your idea.')
