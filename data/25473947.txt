Kind of like Qualcomm right now.<p>The chips don&#x27;t have to be better than Apple, they just have to be better than Intel (and AMD).<p>The benchmarks of the Snapdragon 888, which utilizes the Cortex-X1 core design, look decent. I mean, they&#x27;re not as good as the A14 and M1 with the Firestorm&#x2F;Icestorm cores, but they&#x27;re decent. Decent enough that Microsoft could likely build upon the X1 core and tweak those designs to have competitive performance to Intel.')
