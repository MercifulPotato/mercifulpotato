In that regard, I appreciate good ads that tell me about things I would want to know about and didn&#x27;t already.<p>For example, some of the ads I get are for live shows (back in the before times).  These are live shows that I enjoy going to, but would never have known about, because I don&#x27;t know where to look for them.  Having it pushed at me helps me.')
