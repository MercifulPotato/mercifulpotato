You can jail a process and only limit what it listens on for example.<p><pre><code>  jail -c path=&#x2F; ip4.addr=disable ip6=inherit command=&#x2F;bin&#x2F;csh\n</code></pre>\nfor instance would run the command &quot;&#x2F;bin&#x2F;csh&quot; and jail it so that it doesn&#x27;t get access to any IPv4 and it allows communications over IPv6 only.<p>So you can use jails to sandbox applications. You can also mount all paths are read-only and only the paths required for the application as read&#x2F;write. jails can be very handy for all kinds of operations around that, there is no requirement that you provide the jail with a copy of the user land again, although that is the easiest way to run jails.')
