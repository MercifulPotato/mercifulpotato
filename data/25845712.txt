It&#x27;s like complaining that Gnome Tweak Tool only shows stuff from ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}&#x2F;autostart instead of also showing systemd service entries from user or global lists.<p>Use of a persistent background tasks&#x2F;helpers instead of Task Scheduler (or cron, on Unix-like world) for background updates is a pattern that is unfortunately accepted by now thanks to OS vendors doing exactly the same. &quot;edgeupdate&quot; et co are a great example if we are staying in the Windows world.<p><i>I don&#x27;t like how many services&#x2F;tasks&#x2F;applications Adobe registers and starts for their CC and DC products</i>, but it should not be a surprise that some are getting registered in other places than HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Wndows\\CurrentVersion\\Run or the Wow6432Node version - it should be considered basic admin knowledge that there are other locations where the process may get started on log in, so it is not reliable to just look in Task Manager or Control Panel &quot;start-up&quot; items.')
