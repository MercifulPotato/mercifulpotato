We have topsoil and can make topsoil much much faster. So how do we preserve, and continue to create topsoil faster than it is depleted.<p>What is top soil? A collection of macro and micronutrients, microorganisms, and organic matter in the first 5-10 inches of soil. Essentially, its compost.<p>Traditional farming depletes topsoil because it takes more than it gives. By traditional, I mean subsistence up until early industrial. After we figured out that plants need food, and supplemented it accordingly, the draining of nutritive value of the topsoil largely ended 100 years ago.<p>However, industry brought about destructive methods such as deforestation and deep tillage which increase erosion. Even if you are adding in enough inputs to balance out what your crops are taking, erosion may simply sweep away your 5-10 inches of good soil. However, in the last 40 years, tiling and no-til methods have vastly improved this. No-til and more efficient combines have also much improved soil organic matter (which take decades to build, but not 1000s of years).<p>In general. Yes, the erosion of soil is the erosion of civilization, but don&#x27;t believe the media hype. Farmers aren&#x27;t dumb, they are incentivized to manage their soil as best they can.')
