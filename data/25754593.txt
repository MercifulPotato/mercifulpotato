The problem is that Twitter has lost their credibility on the issue. If you make a habit of rolling around in the mud, then don&#x27;t be surprised if people assume you stink.<p>This is the rejoinder to those who defended them by saying &quot;they&#x27;re a private platform, they can do whatever they want&quot;. And I actually agree with that. But in spheres of life without explicit legal protections, people will come to rely on informal reputation and cultural norms.<p>Twitter is learning the hard way about why companies jealously guard their reputation for fairness and neutrality. Taking a public and divisive stand on the culture war issue du jour is rarely smart business. Like many tech darling Icaruses, Jack Dorsey probably thought the time-tested rules of business didn&#x27;t apply. Watching 10% of his company&#x27;s value vaporize in a few days was a hard way to learn that&#x27;s not true. Hopefully $5 billion was worth it to keep attending Bay Area cocktail parties.<p>At the end of the day Twitter has wrecked its reputation as a fair and neutral platform. It will take at least a generation to repair. A consequence of this will be that in situations like Uganda, nobody will afford it the benefit of the doubt any more.')
