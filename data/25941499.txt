You have a case of a hedge fund that was playing games to manipulate the price of a stock downward for a quick 400% profit the last few years with what appears to be no hedge on the other side of the bet.  They could&#x27;ve bough calls to offset potential losses but they didn&#x27;t because that wouldn&#x27;t have meant such impressive gains.<p>People who should&#x27;ve known better got caught with their pants down and I have absolutely no sympathy for hedge funds.')
