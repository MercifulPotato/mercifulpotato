Recently (and still ongoing) I started on hashing out how to diff large datasets and what that even means.<p>I would love to get an understanding of how the HN crowd sees diffing datasets should be (lets say &gt;1GB in size).<p>Are you more interested in a &quot;patch&quot; quality diff of the data which is more machine tailored?
