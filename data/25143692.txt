Apple had to make a call for their customers: ensure the low battery is as long-lasting and predictable as possible around 1-5%, or keep high performance as the phone battery degrades quicker and shuts off. I think many people thoroughly understand how crucial it can be to have that last 1-2% and going into a situation where you think you have 5%, but then the phone dies, is a pretty bad experience for the &quot;premium experience&quot; that Apple sells. So for most customers they made the right call to preserve the battery.<p>This is an engineering trade-off and not something that typically gets publically broadcast to customers. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s lots of other niche feature tweaks like this to the iPhone that we&#x27;re unaware of. They definitely could&#x27;ve and should&#x27;ve been more transparent about this, but I understand why it didn&#x27;t occur to them.')
