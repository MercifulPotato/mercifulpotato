But that&#x27;s in no small part because I ripped a large CD collection (and pulled other songs off Napster, mostly to replace songs I only had on old vinyl).<p>That said, I&#x27;m not at all sure that I&#x27;d try to build a library from scratch if I were starting today. Maybe I&#x27;d buy the odd album here and there but probably not wholesale.<p>As for video, the vast vast majority people of people don&#x27;t buy a lot of DVDs any longer. Heck, I&#x27;ve certainly had people express surprise that I even <i>own</i> a DVD player.')
