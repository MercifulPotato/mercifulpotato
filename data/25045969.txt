Item(by='usrusr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605016896, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25044666, text='The most visible group of Turkish immigrants are people whose ancestors came from underdeveloped backwaters of Turkey and who have effectively formed a bit of a conservative time capsule. When progressive urban Turks happen to come to Germany (this is rare) that group seems quite alien to them. Surely not as alien as Amish would seem to modern day Swiss or Germans (the German Turkish time capsule is much younger and clearly doesn&#x27;t rule out technology consumption), but it&#x27;s the same kind of disconnect.<p>That group is highly visible because all the others basically blend in with the natives, which creates the illusion that they are representative of all Turks. That&#x27;s why pointing out successful individuals who are clear counterexamples to the antiprogressive time capsule is highly relevant. It can help natives to stop assuming that everybody with a Turkish sounding name is a time capsule victim until proven otherwise and it can inspire those at risk of growing up to be the next generation of time capsuleers.')
