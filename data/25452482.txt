Telling a brand-new graduate student with zero software development experience to just throw everything into a container results in running code that is not optimized for the hardware it&#x27;s running on, which in turn negatively impacts the other users competing for compute time on HPC clusters.<p>There is a movement to incorporate technologies like Singularity into the HPC workflow but for established projects, it often looks like a lot of bikeshedding for negative results compared to just running the code on bare metal.')
