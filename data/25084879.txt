If we didn&#x27;t have the hard 1969 deadline we would likely have gone with the multi-launch option back then.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting alternate reality to imagine: we might have had a more interesting moon program that had the ability to naturally scale to larger and larger missions, instead of repeating basically the same thing until the public gets bored and cancels it.')
