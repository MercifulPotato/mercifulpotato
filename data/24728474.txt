How is that different from casing a house for entrances?<p>It&#x27;s more like looking through other people&#x27;s windows as you walk by the street.  May be creepy if you always stare at the same window, but formally there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.  If you do not want people to see through your public-facing windows in your home, it&#x27;s your responsibility to install blinds or shades.')
