I’m rather close to this issue because I’m aware of grants being given to MIT to make prototypes.  MIT is in the US and have a big reputation.  The current grants are modest, but they are opening a path for MIT to be paid to develop a technology they will sell.  This is all fine.  Where it stops being fine is when the developed coil winding technology is proprietary.  I’m not exactly sure how this doesn’t violate DoE grant contract rules.<p>Here is the competition, btw.  Paz-Soldan’s technique seems sound and should be funded for prototype coils.  I’m not saying MIT shouldn’t be given grants to do this work.  I just wish that they wouldn’t use public funds to develop proprietary technology.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2003.02154.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;2003.02154.pdf</a>')
