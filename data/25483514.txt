Although if reading qualifies as &quot;doing something&quot;, I guess I&#x27;m almost never not doing anything, because if I don&#x27;t have anything else to do, I almost always read. Of course I&#x27;ve always been careful to have plenty of reading material on hand; one nice thing about a smartphone is that you can carry a whole library around with you wherever you go.<p>In situations where I genuinely have nothing to do, not even read, I might get bored if I can&#x27;t come up with something to think about, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s uncomfortable for me to not do anything. It&#x27;s just a situation where it&#x27;s on me to come up with something to think about.')
