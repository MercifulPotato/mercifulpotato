Item(by='gdulli', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602274234, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24732888, text='&gt; It&#x27;s weird watching many of my friends and people I respect cheering while it happens<p>They understand that &quot;free speech&quot; is one of many principles we value, that these principles can clash, and we inevitably have to choose between them in cases. Even if those choices make some people uncomfortable. Before today, speech was neither offline nor online so free as to permit fraud. It&#x27;s a terrible civic abdication to write off criminal behavior because it&#x27;s so easy to get away with online and because it looks so much on the surface level like &quot;free speech.&quot;<p>Or because we live with too much fear and paranoia to accept even a discussion of establishing standards. Twitter making <i>any</i> judgment that some content is fraudulent is not the same as becoming the editorial boogeyman from the extremist side of whatever political party is opposite to yours. That&#x27;s fear. That&#x27;s an appeal to the slippery slope fallacy.<p>My trip to the store is better off for knowing that if someone was shouting about about Jesus or conspiracies, they&#x27;d be asked to leave. We don&#x27;t question that limit on speech. There&#x27;s a reason you see people doing that on street corners. If there was never any deplatforming, all platforms would inevitably suck.<p>Is it ideal that Twitter and Facebook have so much power? Maybe not, but that&#x27;s just the reality we&#x27;re in. We can&#x27;t be paralyzed into inaction. There&#x27;s no perfect body that everyone would trust to do the job and someone has to keep Twitter and Facebook from sucking too hard. Don&#x27;t let your paranoia make you overlook that they&#x27;d lose half their audience&#x2F;business if they ever strayed too far from the middle.')
