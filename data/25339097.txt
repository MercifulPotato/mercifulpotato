VAT and sales tax are structurally different.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s the highest in the US, FWIIW.<p>That&#x27;s true if you talk exclusively of the state-only rate, which makes no sense to use as the basis of comparison; for statewide average combined state and local sales tax rate (the average rate people actually pay for sales tax in the State), California is #9, behind liberal utopias like Tennessee, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Alabama, among others. (Not only is California not the highest for <i>average</i> combined state and local sales tax, it&#x27;s nowhere close to the highest for <i>peak</i> combined state and local sales tax, that is, the maximum people actually have to pay; the source I have doesn&#x27;t rank this way, but from inspection it looks like Illinois with a statewide 6.25% and a peak local additional of 10.00% is the top there.)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taxfoundation.org&#x2F;2020-sales-taxes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taxfoundation.org&#x2F;2020-sales-taxes&#x2F;</a>')
