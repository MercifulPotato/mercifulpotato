It used to be normal for companies to have much larger work forces and to in-source all tasks, even if they were not a core competency. \nNow the emphasis is on lean everything, to only focus on your niche, and outsource as much as possible. Remember IT departments? It&#x27;s all been outsourced to the Cloud.<p>I have two theories on this.\nOne is that we simply have improved our management processes. The economy became more developed and you could realize real efficiency gains from outsourcing. From a pure GDP perspective - this was good.<p>The second is more messy and i&#x27;m still working on it but it ties into a lot of macro issues. It used to be much easier start out with no experience, say as a janitor, and work your way up to a higher position in the same company. This was possible because it was all the same company. Now with outsourcing this is impossible, if you start as a janitor, the only thing you can do is maybe run the janitor company, but you won&#x27;t ever become the CEO of the company whose office you clean.\nAt the same time, you&#x27;ve made entry-level positions at the company harder to attain. The floor is no longer janitor, it is now junior developer (to take a software example). This is one of the reasons why I think there is such a bifurcation in our labor market. A college degree is now the minimum requirement to get your foot into the door. Again, it used to possible to start at the very bottom and work your way up but now there is a hard cap on growth unless you go the college route.<p>I think this was a clever way for companies to also push costs onto employees. Training used to be a thing companies did but now it&#x27;s basically been abandoned. Go spend your own money and get a degree before even talking to us is the attitude.')
