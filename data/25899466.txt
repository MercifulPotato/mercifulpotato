Wat?<p>True, my parent was&#x2F;is drunken my entire life, with a month or two of sobriety spliced in here and there. That doesn&#x27;t mean that alcohol somehow magically caused him to be a useless degenerate who has no regard for human life. From what I hear my dad&#x27;s biggest unexcusable behavior in life came before the alcoholism. His flashes of sobriety that I witnessed growing up didn&#x27;t magically reveal a good person.<p>Using alcoholism to excuse any behavior is just wrong, imo. My mom readily used it to justify why my dad beat her and us. That&#x27;s not okay.<p>Assholes need to be hold accountable and their actions should not be explained away.')
