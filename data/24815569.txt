I got an email yesterday saying they can&#x27;t migrate one of my apps, a Python WSGI custom app listening on a port, so now I&#x27;m looking.<p>The migration faq [0] says that there will be no capability to run Python based apps on the new tsoHost. I don&#x27;t know if that extends to running Python via crontab, you would want to verify that with them.<p>OpalStack [1] looks appealing. It&#x27;s built by former staff of Webfaction. I&#x27;m leaning in that direction, but also considering Digital Ocean, Linode, Heroku, Vultr [2], and some others I just learned about. Some do some of the host management for you. OpalStack is clearly a continuation of the Webfaction model so that will probably be my choice, but want to learn some more about these others too.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.webfaction.com&#x2F;faq#which-features-will-not-be-available-through-tsohost-when-i-am-migrated-from-webfaction" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.webfaction.com&#x2F;faq#which-features-will-not-be-av...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.opalstack.com&#x2F;signup&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.opalstack.com&#x2F;signup&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vultr.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vultr.com&#x2F;</a>')
