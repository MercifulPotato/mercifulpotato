But there is no doubt that Trump supporters came out in force in 2020 far greater than 2016.  I cannot for the life of me understand <i>why</i> so many people think Trump is an ideal choice for President, but I do continue to try and listen, maybe I will finally get hit with the clue bat.  I&#x27;ve got Trump fans as friends, but they can never really articulate why I should agree with them other than &#x27;democrats bad&#x27;.  And that doesn&#x27;t resonate with me, because I need something more than simple tribalism to guide my choice.')
