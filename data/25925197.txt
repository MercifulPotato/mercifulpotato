Anyway, the Metro employees union would never go for it.<p>The no-eating rule is a fairly big deal on Metro. A twelve year-old girl was famously arrested for eating a single French fry [0], in a case (Hedgepeth v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority) that went all the way to the U.S. Court of Appeals, where the arrest was upheld. A teenager was arrested in 2016 for carrying chips and snacks into a Metro station [1]. If I saw an employee flouting this rule, I’d be indignant too. I wouldn’t have posted a photo of the person, but the kind of vitriol, racism, and naked hate this novelist faced in response to her tweet was totally unwarranted. The potential for negative consequences on the part of the Metro employee was greatly exaggerated.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;US&#x2F;story?id=94999&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;abcnews.go.com&#x2F;US&#x2F;story?id=94999&amp;page=1</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;trafficandcommuting&#x2F;metro-transit-police-arrest-teenager-for-carrying-chips-and-lollipop-into-station&#x2F;2016&#x2F;10&#x2F;19&#x2F;1360a014-9627-11e6-bb29-bf2701dbe0a3_story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;trafficandcommuting&#x2F;met...</a>')
