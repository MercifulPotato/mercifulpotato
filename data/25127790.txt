I said he sympathizes with and encourages the &quot;hoax&quot; perspective.<p>And that perspective is that concern about the pandemic is a plot against his presidency just like the Russia investigation was. Go back and watch the speech. It&#x27;s clear as day. The way he puts the pandemic in the past tense (&quot;We did one of the great jobs...&quot;). The framing of the issue as a foreign invasion. Mission accomplished guys, what&#x27;s the big deal? This hoopla is just another hoax.<p>The broader context is important here as well. The speech was delivered in front of a packed auditorium as calls to avoid such gatherings were being made, to little avail.<p>The president has repeatedly doubled-down on this stance that the pandemic is being blown out of proportion, both in words and actions.')
