Excellent documentation which will only likely get better. SDK in C&#x2F;C++, and MicroPython. You can even learn concepts like PIO and DMA in MicroPython. Adafruit expressed confidence in their MicroPython libraries working out of the box, too.<p>The form-factor on the Pico is also a little nicer than and ESP32.<p>Pin duplicators are also available. This idea has a lot of potential, as it allows one to break out modules. It&#x27;s much better than the Arduino shield for two reasons: 1. shields have quirky pin alignments, making it hard to create your own boards. 2. shields stack on top of the other, obscuring the layer below.<p>The Pico will be another stellar success from the Pi Foundation. I have no doubt.')
