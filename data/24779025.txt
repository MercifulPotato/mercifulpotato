The only goal of it is to get a callback from a recruiter.<p>In Europe, I&#x27;ve had a hiring manager tell me he actually reads longer resumes. Another recruiter in the UK told me for exec profiles he&#x27;s seen 3-4 pages long ones that were not great, but passable. The other 23 recruiters and hiring managers all suggested to fit it into 2 pages.<p>I would say, make sure everything important is on the first 2 pages. The book has an example of a person with 20+ years&#x27; experience refactoring their resume to a 2-page one, cutting off 10 years of less relevant experience, and getting a lot more callbacks.')
