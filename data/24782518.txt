If twitter is removing stories for having dubious sources, then that story should not pass muster either.<p>If they’re removing stories for having “hacked” (or in the case of both this story about Hunter Biden, or Trumps taxes: “leaked”) sources, then discussion of BOTH of these stories should be banned.')
