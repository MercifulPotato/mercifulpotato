If you give your life to leisure&#x2F;pleasure it is a resource that is wasted that detracts both from your life, and the lives of any person you may have helped with that resource. I reject the notion that self destructive behavior doesn&#x27;t hurt anyone else.  I&#x27;d hate to live in a society of bums and drug addicts. We all do better when we all do better.\nRight now, fully a third of all of my work efforts (read: taxes) are wasted on retired dabblers and dilettantes who do nothing to help the rest of us. Their pleasure comes at the cost of myself, and my children.\nSo long as you pass on your genes and your ideas, your efforts matter on Earth, and potentially our actions matter on a spiritual&#x2F;supernatural level. The only respite I find in these conversations as that the hedonists will just be dust in the wind.')
