Also what exactly does it mean to work hard as a developer?<p>&gt;How many hours were you working a week?<p>Hours again eh? Sounds like this place has absolutely no work-life balance and just burns everyone out. To whose benefit? Oh right only the benefit of the CEO.<p>&gt;For example, it’s absolutely shocking that the common paradigm for engineers at Google is to come in at 11am and leave at 4pm. In no world can you be working 5 hours a day and be giving a shit, and so the conclusion is that very little meaningful work gets done at Google.<p>This has to be the dumbest thing I have read in ages.<p>Google has a market capitalization of 1.2 trillion. They have extensive research into how to treat employees to maximize their productivity. If you think google is doing it wrong, you are indeed the one doing it wrong.<p>&gt; lack of office attires<p>You can tell this guy has a dress code. Even General Motors the place of 10 layers of bureaucracy discovered they dont need a dress code.<p>Working for this guy sounds like a nightmare.')
