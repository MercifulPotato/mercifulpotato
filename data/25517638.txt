If an operational base is large enough, 5G sources outside of this perimeter will not be effective. It also sounds like it is trivial to create artificial barriers to absorb the emitted energy.<p>&quot;5G wavelengths have a range of about 1,000 feet, not even 2% of 4G&#x27;s range. So to ensure a reliable 5G signal, there needs to be a lot of 5G cell towers and antennas everywhere. We&#x27;re talking on every lamppost, traffic light, etc. because even trees can block 5G signals.&quot;<p>[p.s. hmm. Counter point: Disposable loitering EM-drone swarms. I guess this boils down to battery tech again.]')
