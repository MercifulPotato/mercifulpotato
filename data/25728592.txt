Coins are still a very common feature of life and also useful for teaching addition, also very useful for life.<p>I appreciate we have to move with the times (I’m not pushing for reintroducing log tables)  but it seems useful that kids come out with a solid grasp of fundamental reality around them —- reading an analogue clock, knowing the shape of the world in broad outline, being able to count change.<p>To use a programming analogy, it is better to teach someone JS and how to do DOM manipulation, so that they see it’s a pain, and then show them React and how it’s useful, than just jumping straight into the current state of the art.')
