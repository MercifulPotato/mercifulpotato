I think there should be some content about how our HR teams use Jira coming out soon so that could be a good first step.<p>Ironically, I was part of the group that just did the first ever official Atlassian Twitch stream the other day! Seems like an easy way to fire off content without needing a lot of approvals and checks. I&#x27;ll chat with some people on the marketing side to see how hard it would be to just walk through our own setups. Saw this in a comment somewhere, but confirming we have a culture where process and setup are determined mostly on a department-by-department basis (at least for the non-tech side of the house). Our Marketing org generally works in an &quot;agency&quot; model where there are teams responsible for specific marketing disciplines (SEO, Video, Branding, etc etc).<p>Just on a side note, I&#x27;m happy to walk you through how we use it personally â€” Zoom, email, or whatever. Always trying to learn how we can make Jira better and try to share advice where I can.')
