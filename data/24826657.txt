I made it about 10 years ago after I learned XSLT for a project at work. I feel secure in knowing that the XSLT code I wrote will never become obsolete, as compared to the Python script I wrote which will eventually become harder to run as Python 2 is phased out. The biggest disadvantage is that I havenâ€™t done any XSLT work in 10 years so I need to relearn it every time the script needs modification.')
