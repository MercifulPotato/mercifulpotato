And in a smarter compiler this will be one memory access per byte anyways.  Not to mention on any modern architecture, even if your compiler doesn&#x27;t squash the second memory access, the microarchitecture will.<p>Also all the semicolons after his brackets bug me.  Not to mention that the thing looks past the end of the string.  (We have a length specified, so I assume it&#x27;s not null terminated... indeed, we can get a match past the end).')
