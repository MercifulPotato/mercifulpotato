The baby gave no consent for being photographed naked (as nobody age &lt; 18 can give legal consent for such). A naked picture of a baby belongs only to the parents, not the entire world.<p>Only thing it has going for it, is that when the album was released there was no widespread Internet usage among civilians. With no Internet as we know it today available, that makes an eventual outcry about the picture less likely, and more difficult to organize. But I for sure remember it being controversial back then.')
