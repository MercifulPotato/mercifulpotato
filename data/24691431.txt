Instead of printing after each turn, he&#x27;s running all turns, then printing them all out at once. This is a very different behaviour and I think it&#x27;s glossing over &#x2F; copping out from the difficulties of applying FP in side-effectful codebases.<p>I mean in this case, he&#x27;s transformed the program from running with a constant amount of memory (only need as much memory as it takes to run a turn) to having to store the entire history in memory. So this would be really bad if there were many turns, or if the program was going to run indefinitely, responding to user input, etc.')
