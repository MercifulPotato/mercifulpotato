The chronology is:\nSmart EQ: 2007 (in tiny numbers; niche non-mass-market product)<p>Tesla Roadster: 2008 (in tiny numbers; niche non-mass-market product)<p>Nissan Leaf: 2010<p>Renault Zoe: 2012<p>Tesla Model S: 2012<p>The Leaf was a big seller, and the Zoe outsells Tesla&#x27;s entire line-up in Europe.<p>I think it would be fair to say that Tesla really sold the idea of a _performance_ electric car, but not electric cars as a whole.')
