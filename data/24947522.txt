I was a shift manager in the 11th grade so I had to learn how to manage people and make sure the numbers added up at the end of the night, while doing homework in the back office, with one eye on the drive through times.<p>Running a shift at McDonald&#x27;s required some leadership, you have to be able to work the drive through and clean the bathrooms when the time came. You have to be able to handle any tasks in a fast paced environment. I learned how to be a team player and keep the customers happy. Kinda of the same things I&#x27;m doing now.')
