Have you tried Airflow 2.0? We made some pretty big overhauls both in terms of UI and backend.\n2. DAG versioning is currently problematic, but DAG versioning is a &quot;when&quot; and not an &quot;if&quot; so should be in a future 2.x version :). That said could you describe a bit more about your deployment issues? User stories like this help us improve the product.\n3. Have you looked into using KEDA with the CeleryExecutor? You could create KEDA queues for a lot of commonly used workflows and then you&#x27;d only need to use the python or bash operator to run those tasks instead of k8spodop.\n4. Are you using the Airflow helm chart or did you custom roll a deployment?<p>Any feedback would be highly appreciated and I&#x27;m also glad to answer any questions you might have!')
