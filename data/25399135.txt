You don&#x27;t have to agree with these people to understand the basic formula that if a large enough group feels like they have been disenfranchised and are now being suppressed from talking about it by those in power the result is always the same.<p>The way out of this was for the winning side to get out ahead of it and do everything in their power to legitimize the election for these people. They didn&#x27;t have a moral duty to do so, but it was foolish not to, since now by not doing so we&#x27;ve seen a deep, cemented, hatred and distrust of the outcome and the other side that from my vantage point is materially worse than before <i>and</i> could have been avoided to a large degree.<p>We&#x27;re in trouble. People on the &quot;winning&quot; side of this dispute seem to be celebrating as the other side&#x27;s hopes are dashed and their speech is marginalized, but in fact they ought to be terrified, since insofar as the other side isn&#x27;t persuaded of their error and their beliefs deepen in light of the coercion being used against them being seen as a form of confirmation, things are going to be worse for everyone going into the new year.<p>A strange irony from this situation that I hadn&#x27;t realized is that it seems that if one is on the winning side of a dispute its the point of maximal confidence the other side will be coerced into submission that one actually should be the least confident that the dispute is going to be settled, since it means coercion has been accepted as the only possible method to settle it. In fact, its that moment, the one where persuasion is understood to not be viable, which presents the greatest danger.<p>Our history points to another example of the point of presumed capitulation in fact being the start of anything but, but I won&#x27;t make the analogy at the risk of it (rightly) being torn apart.')
