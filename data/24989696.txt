Not directly illuminating the sky when the illumination is being used on the ground is the low-hanging fruit, but additional measures should be considered:<p>* Use light of lower intensity (candela) to put less illuminance (lux) on what&#x27;s being illuminated. This is a more precise version of &quot;use a dimmer light&quot;, because reducing output (lumens) won&#x27;t necessarily do that if the light is more focused&#x2F;directional.<p>* Illuminate fewer places. Street lighting for traffic safety doesn&#x27;t need to be <i>everywhere</i>; it needs to be where hazards are.<p>* Use alternatives to general illumination. Some road hazards can be marked with reflectors or low-intensity marker lights pointed directly at drivers instead of overhead lighting.<p>* Turn off lights when not in use. Use timers. Use motion sensors. Use buttons pedestrians can press for crosswalks.<p>* Encourage people to use portable lighting rather than fixed lighting. This becomes more effective when there&#x27;s less ambient light because less light is required to achieve the same contrast with a faraway background.')
