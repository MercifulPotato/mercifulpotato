I&#x27;ve implemented an editing tool (realtime video generation parameter editing w&#x2F; feedback from the generator) that really has a lot of issues.<p>Part of them because i didn&#x27;t fully understand Swing when i began the project and partly because synchronizing GUI&#x27;s to another live process is a quite error prone task.<p>A debugger process is almost certainly not living in the same thread as the Swing UI of IDEA so this almost surely more of a thread synchroniztion issue rather than Swing issue. (You really don&#x27;t watch to do any cross-thread touching with Swing apart from for a very limited set of components built for this).')
