Just like every site reliability engineer rewrites borgmon. What I chose to do myself was make Blaze happen using a Makefile config. There&#x27;s a blog post somewhere where Google talks about why they switched from GNU Make to Blaze c. 2006. if I remember correctly it basically boiled down to not having strict dependency checking. So I thought, why not simply avoid their published mistakes without changing build systems? I learned everything I could about make, discovered that variables are secretly lambdas, and that enabled me to figure out a way to have a static archive package for each folder, which also avoided the need to write a makefile code generator. Then I wrote a simple C program to check incremental elf symbols so the build graph stays sanely formed. It totally got make working like a dream in a way I simply hadn&#x27;t seen before. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jart&#x2F;cosmopolitan&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;tool&#x2F;build&#x2F;package.c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jart&#x2F;cosmopolitan&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;tool&#x2F;build&#x2F;...</a>')
