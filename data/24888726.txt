I feel like at the gym, the workout bikes (which I think are generally powered by pedaling), will give you a wattage output that seemed higher than than 60 watts, but again, that&#x27;s about resistance (and not taking into account the inefficiencies of power generation).  Seems like it could be made usable for a daily power generation machine (reminds me of &quot;Oxygen Not Included&quot;, where you have the person run on a hamster wheel to generate power).')
