For example a Tesla won’t even take a charge if the input is below the ~300-500W range in good weather.  In cold weather say Northeast US winter, the floor is closer to a 1kW input as there is a heating system to get the battery put to temperature for charging that is going to eat almost all of that.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.tesla.com&#x2F;discussion&#x2F;93521&#x2F;solar-panels-on-the-roof-of-the-car-for-charging-is-it-possible" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.tesla.com&#x2F;discussion&#x2F;93521&#x2F;solar-panels-on-th...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.tesla.com&#x2F;discussion&#x2F;150998&#x2F;charge-tesla-w-solar-panels-in-parking-lot" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forums.tesla.com&#x2F;discussion&#x2F;150998&#x2F;charge-tesla-w-so...</a>')
