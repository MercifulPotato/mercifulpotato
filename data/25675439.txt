I was an ING Direct customer who was rolled into a C1 360 account and it&#x27;s honestly been great. It&#x27;s just a consistently hassle-free experience. TBH, I mostly use a combination of Fidelity + Merrill Edge these days due to my particular cashflow management setup, but I keep my C1 360 account open for use every now and then. It&#x27;s night and day between C1 360 and Chase, BofA, etc.')
