Most spam today comes from malware running on PC&#x27;s not owned by the spammer.  All they need is a software library that does this math and 100% of the CPU cost is on the malware victim.  The software library would have to already exist and be available to everyone or this concept would never be adopted, which means that the spammer gets this for free.  They just have to plug the library into their malware.  The only cost that would be forced onto spammers would be if the PoW used signed individual keys that could be revoked if abused.')
