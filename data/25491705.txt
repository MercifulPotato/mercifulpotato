Give it some time, it&#x27;s strange and delightful. Last release was in October, as in under 2 months ago: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.riscosopen.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;24&#x2F;risc-os-5-28-now-available" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.riscosopen.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;24&#x2F;risc-os-...</a><p>Firstly, it&#x27;s unapologetically super-british in way you can only experience in person (games for instance, live in the &quot;diversions&quot; folder, settings are called &quot;choices&quot;, the desktop background is called the &quot;backdrop&quot;, the media player is subscribed to the BBC by default. Instead of asking for localization, the clock goes to British time, the prices are in pounds, and you need to go out of your way to tell it you have a US keyboard. There&#x27;s apps for british football news, unmounting disks is called &quot;dismounting&quot;, etc... it&#x27;s fun)<p>It&#x27;s also unique in its own special way, not really fitting clearly into the UNIX or DOS lineage.<p>For instance you can press some key sequence and get a shell, but in this unique way: It first appears at the bottom of the screen and then the graphical buffer of the UX scrolls up with your interaction like so: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.riscos.com&#x2F;the_archive&#x2F;rol&#x2F;productsdb&#x2F;images&#x2F;split.jpg" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.riscos.com&#x2F;the_archive&#x2F;rol&#x2F;productsdb&#x2F;images&#x2F;spli...</a> - this isn&#x27;t unix, it isn&#x27;t dos, it&#x27;s its own special snowflake, really, feels closer to VMS than anything: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.riscos.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;users&#x2F;userguide3&#x2F;book3b&#x2F;book3_2.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.riscos.com&#x2F;support&#x2F;users&#x2F;userguide3&#x2F;book3b&#x2F;book3_...</a><p>It also has this capability of fully interactive submenus with dialog boxes, icons, etc - it&#x27;s kinda weird: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;timil.com&#x2F;riscos&#x2F;desktop_settings&#x2F;menu.jpg" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;timil.com&#x2F;riscos&#x2F;desktop_settings&#x2F;menu.jpg</a><p>You can just flash it onto a microsd card, pop it into the raspberry pi and boot it up. It&#x27;s really easy. Give it a spin.')
