I do not know of any other technology covering a ratio of 10^10 or more. ... This challenge, viz. the confrontation with the programming task, is so unique that this novel experience can teach us a lot about ourselves. It should deepen our understanding of the processes of design and creation, it should give us better control over the task of organizing our thoughts. If it did not do so, to my taste we should not deserve the computer at all! (&quot;The Humble Programmer&quot;, EWD 340)<p>This. I think that the computer revolution would happen if programming teaches the rest of us more about our society and our mind, rather than computers and systems themselves.')
