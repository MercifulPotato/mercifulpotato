Stripe didn&#x27;t cut off the Trump campaign&#x27;s ability to raise funds.  They didn&#x27;t block access to their bank accounts.  They didn&#x27;t freeze their assets.<p>Rather, <i>one</i> company (and they aren&#x27;t even close to the largest player in that industry) chose not to process online credit card transactions for them.<p>The Trump campaign has many other online payment processors that it can do business with.  They can still accept donations via many other means (checks, bank transfers, cash, etc., etc.).<p>A single company (which is just a group of people) decided they didn&#x27;t want to do business with another group of people.<p>Stripe, it&#x27;s shareholders and employees are under no obligation to do business with anyone.<p>And the fact that the customer is a political entity strengthens that, as their right to support (or not) any particular political entity, candidate or position is integral to a free society.')
