This is in addition to all the other electricity needs.<p>In the UK solar is not that great because of the gloomy winters (when heating demand is at its peak, and the UK wants to <i>also</i> move away from gas central heating...).<p>Best bets, IMO are tides and offshore wind. But wind can also be quite variable.<p>If you add all of this up &quot;<i>just over provision</i>&quot; becomes unrealistic. There needs to be extensive storage capacity but I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re quite there yet. Certainly batteries do not seem a very environmentally friendly option. Even this may bot solve the problem.<p>All in all I think renewables can <i>minimise</i> the need for nuclear power but cannot replace it, at least for now.')
