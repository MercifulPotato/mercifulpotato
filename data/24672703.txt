Some thoughts:<p>1) For error handling, I think anyhow and thiserror have been gaining popularity for applications and libraries, respectively. There&#x27;s also eyre, a fork of anyhow with some more options apparently, and color-eyre, which is a variation of eyre for colorful backtraces. Long story short, yeah, there&#x27;s a lot of crates.<p>2) I&#x27;ve heard good things about sqlx as an alternative to diesel that lets you write raw type-safe SQL into your code and get it checked at compile time. It has good async support too.<p>3) I would probably mention async-std as an alternative to tokio.')
