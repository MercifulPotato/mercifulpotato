I personally devoted a significant chunk of my life to avoid that which simply isn’t tenable for most people.  Still looking into the mechanics of say   DNA deep doing to encounter chromatin means you can start to reason about what’s actually happening.  Keep building a slightly more than superficial understanding of everything from Architecture to  Quantum Mechanics and eventually you run out of major fields of study.   It’s far from comprehensive and you really need to focus after that, but it’s something.<p>So sure, I don’t know the exact CGI line, but it’s something I know quite a lot about.  Could a ‘deep fake’ style video effectively be good enough to be indistinguishable from someone actually talking? I suspect not yet, but I wouldn’t want to take the bet.  But I know enough to realize the specifics around chaotic fluid simulation is a vastly higher hurdle due to the underlying computation involved.<p>Granted, drawing that line requires an understanding of  what Military’s can pull off, which ultimately comes down to physics and economics.  Now, I have actually done R&amp;D for them so take of this what you will.  It used to be military hardware had a huge leg up, but that’s far less the case today.<p>Getting to the point where you hear someone say “salt used to be worth as much as gold” and you think “that’s got to be BS” doesn’t take a deep understanding of history, just a supernatural understanding of a few related topics.')
