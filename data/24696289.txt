Please don’t try to second-guess me. <i>I don’t want anything autoplaying.</i><p>That GIFs autoplay is unequivocally a <i>bug</i>. Just a well-entrenched one that would take a lot of effort to fix, and no one capable of fixing it seems to quite think it’s worth it.<p>There are multiple reasons I might not want autoplay: bandwidth or performance concerns, accessibility problems from motion, or even just the simple “if you autoplay, then when I reach it it won’t be at the start of the video any more”.')
