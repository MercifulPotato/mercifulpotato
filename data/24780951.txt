The issue isn&#x27;t that we&#x27;re going backwards — voter turnout has generally increased over this country&#x27;s lifetime [1] — but it&#x27;s that we&#x27;re enfranchising people at a relatively slow and demographically disproportionate rate. If you pick 30 years ago as your starting point, you&#x27;ll miss the start of the war on drugs, white flight and redlining, Jim Crow — all &quot;real, tangible actions and real legislation by living souls, people whose goals were to repress votes to change outcomes&quot;.<p>Right wing media constructing an alternate reality is worrying, of course. But it&#x27;s myopic to intentionally ignore the mantle of disenfranchisement and oppression that recent politicians have picked up. Their ideas didn&#x27;t come from nowhere, you know.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Voter_turnout_in_the_United_States_presidential_elections" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Voter_turnout_in_the_United_St...</a>')
