Jailbreaks are not the main concern here, privilege escalation vulnerabilities are. Those are discovered somewhat regularly in both Android and iOS. Jailbreaks on iOS make use of such vulnerabilities when they discover them, but most vulnerabilities are not discovered by jailbreakers. These sorts of vulnerabilities are also inherent to any complex operating system, not unique to Android.<p>Users &quot;rooting&quot; their Android phones also usually doesn&#x27;t involve any sort of real exploit either. Android devices don&#x27;t come with the ability for apps to run as root by default, and can have their firmware flashed to add a means of doing so. Doing this requires that the user unlock their bootloader, which wipes the device and often requires manufacturer authorization. Rooted devices have weakened security by being rooted, but this doesn&#x27;t affect ordinary non-rooted devices.')
