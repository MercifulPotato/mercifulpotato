Item(by='splintercell', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602169652, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24719405, text='OP implies that it&#x27;s satire. So the only information you wanted to add is the right wing nature of the website (which has nothing to do with the article posted or OP&#x27;s commentary).<p>Anyways (unlike reddit) we also don&#x27;t ask why were we downvoted here, take it and move on. Generally down votes here come in when you add unnecessary &#x27;color&#x27; to the conversation. Like you bring up an unrelated issue to the conversation to make it go towards the flame wars.<p>Its factually correct that a certain filesystem&#x27;s developer went to jail for killing their spouse, but if someone keeps bringing it up on any discussion on filesystems and it results in a flamewar every single time then HN audience will downvote you.')
