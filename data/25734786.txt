It&#x27;s far from perfect, as there are certain features I&#x27;ve seen repeatedly requested that are still yet to be implemented, but over the years that I&#x27;ve used it, Signal has come much closer to a full-featured WhatsApp alternative while taking the harder path of maintaining privacy for these additions.<p>My personal wishlist:<p>- Making the app available on F-Droid, either on the official repos or just hosting a third-party one<p>- Bringing the Android backup solution (encrypted blob) to iOS<p>- Bringing the iOS backup solution (direct device transfer over Wi-Fi) to Android<p>- Signup with usernames&#x2F;emails as an option instead of only verified phone numbers<p>- A more reliable desktop client, because most of my contacts on Signal (myself included) have experienced syncing issues, message decryption issues, notification issues, etc. I do like that the desktop client is temporarily standalone in that the phone running the app does not need to be available, although I have had to re-connect the two every once in a while so I don&#x27;t find it reassuring to depend on the desktop client alone.')
