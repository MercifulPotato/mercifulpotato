I thought I believed in free speech, to the point where I started a company dedicated to providing privacy and communications products that were not subject to control by any central authority (that turns out to be very hard!)  But watching the events of the past few years unfold I am no longer convinced that this would really make the world a better place.  I always thought that in the end cooler heads would prevail.  But we&#x27;ve now done the experiment in a big way and the results seem overwhelmingly negative to me, to the point where they present a credible existential threat to civilization, on a par with climate change.<p>Maybe someone here can talk me down from this new position.  But the evidence seems pretty overwhelming to me right now.')
