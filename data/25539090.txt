Sure, 2+2=4, unless you&#x27;re working base 3 or something, in which case you just have to be careful about your definitions. An easy caveat in hindsight but too often people take the truth they know and insist it&#x27;s the only one. Just look at the debate over irrational numbers in the time of the Greeks -- they can&#x27;t exists, claims one side, and as evidence they note that they can&#x27;t represent them. Or imaginary numbers: they too can&#x27;t exist. Or parallel lines that cross (what?). Or breaking the rules of calculus to get generalized functions.<p>Basically one thing I love about math is you can take any statement&#x2F;idea&#x2F;construction, consider some opposite of it, and see if you can get something coherent out -- and often enough you do! I&#x27;m not saying that 2+2=4 or &quot;you can&#x27;t differentiate discontinuous functions&quot; is subjective, per se, but it is in some sense a decision, a choice.')
