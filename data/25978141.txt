One was an application key user in a different company, he was hired as a deployment manager for that app for more than double the pay; I am happy for him, but he knows he is not a manager.<p>The other one was hired on a position, asked to do something completely different he was not qualified for, the work hours were around 70-80 per week (no overtime paid), zero management implication so he left after a few months. They went in panic mode, offered him double the pay and less work hours, he refused to stay there so they become aggressive.<p>They use to pay above the market for whatever they can hire, but the chaos inside is making any competent people leave asap, so they pay a lot to retain whatever they can, not the experts. It is just a bubble with nothing than hot air inside.')
