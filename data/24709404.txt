It&#x27;s just hard to really know that in advance, because products change so much. E.g., my vacuum cleaner is still working fine after 15 years. Great, but that just says that if you bought one of these vacuums 15 years ago it probably would have been a good idea. But it doesn&#x27;t actually tell you much about what to buy today, because the models and designs and manufacturing processes and quality control have all probably changed since then.<p>Nonetheless this site looks great for getting what info we can. Nice work and I&#x27;ll be saving it.')
