I&#x27;ve been noodling over a lot of similar career questions myself in light of the pandemic. All of a sudden, it became clear that I could just...bootstrap. With the rise of networks like Toptal and Facet, I get access to pretty high quality contracting opportunities and I don&#x27;t need to commit to a &quot;job&quot; to pay the bills and make my money, which by proxy means I have much more time available than I used to.<p>Which means I can noodle around on that side business which all of a sudden...costs a lot less than it used to. Wonder how many other folks are in the same boat?')
