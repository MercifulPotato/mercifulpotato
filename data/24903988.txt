Does every senator have to give it, or is it okay if only a few do so? Did none of the Democrat senators give any advice? Did the Republican &quot;Wait until after the election&quot; not count as advice? As far as I know, many words were shared between the interested parties - surely some of them could have been legally interpreted as &quot;advice&quot;?<p>Edit reply due to rate limit:<p>&gt; Same situation, different outcomes, and funny how both satisfy the demands of the Constitution.<p>Well yes. If the constitution requires the senate&#x27;s consent on candidates, then obviously both giving and withholding consent is allowed - what you call &quot;Same situation, different outcomes&quot;.<p>Of course the Republicans where <i>hypocritical</i> in their justification of their actions, but I fail to see how the constitution was broken.')
