However, couches, nice chairs, books, headsets, screens, <i>good lighting</i>, flexibility with respect to life, bonuses, careful hiring not to mess the team, a view on a mediterranean port in a country that&#x27;s pretty much sunny most of the year, transparency, inclusion in everything, alignment, and working on interesting problems improves retention and productivity.<p>We buy good laptops according to the tastes of our people. One engineer could not use a laptop that didn&#x27;t have a nipple&#x2F;joystick&#x2F;pointing stick (Thinkpad). Although it was strange, that&#x27;s what the engineer got.<p>However, there are things where we <i>notice</i> latent demand and we don&#x27;t wait for someone to ask. For example, we had one couch. We found that everyone wanted to use the couch and there would be a game of dibs, so we bought more couches.<p>Bear in mind that we had a period of struggle and we went cockroach mode. Everyone knew it and everyone knew we couldn&#x27;t afford stuff, but there was acceptance because the information was out there. The rationale behind not buying something was communicated: the money is tight. We&#x27;d buy that if he had more, and we did buy when we had more.')
