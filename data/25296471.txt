Across 8x 16-bit memory channels and at LPDDR4X-4266-class memory, this means the M1 hits a peak of 68.25GB&#x2F;s memory bandwidth.</i><p>Later in the article:<p><i>Most importantly, memory copies land in at 60 to 62GB&#x2F;s depending if you’re using scalar or vector instructions. The fact that a single Firestorm core can almost saturate the memory controllers is astounding and something we’ve never seen in a design before.</i>')
