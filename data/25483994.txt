As a staunch “old school” yankee liberal, I hate the way neo-liberalism has propelled this to new heights.<p>Neoliberalism has very close to nothing at all to do with this, being a center-right economic ideology that&#x27;s basically unconcerned with any axis of offense. Occasionally, neoliberals tactically engage in superficially  identity politics (progressive or regressive) to draw in allies that don&#x27;t have an fundamental preference for corporate capitalismo, and might engage in perfomative offense gestures as part of that, but they aren&#x27;t the driving force there they are using to to appeal to other groups.<p>&gt; We used to tolerate being offended<p>No, “we” didn&#x27;t, unless by “we” you mean oppressed minorities. Dominant social groups in used to openly (and to a lesser extent and less openly still do) murder people for offending them, with virtually no accountability, and before that it wasn&#x27;t even extralegal, the grounds of offense were written into law with harsh punishments.<p>&gt;  If I have a giant microphone for the entire world, I would tell everyone to toughen up a bit and ignore people who offend you.<p>The people with the resources to have metaphorical giant microphones have <i>always</i> has that message to the people that don&#x27;t; that&#x27;s no innovation.<p>Of course, they usually are no less prone to offense.<p>&gt; Right now as it stands, I am in the Silicon Valley and it feels like I can be hung for using the wrong pronoun even.<p>Yes, a lot of propaganda effort by relatively privileged groups has been directed at making you feel that way. But when (much rarer than it used to be within living, but it still happens) people <i>actually do</i> get hung for offending people in the US, it&#x27;s almost without exception by the people that are behind that propaganda effort not the people at whom it points blame.')
