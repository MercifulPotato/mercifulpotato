Now I think it‘s the suppliers fault that it did not work.<p>There was another article that was a rant against a UPS supplier because it did not work anymore after a long time without checking.<p>IMHO, a UPS is a device for _professionals_. It‘s not something one just buy and install-and-forget. It‘s something that needs regular maintenance and testing. It’s like a car.
