Some of the initial problem was that we were given a one day notice to pack up and stay home for the foreseeable future. It was not a choice and I wasn&#x27;t prepared. Part of the problem is that I don&#x27;t have the space in my house for my children, my spouse, and myself to have anything close to a &quot;home office&quot;. As it stands, I am resigned to work on a 13&quot; Macbook from a recliner in my living room after being accustomed to my dual monitors, standing desk, and keyboard at work. I&#x27;m sure I could set this up at the coffee table, but that seems almost worse and also so long work&#x2F;life separation. On top of this, I was in a very healthy groove of hitting the gym every lunch hour, which helped my productivity tremendously. Sure, I could do burpees in the living room or something, but it&#x27;s not happening.')
