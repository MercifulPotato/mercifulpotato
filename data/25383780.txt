But I guess in the case where they are redacting something like a &quot;method or procedure&quot; that has been written about unredacted in other contexts and then its application in this context is classified, I think that would be possible. I&#x27;m sure people are already thinking about how to guard against this.<p>Your second paragraph is interesting. It&#x27;s basically an automatic disinformation generator. I think there&#x27;s almost more security value in releasing a document like that with faked interpolated text standing in for redacted sections, and then a few blacked out sections to add to intrigue and credibility, than in doing a regular redacted document...but maybe there&#x27;s benefits of the old way I don&#x27;t understand. Not sure if I got what you were saying there, but I think I got your meaning correctly.')
