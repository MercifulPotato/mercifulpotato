This is not how chemistry&#x2F;biology works.<p>I don&#x27;t know if you can really digest DNA and get calories out of it, but the thing is, methamphetamine and MDMA both bind to the serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake transporters and produce release of monoamines. I would bet you that they are also deactivated by the same enzymes, etc. It&#x27;s not a coincidence. They behave similarly because they are (very) similar molecules. Not all molecules that are similar behave similarly, but they often do. That shouldn&#x27;t be so surprising if you have a background in chemistry.<p>&gt; the pure MDMA effects are not well suited for partying.<p>I know many people who party on pure MDMA. The effect varies from person to person. Some people find pure MDMA very relaxing, others find it very stimulating.<p>&gt; People are chasing the intense party life vastly enhanced by drugs, not exactly the drugs themselves.<p>As someone who has experienced this first hand, I would say that things are muddier than you think. Stimulants affect your reward pathways. They slowly change your behavior so that you can get that dopamine hit again. It can sneak up on you without you really realizing. You think you love partying, but at some point, you might just realize, you have a lot of friends who do drugs, and you&#x27;ve gradually restructured your life so that you can do drugs more often.<p>&gt; Many MDMA addicts limit their consume to the weekend and suffer through the boringness of work week; usually it doesn&#x27;t spiral out of control like with other drugs. For most people it&#x27;s not a every day kind of stimulant drug like cocaine, amphetamine or meth.<p>I think there&#x27;s two aspects to this:<p>1. MDMA depletes serotonin reserves. If you abuse it during the weekend, you get diminishing returns. It&#x27;s kind of self-limiting in that way. With cocaine and amphetamine, you can increase the dose and keep getting a strong euphoric effect, you can push things much farther, go on binges that last several days without sleeping.<p>2. The culture is different. There&#x27;s a whole subculture of people who party on weekends. That subculture is different from that of meth users. Most of the people who can afford to go out to parties and clubs have day jobs and lives outside of partying. Most people are disciplined enough to throw their lives away and use drugs with some amount of moderation. I also know many people who manage to take cocaine, ketamine and speed on weekends and live a pretty normal life the rest of the time.<p>People who take meth are often poor, even homeless and in dire circumstances. They&#x27;re looking to maximize cost-efficiency, get the best bang for their buck in terms of getting a high, which is why they inject or smoke it. Kind of like an alcoholic might go for drinking pure, cheap whisky. People do that because they are desperate and hopeless :(')
