I just don&#x27;t have any USB-C stuff myself (aside from the aforementioned MBP).  My phones have all been lightning &lt;-&gt; USB-A for the last decade or so.<p>My wife does have a Nintendo Switch, so there&#x27;s that.  (IIRC, the Nintendo Switch&#x27;s USB-C is non-standard?  I might be misremembering.)  I don&#x27;t think I could use it as a phone charger on a regular basis, just for logistical reasons.')
