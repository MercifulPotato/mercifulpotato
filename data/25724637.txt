I had switched jobs with options that would expire 90d after I left.  So I exercised them &amp; put a decent chunk of change in the S&amp;P500 somewhere in late summer.<p>Of course, this was just before the &#x27;08 crash, and over the next few months I watched as my investment was cut in half.  I didn&#x27;t see, but I hold off investing more.  My only regret?  Not investing more.<p>Earlier this year, after COIVD hit, a lot of friends started to sell.  It was obviously too late to avoid the initial damage, but would avoid any further losses.<p>Me, I just kept buying.  I vest stock from my employer monthly &amp; the proceeds go to the S&amp;P500.  I&#x27;d be doing it for years, and having learned my lesson in 2008, I stayed the course.  I had no idea what would happen.  I was fully aware the market could drop further in late 2020.  But since my time horizon is a bit out there, I figured I&#x27;d be able to recover.<p>It ended up a pretty good year for me, whereas not-so-great for my friends.')
