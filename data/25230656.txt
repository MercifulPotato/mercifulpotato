Item(by='Macha', descendants=None, kids=[25231253], score=None, time=1606498311, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25229883, text='&gt; When using Tor, Google switches the CAPTCHA to the more strict &quot;9 pictures&quot; (or even the &quot;endless pictures with delay on each&quot;) version. The rule of &quot;If there is none, click skip&quot; no longer applies. In this version, when Google misidentifies something as the object and you are not selecting it, the answer is wrong because Google thinks you are not selecting all answers. You must guess which one is the misidentified object and select it.<p>Even using Firefox with an adblocker is enough to trigger this one. Worse still is when you then go on to fail whatever the rate limited action is (maybe a forgot password form) and you get sent back to the captcha on the same site in a short interval. Then you get the one with the images fading out and being replaced soo.... slow...ly.....<p>Literally, it takes 30s for an image to fade out and 30s for the next to fade back in and sometimes there can be chains of 3-4 images in the same slot taking up 2-3 minutes for the captcha process. Arguably at that point successfully completion is more likely to indicate ill intent as most actual users will give up and go away.')
