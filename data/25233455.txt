Seems like an odd choice, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem because I keep my date types consistent.<p>It just goes to show that seemingly odd design choices might never end up being a problem.<p>I&#x27;d be fascinated to hear from those who may have had problems with SQLite&#x27;s &quot;flexible&quot; type system.')
