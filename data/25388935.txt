Spend enough time in an ecosystem and you&#x27;ll eventually find a need to interact with most of its features.<p>My experience in Rust has been pretty positive. I&#x27;m writing a new book on systems programming with Rust and, as a result, have spent a great deal of time digging into the internals of libraries, the compiler. The compiler is, by far, the most surprising because it&#x27;s allowed to use nightly features in new and interesting ways. Everything else, when I encounter something new to me, I&#x27;m able to understand from the Rust documentation. The key differentiator with C++ is, I think, the focus on documentation and ensuring that new features are explainable in a simplistic way. This helps make new features introduced into the language jive, to my eye.<p>That said, there are areas of the ecosystem _outside_ the language that are hard to keep up with. The future notion in Rust used to be like that, before Future was included in the base language. That&#x27;s tricky but, again, I think Rust strikes a good balance here: conservative about content in the base language, enthusiastic experimentation in the ecosystem. It&#x27;s possible that this&#x27;ll break down some day but it hasn&#x27;t yet and I don&#x27;t see it as happening soon.')
