Item(by='jug', descendants=None, kids=[25441961], score=None, time=1608118933, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25434638, text='Strange how neither Periscope nor Vine, both getting pretty popular early on (lots of celebrities used Vine and Twitter were getting quite some traction) are now no more. Meanwhile Musicaly&#x2F;TikTok did the basically same once more, and what do you know, there was a demand all along. Twitter could have been running &quot;today&#x27;s TikTok&quot; and it&#x27;s an incredible blunder.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why Twitter abandoned Vine but I think it had to do with feed moderation, that they didn&#x27;t have the resources and infrastructure in place to moderate illegal content. At least there were some noise over underage porn trying to dodge filters and banned keywords in media some time before they pulled the plug. If so, that reeks of misunderstanding the potential and not just throwing cash at the problem. They obviously have what&#x27;s necessary in place over at Twitter.com and they aren&#x27;t novices at this, so just... why. I remember seeing everyone from Game of Thrones cast members to comedians to just random people being enthusiastic over it. They were sitting on a gold mine and didn&#x27;t even fight.<p>Periscope was also cool in a different way. I could click on a map at some person in Scandinavia and see her live stream stuff as she was talking a walk on the snow clad streets.')
