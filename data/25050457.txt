Also, there are OSS GUI libraries not from Microsoft.<p>Frankly, at this point native, cross-platform GUIs are a niche. I used to write a lot of Windows-only GUIs (mostly WinForms, some WPF), but haven&#x27;t written a desktop GUI for around 10 years now. If I was to now, I&#x27;d try one of those aforementioned OSS libs, or maybe use Electron. I know Electon gets a lot of hate on HN, but VS Code shows it&#x27;s possible to do well.<p>Not sure if you meant it that way, but accusations of shilling are forbidden here on HN. I&#x27;ve no affiliation with Microsoft, I&#x27;m just a long-time, dotnet developer that loves C# and the ecosystem.')
