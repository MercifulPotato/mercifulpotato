Names should be meaningful and distinguish the named object from other things that could go in the same place, but &quot;t&quot; is meaningless and there&#x27;s often nothing else (no other types anyway) for it to distinguish itself from. It feels like a hack, and I much prefer the mainstream dot notation.')
