You can be great at your job but still have fewer opportunities because of how you&#x27;re perceived by the majority group.<p>Getting the hiring biases out of the way early makes sense to me. The downside is that this doesn&#x27;t change the broader situation or challenge it in anyway. It just says: &quot;go ahead and apply your biases if you have them&quot;. It think, in some ways, this practice could make things a lot worse overall. It allows companies to massage their diversity metrics in ways that are acceptable and not at all challenging to the notion of what &quot;acceptable diversity&quot; looks like.')
