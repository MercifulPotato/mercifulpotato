And then use a cheap 1.5KW chinese spindle with an ER20 collet system. All the parts are designed to go together, and the VFD gives you speed control. It is quieter, more powerful, and the whole apparatus is much nicer to use. Once you&#x27;ve used spindles, you&#x27;ll really only use routers for handheld tasks.')
