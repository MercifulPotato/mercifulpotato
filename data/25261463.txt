That said, all the trials (at least in phase 1&#x2F;2) are also looking at antibody levels[1][2], which would indicate less likelihood of transmission.<p>Remember, all these vaccines aren&#x27;t yet applying for full approval, but an EUA (Emergency Use Authorization).  I fully expect that the FDA would want to see data on transmission before full approval; but that is harder to acquire, so it makes sense they wouldn&#x27;t wait for that specific data.<p>As someone in the AZD12222 (AstraZeneca&#x2F;Oxford) trial, I can confirm that they are following all participants for a full 2 years.  In this time (versus the ~3 months each Phase 3 \n trial has run for), there will be much more time to see if these vaccines prevent transmission, not just prevent symptoms.<p>With all that said, many thousands of live will be saved by getting these vaccines out now, even if they are only partially effective.  After all, someone who can&#x27;t get sick can return to a more normal life, since they won&#x27;t have issues if they were to get SARS-COV-2 infection later on.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;biology.mit.edu&#x2F;undergraduate&#x2F;current-students&#x2F;subject-offerings&#x2F;covid-19-sars-cov-2-and-the-pandemic&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;biology.mit.edu&#x2F;undergraduate&#x2F;current-students&#x2F;subje...</a> [Lecture 10, with a NIH researcher who worked on the Moderna vaccine]<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6736(20)32466-1&#x2F;fulltext#fig5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6...</a> [Phase 2&#x2F;3 study of AstraZeneca vaccine, figure shows neutralizing antibody levels]')
