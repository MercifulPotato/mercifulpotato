There’s an assumption in articles like this that you even want to work for said FAANG company. Additionally, these posts assume a one-way interview process, which is a sure fire way to end up places you don’t want to be. Jump through all the hoops like a good little show pony, then maybe if you’re good enough, you get an offer and... what? Congrats, now you work for a terrible organization at a level where you’ll never be able to affect real change - you’re a literal cog. Bravo.<p>Do the research and learning out of a genuine kernel of curiosity and self-betterment, not to whore yourself out to some corporation.')
