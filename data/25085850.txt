Side of egg rolls on Doordash is $10, additional egg roll $2. On menu $6.50 and additional egg roll $1. When I noticed that, I immediately removed the order and called the restaurant directly.<p>The markups for ordering through doordash are ridiculous. I can afford to pay $25 for a burrito, but I&#x27;m not going to do that. That&#x27;s a ridiculous price for being lazy&#x2F;greedy.')
