This whole situation has made me a bit uneasy. While I generally agree with the decision made by these private companies in this specific instance, it does feel like there was a domino effect where one platform banned people for inciting violence, and then the rest followed suit when there was media traction on the story. The fact that a few people have this much unchecked power is a bit scary.<p>Yes, these are private companies. Yes, they don&#x27;t have to spend time, money or infrastructure on anyone they don&#x27;t want on the platform, I understand all of this.<p>What I merely want to comment on is the ubiquity of these websites. Facebook, Google, Twitter and even TikTok are increasingly becoming primary means that people around the world communicate. If I&#x27;m a racist prat that spams that we should &quot;kill all those muslamics, innit&quot;, sure I should be warned or removed from these platforms, however that significantly diminish my means of contacting other people.<p>I have friends that I can only really contact through Facebook. I&#x27;m trying to add them on multiple services so that I stay away from a single-point-of-failure, however some of my relatives are old and&#x2F;or technologically inept, and they never check their email or SMS. While I could call them, if I were to get banned from Facebook that could reduce my ability to communicate with these people down quickly and easily to near zero.<p>I understand that there are actions for your consequences, I just fear that with these services becoming so commonplace (see WeChat in China, for example), being locked out of these walled gardens could have severe, real world impacts to those that the platform doesn&#x27;t like.<p>I don&#x27;t know, just food for thought.')
