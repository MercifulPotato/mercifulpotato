Item(by='chrismorgan', descendants=None, kids=[25934615], score=None, time=1611777101, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25932712, text='Firefox exposes this stuff just fine: its context menu on videos has “View Video”, “Copy Video Location” and “Save Video As…”. (I thought that Chrome did too, but maybe my memory is faulty or maybe they removed it at some point.)<p>But sites can easily prevent all of this stuff from happening by putting something transparent on top of the video, so that you’re not actually right clicking on the video, but on another element.<p>And here’s the thing—there’s a sound <i>technical</i> reason why they all do that, and it’s not just legal nonsense. Those operations only make sense if you’re playing one video file, but as you remark, there are all the various qualities available, and all of these platforms are designed to be able to switch seamlessly between sources, so that the browser never does get told “play this single video file, it’s the whole thing”, but rather “here, play this (1080p) chunk”, then “here, now this (144p) chunk”, then “and now this 360p”—with the JavaScript monitoring everything and trying to make it flow as smoothly as possible at each step.<p>So… no, your browser actually <i>doesn’t</i> know about all of this, and that’s the reason that YouTube and the likes have stopped it from exposing it even in browsers that are otherwise willing to.<p>(You could still easily say that there’s a culture shift in this: in the distant past, the web valued simplicity and openness at the cost of performance and effectiveness; but as the internet went more and more mainstream, more and more developers broke ranks and insisted on unbreaking things for their users and improving performance and effectiveness, even at the cost of openness and simplicity.)')
