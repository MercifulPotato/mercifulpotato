I didn&#x27;t recall <i></i>exactly<i></i> where the trail was, only that it was basically cut into a slope.  Looking down at it I couldn&#x27;t figure out where it would be safe to walk and where I would be risking sliding down the hill.  It <i></i>really<i></i> changes things.<p>Obviously, I could have scraped aside the snow every couple of feet and figured it out but I knew there was a lot more such terrain ahead, it would have been very slow.')
