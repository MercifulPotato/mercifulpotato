It came back with a new motherboard too. Essentially a new machine, and it took two interactions: drop-off and pick up.<p>Last fall I bought two Dell desktops (for a client project) and neither has working Bluetooth&#x2F;WiFi. One machine has been fully out of commission for 2 months and the other is limping along with weak WiFi and no Bluetooth.<p>The Dell is upgradeable and I could put 3rd party cards in there and get along. But they’re brand new machines under warranty. I’ve had two tech visits and traded more than 45 emails with Dell tech support and I’m still waiting on full system replacements that will ship in February sometime. I bought these machines in November.<p>Right to repair or not, I trust Apple non-right-to-repair hardware over Dell “I could repair it myself” desktop hardware.<p>The user experience of dealing with both companies negates the right to repair concern for me, on these right now.')
