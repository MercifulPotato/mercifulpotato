You can still use HTTP&#x2F;1.1 as a server or client. Literally the only reason 1.0 isn’t still usable is IP exhaustion&#x2F;vhosts, and that did not change with HTTP&#x2F;2 or 3. Modern TLS is also a complicated protocol. (If you don’t believe me, I believe google.com will <i>still</i> load in IE 5.5+ with plain old HTTP, albeit in a legacy mode.)<p>Also very confused at how we’re spinning HTTPS as a bad thing now? Cloudflare and Lets Encrypt did significantly more for HTTPS adoption than Google anyways... and it is a bit preposterous that it is somehow being spun as a negative. It’s about security as much as it is about privacy...<p>(I am a Google employee but speaking entirely in a personal capacity. Additionally, I do not work on Chrome or QUIC.)')
