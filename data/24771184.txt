A person could ask for a higher salary saying they are in, or relocating to, the BA, then within a few months, or even days, of joining they move out.<p>Either the person <i>needs</i> to be in the Bay Area for the job, in which case the answer isn&#x27;t &quot;paycut&quot; but &quot;you&#x27;re fired&quot;; OR it doesn&#x27;t matter where they live, so why even go through the COL rigamarole? Just offer the lowest possible amount that will get a qualified person from anywhere in the world into the seat. If your options are &quot;200k for a person in the Bay Area&quot; or &quot;20k for a person from Russia&quot; why would you pay 140k to someone in Kansas?')
