Contemporary debate about diet focuses almost exclusively on aesthetic. But equally or more important is that if you dont eat enough, you wont perform in work due to tiredness and difficulty to focus.  You will loose attention while driving. You will have crappy mood, treating everyone around badly. You will build anemia or whatever and you wont be able to walk fast, do any activity that requires physical movement. Your calorie output will go super down, because you will be constantly tired.<p>&gt;  we didnt evolve to where we are by eating three square meals a day. we ate little and often starved in between while hunting and foraging. and likely had a lot of adrenaline coursing through our bodies.<p>First, obviously, those groups had males, females and children. Not everyone was hunting, because that is literally impossible. Second, the lifespan of those people was shorter then ours. They died younger, oftentimes from diseases that had to do with malnutrition of one kind or another.<p>We already fixed whole range of grave diseases that had to do with lack of nutrients in food.')
