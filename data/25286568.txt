However I Have been banned for:<p>- Calling Trump &quot;White Trash&quot;\n- Suggesting my tax dollars should not be used to fund Israel&#x27;s genocide in Palestine \n- Suggesting that leftist protestors arm themselves for protection against the Proud Boys\n- Suggesting that my tax dollars should not be used to subsidize churches<p>I&#x27;ve probably reported 500 blatantly racist and threatening posts since Traitor Trump took over. Unbelievably racist things including swastikas, threats to kill people, Europa-Identity posts, etc.<p>One was a ycombinator-associated lawyer calling all muslims &quot;Animals who fornicate with their sisters and with donkeys&quot;.<p>None of those people have been banned, none of those posts have been removed.<p>The left-wing bias on Facebook seems to be a helluva lot like the &quot;war on Christmas&quot;. Doesn&#x27;t seem to exist, but I really really wish it did.')
