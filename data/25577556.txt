Item(by='ddevault', descendants=None, kids=[25577762, 25578164], score=None, time=1609294244, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25577066, text='&gt;At what point in the process of making software does proprietary software become unethical?<p>The start.<p>&gt;If I open a restaurant and sell food, but don’t publish my recipes, that isn’t unethical?<p>No - this is also unethical.<p>&gt;If I make software, and I choose to offer it for money but not offer the source, what is unethical about my behavior?<p>If software runs on the user&#x27;s hardware or uses the user&#x27;s data, I have a right to know how it works, to modify it to do something different, and to share those modifications with others. I hold the copyright to those modifications, and I should even be able to sell it to others. The software is just information at that point, and information is inherently valueless - it&#x27;s the creation and distribution of information that costs money. And money itself, remember, is an abstraction for value, not valuable in and of itself. Just because something is a viable business model does not make it ethically agreeable.<p>Note for recipes that restaurants are required to share some information, like ingredient lists and nutritional content. This doesn&#x27;t go far enough, but even at this level of transparency, the food industry is held more accountable than software.')
