So the shell by itself would be pretty useless.<p>This theoretical shell and its family of utilities would all have to emulate terminal emulators by using something of a common library of wrappers around tty functionality. At that point you&#x27;ve re-invented cygwin for your OS of choice. And you&#x27;re going to be running the same kinds of stuff you&#x27;d run in a real terminal emulator.<p>I&#x27;m not being snarky. I gave this kind of thing a lot of thought many years ago when I was thinking of native GUI unix-style shells on Windows.<p>Unless you have a different use case in mind for this shell ?')
