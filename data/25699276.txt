Social media companies have proven that they can and will abuse their moderation powers to suppress free speech.  In this case, it seems that they were emboldened to suppress conservative free speech by the Democratic wins in the 2020 election.  What they don’t understand is that telling nearly 150 million people to shut up and sit down will have profound business consequences for them.<p>As decentralized solutions quickly flourish in response to their suppression efforts, they will learn the hard way that those who abuse their powers eventually lose them - whether the abuser is Donald Trump, Google, or Twitter.
