The most basic one basically just (with knowledge of the language) inserted outputs at function entry&#x2F;exit and branch points (if, else, loops). However, it was a commercial tool that did this for us as part of their suite of tools. I have no idea what the status of open source&#x2F;free tools would have been in 2004 to do the same thing.')
