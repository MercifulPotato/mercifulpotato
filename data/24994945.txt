In fact, it&#x27;s easier to detect people with problems if it&#x27;s legalized, since they lose the incentive to hide the habit and it becomes easier for them to seek help when they feel like it. It&#x27;s also easier for them to come clean and resume a normal life; otherwise, once you&#x27;re tainted with felony, all the incentives are to fall back even worse on substance abuse.<p>If there is one thing we&#x27;ve learnt from the heroin years, is that these things have to be faced in the open, and that addicts are sick people, not bad people. You don&#x27;t send sick people to jail, you send them to a hospital.')
