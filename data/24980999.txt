The biggest value is having good default behavior and how it nudges programmers to favor predictable and composable solutions.<p>There are a million features and defaults in C# that constantly undermine a programmer&#x27;s attempts to create good compositional code.  If you and your team is disciplined enough to avoid falling into the traps, that&#x27;s good.  But a lot of teams are not that disciplined and tend to churn out the same buggy OO code with the same subtle bugs caused by the same default semantics.<p>Also, F# is a pretty powerful language for language nerds. There&#x27;s a reason there are literally half-dozen F# to JavaScript compilers, not to mention Erlang, CUDA, PHP (I know), WASM, etc.<p>Until they start removing features from C# (Maybe something like a strict mode), it will never be F#.')
