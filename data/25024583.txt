I&#x27;m active on social media. I don&#x27;t see what you&#x27;re talking about <i>at all</i>. My feed is constantly being inundated with &quot;We need to make lists of every trump supporter&quot; and similar, but never do I see the supposed ultra-widespread nazi&#x2F;alt-right hate.<p>Trump, for all his flaws, has disavowed white supremacy so many times it hurts to watch and even the most famous &quot;very fine people&quot; quote was [0] taken out of context (if you can call that anything but an outright lie, frankly).<p>The membership of racist organizations like the KKK is small, vanishingly small. It&#x27;s not even .1% of Trumps base. [1] And, more importantly, it&#x27;s shrinking. It has been for a very long time.<p>[1]<i>Despite their diminishing numbers, there are still approximately 3,000 Klan members nationwide, as well an additional but unknown number of associates and supporters. Even with relatively small numbers, groups like the North Carolinabased Loyal White Knights (LWK), perhaps the most active Klan group in the United States today, have a fairly expansive geographical reach. In 2015, with just 150-200 members, they were able to draw attention to themselves in 15 different states (mostly in the south and east), typically through fliering, which requires only a single participant.</i><p>[2][3] It is a matter of public record that Biden supported segregationists, voted against integration-supporting policies like bussing (which Kamala Harris roasted him for repeatedly), and pushed legislation that disproportionately harmed black folks.<p>Ultimately, there&#x27;s plenty of good reasons to dislike Trump that are completely and unarguably valid. Covid, John Bolton, numerous conflicts of interest (like using personal assets for the military and government functions) are a small piece of that. But calling Trump <i>racist</i> or a <i>nazi</i> is just taking the bait that his political opponents have set out.<p>In my personal opinion, Biden is the worse choice for president purely on the basis of his likelihood of supporting additional war efforts (whereas Trump is the first president in 40 years not to start a new war - AND has helped bring about a series of peace treaties in the middle east.)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DZfzJATDmXs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=DZfzJATDmXs</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adl.org&#x2F;education&#x2F;resources&#x2F;reports&#x2F;state-of-the-kkk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.adl.org&#x2F;education&#x2F;resources&#x2F;reports&#x2F;state-of-the...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nymag.com&#x2F;intelligencer&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;joe-biden-record-on-busing-incarceration-racial-justice-democratic-primary-2020-explained.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nymag.com&#x2F;intelligencer&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;joe-biden-record-on-...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;920385802&#x2F;biden-vows-to-ease-racial-divisions-heres-his-record" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;14&#x2F;920385802&#x2F;biden-vows-to-ease-...</a>')
