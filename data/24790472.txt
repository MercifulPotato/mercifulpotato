Item(by='kyuudou', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602779488, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24762449, text='Not bad: INTJ 0.197490\nINTP 0.138727\nINFJ 0.127998\nINFP 0.125142\nENTP 0.091211<p>I consistently score INTP. Another account which I have about 8 years of sometimes voluminous comment history with for non-technical topics produces the same results in the same order. Hmm, maybe I&#x27;m turning into an INTJ with age... Kind of makes sense.<p>Like others, I&#x27;m wondering what the &quot;controversiality&quot; value indicates.<p>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised and slightly uneasy.')
