You made me realize that I have no ability to downvote here because I don&#x27;t have a high enough score. This lets karma whores like yourself bully new users when they say something true that you don&#x27;t like.<p>At this point I decided that HackerNews is just another Reddit with slightly different problems. I wanted to delete my account. Wow! You can&#x27;t do that! Simply amazing. What kind of incompetent makes a website that doesn&#x27;t allow users to control their digital footprint? Count me out of this little experiment. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t post more before finding out.<p>I will not be back to read or comment on this site again. So have fun talking whatever kinds of smack you want to my dead account.')
