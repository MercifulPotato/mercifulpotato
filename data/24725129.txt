No most games do no scale like compilation does. For instances when compiling a large program GNU make lets me the following: make -j 16<p>That will create 16 instances of the compiler each compiling different compilation units. I could even do the following: make -j 128 and that will spawn a 128 processes, and still scale. I can keep scaling this assuming I have enough compilation units (aka files)')
