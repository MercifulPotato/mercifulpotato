I think in that situation it’s even more ambiguous since the “troll power” is so much greater then.<p>I think it’s unambiguous that the user is a shit-stirrer certainly, probably an asshole. But not necessarily racist. Or no more so than your average run of the mill “everyone is racist subconsciously” racist.<p>I think what’s hard is that it’s a negative thing to do that brings more chaos and harm into the world. It could be racist&#x2F;white power that is super bad, let’s say 100 on the bad-o-meter. Or it could be trolling the pearl clutchers that is mildly bad, let’s say 11 on the bad-o-meter. And for scale, punching someone in the face is 200 and murdering someone is 1000.')
