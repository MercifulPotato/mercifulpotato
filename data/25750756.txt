We know this because we&#x27;ve seen it happen over and over.<p>If a site posted links to houses where people were on vacation and discussed best ways to break into them. It would get banned. Nobody would complain.<p>Why is it that a site which is essentially built to allow people to discuss violent crimes against people is supposed to be tolerated? We should tolerate it because it&#x27;s discussing violent crimes against politicians? I don&#x27;t even think it&#x27;s limited to that regardless.<p>Parler was created so people could discuss things which were banned on other sites for being too violent and had too much hate speech. It&#x27;s unofficial charter is based on supporting criminal activities.<p>I don&#x27;t understand why people are acting like this is free speech when so many similar crime-based sites are not tolerated.')
