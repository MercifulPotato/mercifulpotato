We&#x27;re OK with foreigners doing much of the labor for lower wages - as long as they do it overseas, and then ship the products here. However, if you think about it, there would be benefits to having the work be done domestically rather than requiring it be done in other countries. We could lower transportation costs of goods (and the environmental impact on transportation), we could have more flexibility in production, we could keep higher wage jobs associated with the work (management, machinists, R&amp;D), etc. We could also have a more equitable balance of globalization - for instance, right now it&#x27;s easy for a U.S. doctor to benefit from overseas manufacturing workers, but it&#x27;s hard for a U.S. factory worker to benefit from overseas doctors.')
