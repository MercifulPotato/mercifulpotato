Working from home is a godsend for infants and toddlers. Iâ€™m also often thinking what else could I do but the problem is that almost no career is portable like software engineering. There are credentials and local requirements and relationships which are not as important in software.<p>My current thinking is to de-emphasize work for the kid years.
