The reason it&#x27;s illegal to buy certain things in the US (people, organs, drugs, assassinations) is that we all got together and thought people shouldn&#x27;t do that. Many people disagree but, that&#x27;s what voting is for. Subverting the will of a democratic people is... immoral?<p>The typical counterargument is something like &quot;well what about Saudi Arabia&quot;, but I think it&#x27;s pretty easy for an oppressive regime to just say &quot;you can&#x27;t use cryptocurrency&quot; and punish you severely for it--to the degree you won&#x27;t.<p>Anyway, I just don&#x27;t think cryptocurrency is a solution to this, and even if it is it&#x27;s antidemocratic.')
