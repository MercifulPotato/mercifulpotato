My market is starting to develop into this, in large part because of Seattle buyers flooding inland. That said, it is better than some of the alternatives. There are other highly-competitive markets where houses just never come on the market - instead they get sold in pocket listings and the only way to buy a house is to canvas a neighborhood or be in tight with an agent who is farming neighborhoods. It&#x27;s ideal if houses actually come to market, the market can decide the value, and it&#x27;s supply &#x2F; demand that is making it possible for houses to be sold on such a short time-table. It&#x27;s a better dynamic all around though than having houses sit, potentially vacant, for months and months and&#x2F;or increasing the challenges where buyers want to move and may even have a house under offer but can&#x27;t get their current house sold. Liquidity in the housing market is ultimately a good thing for buyers and sellers.')
