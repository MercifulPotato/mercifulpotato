I guess it would be passable in some circumstances, but I can imagine a bunch of reasons why it would be miserable or useless:<p>* the quality drop; recompressing, non-matching frame rates, non-matching resolution--all the same goes for audio. You&#x27;re very likely clipping (losing) data. This is assuming you&#x27;re doing screen-capture. If you&#x27;re literally video taping a monitor you will get moir√© in the video, room tone in the audio, losing any stereo separation, and other audio&#x2F;video artifacts.<p>* performance; must be done in real-time, cannot queue up multiple sources. This is likely the biggest efficiency killer and makes things 100x more labor intensive.<p>* reliable Internet; if you get a blip or have a slow connection you have to hopefully catch it and start over. With youtube-dl you can pause, resume, confirm even on the slowest, spottiest connections.<p>* metadata, organizing, indexing; likely hand-typed separately, prone to error, prone to not knowing if you&#x27;ve done that video already.<p>* Chain of custody; grabbing the original video allows you to prove two identical copies match (using file hashes or other comparisons) screen recording makes that difficult to impossible to confirm--maybe with fancy AI you&#x27;d have to run by the courts?')
