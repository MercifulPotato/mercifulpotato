Indeed, Lisp languages are strongly typed but I&#x27;m sorry, in the real world it doesn&#x27;t help me, I need types, statically checked types.<p>I don&#x27;t know if Lisp, the language, influenced Java and Scala so much, it was more about its runtime, the garbage collector, etc. The only thing that I liked about Lisp is the composabiltiy, and coupled with objects from Simula created my favorite industrial languages, Java and TypeScript. I&#x27;m passionate about parsers, compilers and transformers and this is why I have a fost spot for SML, OCaml. I simply dislike Lisp, interesting language but not for me.')
