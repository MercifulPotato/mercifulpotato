It allows ionized air displacement in all directions depending on electrodes on the ship. So, no air resistance, no sound barrier. It move itself silently, it can move also under water, the same way it moves in the air, by displacing the water around it. It can sustain itself and accelerate in any direction depending on which electrodes are activated and so, to which direction the air is sucked. It would require a great source of energy to surround the ship surface (for something around 20m long in size) by plasma, should require something around 80000 Gauss and 1000 Megawatts for the electrical discharge.')
