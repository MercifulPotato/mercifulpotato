If anything the past four years of democrat reaction to Trump has directly contributed to the situation we&#x27;re in. The failure to acknowledge this simple fact is startling.<p>If you were a Trump supporter who was just called a fascist, racist, bigot, white supremacist, uncle tom, unintelligent rube during the past four years, and you watched as the media, hollywood, elites, and democrat party tried everything possible to undermine your legally elected President, including unmasking of family&#x2F;friends&#x2F;campaign, bogus 2+ year Russia investigation peddled as fact by the pundits 24&#x2F;7 7 days a week, impeachment #1, daily conspiracies of all variety, and I could go on; would you trust the outcome of the election?<p>There were hundreds of sworn affidavits including by democrats and independents, factual things worth investigating if not to simply bring closure to the numerous issues, and the democrats instead not only slammed the door shut, they opened have and continue to deride conservatives &amp; Trump supporters.<p>How on Earth is it not clear why people don&#x27;t trust the election results or even more so how we ended up with 50,000+ people in DC and a small subset ending up inside the Capitol building?<p>To top all of that off, for over 3 months this past summer in multiple cities across the nation, blm&#x2F;antifa threw very often violent protests that were watered down by the media as &quot;mostly peaceful&quot;, despite millions of humans seeing with their own eyes what was happening. People were shot and killed in multiple places, multiple police officers were injured and killed. They tried to storm the White House &amp; Portland Federal building.<p>How can you still claim it&#x27;s all due to just one person? I find it to be total nonsense.<p>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be downvoted for saying the above, but failure to at least recognize what I&#x27;m saying is a colossal mistake. This is what the other side is feeling.')
