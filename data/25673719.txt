Many many people consciously invested. The US govt _already_ has access to every single one of those people’s wealth via existing taxes. Despite that, we have a society with non-zero single moms who can’t pay rent &amp; healthcare.<p>There’s something wrong in our society here, sure. A wealth tax doesn’t seem to address that problem though. Heck, if the US govt could’ve put taxpayer money to  ease off on Model 3 production hell then yes taxing Elon’s gains today would be fair. Otherwise, it’s just unfair, inefficient.')
