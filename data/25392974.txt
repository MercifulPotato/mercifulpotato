The politicians trying to take credit for them as miracle pills have had nothing to do with the research. And most of the people telling you to get vaccinated have had no involvement in the vaccine&#x27;s development.<p>You can think all the people above don&#x27;t work in your best interests. That doesn&#x27;t mean the researchers and scientists developing those things also are.<p>It&#x27;s fucking depressing to see how many people are so readily distrusting just about everything that makes the modern world the most incredible achievement in human history. They&#x27;ll use and abuse every advancement in health care and technology all the while shouting their bloodshot eyes out against 5g, vaccines and whatever scapegoat of the day they decide to pick.')
