I&#x27;d still argue that you don&#x27;t really support something you haven&#x27;t tested against, but I guess this is pretty off topic. My overall point was more that sometimes being locked into a single database is a conscious decision because you want to make use of everything a database has to offer.<p>In the context of the article, for &quot;Forcing Functions&quot;, I absolutely agree that switching databases is a useful way to find weakness in your solution.')
