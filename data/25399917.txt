I would have thought that confirming you&#x27;ve seen something that no-one else on the planet has would be a somewhat difficult task. I wonder if there&#x27;s like a world-recognized central database where this morphology and acoustics data of all species are organized for easy comparison.<p>&gt; These samples were taken as eDNA - a new, fancy technique in which gallons of the surrounding water is captured and filtered for bits of DNA which can then be cross-checked against the DNA of known species.<p>Also pretty cool. I didn&#x27;t expect them to leave so many pieces of themselves in their wake for something like this to be possible.')
