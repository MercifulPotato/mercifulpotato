They also had Logo and possibly other languages. Logo is an interesting alternative to BASIC since it&#x27;s beginner-friendly. Microsoft (and other companies such as Digital Research et al.) supplied a number of languages other than BASIC (Pascal, Fortran, COBOL...) but they typically required more resources and were less novice-friendly.<p>BASIC worked out of ROM and a few kilobytes of RAM, and was easy to learn.<p>As you note, Turbo Pascal - a nice environment with a fast one-pass compiler - came out later. It does seem to have had a cassette version at some point, but it required more RAM than BASIC and was harder to learn. Nonetheless it was highly successful and its descendant Delphi is still used today.<p>It&#x27;s hard to get Scheme to run in a few kilobytes, but it would be fun to try. Primitive LISPs did seem to exist on microcomputers but only gave you a few atoms and cons cells because of memory limits.<p>COMAL was largely based on BASIC but never caught on as widely.<p>In any case, I don&#x27;t think Microsoft gets the credit or the blame for BBC BASIC. (There were also versions of microcomputer BASICs from companies other than Microsoft, dating to the early 1970s.)<p>disclaimer: I&#x27;ve only seen it running in an emulator like the BBC Micro bot; it looks cool though. ;-)')
