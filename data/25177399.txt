You can do this by turning on location tracking (this is something apple mandated) which probably turns on the GPS RF amplifier and is one of the fastest ways to drain the battery. I&#x27;ve had the phone shut down while charging leaving the GPS running with another CPU intensive app before (Spotify I think.)<p>But on the iPad this is just about the only choice.')
