It&#x27;s already better than Slack for personal use cases IMO.<p>I hope they monetize in that direction rather than ads (Discord seems to still be pretty reliant on VC funding, which makes sense to me since Nitro is pretty cheap and not particularly necessary to use the product) — it seems less soul-eating. They&#x27;ve been dialing back the gamer branding at least, which could help reach a broader audience.')
