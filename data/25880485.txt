Item(by='wolverine876', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611387917, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25865062, text='It seems intellectually dishonest to me:<p>The job of every news organization is to obtain and publicize otherwise unavailable information, often information that some people want to keep hidden. Someone desiring to withhold the information is the norm, not a reason to make an exception. A journalist&#x27;s obligation is to their readers. Withholding the identity of a public figure - especially someone who actively attempts to be an influential public figure - is not in their readers&#x27; interests. Their job is to inform readers. There is nothing unusual about identifying public figures; it&#x27;s valuable to the public to know who is behind public actions. If the author is as intelligent and informed as he presents himself to be, he knows that.<p>It&#x27;s nothing like doxxing, the author knows it, and so do HN readers. The NYT wasn&#x27;t going to provide his home address and social security number. It&#x27;s dishonest of the author to say otherwise.<p>To make a massive public stink about the article would of course just inflate his own public profile and spread his name further. Again, if he is the smart person he claims to be, he knows it and did it intentionally. Everyone on HN would know it. It&#x27;s dishonest to act surprised, but fits the pattern of this sort of manipulative rhetoric - both play the victim and increase your public profile.<p>It&#x27;s also well-known that powerful people in Silicon Valley are actively engaged in a power play against the news media, also attempting to discredit it. I&#x27;m confident that the author knows that very well and knows that his actions will play a part in it. To ignore that is not honest; to claim it is coincidence seems hard to believe. (Also, the news media is a critical part of democracy and an open society; it&#x27;s not clear the good of society, rather than the narrow interests of powerful people in SV, is on his mind.)<p>Most of this claims are unverified and he offers no evidence. There&#x27;s no reason I should trust him, especially given the dishonesty I already see.<p>Finally, playing the victim card is a strong signal, IMHO, of an attempt to manipulate.')
