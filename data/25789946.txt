Players can download a copy of the Rules\nEngine and ask it to generate cards, then they can choose the cards they want to\nmake physical copies of. The game is played with the player-created physical\ncopies of the cards generated by the rules engine. The Rules Engine is a free\ndownload and the total cost of playing the game is the cost of the materials for\nthe physical cards. There is no possibility for anything like microtransactions.<p>Players can &quot;register&quot; cards generated by the Rules Engine with the community of\nplayers. Once a card is registered, it can be used for &quot;official&quot; games.\nOfficial games count towards players&#x27; <i>standing</i>, a karma-like metric that\nmeasures their influence on the game. Players also gain standing when their card\ndesigns (i.e. the art they create for physical cards) is appreciated by other\nplayers. Standing is calculated so that being good at the game and creating\nbeautiful art for physical cards increase a player&#x27;s standing by equal measures.<p>Players with higher standing can eventually make decisions about the nature of\nthe game, e.g. they can change rules, change or ban cards, change the amount of\nstanding earned for various reasons and so on. The only person who is allowed to\nchange the code of the Rules Engine is, well, me. As the creator of the game I\nhave veto power over any decision I think will harm the game. On the other hand,\nI have no power to make any decisions on my own- I can&#x27;t change rules, ban\ncards, etc. I am only the Maintainer of the Engine.<p>The source of the Rules Engine is kept under a proprietary license, to make it\nharder for people dissatisfied with decisions of high-standing players (or the\nMaintainer) from endlessly forking the project, causing the community to\nfragment into camps playing mutually incompatible clone-games, a situation that\nI believe would be detrimental to the game. Players remain free to create\nwhatever physical cards they like without invoking the Rules Engine and to play\na game with whomever accepts to play with them. However, the intention is to\nhave a &quot;core&quot; game that is the same for all.<p>The game is associated with a decentralised online marketplace where players can\nsell their card designs in exchange for standing, or real money.<p>This is a long-term project. I&#x27;ve been working on and off on this idea for a few\nyears now.<p>Oh and I&#x27;m also doing some research for my PhD of course. But that&#x27;s of no\ninterest to anyone :)')
