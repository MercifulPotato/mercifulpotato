It sounds like you have worked with a succession of terrible people if this is your impression of code review or team communication, so I can certainly understand that would have an effect on your ideas.<p>I&#x27;ve encountered this sort of team before â€“ the high-functioning jealously-protected team that&#x27;s isolated from outside interaction and visibility. They usually produce absolutely wonderful high-quality software that is useless and meets none of the requirements that other teams have of them.<p>In fact, I&#x27;d say that well-functioning teams will usually themselves develop a system of code reviews or similar, along with using task-tracking software, regularly seeking influences from the outside stakeholders, and making sure work is visible to other teams. A good manager supports those interactions and helps to make sure everyone has the resources they need to work effectively.')
