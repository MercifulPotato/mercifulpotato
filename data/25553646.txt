Contrast it with your typical highway overpass.<p>The same thing applies to the aqueducts, by the way. Sure, they were engineering projects, but they were constructed with an eye towards elegance and beauty.<p>Want to see a purely utilitarian aqueduct? Look up the Acqua Felice, built to restore Rome&#x27;s water supply in the 16th century after a thousand years of interruption. Sure, it did the job, but it&#x27;s much uglier than the old Roman aqueduct right next to it.<p>Now, modern buildings aren&#x27;t just ugly because they focus entirely on function (like the Acqua Felice) -- they&#x27;re intentionally and deliberately ugly and inhuman. Modern architecture is awful.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.romeartlover.it&#x2F;Furba14.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.romeartlover.it&#x2F;Furba14.jpg</a>')
