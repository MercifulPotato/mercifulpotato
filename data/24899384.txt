I recall at the run up to the 2016 election, one of the main issues was gender and public bathroom usage. I couldn&#x27;t help wondering at the time why that issue received so much attention vs. the 42,000 opioid overdose fatalities that year alone, which got virtually zero attention.<p>One factor in that is America is a pretty unequal society, and problems the relatively wealthy [1] face receive disproportionate attention than those primarily confined to the less wealthy.  Not saying that&#x27;s the only factor, but it&#x27;s definitely a major one.<p>Ditto with de-industrialization, which a sibling comment mentioned.  The relatively wealthy gain disproportionately from it in the short term, and those who are disproportionately hurt by it are less wealthy and typically live in unfashionable areas.  Predictably, their problems get relatively less attention than they probably should (esp. since the relatively wealthy have the option of hand-waving those problems away with stuff like &quot;Pareto efficiency,&quot; etc.).<p>[1] I&#x27;d count software engineers and similar professionals as &quot;relatively wealthy.&quot;')
