Periodic reinforcement and having a video based &#x2F; more interactive guide than just an embedded gdoc would all be super useful in helping kids learn faster and get to a competitive level quicker ... but with that said, Corewars is not a great game to start teaching kids with limited coding experience by any means. It&#x27;s too hard to pick up - other games would serve this purpose much better. \nHowever, if we ever hop back into the edtech space, we&#x27;d certainly be interested in chatting with you at some point :) Cheers')
