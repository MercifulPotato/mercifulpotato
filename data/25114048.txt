Ultimately I prefer the more information that we can get on politicians available.<p>It seems to me that especially when an elected official has something they don&#x27;t want others to know about that it should be public knowledge.<p>After all an efficient marketplace only is efficient if all actors have access to as much information as possible.<p>EDIT: As a follow up, several people point out that it could happen to me or a family member, but this seems even further reason to have DKIM so that if someone attempts to blackmail me based on the contents of my email, checking the DKIM signature makes it even easier to disprove a bad blackmail attempt.')
