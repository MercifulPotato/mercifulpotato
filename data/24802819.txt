In my opinion Colorado is much more beautiful, Boulder has a lot of the advantages of living in a big city but also so many fewer disadvantages. Personally I’m not a big fan of the kind of nature of the bay area has to offer. I grew up in the Northeast and the southeast, and I miss the huge deciduous trees and the fall-time colors. The Bay Area is pretty, but doesn’t hold a candle to the beauty of Michigan or Colorado or Tahoe in my opinion. Obviously different people have different preferences, but for every person who believes the bay area is the perfect place to live regardless of their career, there’s at least another person who doesn’t particularly like it and has their own idea of a perfect place to live.')
