After a while it becomes a chore to manage, and I usually end up thinking that I&#x27;d rather enjoy programming instead. Which after spending a work day doing at my day job, I rarely have the motivation to do in my spare time, and when I do, I&#x27;d rather invest it on side projects than on Factorio.<p>Still, it&#x27;s one of the greatest games ever made, and the thrill of watching it all work when it does work is exhilirating, much like programming. :)')
