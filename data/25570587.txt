Usually you hear the whirr of the drone and look around, there&#x27;ll be somebody standing nearby with a massively conspicuous radio controller.<p>It&#x27;s already illegal to fly drones outside of line-of-sight of the operator, and once they start getting big enough (&gt;250g) to allow a longer flight time, the operator is also required to have a spotter, a license and register the drone with the government (USA). The new rules mentioned in the article also directly try to address this with remote ID - the idea is that it&#x27;s a &quot;digital license plate&quot; which must be openly broadcast from all drones &gt; 250g. So if you see a drone doing something illegal (eg no operator within line of sight), it should be trivial to report it and for the operator to face consequences.<p>My point about Harleys was that of precedence - we already live in a very noisy world where it&#x27;s perfectly acceptable to buy&#x2F;modify incredibly loud machines (louder than drones by a lot) for primarily entertainment purposes, to be used in public or residential areas. My leaf blower literally makes more noise than my drone and usually runs for 10x as long, to say nothing of a multi-stage gas-powered snowblower. My point here is that things are loud, and drones aren&#x27;t even close to the loudest things we already find totally acceptable, so it feels arbitrary to ban them over noise concerns. For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m totally on board with restricting night-flying for noise reasons, I just don&#x27;t think we need additional laws beyond existing noise ordinance for daytime flying.<p>Finally, if you&#x27;re feeling very paranoid about this from a camera&#x2F;anonymity perspective today (TFA says the new rules have ~30 months before coming into effect), most drones broadcast their video feed on analog channels, so you can buy a $10 receiver that&#x27;ll plug into any modern smartphone and you can see exactly what the drone sees. That should lead you back to the operator if necessary (bonus points if you record your screen for evidence of any wrongdoing).')
