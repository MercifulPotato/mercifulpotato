Best case, you get a huge speed up if everything fits in the high-speed RAM, worst case, you fall back to the &quot;old&quot; RAM.<p>Side note, while Apple charges ridiculous prices for their upgrades, Mac Pros are actually some of the more &quot;&quot;reasonably priced&quot;&quot; computers comparatively. I&#x27;ve looked at HP and Lenovo&#x27;s equiv. workstations, and you pretty much get screwed by everyone at that scale.<p>My desktop can take up to dual 128 GB sticks but one stick costs over $1,000, so I&#x27;m stuck with my 32 GB stick :(<p>... OTOH, it&#x27;s pretty insane you can get 128GB of RAM for $1,000 nowadays. I remember when 8GB was a lot and cost several hundred. Time and miniaturization go on I guess...')
