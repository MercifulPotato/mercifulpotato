The right isn&#x27;t a unified block.<p>There are traditonal conservatives: god, guns, limited government. Mitch McConnell, David French, Mitt Romney, Charlotte Lawson. I fundamentally have different values from these people, but their perspectives are useful, enlightening, and reading their viewpoints causes me to better defend my own, or even occasionally change. They are staunch defenders of individual rights and traditional liberty.<p>There are libertarians on the right. Rand Paul, Spike Cohen, Justin Amash. These people I share a surprising number of values with, but fundamentally disagree with on the conclusion. Due to an inherent argumentativeness, it&#x27;s hard to get a good faith debate, but I acknowledge their opinions that the government uses its power poorly, that both political parties are primarily concerned with remaining in power, and so on.<p>And then there&#x27;s the group who wear t-shirts with &quot;Camp Auschwitz 2021&quot;, &quot;6 million wasn&#x27;t enough&quot;. Signs that say &quot;Q Sent Me&quot;. Hats with &quot;Make America Great Again&quot;. These people are absolutely racist neo-nazis. These people are pretending to believe that Italians stole the election. There&#x27;s no true belief here, no fundamentally held tenant other than &quot;my side is better&quot;.
