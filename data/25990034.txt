Or, don&#x27;t buy silver because that&#x27;s a distraction from the real manipulation!<p>Who do you believe? I&#x27;m no stranger to conspiracy theories and my fear is that the WSB community is getting swept up in conspiratorial thinking. Sadly, with billions and billions of dollars at stake there probably <i>is</i> market manipulation happening, so the paranoid will feel vindicated when some manipulation is eventually discovered and acted upon - see the recent $GME situation. But there&#x27;s going to be a massive false-positive rate on manipulation claims. I don&#x27;t see things ending well for the average person getting swept up in this frenzy.')
