I understand it to be pretty ethnocentric. At most it would support unifying Korea. But I don&#x27;t see it trying to expand outside &quot;the homeland&quot;. You might see import substitution, less-open borders, restrictions on foreigners, stuff like that. If Korea had some grand historical claims I could see it going irredentist, but I don&#x27;t think those claims exist.')
