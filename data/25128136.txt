If I publish a novel about a magical wizard who can control things with his mind, flies around the galaxy in a spaceship shaped like an X, carries a laser sword, and battles his cyborg father who wears all black, I bet I would get a call from Disney&#x27;s lawyers.  That is because my work could be deemed substantially similar to Disney&#x27;s IP even if it is a different expression.')
