So anyone who can&#x27;t use 6 but relies on the open-source version now isn&#x27;t getting patches.<p>Qt company would like to pretend that is forever (and thus doesn&#x27;t mention it), but actually the community contract (which exists to prevent Qt company from ever keeping parts of core Qt closed) forces them to release the patches after one year, because withholding <i>any</i> patches to core Qt for more than a year triggers a safeguard clause in that contract that forces relicensing of Qt.<p>FWIW, your tone does not feel appropriate, especially when you suggest &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;.')
