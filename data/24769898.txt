Historically most people spent far more time outside than we do now.<p>Unfortunately if that is true, the only reliable way to get the dosing right without expensive testing would probably be sun exposure, which many people simply aren&#x27;t going to get with modern lifestyles. There&#x27;s also no evolutionary reason why there couldn&#x27;t be an inherent trade-off between Vitamin D and UV-related skin damage&#x2F;skin cancer: evolution tends towards &quot;good enough&quot; rather than &quot;perfect&quot;.')
