Item(by='bart_spoon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601908235, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24685690, text='&gt; If anything my guess is that once they figured out the battery problem so they can go on bigger courses, they will introduce electric vehicles in the Formula 1 and start phasing out Formula E.<p>Someone correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but I believe Formula E has an exclusive contract with the FIA to be the only series that uses fully electric vehicles until 2039. Formula 1 could only switch to electric vehicles with permission from Formula E, or through some kind of merger. If anything it seems more likely that Formula 1 is the one that gets phased out.')
