Is it the same in languages like haskell or ocaml? (haven&#x27;t used them in any significant way)<p>As for clojure, it&#x27;s described as a &quot;data-driven programming&quot;, which is almost as important as it&#x27;s FP designation. I think it&#x27;s that data-driven part that brings a lot of the benefits you&#x27;re talking about.')
