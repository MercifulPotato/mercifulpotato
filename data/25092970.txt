After seeing the UI comparison of Catalina and Big Sur, the decision is easy. My next laptop will be a ThinkPad.<p>I switched to Mac around 2001 when OS X was first released. I made the switch so that I could run OS X. I have witnessed a continual decline in it. I stopped my OS upgrades with Mojave because I didn&#x27;t want to lose the ability to run Adobe PhotoShop CS4 and Microsoft Office 2011 (both 32-bit).<p>I can&#x27;t stand washed-out (overly white) UIs. Add a bunch of unused real-estate and it&#x27;s especially maddening. Throw in cartoonish icons and coloring and I&#x27;m out of here. The dumbing down of the OS has crossed my level of tolerance.<p>If it were possible to run alternate OSs on M1, I&#x27;d seriously consider it. I&#x27;m done with OSX&#x2F;macOS.')
