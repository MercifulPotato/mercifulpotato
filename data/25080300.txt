You are just trying to pretend it is because the current solutions do not fit your particular worldview or cause you some temporary inconvenience.<p>&gt; Covid is barely worse than the average flu for healthy young people,<p>Not true.  We are really starting to understand the long-term consequences of even &#x27;light&#x27; covid cases so I have absolutely no idea why you thought you were going to be able to float this particular lie past us.<p>&gt; yet even those with no contact with at-risk groups must still disrupt their lives for seemingly no reason.<p>Because the people they interact with may have contact with at-risk groups.  This is epidemiology 101, limit transmission paths to slow down a disease.<p>&gt; IMO this is unfair to them and also prevents herd immunity from developing.<p>It is becoming pretty clear that &#x27;herd immunity&#x27; is going to be hard to develop without some widespread vaccination.<p>&gt; Furthermore outbreaks are happening in places even with more strict protocols.<p>But places with strict protocols are doing a lot better than those without.<p>&gt; Overall I think the damage from the reaction to the pandemic is worse than the disease itself.<p>Demonstrably false.  It is quite telling that you and all of the other anti-lockdown people are no longer trying to tell us that Sweden is the model to follow.  Over the past month it has become obvious that Sweden really fucked up badly and their choice to not lockdown is leading to a huge second wave while their neighbors are cruising along at almost no cases&#x2F;deaths.')
