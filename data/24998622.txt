That&#x27;s what most people do anyway. This is for me the most overlooked problem with privacy. If you have your life out in the open then everyone who has an interest in you can tell you the things you expect to hear without knowing whether they&#x27;re genuine or just stalking you. It&#x27;s much easier to flirt someone if you know what movies&#x2F;music&#x2F;books she likes, what bars&#x2F;cafes she visits, what&#x27;s her political view etc. And this creates a culture of vultures who fake their identities all the time.<p>Furthermore, I implore anyone who thinks that online dating is easy to create a fake profile with a photo of a semi attractive woman as a test. You get flooded with thousands of requests in no time. I tried it on Facebook and I reached the 5.000 friends limit in just four days. There&#x27;s no way anyone can reach out and flirt in this mess. You become irrelevant in the noise.')
