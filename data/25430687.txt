And even if he did actually mist himself with COVID he&#x27;d also likely be criticized by the research and science community and potentially forced out of his position for taking that risk as the CEO of a publicly traded company.<p>IMO -- his best bet was to not take it immediately, wait until front line health care workers have received their vaccine (e.g. in the U.S) and take his when consumers have access to it based on his age&#x2F;risk profile.  This way he can point to it and say, I didn&#x27;t use my seat as CEO to take away from those who needed it most, but I got in line as soon as people my age&#x2F;condition were allowed.  Historically this will look good on paper, and the criticism of him wouldn&#x27;t last longer than a couple of news cycles.')
