You can’t work only five hours a day _and_ still “give a shit”, according to the article.<p>Sounds like someone full of himself. I’m never going to work more than 8 hours a day for a company, preferably less even. I still get more stuff done in those hours that I do work.<p>I care a lot about what I do, but I’m not going to destroy myself or my life for someone else’s company.
