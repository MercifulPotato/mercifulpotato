Item(by='floatingatoll', descendants=None, kids=[25309837], score=None, time=1607122422, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25308511, text='As I tried to note in the final paragraph (I would clarify in hindsight), I&#x27;m not trying to say exactly why Hsieh fell â€” I&#x27;m trying to warn others who might fall in a predictable (to me) manner, by drawing parallels to elements that are familiar from Hsieh&#x27;s story.<p>Two or three of those I&#x27;ve seen fall are exact fits for &quot;I went from working hundred hour weeks to quasi-retirement&quot;, and they did not treat their burnout with the respect and healing I feel it requires. When they took away the overwork, the unhealed burnout smoldered and eventually caught fire and burned them, weeks or months later.<p>Is this what took down Hsieh? I haven&#x27;t a clue, and it&#x27;s unlikely I&#x27;ll ever know, and I certainly don&#x27;t intend to bother anyone to learn more about his circumstance. His friends are having a bad enough time as it is and I empathize too strongly to press for more knowledge.<p>Is Hsieh&#x27;s story familiar from personal experience? Yes, absolutely. In the couple of press articles I&#x27;ve read, and a couple of quotes from a letter from a friend to him in one of them, there is certainly material enough to <i>remind</i> me of others I&#x27;ve known who worked themselves to the bone, sold it all and rested, and then a while later (a few months to a couple years) self-destructed.')
