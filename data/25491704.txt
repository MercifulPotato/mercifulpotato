When the temperature does rise above 100Â°C, that means there is no liquid left in the cooker, and so rice must be done. It then switches off the high heat and runs in &quot;warm&quot; mode.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RSTNhvDGbYI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=RSTNhvDGbYI</a>')
