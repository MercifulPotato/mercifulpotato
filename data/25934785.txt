Starting a fire in the cold is quite a bit harder.  Mostly because if it’s cold, then it’s the middle of winter, and that means the kindling is covered with ice and snow, which has to be melted and evaporated off.  A dry log has a lot of potential energy in it.  A frozen log full of water and snow has zero or even negative potential energy, as in, even if you get it to burn it might take more heat out of the fire because of the ice than it adds back by burning.<p>But, that might not apply to peat fires because 1) larger, hotter fires make more efficient use of fuel, especially if they are in some insulated space where all the heat is not going straight into the atmosphere and 2) the peat might be dry.')
