You link bomb.<p>Ideally you have a cache of extremely long messages where you selectively quote small sections of sources, out of context, that seemingly prove your point but on careful reads are unrelated or actually contradict.<p>But there&#x27;s ten or fifteen &quot;sources&quot; and by the time you read through the post, all the articles posted, and form a coherent argument contradicting it, they&#x27;ve already posted a bunch of other places and&#x2F;or the thread has moved on.<p>That&#x27;s the ideal case where you&#x27;re inclined to waste 20 minutes arguing agaisnt a comment on the internet and there isn&#x27;t a mix of legitimate sources with total bull shit sources forcing you to do a secondary hop to prove a point agaisnt the fake source.')
