The xpenology people flat out lie about this and point to that sourceforge project which is just the gpl bits.  The parts they are copying and installing are not free software<p>The xpenology people claim it is an &quot;open source alternative&quot; to synology.  It is not. They are lying.  They are just hacking at it until it runs unlicensed on non synology hardware.<p>Is OS X free software?  If you hack up an open source bootloader that lets OS X run on non apple hardware does that magically make OS X free and open source?<p>This is not complicated.  If you are using xpenology you are pirating software.  If you are relying on xpenology to store important data you are a fucking idiot.')
