Though I exist in a bubble as everyone else. Age with internet chatting is interesting because no matter how old you are, there is actually a finite amount of experience anyone alive today could have with it. There&#x27;s a large age block that irrespective of the individual age probably have about the same level of experience with chat (i.e. starting on usenet&#x2F;IRC and staying with it all until now). Oh, I know some fortran. Still wanna guess my age?<p>I&#x27;m going to re-emphasize a point I made earlier that invalidates any age-based arguments: Poetry. The conventions of interpreting far more meaning from punctuation than a reader tends to from long form prose have been around far longer than anyone alive today.')
