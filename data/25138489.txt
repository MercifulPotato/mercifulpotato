If you were an App developer like myself, you&#x27;d realize what a huge change this was.<p>First, most Apple devs don&#x27;t care about alternate app stores. Those provide nearly zero additional revenues to devs on every platform they are available.<p>Second, most Apple devs don&#x27;t want the Apple App Store to lose it&#x27;s primacy, they realize that it&#x27;s hugely beneficial to their revenues. The security, the app vetting, the single sign on, single purchase account, and easy subscription management and refund features, is a huge reason that we make far more from the App Store than Google Play, despite Androids SIX TIMES larger installed base. Apple attracts the best app customers and makes them super comfortable with buying and subscribing to apps.<p>Most Apple developers by far largest concern was the large percentage of revenues Apple took. And they addressed that today.<p>At 15% we can use App Store purchasing for far more things, and I&#x27;m already having those discussions with clients today.')
