Item(by='strogonoff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609054639, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25543865, text='&gt; Whether you know all the work to be done or not, there is a quantity of work to be done after which there will be no more work to do.<p>Does that imply the existential possibility of a finished software product? To me it is precluded by ever-changing requirements and impossibility of bug-free software.<p>&gt; Some of that work might be learning what all the work is. Some of the work might be defining how to do some of the other work. … All of these are subtracting from the total quantity of work that will have been done by completing the project.<p>If an activity changes the pile of work, can it be positively claimed subtraction took place?<p>Given pile of work A and activity ƒ, we can say ƒ is subtractive only if its intention was to make ƒ(A) ⊆ A.<p>If ∂(A) ⊊ A (intentionally, not because some regressions were accidentally introduced), then I don’t see how ∂ is subtractive. New pile of work may be (but doesn’t have to be) smaller, but it is not a subset of the original pile.<p>I believe a lot of activity is like ∂, especially in smaller teams where enabling continuous pile-of-work redefinition may be more beneficial than subtracting from the pile.')
