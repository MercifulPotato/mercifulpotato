Item(by='snuxoll', descendants=None, kids=[24832313, 24832057, 24831067, 24834812], score=None, time=1603131718, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24827853, text='&gt; I also love that you&#x27;re making being a &quot;Professional Dungeon Master&quot; a plausible future career choice. :)<p>Professional DM&#x27;ing will never be good for anything other than making some money on the side unless you&#x27;re charging players an unreasonable amount of money. Yes, there is an imbalance of potential players versus DM&#x27;s, but at the end of the day the only thing preventing <i>anybody</i> from being a DM is getting over false assumptions that &quot;it&#x27;s not as fun as playing a character&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m not Matthew Mercer and thus I&#x27;m going to be a bad DM&quot;. If my introverted and self-critical ass can DM and have players enjoy the experience, so can whoever is reading this.<p>I DM a weekly 2-hour session, beyond the actual time spent in the session I spend ~45 minutes prepping every week (and I&#x27;m running published modules right now, not homebrewing, so that&#x27;s just time spent reading ahead, writing session notes, etc.). Paid DM&#x27;s generally charge $25 per player for a four hour session, and their prep time is included in that - given that even running the same module for multiple groups still requires prep time and longer sessions moreso, you&#x27;re only making $15-25&#x2F;hr before banks, taxes, etc. take a cut. Not only that, but being <i>paid</i> means you have fairly high expectations placed on your skills that nobody would have for the friendly DM running a game for fun.<p>I don&#x27;t have anything against paid DM&#x27;s, but unless you are literally providing an insanely polished experience that has potential players willing to drop $50 each for a session you&#x27;re not going to be making a living off it that justifies the time spent beyond some extra pocket change.')
