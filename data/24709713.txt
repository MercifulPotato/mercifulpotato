Something like firewire where we can memory map a device or perform bulk transfers or byte oriented transfers.<p>Maybe a &quot;converged&quot; controller with some brains can allow it to handle Ethernet frames directly so an Ethernet port or dongle isn&#x27;t much more than an external MAC. Then we can use existing Ethernet interface hardware, MAC&#x27;s, jacks and so on. A new connector would be nice too. One that doesn&#x27;t have the ability to inject 20V into a 5V device. Real-time can be handled using TSN and PTP can also be used.<p>Finally, combine that with single pair Ethernet for local desktop device networking at up to 1GB <i>with</i> PoE over a single pair of wires. Why do we need USB 3 and C again?')
