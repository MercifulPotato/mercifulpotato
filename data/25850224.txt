Item(by='armadsen', descendants=None, kids=[25850474, 25850490, 25850470, 25850848], score=None, time=1611168291, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25849375, text='&gt; AirPods Max are aimed squarely at Apple devotees – of which there are millions – who simply could not bear to be seen with a pair of Beats headphones, even though Beats are superb.<p>You see this all the time in critical reviews of Apple products. The implication is that people who buy Apple products do so because they&#x27;re irrational cult members, not because they rationally consider the device worth the price for various reasons.<p>I suppose I would be considered an &quot;Apple devotee&quot;, in that I make my living doing Mac and iOS development, and own plenty of their hardware. I also have AirPods Max, and I think they&#x27;re great.<p>&quot;Superb&quot; is not how I would personally describe Beats&#x27; stuff. I recently worked on repairing some Beats Solo 3 Wireless headphones for a friend. They&#x27;re made like every other cheap, flimsy, plastic consumer electronics device, with lots of glue, plastic clips, and fragile mechanical parts. (One of the headband hinges breaking necessitated the repair.) If you&#x27;re OK with the tradeoff between quality and price, by all means, buy Beats. (I think you&#x27;re better off with a much cheaper competitor, considering the relative difference in quality is low to non-existent.)<p>By contrast, the AirPods Max are clearly a well-made, premium device, using metal, premium materials, and clever engineering. Add it all up with the good sound quality and usual integration with Apple&#x27;s other hardware and software, and it&#x27;s a device that&#x27;s worth the price <i>to me</i>. If you don&#x27;t value those things -- which is perfectly fine! -- it may not be worth it to you, but it doesn&#x27;t mean that anyone who would buy them does so because they&#x27;re a brainwashed Apple fanatic.')
