We like working from home but it broke down any kind of interactive process&#x2F;exercise, every meeting for a workshop becomes this choreography of: how to ask for a spot to speak, how to leave space for others to take that spot, who will facilitate that. It kills any spontaneous take or realisation that you could bring up in a meeting room. It feels like everyone has to stay in a queue to have time to speak. A lot of times it&#x27;s happened that people forgot what they wanted to say or the conversation went way past that point and people don&#x27;t feel like backtracking the discussion.<p>I can say that people feel like they should only speak up and state *really important thingsâ„¢&quot; but often the small unsaid things are really valuable.<p>It really sucks, I thrive in environments where I can pick up bits and pieces of information and glue them together into something meaningful to my team, I can&#x27;t really do that remotely (not without pestering people or trying to have scheduled coffee breaks to just chat).')
