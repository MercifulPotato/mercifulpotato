I find that the only reason to not wear a mask is discomfort from heat and sweat. Wearing a mask, but wrong, doesn&#x27;t help that.<p>As for my personal set of rules: if I can distance 12 feet I don&#x27;t wear one. If I am frequently passing people (on sidewalks or trails) I keep it on. If it is fairly empty and I pass someone every once in a while, I keep the mask in my hand and breath through it when I pass someone.')
