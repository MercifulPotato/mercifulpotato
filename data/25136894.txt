The study started in late July, so it&#x27;s been about 4 months. The data that they examine probably lags a bit too and in the intervening period, cases have gone up significantly.<p>Over the course of a longer period of time and with cases on the rise as they are now, I&#x27;d expect the risk reduction to be much higher.<p>Edit: Also, these numbers are somewhat skewed by the fact that not all 40k people got the vaccine&#x2F;placebo at once, but over a period of time.')
