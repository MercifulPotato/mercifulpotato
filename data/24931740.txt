Just because most people are horny &amp; sexual doesn&#x27;t mean that they need to hump each other at work or at conferences. I expect professional behavior regardless of your personal beliefs. Now, <i>personally</i> I&#x27;d prefer people to also <i>look</i> professional (fully clothed, no religious symbols, ...) so I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily disagree with such rules, but they&#x27;re usually (as evidenced by this very OP) applied inconsistently, politically.')
