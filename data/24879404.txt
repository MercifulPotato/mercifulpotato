If they really wanted to hook users in, they should consider offering at least 5GB free.<p>The jump from 1 GB free to 100GB for $30 a year is too large. I think they are missing a lot of people in-between. I have quite a lot of photos, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need 100GB anytime soon. $30 a year for something like this when I could just use Google Photos for my purposes for free is still too much.<p>So I suggest at least 1-2 other plans in between, such as 10GB for $5 a year and 20GB a year for $8 a year.<p>Or if you do offer the 5GB for free, maybe just 15-20GB for $10 a year. I think you&#x27;d get a lot more &quot;paying customers&quot; this way, even if they aren&#x27;t super profitable (they might just be, as the ones that need a ton of space are actually the ones that utilizes everything to the max, while normal people tend to overestimate how much they need).<p>But once you get this larger audience hooked, it&#x27;s easier to get them to upgrade when they need more.')
