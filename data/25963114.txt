I&#x27;m reminded of the story of the hedge fund manager who was getting a shoe shine, and the shoe shine boy was giving him stock tips. He closed out his positions and correctly called the top of the bubble[1]. I don&#x27;t know if the story is true, and it is just an anecdote anyway. But historically this kind of activity does mark the end of bull markets.<p>At the same time I keep hearing that the stock market is actually undervalued on average given current interest rates - and those aren&#x27;t going to change anytime soon.<p>Definitely things are frothy and there are bubbles in some stocks, but maybe this market still has legs - at least while the fed is buying 120 billion of debt each month.<p>[1] I found it, it was Joe Kennedy in 1929: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.fortune.com&#x2F;magazines&#x2F;fortune&#x2F;fortune_archive&#x2F;1996&#x2F;04&#x2F;15&#x2F;211503&#x2F;index.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.fortune.com&#x2F;magazines&#x2F;fortune&#x2F;fortune_archiv...</a>')
