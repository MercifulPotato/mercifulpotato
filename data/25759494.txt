People do kill snakes (also worship them on a certain day of year) if they get into the house but usually they try to sho them away towards the fields.<p>The usual experience is that they leave you alone if you leave them alone. Unless the only place they can find the food is your house. There is always a probability of fatal biting if a venomous snake is in the vicinity. Catch it and leave it away from the city whenever you can.')
