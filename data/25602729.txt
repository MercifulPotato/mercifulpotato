Bitcoin&#x27;s energy consumption is not proportional to the number of transactions it&#x27;s processing.<p>The energy used is proportional to the block reward, the reward that miners get from mining a new block roughly every 10 minutes.  They won&#x27;t spend more money on energy than they get from mining, or they would go out of business. That mining reward goes up with price,  (because it&#x27;s paid out as a fixed amount of BTC) and goes down with each halving event (every ~4 years the block reward is cut in half in BTC terms).<p>The network can be doing 7tps or 7 million tps, doesnâ€™t really matter for energy use, although higher usage can have indirect effects on price or other things.')
