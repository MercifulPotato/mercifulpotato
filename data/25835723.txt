No one is getting banned because they don&#x27;t like the tax rate, or because of their view on universal healthcare.<p>Exactly right.  Nothing would have happened to Parler if its userbase wasn&#x27;t substantially affiliated with a mob that literally attacked the democratic process because they didn&#x27;t like the result.<p>I&#x27;m sure someone&#x27;s thinking that the correct response to that is have the <i>government</i> police forces battle with the mob until it changes its mind of its own accord, rather than have (non-government) <i>society</i> take action against the root causes of the mob, like Parler.  However, that&#x27;s undesirable for reasons that should be obvious.')
