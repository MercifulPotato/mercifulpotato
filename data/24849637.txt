I haven&#x27;t really needed (from Rust) to depend on anything written in Java or some other random language, so my experience there is mostly non-existent.<p>Advanced &quot;infrastructure features&quot; you&#x27;re describing just aren&#x27;t important for most companies that aren&#x27;t Google-scale.
