Our whole web infrastructure are based around clearly distinct public&#x2F;private exchanges - there&#x27;s no middleground this and yet people create these absurd hacks like captchas and fingerprints to fight the nature of the internet.<p>Finally everyone wants benefits of public data (search engine indexing etc) but don&#x27;t really want to give anything back to the ecosystem. It&#x27;s just pure greed and law, our society and government shouldn&#x27;t aid it in any way, shape or form.')
