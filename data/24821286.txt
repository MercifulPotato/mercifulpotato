So what if we made compiler into kubernettes. Basically allow compiler to spin up new serverless functions&#x2F;microservices&#x2F;etc to run code that is becoming bottleneck.<p>Video demonstration:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1vEjGKhSx8o<p>The advantage is that as a developer it can hide all the nasty part of microservices&#x2F;serverless... I.e. compiler can make sure error stack trace is maintained even if some functions are ran in a separate service.')
