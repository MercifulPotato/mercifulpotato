I&#x27;ve had all the SSRIs, none worked. I&#x27;ve tried the SNRIs and they worked a bit 8 years ago, but aren&#x27;t working at all now. I started lithium a week ago, that&#x27;s not having much effect so far (dose should be reviewed next week). I think the latest term in the US is Major Mood Disorder.<p>Only around 30% of people with depression ever find an antidepressant that works for them. So for all the SSRIs, SNRIs, Tricyclics and other, the SUM effectiveness is 30%.<p>There&#x27;s really very little left on the menu and I have no expectation it will work.<p>So, anyone got any experience with self treatment?')
