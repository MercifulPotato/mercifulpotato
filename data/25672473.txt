My only complaint productivity-wise is similar to the issue with gaming, because I&#x27;m using Windows all of my taskbar icons are shoved over to the left.<p>For the games with HUDs stuck to the sides, I just turn down the horizontal resolution and have black bars on the left and right. But for games like FS2020, using the full display makes the game that much better.')
