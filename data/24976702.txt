One place was kind of an exception - containerization was on the road map, but not in use in production yet. They’re everywhere. I’ve deployed 3 containerized services in the last 6 weeks - 2 using Go and 1 using Node. They’re kind of the default these days, especially when deploying to AWS&#x2F;GC.<p>I assume it must be similar to some degree for a lot of developers here.')
