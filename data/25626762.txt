Worst case scenario you use inline assembly in C and you get that.<p>Rust also allows inlining assembly.<p>&gt; Thus the contrary cannot be true for Rust: if I give you a heavily optimized C program not always you can produce an equivalent version in Rust.<p>This is incorrect for the reason above. Worst case scenario you just inline assembly in Rust to reproduce exactly the same performance of any arbitrarily optimized C program.')
