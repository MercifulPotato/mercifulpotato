If I&#x27;m saying I&#x27;ll pay whatever price, though, you bet I&#x27;m putting that on there. ;P<p>Edit: and to be fair, I&#x27;d take a logo that isn&#x27;t an eyesore - the other commenter on this thread used some odd language for it, but I consider the Razer logo to be an eyesore. Bright green is not something I want on my laptop.<p>The Apple logo, as annoying as it might be, at least doesn&#x27;t look like someone took a crayon and scribbled on the back of the machine.')
