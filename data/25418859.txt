In the same way that training in martial arts helps with punching, or training in coding helps you write better software, training in thinking helps you think.&quot;<p>Thank you.  But are these comparable?  Is thinking competitive and there&#x27;s a winner?  What is it to be trained to think?  If that training hadn&#x27;t happened, would the un-trained person not be thinking?  Or, would you be thinking along a more natural way?  Is it more akin to building one or other type of sandcastle, rather than to be a better fighter?<p>The way I view it, the only thing an individual can do is try to be the winner for themselves - they need to progress their understanding of themselves as much as possible.  In nature there&#x27;s no competition - there are needs that might or might not be met.<p>But, if you want to harness or direct individuals into a collectivised state, yes, you need to train them, and they will produce what you call &#x27;original works of philosophy&#x27; on the basis of all the thought that has preceded them.  As if &#x27;a body of original works&#x27; is important to an individual.  They may be renumerated for their trained thinking.  As if renumeration is something the individual would ever want.')
