It is a war between malware creators and OS creators.<p>No, this is _exactly_ the war we think. It is a war between Apple and malware over control of _my_ personal(!) computer.<p>At this point both malware and Apple leak personal data from _my_ personal computer. So from the perspective of controlling MY personal computer they are both malware and differences are neglectable if I do not even have a choice to install my own OS.<p>Secure boot is secure if I(!) can secure it, not Apple or any other external authority.<p>&gt;For me, Apple products really are designed to protect my personal information.<p>Apple products designed to get  _control_ of your personal information from you and thus to control you and your behavior.<p>Computer is no longer a &quot;Personal Computer&quot; with all of these developments. It&#x27;s simply a termianal of some big machine where your &#x27;personal&#x27; space isn&#x27;t even really your personal.<p>Probably it is a good idea to recall what &quot;Personal Computer&quot; meant and what it should mean.<p>For me it is My control over My computer and My data if I wish to, and this a minimum for My privacy.<p>And privacy is a minimum for society respecting freedom and rights of a person.<p>All of this is really like R. Stallman predicted.')
