Item(by='WorldMaker', descendants=None, kids=[25754827], score=None, time=1610485069, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25745942, text='&gt; You&#x27;re asking that Steam dedicate a fleet of thousands of servers to facilitate cracking your password. And on top of that, the service would also need a database that likewise serves billions of requests a second.<p>No, I&#x27;m just saying that I believe Steam presumably scaled naturally (through decades of growing usage and also decades of huge scale DDoS attacks) to something like that for other reasons and are possibly missing safeguards to prevent it being misused.<p>Obviously, I&#x27;m making cynical assumptions and failing to give Steam the benefit of the doubt here. I&#x27;m sorry.<p>&gt; Additionally, modern hash algorithms like bcrypt are constructed so that they take considerable and configurable time (on any hardware), so the hashing rates are on the order of tens of thousands a second or less, instead of billions and trillions. Since Steam are evidently very concerned with account security, I&#x27;d guess they take advantage of these algorithmsâ€”and since you changed the password recently, it was probably hashed with the latest used algorithm.<p>The article points to evidence that the login system possibly hasn&#x27;t been updated since around 2012. Plenty of systems were still using unsalted MD5 back in 2012. It&#x27;s a huge assumption that they&#x27;ve kept up with modern hash algorithms.<p>Additionally, the SteamGuard files stored in the base client directory were reported to include MD5 hashes at least as recently as 2014. (Even worse that file contained long lived tokens directly able to bypass SteamGuard.)<p>I hope Steam is doing better than that today, but you can forgive my pessimism&#x2F;cynicism after fighting this cycle much longer than I would have liked that the conclusions I jump to remain that Steam isn&#x27;t doing enough to protect account security.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s time to accept that either your passwords are easily guessable, or are lifted from you in some way.<p>I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of paranoia and anxiety over this. I&#x27;ve done a lot to eliminate suspects and shrink attack surface, and continue to do so. So far as I can tell this is specifically a Steam phenomenon, Steam is the weak link in the chain, and my other accounts seem secure accept that my email providers report failed login attempts from the same IPs mentioned in SteamGuard emails shortly after the SteamGuard timestamp.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ve expended too many words of paranoia and cynicism in this thread. I appreciate the attempts to help.')
