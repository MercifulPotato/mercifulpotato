Dressing appropriately starts to feel more like putting on a hazmat suit than getting dressed to go out as any bit of exposed skin is at risk.<p>Even many cold-weather accessories you might have start to feel insufficient. A knit scarf or toque is great in many situations, but the cold wind will cut through it like a knife.<p>I remember being sent outside at recess as a kid at those kinds of temperatures. I mean, I still go outside when I have to but I don’t exactly look for excuses to leave the house.')
