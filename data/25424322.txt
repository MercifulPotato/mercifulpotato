For all the hype of Rust, I don’t think this is it.<p>How does Zig compare to Nim?<p>Does Zig have a future in games programming?  I feel games programming is the ultimate test, to validate the true success of a programming language.<p>I do like that Zig compiles to LLVM. Although this in itself will exact a minor performance penalty, in exchange for wider CPU coverage.<p>Nim transpiles its code down to C, and I’m not certain how that will play out. As you’re now writing your new language on an already somewhat buggy language.<p>But this does give Nim the possible speed advantage, of getting the code compiled closer to the metal, whereas Zig will compile to the intermedia LLVM layer.')
