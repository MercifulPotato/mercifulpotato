Avro&#x27;s separation of schema &amp; binary is better than protobuf&#x27;s field tags.  You need a schema to meaningfully parse protobufs anyway (usually baked into the codegen), so you might as well make that schema a first-class object and package it with the data.  Then you don&#x27;t need to include or maintain the field tags (shrinking the binary size), you can explicitly reconcile different versions by sending along the new schema, and you don&#x27;t need to codegen for each language, letting you easily support reflection and dynamic languages.')
