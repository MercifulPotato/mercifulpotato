[1] Deep understanding, and the ability to apply a concept, and the ability to draw deep comparisons between concepts, are not the equivalent of having instant recall of many facts.<p>Early in the learning process you&#x27;ll have to be able to remember the basic facts of a topic, as this is necessary to develop deep insight, but once learnt, deep insight doesn&#x27;t depend on perfect recall of the particulars.<p>It&#x27;s reasonable for an exam on language theory to expect a student to know that deterministic finite automata are represented as 5-tuples, but students learn about DFAs in order to develop understanding; little is lost if they later forget that particular detail. The ability to apply the concept is what&#x27;s really valuable.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cft.vanderbilt.edu&#x2F;guides-sub-pages&#x2F;blooms-taxonomy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cft.vanderbilt.edu&#x2F;guides-sub-pages&#x2F;blooms-taxonomy&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DIKW_pyramid" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;DIKW_pyramid</a>')
