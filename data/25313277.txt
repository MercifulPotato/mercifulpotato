But how do we build trust in a decentralized network the size of the human population? How do I know if this username on my screen is publishing in good faith without some kind of transitive trust?<p>I might trust someone my real-world friends trust when it comes to local gossip. If I want trustworthy national news my only recourse seems to be to go through a centralized journalism institute. But which one? Well I&#x27;ll probably look at what people around are looking at.<p>If there&#x27;s a national broadcaster or dominant cable news channel in my country I&#x27;ll probably look at that, but if I don&#x27;t like what I see I may be biased to go search out another institution that I find more agreeable. Then you get things like Macedonian teens running sites dressed up to look like US-based newspapers posting straight-up bullshit because there&#x27;s always a market telling people what they want to hear.<p>How can we build a decentralized system to overcome people&#x27;s biases and laziness? People are going to gravitate to sources their friends and family use, and collectively to sources that fit their preexisting beliefs. It&#x27;s no wonder we&#x27;re in this situation where people are struggling to agree on reality.<p>&gt;&gt; Only a decentralized approach to trust and reputation will scale well enough to regulate decentralized content<p>But what if a decentralized network of trust collectively agree that covid is a hoax and the Earth is flat? I&#x27;m not sure if the (de)centralization of the underlying technology really has an impact on that problem.')
