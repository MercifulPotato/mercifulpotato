I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see a 8-0 outcome, but there&#x27;s likely to be a concurring opinion or two, which will make the decision take longer. My expectation is that the opinion will come out in the January-March timeframe.<p>By way of comparison, Bilski v Kappos (the first big patent case in recent years) was a 9-0 case argued in November whose opinions only came out in the end-of-year opinion blitz.')
