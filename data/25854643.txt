One would think that people would form communities but you would be surprised. Many of the newer tech people just treat it as a bedroom whereas some parents and older residents treat it as a community.<p>I think much of new tech is mercenary. They aren’t from the area. They came to make money. They don’t care about the neighborhood. When they can make more money elsewhere they will leave. In fact, with COVID-19, many have and are.<p>Even if you build a bunch of tech fish tanks, the surrounding area will still become very expensive. Yes, building more  tech fish tanks can make it less worse, but it is still be untenable for existing residents. An artisanal coffee shop replacing a donut shop just made coffee unaffordable for the less wealthy.<p>I think that a much better connected transit system is actually the answer. It will allow new communities to form farther off but still connected to the whole. It gives everyone a place at the table and increases the cultural richness. NYC feels much more culturally rich than SF and I think that is why. Instead, in the Bay Area, you had the black community moving to Sacramento.<p>Also, those fishtanks were folly. It would have been much better for the city to have more mixed housing in those neighborhoods. By mixed, I mean having some larger units that allow families to stay. In a way, in the SOMA, you replaced the original SROs with tech SROs. The irony.<p>I think the transit villages were also terribly designed. Most are aligned around the track. That makes no sense from a noise pollution standpoint. It makes far more sense to build either perpendicular to the track or at least a block away.<p>Stepping back even further, government had and has an issue with attracting talent. It was hopelessly inadequate at addressing the challenges and taking advantage of the opportunities.')
