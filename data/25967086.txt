Item(by='bhk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611991930, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25966779, text='I find this fascinating (from the article you lined):<p>&gt;  Webull Chief Executive Anthony Denier said his platform’s clearing firm, Apex Clearing Corp., notified him Thursday morning that Webull needed to shut off the ability to open new positions in certain stocks. Otherwise, Apex wouldn’t be able to settle the trades, he said.<p>1. Clearing houses raised capital requirements by a remarkable amount.<p>2. Apex specifically indicated that opening new positions in <i>certain securities</i> should be forbidden.  This does not sound like an aggregate collateral shortfall.<p>&gt; The volatility of those stocks is approaching infinity as their trading volume increases, so the traditionally mild and technical credit risk around settling trades has become real and scary. Brokerages have to put up more money to guarantee against that risk, and also think about ways to prevent the risk from coming true.<p>Hold on here...  regardless of &quot;infinite&quot; volatility, the risk of a $300 buy order is at most $300, and when the brokerage is custodian of $300 settled real US dollars in the customer&#x27;s account, there is no apocalyptic systemic risk.<p>I would understand if this were simply a matter of Robinhood tightening margin requirements, but no, they were prohibiting all purchases, even from accounts with plenty of cash, and now we are hearing (not the first story they spun) that this was because of some nonsensical aspect of the DTCC collateral requirements (the buying customer&#x27;s funds do not count and cannot be used as collateral).<p>Collateral shortfall would apply to all purchases of all stocks, wouldn&#x27;t it?  Why not cap all purchases? And what exactly were the collateral requirements on GME?<p>&gt; Those outlays, which behave like margin in a brokerage account, can create a cash crunch on volatile days, say when GameStop falls from $483 to $112 like it did at one point during Thursday’s session.<p>Hilarious! This intra-day volatility was <i>caused</i> by the brokerage&#x27;s actions.  This was the kind of raid that could happen only in the low volume environment created by the cessation of retail buying.')
