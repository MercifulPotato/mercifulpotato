I could even do that even if I didn&#x27;t find grown women (or men) dancing sexually attractive myself, just by osmosis, just like I know an ad for a car is supposed to elicit this or that association, while not caring much for cars myself.<p>&gt; The self-disgust this causes is<p>an assumption of yours, and you might as well ask what makes you engage in these mental gymnastics. I don&#x27;t find children dancing sexually arousing in the least, yet still recognize it as dancing sexually, which isn&#x27;t weird or interesting at all, much less &quot;ugly&quot;.')
