A regime largely in place to protect biased trade relations for cheap materials and goods from around the world and more importantly (to those orchestrating the regime) to the line the pockets of select defense contractors.<p>Investments in space represent, what, .1% of the US GDP? Astoundingly the single mother raising her kid in food scarcity in &lt;insert dystopic cityscape here&gt; actually probably really doesn&#x27;t give a hoot about terraforming in 2500, but would really give a damn about having healthcare and avoiding societal collapse from climate catastrophe in her lifetime.<p>A lot of unreasonably rich people are unreasonably obsessed with space, but thats largely because they are sociopaths. Thats how they got rich in the first place, or were born to such extreme luxury they are psychologically impaired to be unable to relate to anyone outside their class meaningfully. So they go full scifi because they don&#x27;t think the world we have with all its problems not so easily solved by throwing money at them (that isn&#x27;t for their own immediate personal gain) is worth it.')
