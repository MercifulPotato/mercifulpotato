Item(by='interestica', descendants=None, kids=[24844933, 24845822, 24845716], score=None, time=1603245338, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24844068, text='There are a couple &#x27;8mm&#x27; tape formats. \nMy suggestion:\nPut a saved search on kijiji (or craiglist or whatever) for a DIGITAL8 camcorder. You&#x27;ll find one for under $100. These cams are backward compatible to the 8mm and hi-8 analogue formats. They will play those analog tapes and output digital stream (DV) over Firewire. The harder part is now getting a computer that will take the firewire (you may have an old laptop -- macs had them until like 08 -- or get a firewire-to-usb2.0 cable or thunderbolt to firewire adapter on amazon). Modern imovie&#x2F;premiere will gladly accept the DV stream&#x2F;control the camcorder.')
