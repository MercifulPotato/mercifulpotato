Maybe even <i>most</i> don&#x27;t - but some actually do enjoy the process of writing good documentation, and they find satisfaction in creating knowledge artifacts that make their code easy to understand and use. It&#x27;s not enough to just find these engineers, however - they need organizational support so that they have the right tools to create and share good documentation, and are appropriately encouraged to do so.')
