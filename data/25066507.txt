Really interested.<p>Back in the day I had 2 Sun 20&quot; GDM20E20 (1997) which was major $$ and after then I alway had 2 monitors, moving at some point to a single ultra wide LG (which are pretty neat). One day I looked at my setup and how I used it and realized I did not look at all of the screen. I swapped it for a small single Apple LG 4K and it turns out I am very happy. The dense nature of the 4K was a game changer. I plan on getting an 8K when it comes out.')
