The first looks like it gives a language for SIMD operations, but not all of the intrinsics. The second is for vectorization, which also doesn&#x27;t include all of the intrinsics.<p>However! The second shows an example with Base.llvmcall, which lets me write LLVM assembly. That should let me do anything I want.<p>However however - the stuff I <i>actually</i> do doesn&#x27;t need all that, and could likely be implemented with LoopVectorization.')
