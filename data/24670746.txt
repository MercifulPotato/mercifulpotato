After about 6 months of self study, I decided I wanted to work for a webhosting company, and that I really wanted to work in the hosting&#x2F;server&#x2F;datacenter&#x2F;Linux environment. So NOC Technician is basically where it’s at for that sort of thing to get a foot in the door.<p>I was hanging out in an IRC channel for a local Linux user group, and lo and behold, there was a guy who worked in a local datacenter&#x2F;hosting company. I got the manager contact from him, and basically called and emailed and bothered the hell out of him until he relented and said OK come work as an unpaid intern. I worked hard, learned and incredible amount there (they hired me on after a few weeks, albeit very cheaply of course)— DNS&#x2F;network&#x2F;webserver&#x2F;troubleshooting, all the fundamentals, and there were incredibly smart and brilliant people there that I learned from. Those were very cool days.<p>From there I kept learning and have done fairly decently for myself. Good amount of luck on the way probably, sort of right situation&#x2F;right timing... have worked at two very large ISPs&#x2F;telecoms in Systems and Server Operations since then.<p>Wanted to share this maybe to also give encouragement to people just to keep trying and working hard and it can work out. Potentially also a good message in this hard time of the Coronavirus.<p>Would love to hear some other foot-in-the-door stories.')
