Maybe I&#x27;m not understanding how this works, but wouldn&#x27;t you need some sort of license to do this? If someone downloads the Gmail app from your catalog, but it doesn&#x27;t work the same as the plain web client, they would probably blame Google and not you. I can&#x27;t imagine Google would like that.')
