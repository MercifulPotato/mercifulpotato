I said your description was &quot;hyperbole&quot;.  That was a comment on your post, not you personally.<p>And come on, Mediamatters.org?  &quot;Media Matters for America is a politically left-leaning 501, nonprofit organization which acts as media watchdog for scrutinizing right-leaning media outlets.&quot;  A politically left-leaning organization doesn&#x27;t like a right-wing organization?  <i>Shocking</i>.<p>Let&#x27;s look at an example, Tucker says “I don’t see” that “diversity is the strength of our country.”  That&#x27;s white supremacy?  Question that diversity is a strength can be twisted to the idea that white people are better than other races?  That&#x27;s just complete unhinged honestly.  You&#x27;d have to see the &quot;white supremacy&quot; boogieman around every corner to consider that an example.<p>Let me ask you this - how many people do you know personally, who voted for Trump?  I mean, there are 63M of them, so it&#x27;s not like they are hard to find.  I&#x27;m going to guess, <i>zero</i>.  But let&#x27;s say you do know some.
