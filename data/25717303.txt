If I understand these figures, that means that on average white doctors keep black patients 40% longer than black doctors keep black patients.<p>I don&#x27;t know what that means for the quality of care. Is keeping patients around good or bad? The Medicaid&#x2F;Medicare&#x2F;Self-pay numbers are very similar for the two groups, so it shouldn&#x27;t be that the black patients going to white doctors are just paying for more care, right? Does it say something about case difficulty?<p>I know very little about this topic. Hopefully somebody who knows more can chime in. But that gap seems...significant?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;pnas&#x2F;suppl&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;12&#x2F;1913405117.DCSupplemental&#x2F;pnas.1913405117.sapp.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;pnas&#x2F;suppl&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;12&#x2F;191340511...</a>')
