I&#x27;m from the east coast, but have lived in Southern California for the past few years.<p>California is out because the taxes are insane.<p>I&#x27;m thinking about moving to Denver, Austin, Houston, or Miami beach. I like sports like surfing and kitesurfing which is why Houston and Miami are a bit higher on my list.<p>My job is not location-dependent, but I do feel like it&#x27;s worth it to be around other like-minded people.<p>What do you think? Has anyone else recently made a move due to being able to work from home?')
