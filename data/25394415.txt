Boca Chica&#x2F;Austin might eventually become the new locus of new hiring for example, but the Dragon&#x2F;Falcon business might remain in CA for example.<p>HP leaving is basically a zombie company leaving on life support, it would be like IBM or Kodak leaving.<p>The real power of the Bay Area is the startup economy, and I think it will be hard to dislodge that, just like it&#x27;s hard to dislodge Shenzhen, because of the &quot;nexus&quot; effect, or chicken and egg as you mentioned. If all of your customers and workers, and supply chain, and investors are in one spot, as an entrepreneur, you&#x27;re going to gravitate there, even if the costs are high.<p>I mean, you get can Silicon Hills, and Silicon Alleys elsewhere, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ll overtake the Bay Area.<p>However, I could see Texas, Arizona, Nevada, becoming the &quot;Mars Plateau&quot; in the future. Realistically, Musk needs a coastal port for logistics, ability to mine resources, and a state that would be complicit in dealing with angry laborers or neighbors who don&#x27;t like Sonic Booms going off all the time.<p>CA&#x27;s just not going to let him run as roughshod as he wants, e.g. the worker safety and labor issues at his plants, the environmental impacts of what he&#x27;s doing in Boca Chica, etc. That slows down his time schedule a lot, I don&#x27;t blame him, he wants to get to Mars quick, but then again, if I were living near a Starship test area, I&#x27;d also be annoyed by all of the traffic, tourists, and explosions, so I don&#x27;t object to him trying to get as far away from regulated residential areas as possible.')
