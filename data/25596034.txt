I&#x27;m not interested in the philosophical, because I&#x27;m literally living in the pit of lies with no way to convince my family or coworkers that they&#x27;ve been mislead.<p>I&#x27;m having to explain to my own mother, why having 20+ people (including people who were on flights from across the country) over for Thanksgiving is a bad idea. I&#x27;m having to explain to my sister why we shouldn&#x27;t go out and eat at restaurants right now. I&#x27;m having to explain to my mom why its important to tell everyone at the Thanksgiving party about a certain partygoer&#x27;s postive Test Result, and that my mom should help contact trace out of duty to this country alone.<p>And I&#x27;m making the calculus of whether or not to expose myself to my own family, who fails to take precautions in this COVID19 era, because they believe in the misinformation. This is my life, and it has been for months.<p>And now I learn my Sister is leaning anti-vax in addition to this whole shebang, because she doesn&#x27;t seem to take the COVID19 threat on her own health seriously.<p>Maybe your situation is different. Maybe you have time to wax philosophical. But I don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m dealing with the surface level, because that&#x27;s where the problem is.')
