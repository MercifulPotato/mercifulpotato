If you are a serious Software Engineer with 15+ years of experience you will easily fail their stupid interview process.<p>Why? Because most of the people on the loop have far less experience than you. They aren&#x27;t any good at measuring those who are truly skilled and are just looking for clones of themselves that are happy to reinvent the wheel constantly.<p>The basics aren&#x27;t really crucial to developing most software. Not the way Faceboook is testing them at least. They want you to spout off the typical college explanations for things you do in just a call to a library.<p>No serious systems developer gives a shit about how to implement sort these days. It&#x27;s a waste of time.<p>The only way to measure the value and experience of senior developers reasonably is to have in depth discussions about their experiences. Using college type tests is just absurd and idiotic.')
