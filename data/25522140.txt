I used to think (as most people do) that the interview is a confrontation between interviewer and candidate.<p>However my biggest breakthrough happened when I changed my perspective. Now I see interviewers as detectives, gathering evidence of whether the candidate would be a good hire.<p>So my advice to candidates is the following: don&#x27;t think of the interviewer as the enemy. Usually they aren&#x27;t trying to get you, but help you. And if that isn&#x27;t the case, you don&#x27;t want to work for that company anyway. Keep a friendly and relaxed conversation with the interviewer and you&#x27;ll be surprise how far it can get you.')
