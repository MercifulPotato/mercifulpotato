Whether it&#x27;s college campuses violently protesting conservative speakers (e.g. Ben Shapiro), tech platforms banning and labeling speech they disagree with (e.g. Twitter, YouTube, Reddit), or corporate America demonizing those whose speak the truth and&#x2F;or hold differing views from politically left ideologies (e.g. James Damore), postmodern leftist ideology, as articulated so poignantly by Dr. Jordan Peterson, is not only attacking our free speech, but drawing under question the very ideas that form the foundation of our country. I think I speak for many rational liberally-minded small-government constitutional conservatives when I say that it has become increasingly dangerous for us to even have our ideas, let alone express them. This notion that because you feel your ideas you give the moral high-ground you can justify doing horrible things to your fellow citizen with whom you disagree with must be stopped.')
