Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609343127, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25579627, text='<i>&gt; I do not share the distain for the &quot;softer&quot; sciences often found in the hard sciences</i><p>It depends on what the disdain is based on. If the disdain is just based on &quot;your field isn&#x27;t physics (or chemistry, etc.)&quot;, I agree that&#x27;s not justified. But if the disdain is based on &quot;your models don&#x27;t make good predictions&quot;, I think it&#x27;s justified. Scientific models are <i>supposed</i> to be judged based on whether or not they make good predictions; if they don&#x27;t, they&#x27;re wrong. Models that make good predictions are much, much rarer in the &quot;soft&quot; sciences--many such fields basically have <i>no</i> models with any predictive power at all, yet their proponents claim they are &quot;sciences&quot; and want their models to be used to, for example, make public policy.')
