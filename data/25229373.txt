Item(by='anovikov', descendants=None, kids=[25232911, 25229597], score=None, time=1606490776, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25219271, text='There is no housing crisis. U.S. has more than plenty of good quality, large, and more than affordable houses (many of them are probably beyond repair but this is a consequence of their abundance and lack of demand).<p>Housing crisis is only about the very few already overpopulated spots being hyper-attractive for people to move in because that&#x27;s where opportunities are. There is no way to &quot;fix&quot; this because even if housing is by some magic affordable, so many people will flock there that commute times will increase beyond survivability and people will pay with their time instead of money (that works in exactly the same way as home prices rise when mortgage fall: this is a free market).<p>If you want to fix it, you need to stop these places from being attractive, or prevent people from moving. Both sound like a Soviet Union-style dystopia.<p>It&#x27;s better to just concede to the fact that housing in attractive areas is a scarce resource for which there is always a competition and most people who are there, simply shouldn&#x27;t be there, them being there is just a result of their Dunning-Kruger effect.<p>There is a middle ground of &quot;regulated rental&quot; but this is precisely a compromise, a middle ground between buying and market renting. Buying a place in attractive location is winning a lottery: if place is ALREADY attractive, the rental yield there is low because price to buy is sky high due to countless trillions of printed money sloshing around, so it makes no sense buying, it only makes sense buying <i>before</i> it gets attractive, but it can&#x27;t be predicted. Regulated rental gives you same opportunity: rent now and if in 30 years the place became attractive, you are renting at a small fraction of real cost, you won. This is not a solution, it is just a step halfway to the Soviet Union where the Party decided where you should live.')
