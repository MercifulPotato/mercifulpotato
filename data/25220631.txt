But if we&#x27;re being honest, everything you just mentioned is exactly why your active participation in defensive driving techniques is essential. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Defensive_driving" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Defensive_driving</a><p>Since crashes always have fault, defensive driving and proper maintenance of your car are paramount safety requirements both for myself and to pay respect to other people. However, beyond that, I&#x27;m buying my car based on an assumption that other people will not pay me that respect (e.g. by texting and driving), which is also precisely the point of defensive driving in the first place.<p>It seems like you&#x27;re here mostly to force a debate. I made my point; I hope you&#x27;re at peace with it.')
