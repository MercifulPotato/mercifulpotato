Item(by='nmfisher', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601702793, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24669483, text='1) Epic is gobsmackingly cashed up. Fortnite brought in almost $2 billion in revenue last year, and they raised almost $2 billion in equity this year. If anyone is positioned to have a drawn-out legal fight with Apple, it&#x27;s Epic.<p>2) Epic&#x27;s endgame isn&#x27;t Fortnite, it&#x27;s the Epic Games Store. Tim Sweeney is a smart businessman, he knows that Fortnite&#x27;s shelf-life is limited. He&#x27;s seen Steam make an order of magnitude more money for Valve than its games. EGS would not only diversify Epic away from Fortnite, it would bring in far, far more revenue (not to mention tying up nicely with licensing the Unreal Engine to developers).<p>3) With EGS on the App&#x2F;Play Stores, Epic would be positioned to capture literally <i>billions</i> of revenue. The potential reward is so large, it&#x27;s worth throwing almost everything you have into the Apple&#x2F;Google lawsuit.')
