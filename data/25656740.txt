Nature already built a large scale dehumidifier called rain.<p>They only reason these &quot;projects&quot; are done is because they appear to be directly producing the solution (water in this case) without having to fix the underlying problem. The most perverse thing about them is that they never work out in the end. It&#x27;s just a money pit and conversation starter.<p>The reason why even the poorest members of first world nations are wealthy relative to developing countries is because of infrastructure. Without roads, schools, electricity and internet we would be doing just as badly as them. Imagine living without indoor lighting. We take so many easy things for granted.<p>Everyone benefits from infrastructure. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you are poor or rich. But that&#x27;s the crux. People only want to help the poor. Once they cease to be poor nobody wants to help anymore but how is that supposed to work? If you remove support too early those people will fall back to poverty. It becomes a privately funded welfare trap in the end.')
