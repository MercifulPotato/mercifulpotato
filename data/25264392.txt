Here, it <i>is</i> a hot take.<p>I never understood this sentiment though. Competitions like ICPC aren&#x27;t like silly quizzes, you need to have incredibly good understanding of algorithms and data structures. Now I understand that the breadth required here is of course broader than anything a programmer likely to use in an &quot;average&quot; programming task, but then again you shouldn&#x27;t compare a ICPC finalist with an average programmer either.')
