Onyx Boox only because it&#x27;s android (android 10 probably) and I will be able to use Google Play Books which I use for all ebooks. Some of android note taking apps may work well with eink display. Can have app for any book format. In some places it&#x27;s refresh rate is even faster than remarkable.<p>On bad side, the product page of Onyx looks like other cheap Chinese products and I can forget about getting any support at all after buying.<p>Remarkable 2 is fast, I have tested remarkable 1 and I know how it feels when writing and drawing&#x2F;doodling. There is KOReader for it. Some other open source apps to. That&#x27;s pretty much it with it. I don&#x27;t know if android can be installed on it.<p>So what&#x27;s your take? What about power of android on an eink note taking tablet? What about build quality and support and openness of the system?')
