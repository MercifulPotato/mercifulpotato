Like specifically how would this fraud work?<p>[0]<p>&gt; The ballots have all been accounted for, an investigation confirmed no boxes were added or removed, and all the ballots in Georgia were subsequently audited and then recounted twice.<p>Can you link to the report of this investigation? How did they determine that no ballots were added? What is the chain of custody for the ballots that were removed from under the table?<p>&gt; Here is a slightly better link<p>&gt;&gt; Pick theorized that the machines in the room could have totaled “18,000 ballots.” (Biden won the state by less than 12,000 votes.) But that’s wrong, according to the state election board monitor who was in the room as they counted.<p>One of the guys implicated in the alleged fraud says its wouldn&#x27;t have been enough to change the result. Did they attempt to verify this statement?<p>&gt;&gt; The investigation remains open.<p>Interesting how that works. They&#x27;re confident enough that there&#x27;s not anything there that they&#x27;re willing to make public statements, but they&#x27;re not willing to close the investigation and issue a report so people&#x27;s concerns can be alleviated.<p>&gt; Do you think the investigators report would contradict their own testimony?<p>Its possible but its more likely it would show how well (or not) the claims were investigated and present the evidence that was used to substantiate or reject the claims. The affidavit doesn&#x27;t present any evidence other than the testimony of the investigator (who wasn&#x27;t present at the incident) and is therefore meaningfully contradicted by the testimony of people who were there.<p>&gt; Not that it should matter, but all the county and state election officials involved are Republicans too.<p>That&#x27;s correct, it shouldn&#x27;t matter and it does not matter.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ballotpedia.org&#x2F;Ballot_stuffing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ballotpedia.org&#x2F;Ballot_stuffing</a>')
