It&#x27;s a completely different problem from starting with coal.<p>Anyway, there are planes that use ethanol internal combustion, and methane reaction engines. There have been for ages. Those fuels aren&#x27;t widely used because they are hard to handle and lose performance on the normal passenger transportation conditions. The reason they are more common on cars is because performance matter much less on road transportation, not because of any lack of testing.')
