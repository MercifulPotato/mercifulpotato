Each Ghost installation has its own codebase and database, so they&#x27;re very independent of each other, with upgrades and migrations all happening independently.<p>Dunno if you&#x27;d call that single or multi tenant, but that&#x27;s the gist.<p>I can automate the upgrades and migrations and running them for all the installations at the same time, or leave your installation alone until you ask for an upgrade &#x2F; migration.')
