You have a vote, but majority rules, and overnight you could be working under terms and conditions you don&#x27;t necessarily agree with.   Promotions and internal transfers are handled by seniority. The collective trumps the individual.  Nothing inherently wrong with that, but you can&#x27;t please everyone.')
