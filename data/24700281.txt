Item(by='DCKing', descendants=None, kids=[24700817], score=None, time=1602005362, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24699171, text='I guess what I don&#x27;t understand then is what big advantage &quot;enterprise ECC&quot; has left over this DDR5 &quot;non-enterprise ECC&quot;. (Seriously, why is ECC &quot;enterprise&quot;? Everybody wins with memory error correction.) If regular DDR5 can correct single bitflips, it is on par in correction capabilities with &quot;enterprise ECC&quot; DDR4.<p>Maybe this won&#x27;t allow for the detection of multiple flips, and maybe won&#x27;t even report single bit flips to the OS (it&#x27;ll just fix them silently). I suppose there&#x27;s no big need to support detection and reporting for the vast majority of use cases. Ryan Smith at Anandtech in the link above says as much: &quot;Between the number of bits per chip getting quite high, and newer nodes getting successively harder to develop, the odds of a single-bit error is getting uncomfortably high. So on-die ECC is meant to counter that, by <i>transparently</i> dealing with single-bit errors.&quot;<p>But for my purposes, if just the correction capabilities are on par with DDR4 ECC I&#x27;d be absolutely fine with that. And I guess that goes for many people. Even while using ECC memory now at home, I&#x27;m not monitoring the correction statistics and I&#x27;m guessing few people do in general. It might as well be silent today if you ask me.')
