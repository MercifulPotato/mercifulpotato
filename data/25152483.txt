A lot of humans would say a random piece of quality GAN-generated art is a creative work. They may not say so if they first looked at every piece of training data that went into it. But then, they might not do the same if they looked at every piece of art produced and viewed by a given human artist previously.<p>As a thought experiment, if the line in the sand is whether a computer can generate a piece of art that people think is creative, even with full knowledge of every piece of training data- I think that&#x27;s not at all difficult to overcome long term. Possibly even with current models.')
