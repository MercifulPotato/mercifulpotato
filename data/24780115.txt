Such an elevator can add an hour to your commute.<p>If you have a mobile impairment, it can save your day to know in advance if ‘your’ elevators work.<p>Berlin’s transit network (VBB) already does this: When you request a wheelchair accessible route, its app lets you navigate around broken elevators – thanks to facility status APIs of its connected partners.<p>To my knowledge, it’s the first transit operator to do this.<p>For passengers, there is an overview webpage: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brokenlifts.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;brokenlifts.org</a><p>IMO Google Maps and Apple Maps should have this feature, too.')
