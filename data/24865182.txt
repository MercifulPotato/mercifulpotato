These are intended to let the app make intelligent decisions about what network requests to do. For example, “expensive” networks should disable background or speculative fetches and only fetch what the user asked for.<p>Presumably Apple apps that bypass the network filter are making use of these flags already, to avoid unnecessary network traffic.')
