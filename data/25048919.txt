Clocking 8 billable hours a day is actually pretty difficult. Think about how many hours of actual solid work you get done a day - for most devs I know, it&#x27;s 4, maybe 6 or even (rarely) 8 on a day when they&#x27;re really pushing for something. Those are your billable hours. Futzing around on twitter or HN, eating lunch, making yourself a snack: not billable hours.<p>Contractors also rarely have a level of stability where they can work every week. Things crop up - your periodic contract renewal takes a week or two to get approved by legal, stuff like that. These factors are broadly why hourly contracting rates can get pretty high.')
