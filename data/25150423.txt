They can adjust their settings and be on their way.  I won&#x27;t block their choices aside from intercepting requests to the ISP DNS.<p>Most of my friends are not technical, have no idea how to tweak the settings in their browser and would not know they even need to care.  So I think it is fair to say that a choice is being taken away.  It isn&#x27;t like browsers are going to prompt people and explain what is occurring.  The masses will experience centralized DNS without any idea this is happening.  I think we will fundamentally disagree here.<p><i>You could block your guest&#x27;s VPN connections, but you don&#x27;t do that.. why not?</i><p>My guests can choose to use a VPN if they wish, I would not take that choice away.  That is an intentional move to protect their traffic.  DoH is not an intentional choice.  They did not choose this.  If a technical friend chooses a DoH server, their laptop won&#x27;t work and I will explain, if I had not already, that DoH servers are blocked.  Anyone that knows me, would expect this behavior.  Anyone that is my friend would accept this.  We probably just have very different circles of friends.')
