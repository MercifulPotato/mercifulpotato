There has been zero such enforcement this time around. Public health powers are old, precedented and powerful. They are barely being used here.<p>I would support anonymizing the reporting. But requiring <i>some</i> kind of reporting is reasonable given the circumstances. There are too many people who would test positive and hide it, and that&#x27;s a public health risk.')
