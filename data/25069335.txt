We were all using desktops or fairly clunky laptops.  Then, out of nowhere, we have touchscreens, cameras, maps, etc AND the power of a desktop machine, in a device that&#x27;s 1&#x2F;20th the size!  It was such a staggering leap!  I think phones were technology that was so far ahead of what we were prepared for, we had no means of defence.<p>With regards to the aims of Apple, Google et al - yes I think they wanted to spy on us from the start.  It has always been about better governance of the masses.  Corporation owners think they own us - everything we are provided with is only done with a view for them to apply greater governance of us.  Historically, it would have been expedient to use stories (religions) to do this, then debt, and now technology.<p>Bringing us to the present, if you ask me, the virus we are apparently experiencing, is just a pretext.  It is just another story, that leverages us into a technocracy.  They want to boot up a technocratic system that we will all live in from cradle to grave, unaware and unable to do anything about our circumstances.  This has been planned since the 1930&#x27;s - IBM shared work space with Technocracy Inc as it was known then.<p>We are spending our time online, shopping online, isolated, dependent on corporations for the news, our food, intermediating our experiences, etc.  We are sold on the future, Elon&#x27;s neural lace, augmented reality, smart metering&#x2F;cities, etc.  I&#x27;m not joking when I say it seems to me that these plans are so progressed, and everyone is so on board, that the human experiment must surely come to an end soon.  It will be a great reset, but we&#x27;re not going to like it.<p>PS Here&#x27;s a good article from 2016:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technocracy.news&#x2F;global-smart-grid-technocracys-endgame&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.technocracy.news&#x2F;global-smart-grid-technocracys-...</a>')
