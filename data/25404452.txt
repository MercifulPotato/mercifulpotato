I don&#x27;t mean to deny the importance of the insight; a lot of people do have seriously mistaken beliefs about how social and economic facts come to be, and learning a bit of political science is a critical part of correcting those mistakes.<p>The problem is that electoral politics, at least as practiced recently in the US, rarely has much to do with this. I&#x27;m on a few donor lists, so I got a lot of political fundraising emails over the past year, and out of the candidates I can remember only <i>one</i> was focused on society and how we can make it better. The other candidates talked primarily, if not exclusively, about how terrible their Congressional opponents are and how useful my help would be to defeat their villainous ways. Whatever term you use to refer to this category of activity, I don&#x27;t think someone with an earnest interest in improving the world would choose to regularly participate in it.')
