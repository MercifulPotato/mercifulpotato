If politicians are making a habit of blaming things on the EU and implying the EU is unaccountable, that strikes me as a problem worth taking seriously. Presumably it wouldn&#x27;t work in the first place if the people had unshakeable confidence in the legitimacy of the EU.<p>&gt; The E.U. is very much a representative body<p>Sure, but I wasn&#x27;t commenting on this. My point was a specific one about perceived legitimacy, without which there can be no EU. Whether the EU is <i>actually</i> democratic, is another matter.')
