See Racing Point breaking system affair. It&#x27;s illegal for sure, but no fine has been issued because they need racing point to be there and fill up the grid.<p>On the other side, everybody knows that the &quot;over 1 thousand&quot; horsepower Mercedes engine is doing something not completely legal, the new regulation for this year were made explicitly to avoid having engines too powerful and 1 thousand horsepower was considered an hard limit, impossible to surpass, by FIA engineers, yet Mercedes it&#x27;s around 1,020 .<p>But admitting that the multi championships winner is cheating, after an investigation that without informants with very specific insider information could take years, would mean casting a very bad shadow on the entire F1 circus.')
