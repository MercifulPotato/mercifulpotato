Part of our whole goal is to find additional objective measurements that don&#x27;t need to rely solely on the patient&#x27;s reporting. For example, how one uses their phone (have they left the house? are they socializing and in touch with others? etc.) could be telling. By combining different streams of information we can relieve patients, clinicians, researchers of just relying on the types of surveys you talk about to give a more objective view of the patient. We don&#x27;t know of anyone else taking this comprehensive approach.')
