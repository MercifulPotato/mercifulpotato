I didn&#x27;t expect much, but some apps actually work really well (Element, Conversations, Android builds of my Allegro games etc.). Even tried Among Us which is a Unity game and it&#x27;s... kinda playable (there is a problem with some shaders making it hard to play, but it all works otherwise - haven&#x27;t debugged it yet though).')
