Initially, they were hacking together all the code as quickly as possible (of course that didn&#x27;t scale and had to be rewritten completely) and then they later got enough money to just brute-force development by throwing hundreds of developers at it.<p>Then they started pushing their naive ideas to everyone else (e.g. static typing, functional programming, 100% unit test coverage, Elixir...) and they put 0 focus on stuff that really matters such as keeping method parameters and return values as simple as possible, consuming events using for-await loops instead of event listener callbacks, naming variables well, separation of concerns, etc...<p>So now most of the industry knows two kinds of code: Dirty hacks or bureaucratic bloatware. Nobody knows how to code properly. There is nobody around to teach people the correct approach and there are a lot of people around to teach the incorrect approach.')
