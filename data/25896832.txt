This means that me, a blond blue eyed man (and accessorily French) could define myself as Afro-American in the US.<p>That&#x27;s not really true.  You wouldn&#x27;t be actually able to define yourself as Afro-American in the US, beyond maybe lying on a form (and even that designation would probably be overridden if it mattered).  Pretty-much everyone would consider your self-designation to be annoying BS.<p>A few full-blooded white people have tried passing as Afro-American (only possible because of the lingering effects of the one-drop rule), but they received a lot of press (and rejection) when the real story came out.')
