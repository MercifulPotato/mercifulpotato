Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601562632, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24651138, text='&gt; I think the problem in USA has more to do with how easily people are swayed by emotional arguments. It is so easy for politicians there to cause people to lose trust in a candidate just by attacking unrelated things about them.<p>In my personal opinion as an American, I feel we&#x27;ve backslid a bit since ~2010. At that point, it seemed like any nearly argument could be won by invoking science (even where it wasn&#x27;t applicable, such as metaphysical arguments about religion), and now science is merely one of &quot;many Ways of Knowing&quot; and perhaps a racist one at that. We&#x27;ve never had a complete trust in science, mind you, but even on the far right people wouldn&#x27;t attack the very idea of science and objectivity (even if they had paranoid ideas about conspiracies in the science community and so on). I&#x27;m not sure the cause, but it concerns me deeply.')
