It got exhausting. Much of the time when an app updated itself it would happily overwrite the custom icon with its own, meaning I had to run the equivalent of a cron script to open the custom-icon-installer-app periodically to put things back the way I liked them. Not sure if it&#x27;s still the case, but at some point several years ago I threw in the towel and let the dock be whatever it was going to be, based on the apps I use.<p>Those who are busy putting these in, has it gotten any better or is it still a constant game of whack-a-mole to keep your customizations?')
