It&#x27;s like watching Theranos and Enron (Tesla is currently 10x Enron market cap at peak) happen at an even larger scale from memes and hope and hero worship and fuzzy math.  It&#x27;s 2.6x Toyota&#x27;s market cap now and Toyota made 24x as many cars in 2019.  I don&#x27;t see any way &quot;future performance&quot; can make those numbers ever work.  And I assume that is why they keep shoveling this crap to retail investors.')
