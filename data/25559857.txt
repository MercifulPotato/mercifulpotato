The more land becomes an asset and the less it becomes a liability (e.g. by capping property taxes) , the greater incentive there is to hoard it and jealously guard its value with NIMBYism which leads to even less development, greater shortages and even higher prices on an upward spiral.<p>Saying &quot;it&#x27;s about supply and demand&quot; is not technically wrong but it glosses over the toxic systemic changes which brought us here and exculpates the people who deliberately fought <i>for</i> them to create this mess.<p>If land were closer to being in a liability in SF then the NIMBYism would be a pale imitation of what it is now and the land would be used <i>much</i> more efficiently and property wouldn&#x27;t be as astronomically expensive.<p>However, land owners need an economic incentive to develop that <i>requires</i> them to lose money if they use land unproductively.<p>That means taxing the value of the land - preferably directly (via LVT) but failing that by raising property taxes.')
