Your exchange with GP literally amounts to a &quot;uh huh &#x2F; nuh uh&quot;.<p>Name-calling, FWIW, is even less productive.<p><i>&gt;&gt; you needn&#x27;t know, it was corrected</i><p>There were long reports on what went wrong (and what didn&#x27;t) in 2016 polling.<p>For example, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aapor.org&#x2F;Education-Resources&#x2F;Reports&#x2F;An-Evaluation-of-2016-Election-Polls-in-the-U-S.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aapor.org&#x2F;Education-Resources&#x2F;Reports&#x2F;An-Evaluat...</a><p>More importantly, there are explanations from pollsters about what they changed and they speak openly about remaining possible sources of uncertainty&#x2F;error. See e.g. the quotes in this article: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsweek.com&#x2F;how-pollsters-changed-their-game-after-getting-2016-election-wrong-1532943" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsweek.com&#x2F;how-pollsters-changed-their-game-af...</a><p>All of this is a quick google search away, and anyone who has actually paid attention to polling knows exactly how polling has changed in the past 4 years. It&#x27;s literally impossible to read anything on this topic without knowing that polling firms openly talk about methodology changes. Therefore, your original comment was either intentionally misleading or profoundly uninformed.<p>NB: You can absolutely agree or disagree with their methodological choices, especially around &quot;shy Trump effect&quot; and whether Trafalgar-like &quot;what do your neighbors think?&quot; questions make sense.<p>But even if you disagree with their choices, <i>_it&#x27;s plainly untrue to say their attitude is &quot;you needn&#x27;t know&quot;. To the contrary, they&#x27;re quite open about how their polling methodology has changed._</i><p>Are you willing to defend with evidence and reason your initial claim that pollsters haven&#x27;t explained what they have&#x2F;haven&#x27;t done to try and correct polling methodology? Or are we just going to name-call like we&#x27;re 12 year olds on a playground&#x2F;irrelevant partisan zombies in the internet comment section?')
