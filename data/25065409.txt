The Gillette ad comes to mind as, to me at least, it legitimises and maybe even exaggerates how many males are toxic or have issues - to the point where a razor brand feels they need to step in and tell all men, &quot;hey guys, be better.&quot; (could you imagine the backlash if a tampon brand did something like this to females?)<p>Let&#x27;s be critical about this, maybe those particularly toxic males are actually exhibiting tendencies that are more to do with some sort of sociopathy rather than it being their a product purely of their gender?<p>On top of this, men are also given a lot of conflicting messaging - particularly as far as media and pop culture is concerned - on how they should behave. Couple this with the usual stats about the troubles men face and I can understand why parents are worried.')
