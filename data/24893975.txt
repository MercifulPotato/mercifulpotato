Although Adobe XD doesn&#x27;t share the same &#x27;mindshare&#x27;, the dominance of Adobe in the industry means that there is still interest in the product.<p>Will this Adobe XD update broaden the usage of the app? Only time will tell. It&#x27;s nice to see alternatives to Adobe apps though.<p>It does appear that Adobe is in the unusual position of playing catch-up in this field for once. (Another example of Adobe catching-up is on the iPad where Procreate has leapt over Adobe to dominate the digital painting app space.)')
