I once ran an A&#x2F;B test on the same page where 50% were prompted &quot;was this page helpful?&quot; and the other 50% were prompted &quot;was this page useful?&quot; and the results were different to a statistically significant degree which suggests that even minor rephrasings skew the results, so we need to all use the same terminology.<p>&gt; its a request for feedback I don&#x27;t know helps me or not<p>Yes I&#x27;m aware that readers aren&#x27;t incentivized to respond which explains why it&#x27;s rare to get higher than 5% response rate. This situation is a microcosm for documentation&#x27;s overall problem: we can&#x27;t find incentives for people to voluntarily and consistently confirm the value we provide and we don&#x27;t have any other means to prove the causality.')
