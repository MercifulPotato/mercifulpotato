Entry cost for telephony then (=building a whole new, alternative telephone network) is so expensive, that it&#x27;s unrealistic to build one, except maybe in places with such population density, that the cost of new wiring is offset by the number of new customers in a small area.<p>Compared to pulling new telephone cables for the whole country, making a new social network is very fast and cheap (apparently, takes 13(?) employees in case of instagram), and allows a slow-start (run the network on one $5 virtual machine, then get another, and another, then have issues with scaling and technical debt, but slowly fix stuff when money pours in), which means that even if facebook fails  horribly after the breakup, &#x27;someone new&#x27; will fill the gap.')
