Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606030209, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25172944, text='&gt; What point are you trying to make?<p>One can advocate for terrible things by comparing them to even worse things. That doesn&#x27;t make it ok to violate people&#x27;s rights, it just means we can find even worse examples in history. Here we have an example of a democracy violating people&#x27;s rights. Someone said government nowadays is unaccountable. I suggested that government has always been largely unaccountable. Someone said I was cynical and that democracy was good because that allows us to wrest control back from the elites. I suggested (in the form of a question) that the people in a democracy are just as capable of violating our rights as the elites. Someone else pointed out that&#x27;s better than a warlord. I observed that the warlord is also better than what he replaced. Certainly we can agree that violating people&#x27;s rights is bad, and just like we came up with something better than a warlord, we ought to be able to come up with something better than a democracy.<p>&gt; One thing can be better than another, even if that other thing is better than something else.<p>We can keep coming up with better things.')
