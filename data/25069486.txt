It briefly hugs itself sharing a vision of a world where technology doesn’t collect and manipulate. In the history of the market, have we ever accomplished that?<p>We’re not on the sidelines. We continue to actively use hardware made by others on networks run by others to push more and more data to a plethora of centralized services, and even with P2P mesh networks that won’t stop. It’s Pandora’s Box. AI may end up killing or putting us in tubes like in The Matrix just to try to save us from ourselves.<p>But if we try to stop it or slow it, we risk not finding cures for disease, dying from an asteroid or rogue black hole, not seeing more wonders of the universe, or not experiencing the 2049 holo equivalent to Brittany Spears in Toxic.')
