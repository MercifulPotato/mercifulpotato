Also we have lots of liquid water on our planet, when it interacts with solids things and&#x2F;or air, the visual complexity of the scene simply explodes. Look at boiling water, or streams of water, or shoreline. And to complicate things even more, some visuals depend on wave nature of the light: soap bubble, rainbow, or DVD disk.<p>Here’s some 15 years old tech.demo: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HsWh66MvqBg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HsWh66MvqBg</a><p>Stuff like the brick wall with these shadows and reflections is awesome fit for RT.
