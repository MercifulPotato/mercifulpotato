Remember Kuro5hin? Very healthy and thriving community destroyed by a handful of stupid trolls.<p>Have been following one of the decentralized web approaches, don&#x27;t remember, netsomething dot net, runs in the browser, very nice interface. Started promising until it got swamped with right wing lunatics doing nothing but trolling and spewing antisemitic stuff all over the place. I am not even offended, it is just a waste of my time to wade thru this trash to find some meaningful conversation.<p>Any unmoderated community is going to attract these lunatics.<p>The only places where I find meaningful conversation are topic centered Forums.\nAnything sans topic turns into a burning dumpster when unmoderated. This is humanity. The lunies get their voices amplified and the sane fall silent.')
