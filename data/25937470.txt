The specialist appointment wasn&#x27;t going to be for a month, but then they call suddenly and have a cancellation the next day. I end up having to pay full price for the specialist appointment because my insurance doesn&#x27;t like that I had two &quot;assessment&quot; appointments back to back.<p>On another occasion, I was quoted a procedure, and my decision for when I wanted to have it done was driven entirely by which insurance-year it was going to fall under, rather than by my convenience or how urgent it was, or anything else.<p>I know these are fundamentally &quot;insurance issues&quot; and I suppose better supplemental insurance could make them go away, but at the end of the day, just like with Americans, my insurance is chosen by my employer and I have basically no control over it.')
