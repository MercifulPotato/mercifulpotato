Decomposition and overlong encoding have nothing whatsoever in common.<p>&gt; There are certainly plenty of circumstances where you don&#x27;t want to allow non-canonical representations; my point was that there are more non-canonical representations than just the ones that UTF-8-level canonicality checks catch.<p>This has nothing to do with overlong encoding. Overlong encoding is nothing like decomposition. Composition and decomposition are different valid sequences of codepoints for the same grapheme cluster. Overlong encoding is the invalid non-minimal encoding of a single codepoint. It&#x27;s not just a difference of opinion as to the convenience of precomposed codepoints.')
