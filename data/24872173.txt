I find it easier to remember things I learned from long-form text rather than comments (across many sites so it&#x27;s not something only on HN). For example, I can remember things I learned from a book I read in 5th grade but I can&#x27;t remember an interesting comment I read last week about irrational investors (at least not without looking it up) even though I think I gave the same amount of attention to both.')
