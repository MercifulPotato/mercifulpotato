Item(by='eropple', descendants=None, kids=[25939288, 25932355], score=None, time=1611758799, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25928424, text='In America at least, the only way to make a significantly better desk than an IKEA one at similar prices is to omit the costs of tools and labor.<p>Even after omitting the very significant cost of tooling (my corner clamp jigs for cabinetry cost half what a GALANT table does), getting good material you actually want will easily hit a hundred bucks for a fairly small, plywood-based desk. (Baltic birch isn&#x27;t cheap! But it&#x27;s cheaper than solid wood.)<p>I would rather own that desk, for sure, but it&#x27;s not cheaper, and IKEA is pretty amazing at what kind of quality they offer at what prices--sure it&#x27;s all fiberboard or cheap wood, but it&#x27;s reasonably reliable and it&#x27;s impressive that it&#x27;s doable at that scale at all.')
