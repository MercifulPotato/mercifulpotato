Item(by='floatingatoll', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601847610, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24682351, text='GPA is a biased criteria in an education system where some people have disproportionate access to educational resources. The United States is one such system, with white people and affluent people having considerable advantages^ over others.<p>The post’s author correctly observes that the resulting random lottery will accurately represent the biases that influenced the applicant pool, and therefore the outcome will be a school that reinforces societal biases rather than weakening them.<p>The error in reasoning here is in the relative evaluation of “bias in entrance exams” versus “bias in GPAs”. The school has thrived under the former bias, and the essence of the issue is simple:<p>Which biases are healthier for students and society? The biases of school’s exam process, or the biases of GPA?<p>And that phrasing highlights a particularly ugly truth that most of the citizens supporting this change will do everything in their power to refuse recognizing consciously:<p>“A system that’s biased towards my family’s skin color and&#x2F;or wealth level is better for my family than any system that is not biased in my family’s favor, no matter how good it may be for society in general.”<p>^ For example, “test prep” biases GPAs towards students with wealth and free time, against students with evening&#x2F;weekend jobs and family responsibilities.')
