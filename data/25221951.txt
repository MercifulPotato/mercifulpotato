But I wonder if Dan would make it through the average Facebook engineer interview without his Redux cred however.<p>He is also the rare person who is very honest about this kind of thing which is refreshing. For example he claims he only vaguely understands time complexity (&quot;nested loops are bad&quot;).<p>I don&#x27;t know exactly what point I&#x27;m making here, besides there can be a disconnect between a developer interview process and what people actually contribute. I think engineers should strive to be solid at the fundamentals, but at the same time there are very productive people who just learn as they go. Also, it takes a village so to speak, and over-optimizing for Comp Sci majors who drill LeetCode may not be the best long term choice for building teams either.')
