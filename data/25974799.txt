Maybe I&#x27;m discounting those benefits but the penalties are very real. 2x performance penalties in performance sensitive code and blurry scalable content like fonts are real downsides.<p>Looking further down the thread what I think would be the ideal solution is what is being proposed and doesn&#x27;t get any response:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.freedesktop.org&#x2F;archives&#x2F;wayland-devel&#x2F;2013-May&#x2F;009512.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lists.freedesktop.org&#x2F;archives&#x2F;wayland-devel&#x2F;2013-Ma...</a><p>The current solution actually seems much more complex than this as the protocol needs to actually know about scaling instead of the scaling factor being just some metadata about how things should be and have been rendered and everything else would be within the client and compositor code.<p>&gt; How do you render a 20px tall font at scale 1 2&#x2F;3 without being blurry or without rounding errors?<p>Fonts are not sized in pixels for the most part. Modern fonts are resolution independent and the renderers try hard to fit it to however many pixels you have. By faking them out and telling them &quot;here&#x27;s a 200x200 box to do your work&quot; and then later scaling down that box to 150x150 prevents that code from working properly.<p>&gt; What happens when you try to stretch this window across multiple screens?<p>For this case your render at the maximum of the two fractional scales and scale down in the lowest one. It&#x27;s no worse than the current solution for that screen and better for the one that matches.')
