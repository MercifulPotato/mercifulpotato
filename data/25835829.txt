I constantly get distracted by things I need to do at home, or wanting to do hobbies, etc. and I don&#x27;t have a good workspace like I did at work.<p>WFH and the ability now to work from anywhere is great in a way. At least half my team has no plan to return to office full time. I do think, though, that collaboration and the soft skills of our work area will suffer. There is a <i>lot</i> of collaboration, discussion, and coalition building done in person, in hallways and over lunch that doesn&#x27;t happen nearly as well on Zoomslack.<p>Anyway, yeah, it sucks, and I miss the old world.')
