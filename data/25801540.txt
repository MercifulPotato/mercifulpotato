Even if you&#x27;re only doing one data source, if you want analysis to be easy later you&#x27;ll likely want to sync all fields available from the api (as you probably don&#x27;t know what fields are of interest before analysis).<p>If you imagine doing this for Stripe say, there&#x27;s a huge amount of fields available in different objects (charges, invoices, subscriptions etc) and you need to add these as columns to your relation database of a data warehouse. Unnesting may also be needed. That&#x27;s very tedious work and on top of it you need to run, monitor and maintain the extraction process.<p>Even a small company could easily have 10+ data sources containing dozens of tables that they want to sync to a warehouse so this quickly becomes unmanageable. Hence companies like Stitchdata, Fivetran and now Airbyte now selling it as a service.')
