Every time we hit an (aparently) unsummable problem, we made good note of the issues we had and took the substance, previously and carefully tested. This was years ago. We never went back to the substance because we managed to solve most of our issues.<p>Nothing opens the soul (figuratively) as much as this substance. I still can&#x27;t even begin to comprehend why MDMA is still illegal.<p>With (huge) caution, I would recommend anyone who struggles with PTSD and trauma related couple issues to first seek professional counseling, second, read as much as they can and then consider using MDMA on a therapy setting.')
