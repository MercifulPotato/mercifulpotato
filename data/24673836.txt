Mobile carriers and governments have <i>never</i> allowed just “anything“ installed on phones.<p>&gt; I think the concern is it didn&#x27;t evolve naturally.. it evolved to this configuration due to the whims of a few companies in strong monopoly positions.<p>What’s “natural?” Markets are not created by god, they’re created by customers.   Apple didn’t build the most successful product line in history because of monopoly practices - they built it because customers wanted it.   And,  Apple isn’t a monopoly by any historical definition of the term.  Google is one in search and have tried to parlay that into Android.  Illegally?  We will see.<p>&gt; Believing that we have the best solution available is again, a bit disconcerting.<p>I don’t claim we have the best solution available, I claim that government regulation of app stores or forced disaggregation of app stores would make the current situation far worse.<p>Want a better situation?  Build a new and better  ecosystem.  It wasn’t even 6 years ago that Apple and iPhone and iPad was declared dead by most pundits, about to get trammelled by Samsung and Chinese Android makers.  Now we want government to turn them into a utility?  These decisions and laws take decades.<p>&gt; The government won. Then the next administration basically vacated the actions against them. People care.<p>There was a second consent decree.  It arguably didn’t really matter, because the next generation was mobile.<p>And I’m sure some people care about Microsoft’s continued dominance of PCs, but not enough to convince a government to do anything about it.<p>The same likely goes with iOS and Android.  I see a lot of devs&#x2F;publishers complaining and not a lot of users.')
