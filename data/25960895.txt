That is QAnon-level evidence-free conspiracy theorizing. The clearing houses were demanding more collateral and brokerages couldn&#x27;t afford or didn&#x27;t want to put it up.<p>&gt; whether shorting 136% of the stock counts as outright manipulation<p>I refer you to the snarky top comment about how all the Dunning-Kruger victims who claim manipulation do not actually know what manipulation is. Shorting a stock is not manipulation and neither is lots of people deciding to short a stock. 136% of the stock is shorted because a lot of people were shorting it, not because Some Guy decided to single-handedly short 136% of the float.<p>&gt;  Reddit kids have done nothing but pop an artificial bubble<p>So GameStop was an artificial bubble at $10 but not at $500?
