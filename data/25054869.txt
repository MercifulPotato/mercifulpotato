There’s a small segment of people who actually have consumed the material and believe in it, and a much larger set who have heard of it and have a vague (and possibly wrong) notion of what “side” it’s on. I think due to the repugnant nature of the movement, most of that commentary is going to come from the left, so mostly left-wing people will form an opinion. Most of the people who are favorable toward QAnon in those polls on both the left and right probably have little idea of what it actually is.<p>See: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;28&#x2F;bush-did-north-dakota&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;slatestarcodex.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;28&#x2F;bush-did-north-dakota&#x2F;</a>')
