It&#x27;s tens of times cheaper to produce, and I&#x27;d venture to say that it might as well be several times less healthy than the original.<p>Same thing for &quot;grana padano&quot;.<p>If you don&#x27;t know anything about wood pulp in the parmesan, or fake olive oil, I suggest you read &quot;real food, fake food&quot; [0]. It opened my eyes.<p>I guess the reason why the Italian consortium sent this (otherwise stupid) cease-and-desist to this poor Australian guy, is because they&#x27;re desperately trying to defend the real stuff from the fakes.<p>I sympathize with the guy, but it&#x27;s a global battle; and organizations that are supposed to defend the consumer are doing next to nothing (expecially in the US). This is not about protecting a &quot;brand&quot;; it&#x27;s about the fact that when you buy grana padano in the US and it&#x27;s made of sh*t, you as a consumer should be able to tell.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Real-Food-Fake-Youre-Eating&#x2F;dp&#x2F;1616204214" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Real-Food-Fake-Youre-Eating&#x2F;dp&#x2F;161620...</a>')
