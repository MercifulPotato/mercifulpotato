Heller).<p>It&#x27;s a situation where there are two classes, the haves and have nots. If you aren&#x27;t politically connected in NJ, NY, CA, etc - good luck. If you exercise these rights, you will end up in a prison cell.<p>Even places like PA - a very gun friendly state - this is working its way through the courts for other reasons. For example, in Philadelphia they have closed the permitting office repeatedly for COVID, bystepping the law which requires them to issue a permit in 45 days, by simply not accepting applications.<p>That&#x27;s America.<p>I can only hope the SCOTUS will take up new cases on this.')
