I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t answer your question right now, as I have no idea why anyone would do that (as opposed to, say, vector-valued rewards---i.e., why is the ability to complex-multiply two complex rewards relevant, as opposed to merely comparing separate components of rewards from R^2). I&#x27;ll have to read up on the subject :)')
