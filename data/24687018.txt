I&#x27;ve seen a lot more hours wasted on lost commits than I find credible to be wasted in slightly more verbose history.<p>Squashing also turns cherry picked commits into merge conflicts.<p>I&#x27;m not a fan. I can always go back to the feature PR and read the ticket details and diff commentary when I want the history with a full diff. And of course very old history isn&#x27;t very relevant because less of it remains in the present, so rot of ancillary systems isn&#x27;t a huge concern.')
