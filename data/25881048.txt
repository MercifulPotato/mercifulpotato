Can&#x27;t take it seriously without any mention of that. Bitcoin is mined where it makes profit, and you can&#x27;t make any profit without using waste electricity. Today&#x27;s mining hardware is smart enough to turn off when the powerplant signals there is too much demand and no waste (thus increased prices), and turn back on when convenient.')
