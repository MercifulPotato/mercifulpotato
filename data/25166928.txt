I&#x27;m writing this from Windows 7 as we speak. I also have 10 installed on this PC. I prefer 7. I have SMB1 and RDP turned off, I&#x27;m not really worried it&#x27;ll get owned through my router either. I don&#x27;t use anti-virus either, but then again, I also don&#x27;t run random exes that arrive in email or through an ad.')
