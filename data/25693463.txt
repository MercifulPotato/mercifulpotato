Some people just don&#x27;t make that much salvia for example and get dental problems way more than others, even with identical dental care behaviors and diet of someone with pretty much no dental problems.<p>Also it prevents bigger issues in the future that a socialized healthcare system would have to pay for.  Cheap socialized dental care basics I think is a net positive for a society in general.  The poor will be more productive and create more tax revenue than the amount of money put into it.')
