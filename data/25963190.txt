There&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with either - any more than there is with e.g., English being a language with thousands of &quot;hidden&quot; words that people have to learn and remember instead of limiting you to only the words visible in an autotext menu - but you have to think about how people learn them, how consistently they&#x27;re available, how to accommodate people not knowing them or learning them at different rates, etc.<p>HN commenters tend to be power users of desktop-style UI more than touch or mobile-style UI which can make it hard to see similarities between them (right click conventions really aren&#x27;t much more consistent or obvious than swipe conventions)')
