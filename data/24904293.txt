The fact that the rules of a game can be adjusted to drive it away from optimum -- far away, sometimes even to the opposite extrema -- is a pretty basic economic concept and this is a pretty basic example of that concept. Market inefficiency 101 type stuff. That&#x27;s why everyone else here is focusing on the metagame.<p>And no, 2.5% is not typical. Maybe Walmart gets 2.5%.
