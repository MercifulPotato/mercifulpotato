The vast majority of MPs (including ex-PM May, for example) supported UK staying in the EU ...<p>Then there&#x27;s things like how almost all countries have rules requiring a supermajority in any vote leading to major constitutional change ... but the advisory vote of the referendum was passed on the slimmest of margins. If the vote has been &quot;leave with no deal&quot; then the Leave, camp (funded heavily by a Russian oligarch as we now know) would have lost the vote.<p>The whole point of our UK democracy was supposed to be to allow complex decisions to be made without simplistic populism.<p>The economic experts, the scientific experts, the political experts, the legal experts ... amongst these groups the consensus was very clearly for remaining in the EU. It was an act of subversion to arrange a referendum with no clear aim (contrary to the election manifesto) in which the population could be swayed with simple lies.<p>It hasn&#x27;t even brought the much maligned sovereignty, instead we had an unlawful prorogation of parliament and because of the removal of oversight the current Covid19 crisis has been used to route 100s of Â£millions to Tory owned corporations under the guise of buying PPE which simply hasn&#x27;t been delivered (or has and had been deficient ... but that&#x27;s no surprise, none of these companies were previously PPE suppliers).<p>What constitutes rationality in a democracy surely is open, fair, and democratic as a first step. It&#x27;s truthful and forthright. These words do not fit this process at all.<p>Convincing people through lies to vote against their own interests isn&#x27;t democracy.<p>Convince me.<p>[<i>These views are my own and do not relate to my employment.</i>]')
