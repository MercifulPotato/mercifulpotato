I wasn&#x27;t aware Canonical had an &quot;online PXE&quot; flavour that you linked, TIL.<p>I say all this above, but I&#x27;m sure there are still shops out there burning ISOs to CDs (maybe USB now!) and hand installing everything - if I&#x27;ve learned anything, it&#x27;s that nobody seems to agree on how to do stuff the same way. :) Each company is it&#x27;s own beautiful unique snowflake full of their own design  and deployment patterns.')
