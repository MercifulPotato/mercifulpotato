Others decide to hold on to the mantra and feel a need to be arrogant or dismissive to those they disagree with.<p>I respect fellow front-enders who are happy doing things their way. Not everyone needs Tailwind. But it&#x27;s frustrating to and honestly somewhat baffling to see a bunch of them dig their heels in the sand and defend their approach by assuming all the rest of us just &quot;don&#x27;t know CSS&quot;. It&#x27;s a minority, but a vocal one.')
