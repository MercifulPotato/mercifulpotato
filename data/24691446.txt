Future allocations on the stack bump the pointer further downwards to grow the stack further. This leaves the 128 bytes of the red zone always below the stack.<p>EDIT: to clarify the red zone is below the stack pointer conceptually (below the stack) but higher in memory actually (since the stack grows downwards).')
