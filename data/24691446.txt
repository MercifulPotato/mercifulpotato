See the reply to this for a correction. I shall leave it here as a monument to my shame.<p>Yes, so since the stack grows downwards, we subtract the size of the red zone from the top of the stack (represented by the stack pointer), moving the new stack pointer down.<p>This &quot;grows&quot; the stack (downwards remember) by the size of the red zone. Future allocations on the stack bump the pointer further downwards to grow the stack further. This leaves the 128 bytes of the red zone always below the stack.<p>EDIT: to clarify the red zone is below the stack pointer conceptually (below the stack) but higher in memory actually (since the stack grows downwards).')
