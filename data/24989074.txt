Why. Because many of them drive for more than one of these companies at the same time. And I don’t mean they work sometimes for one and sometimes for another, I mean they’ll have two or more apps open at the same time.<p>This is vastly different than say working 20 hours a week at Walmart and another 20 at Costco.<p>Think about this: if drivers were “employees” who then logically could only work for one (at a time) how would a competitor enter the marketplace if driving for the new guy prohibited you from also working for Uber? If the new player has insufficient ride volume it’s a huge barrier to entry.<p>The fact that drivers themselves seemed to reject this just shows what a bad idea this is.<p>I mean what’s next? Overtime? Making it hard to “fire” drivers?<p>And as for a notion of a minimum wage for drivers, if they for 3 different companies in an hour who pays that?<p>Don’t follow NYC’s example of steadily recreating the taxi medallions system (eg driver quotas and tax measures to drive the cost up; Uber is essentially twice the cost it was 5 years ago).')
