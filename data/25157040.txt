Or, maybe they don&#x27;t respond and now the original poster doesn&#x27;t feel the community is supporting them. This asymmetry can lead to poor communication in the community.<p>I&#x27;ve been working on an app and was reading about the pros and cons of going freemium vs. pay up-front. I was surprised to read that people suggested the pay model is better for indie devs because with free, you&#x27;ll have more users, but you&#x27;ll also get worse feedback from the free users. Maybe there&#x27;s a correlation between seeing something as free and feeling that the work behind it is trivial?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;o_4EX4dPppA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;o_4EX4dPppA</a>')
