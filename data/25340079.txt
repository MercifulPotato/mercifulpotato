Things can go pear-shaped remarkably quickly.  Numerours modern shipping disasters  have transpired in a few minutes, or less.  (<i>Edmund Fitzgerald</i>, <i>Costa Concordia</i>, <i>MV Sewol</i>, <i>Estonia</i>, <i>El Faaro</i>, ...)  Size alone is no guarantee <i>at all</i> of safety, and can work catastrophically against you if below-decks.<p>- Easier said than done:  avoid panicking, and avoid <i>both</i> panicky <i>and</i> oblivious people.  If you&#x27;re good at keeping a clear head and <i>useful</i> goal focus during crisis, so much the better. Even if you do, others panicking <i>or</i> ignoring clear dangeer can kill you (usually along with themselves).  The aspect of <i>Titanic</i> dramatisations I&#x27;ve found  most compelling is noting who realises when that the ship is in fact doomed, and how they respond.  Some early, some late, some never, some quietly, some loudly, some selflessly, some selfishly.<p>Once off the stricken vessel, survival depends on keeping your head above water, literally, and remainung uninjured, warm, dry (generally), hydrated and fed (if rescue is not immediate), healthy, and rescued or returned  to hospitable land.  Survival even in very cold water is generally not an <i>immediate</i> threat.  Drowning, injury from falling debris  or flotsam, and hyperthermia are the most immediate risks.  Past a day or so, hydration, food, and exposure become more critical.  Shipwreck survivors have lasted <i>months</i> on rations, fish, and rainwater, in instances.<p>Signalling your location or attracting attention through orange equipment (many rescue evacuation craft, survival suits, life jackets), flags, flares, beacons, strobes, radio locators, mirrors, or fires (avoid burning your craft), etc., help.')
