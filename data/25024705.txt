There are a small subset of extremist on either side, and when people argue, they&#x27;re pointing out the worst things the other side&#x27;s extremists did. Calling each other KKK and Antifa and racist and SJW. Realistically, between those two extremes, the majority of people are good well meaning people who just don&#x27;t know what the truth is anymore due to all the lies and disinformation on the web. All the clickbait shoving the most rage inducing stories about the other side all day long.')
