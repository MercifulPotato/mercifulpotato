Item(by='fortran77', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612026131, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25970226, text='Yes! In fact I own one of each. A Bolt, a Volt, and a Tesla &quot;S&quot;. Each are good in their class. No major problems with any of them. (Actually, the &quot;S&quot; has been in the shop more times than the other two, which have never needed a repair other than routine service.)<p>It&#x27;s a shame the &quot;Volt&quot; was discontinued because it was a great concept and the car works well. Unlike the fake &quot;Plug-in Prius&quot; -- which can&#x27;t go faster than about 30 MPH without the gas engine kicking in -- the Volt is 100% electric on its ~ 50 mile range before the ICE will turn on. I got it for the occasional long drive I need to do.')
