Another factor is that humans as a group tend to force other humans to commercialize what they do, even if they expressly don&#x27;t want to do that and would rather publish it without ads, without paywalls, without subscriptions, etc.<p>We do a poor job of making it possible for people who create open source and people who create free content to get enough money out of that to give things away freely in service of their ideals. And after a while, people sometimes get fed up with working for free, seeing it benefit other people and not benefit them.<p>I complain a lot about that wrt to my own writing, but I&#x27;m not the only one. I&#x27;ve seen posts recently that complain about big companies using open source and&#x2F;or open source providers being fed up with working for free.<p>Just a couple of things that come readily to mind:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25186890" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25186890</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25032105" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25032105</a><p>I find this maddening, especially when the idea of UBI is so popular. We actively punish people doing good works and tell them &quot;Up yours. If you are an idealist, you can do it for free and find some other way to pay your bills.&quot; and then also say &quot;We should just give money away to all the poor people simply for existing&quot; while not actually making that a reality.<p>Talk of UBI makes me think of people I have known in the past who would make conditional promises, like &quot;If I win the lottery, I will give you half.&quot; Somewhere along the way I figured out that &quot;a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush&quot; and to not trust &quot;naked men offering you the shirt off their back.&quot;<p>People who actually want to make something happen will do the small thing in their power to accomplish today. People who make big promises based on long-shot bets (or on the idea that you need to make a big sacrifice before they will consider doing something for you -- and, no, it&#x27;s not a stated as part of some kind of enforceable contract) are con artists, liars, manipulators and people wanting to be seen as &quot;good guys&quot; based on hot air without having to go through the pain and suffering typically required to do any real good in this world.<p>If you want a better world, pry open your wallet and give a dollar to Patreon for an independent artist or a $5 PayPal tip or something.<p>It&#x27;s sort of a myth that big problems need big solutions. The antidote to a behemoth problem is often not some other equally powerful behemoth. It&#x27;s often enough &quot;little&quot; solutions to weigh as much, so to speak.<p>Start investing in the small answers. They are easier to reach and support and more likely to be a real antidote.')
