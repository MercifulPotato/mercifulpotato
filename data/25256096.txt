If I am out and a team member can&#x27;t read my code to troubleshoot a critical issue, I have let my team down. If I change projects and the next programmer can&#x27;t easily pick up my work, I have let my team down.<p>Approach it from that perspective. If a &quot;rock star&quot; is coding above someone&#x27;s head and making sweeping changes, that is a liability. The moment you feel out of your depth, that is the heart of the code review. A line-by-line reading from that point is a waste of your time.<p>If the 22-year-old junior on my team said to me, &quot;I tried to review your code, but I don&#x27;t understand this section with the generic functions,&quot; that to me would be the value--not whether I followed our guidelines or made some minor mistake. That&#x27;s an opportunity for me to improve the maintainability of my code and help my teammate improve their knowledge.<p>You should be able to carry out your code review with this teammate in that way with confidence in my opinion. If you feel like you can&#x27;t, that seems dysfunctional to me.')
