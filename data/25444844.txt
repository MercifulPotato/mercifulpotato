[1]<p>&gt; Real-time reporting through secure, HIPAA compliant cloud connection [1]<p>My understanding is that a major hurdle was the FDA requiring test results be reported back to health authorities. Or at least there has been a lot of disagreement on the issue [2]. It&#x27;s a bit unclear if the reporting via the app is 100% mandatory but I would bet on it sending at least something indicating positive&#x2F;negative by default.<p>I&#x27;d expect the majority of the per unit cost to be the digital test reader and Bluetooth capability. I&#x27;m skeptical if this is anything more than a fancy camera + Bluetooth like digital pregnancy tests.
