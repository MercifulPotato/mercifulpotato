Capital investment allows spending - assuming the recipient needs to spend the money; giving $1,000&#x2F;month UBI to everyone 18+ years of age, you can bet 95%+ of them will spend it, it won&#x27;t sit in a bank account, and it will lead to an ROI - even if that&#x27;s personal development or quality of life improvement that will have cascading, lifelong productivity benefits to (including counter counter-productivity).<p>Does this author have vested, financial interest-motive in Bitcoin or other crypto-&quot;currencies&quot; - which centralized digital currencies (legitimately fiat, a better transparent version of)?<p>Edit to add: looks like they likely do, re: a project they list in this site&#x27;s menu - oh, and in their about me: &quot;Early Bitcoin adopter, now Bitcoin Cash supporter.&quot; Would it not have been best practice for the author to list their vested interests as they&#x27;re writing about a competing product&#x2F;offering?<p>Imagine if everyone countering the positive narrative (propaganda in part) perpetuated by the &quot;army of HODLers&quot; was financially incentivized to counter that narrative whenever they had a chance, and not only that but proselytized their position, Bitcoin et al would have never reached its position today and many people who bought into the hype - or even killed themselves because of their losses - would have not unnecessarily, unreasonably transferred their wealth to someone else; a true centralized digital currency could take the cash you transfer into the digital currency &quot;out of circulation&quot; instead of giving it to someone, Bitcoin et al similarly structured - the &quot;army of HODLers&quot; are akin to a religion that&#x27;s financially incentivized - even Fred Wilson - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;avc.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;orthodoxy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;avc.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;orthodoxy&#x2F;</a> - stated he dislikes the cult-like behaviour of some in their community, without realizing he&#x27;s in the community but just taking a priest-like role where he&#x27;s in a more refined position and better controls his behaviour&#x2F;image.<p>I am glad higher profile individuals are starting to voice their opposition, dislike of Bitcoin et al - Elon Musk recently tweeting out &quot;Bitcoin is almost as bs as fiat money;&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;elonmusk&#x2F;status&#x2F;1340588909974200321" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;elonmusk&#x2F;status&#x2F;1340588909974200321</a> - fiat currency can shift into a better system supported by immutable, transparent blockchain - but with centralized control so no shenanigans can occur hidden from other allied nations you&#x27;re trying to fairly balance economies with, arguably who will all be democratically elected governments, democracies.<p>Edit to add: With the growing &quot;army of HODLers&quot; with more vested asset holders waiting for the value of Bitcoin et al to recover and then some - while chanting the mantra &quot;HODL!&quot; - we need to pay attention to counter regulatory capture that this newer industrial complex will work towards.')
