Like if they were working on UFO-like crafts, why wouldn&#x27;t you just keep it completely secret. It&#x27;s not like China is going to care about US patents, so whom is it for, US companies? Or is this just a show for the media to a. normalize UFO&#x27;s for some reason (make pilots more likely to report strange things they encounter)? b. some kind of psy-op to either distract the public or adversaries')
