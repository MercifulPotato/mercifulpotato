To fully understand this kind of emergence you need to realize even the following video is in the same category of phenomenology called &quot;emergence&quot;:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5v5eBf2KwF8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=5v5eBf2KwF8</a><p>Atoms themselves &quot;emerge&quot; from probability waves, not the other way around.<p>On a wild tangent: I believe all emergent patterns represent &quot;negative entropy&quot; so I claim this disproves the Second Law of Thermodynamics, because it fails to take into account (i.e. quantify) &quot;pattern-ness&quot; or &quot;order&quot; in systems. Total entropy of the universe maybe doesn&#x27;t increase but remains at zero, where the order perfectly counterbalances the randomness. Since there&#x27;s no way to &quot;measure&quot; order in a system, the Second Law remains somewhat philosophical despite it being consistent with &#x27;gross averages&#x27; measurements like temperatures, pressures, volumes, etc., in classical systems for which essentially only one side of the equation can be quantified.')
