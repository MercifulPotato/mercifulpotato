Amazon penalizes sellers who offer their amazon items for less on other online retailers.<p>Also, UPC codes are entirely controlled by a single company called GS1, start at $25 each.  It&#x27;s also worth noting that GS1 has been compromised multiple times, allowing overseas hackers to list &quot;copycat&quot; products with cloned UPC&#x27;s defrauding legitimate sellers.  Ironically, invalidating the whole reason UPC codes were invented in the first place.')
