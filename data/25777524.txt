While I can get over that without issues, I find it&#x27;s missing a button. The Pebble Time has a great UI for music control requiring 3 buttons (up&#x2F;pause&#x2F;down) and a back button that is incredibly convenient and I just haven&#x27;t seen matched anywhere yet.<p>I think I actually prefer this project over the Pine Time because it has E-Paper, no touch screen, it looks nice and developing for it may be simpler.')
