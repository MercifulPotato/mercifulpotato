Numorous times trying to call out someone not civil will put you in the not civil category. That&#x27;s why systems like HN aren&#x27;t necessarily encouraging of open discourse. Many don&#x27;t want to get judged, and judging is all many do, downvoting based on rhetoric and neuance (or lack thereof). And, the achilles heel is the downvote as the not-civil vote, except there is no discourse because you can&#x27;t reply to a downvote.')
