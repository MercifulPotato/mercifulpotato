I think a range between around £60k to £110k is in line with what i&#x27;ve seen on offer for senior (source: i&#x27;ve spent most of this year looking for work, and this is pretty much what i&#x27;ve seen)<p>It depends far more on the company than anything else. I&#x27;ve seen engineers earning over £120k that wouldn&#x27;t have been able to get hired as senior at my last role, where the senior salary was in the £70-80k range.')
