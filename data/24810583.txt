Item(by='reggieband', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602947776, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24806405, text='&gt; Start spamming child porn and other problematic posts until the moderators just decide they&#x27;re spending too much time moderating that repo and need to shut it down, even if the developer has done nothing wrong.<p>How is that different from right now? Changing the default visibility of posted content from public to private doesn&#x27;t change the ability of anyone to spam anything. You either have to clear out your moderation queue OR clear out your publicly visible forum after the fact. And isn&#x27;t that better? By forcing moderation you are preventing that horrific content from being visible while you were asleep overnight. Right now the forum owner can just shrug it off &quot;oops, I was asleep, not my problem&quot;. Without Section 230 that might not be permissible.<p>&gt; you are willfully ignoring second and third order effects to continue this thought experiment where people are routinely showing that these secondary and* tertiary effects will be crippling to more than just social media companies.<p>In what ways has anyone show any secondary or tertiary effect that would be crippling? I would avoid allowing public comments on my blog? I would avoid creating a public discussion forum? I fail to see this as crippling.<p>I think people are vastly overestimating the impact of re-publishing the content of others on their personal lives. Yes, it could cripple some potential businesses. But my point is: should those businesses exist? Let&#x27;s really think about exactly what we are giving up, not this fear mongering &quot;destroys the Internet&quot;. Let&#x27;s be specific. What would we lose that cannot be replaced?')
