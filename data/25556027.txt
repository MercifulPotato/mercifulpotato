It is a large ISA, which means you don&#x27;t have the option of making e.g. small specialized co-processors based on the ISA. Nor can you make simple CPUs for the microcontroller market.<p>The RISC-V BOOM has half the silicon area requirement of a comparable ARM Cortex CPU, is OpenPower based chips able to match that?<p>If you already have a large instruction-set I don&#x27;t quite see the value in an extendable ISA. You cannot keep the ISA lean as micro-architecture best practices change.')
