Thank you for the correction.<p>Countries have whole net of iou-s between them and debts are not always expected to be paid back in full.<p>Some money borrowed comes from private market that you can disregard completely if you decide it was a bad idea and don&#x27;t intend to repeat it in the future.<p>Yes. Hyperinflation is a thing but I wonder how high (stable) inflation you could have by just printing new money and using it to finance budget directly while preventing banks from inflating money supply with credit.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the solution is, but I think assuming that because there&#x27;s some monetary debt now it will all have to be paid back in the future is wrong because that&#x27;s not what eventually is going to happen.')
