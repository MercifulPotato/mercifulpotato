I get the sense saying &quot;we&#x27;re consuming plastics&quot; causes concern because plastics are generally demonized and looked upon as &quot;bad&quot;.<p>But we consume a lot of stuff unintentionally.  Fine sand is blown around and deposited on food that we consume.  But sand is &quot;natural&quot; so it&#x27;s ok.  But it&#x27;s really just silicon dioxide mixed with other random minerals.  Is that a problem?  We know inhaling silicon dioxide is bad for you, but eating it?  It is an approved food additive.')
