It is simple in the ways C is and the gotchas are all things i do naturally based on C. I like having structs and like having to check errors in each call. It forces one to concretize the idea that any reference to anything off of the CPU or the RAM might do anything. You have to have an error strategy for robust code. I donâ€™t think people complain that Linux code does a lot of error checking. To be sure I mostly use to for network servers or making a lot of network calls quickly. (E.g. I have tools to do stuff in AWS that can reliably get S3 to start throwing 503 errors in Go. But they can re-encrypt a ton of data using one host and a small amount of time.')
