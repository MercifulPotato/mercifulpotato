I also agree that bootstrapping is better in principle.<p>The search path (in nix?) thing, I don&#x27;t fully get -- can you expand what you mean? Concerning not needing to patch upstream -- the world is full of setup.py scripts and other cruft that tries to download random stuff from the internet or write and read hardcoded system paths -- how do you deal with that?<p>&gt; It&#x27;s funny that you mention &quot;non-machine editable Scheme code&quot;. In the Lisp world, code is data<p>One of the ego-salving lies lispers like to tell themselves ;) If it were so they&#x27;d enjoy world class refactoring, whereas in reality they can&#x27;t even auto-indent code without manually futzing around with symbol properties in emacs. I haven&#x27;t fully traced how guix update works, but looking at edit-expression it doesn&#x27;t look very code-is-data to me (the replacement function operates at character not ast&#x2F;sexp level; read is only called for side-effect as a hack twice).')
