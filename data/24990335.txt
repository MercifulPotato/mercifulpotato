There is usually a national dataset for each country that contains more records than eBird. It can be good to know that there is a website gbif.org that collects many of these kinds of datasets.<p>The eBird dataset is available from gbif here:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gbif.org&#x2F;dataset&#x2F;4fa7b334-ce0d-4e88-aaae-2e0c138d049e" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gbif.org&#x2F;dataset&#x2F;4fa7b334-ce0d-4e88-aaae-2e0c138...</a><p>It contains 705 million occurences. Can be compared with a Swedish dataset, Artportalen, that contains about a tenth of that, but that is just for Sweden<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gbif.org&#x2F;dataset&#x2F;38b4c89f-584c-41bb-bd8f-cd1def33e92f" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gbif.org&#x2F;dataset&#x2F;38b4c89f-584c-41bb-bd8f-cd1def3...</a><p>In Sweden, majority of all birders report to Artportalen. I don&#x27;t think eBird get much data at all, in comparison, for Sweden.\nEDIT: According to gbif, eBird has about 1 million occurences for Sweden, compared with 78 million for Sweden in Artportalen')
