I got fed up with how slow it was becoming and how it was running my fans all the time.<p>Unfortunately, two things happened that made me quit Safari:<p>- I found some weird bug wherein whenever I typed an address in the address bar it would always slow down to a crawl<p>- Apple deprecated and abandoned old extensions. So I lost most of my very valuable extensions, with emphasis on uBlock Origin and Reddit Enhancement Suite. I could live with a different adblocker (I saw adguard at the time), but I could not live without RES. No way.<p>So I left Safari and have since moved to Firefox. It seems almost as fast as Chrome, has nice integrations and features, but it&#x27;s no Safari. It still drains my battery and has issues. Firefox has since progressively added PiP (even if it&#x27;s not native) and support for media keys, which was a godsend, so that&#x27;s nice.<p>I&#x27;d like to get back to Safari. It would be amazing. Do you know if there is any way for me to get what I used to have back? uBlock Origin (or something with compatible filter lists and custom rules) and Reddit Enhancement Suite?')
