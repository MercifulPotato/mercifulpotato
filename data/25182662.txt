They aren&#x27;t obvious because bias isn&#x27;t necessarily obvious.<p>For example, here&#x27;s a study where candidates with the same cv differ only by name.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.insidehighered.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;07&#x2F;new-study-finds-discrimination-against-women-and-racial-minorities-hiring-sciences" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.insidehighered.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;07&#x2F;new-study-fin...</a><p>I gotta run, so I don&#x27;t have time to cite it, but women, controlling for job qualifications and profession, earn 98% for every dollar a man earns.  That may not seem like much, but the effect is enhanced by hiring and promotion differences and other effects of bias.<p>As to your question of not getting the benefit, how do you know that gender bias didn&#x27;t help you get hired or affect your pay? Are you so sure that if you were a woman, you would have been hired, paid, and promoted just like you were now?<p>Regardless, policies are based on affecting the most good for the most people, not on helping you.')
