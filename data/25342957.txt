I can’t imagine any government staying out of something so core to a nations id. I’m asking though, I’m not sure!<p>I suggest looking around the world in space, but also looking through history in time.<p>Around the world: look at countries that don&#x27;t produce much food of their own, but import a lot instead.  Those countries might still have food regulation, but they won&#x27;t have a local food growers lobby asking for subsidies.<p>Throughout history: Have a look at eg the British Corn Laws and the aftermath of their repeal.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Corn_Laws" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Corn_Laws</a><p>&gt; With that said my understanding of the farm bill is that one of the pillar purposes of its creation by FDR in the new deal was to control the cost of food.<p>Much of the New Deal was meant to increase the price of (agricultural) products.')
