The snippet assumes the byte order of the buffer or byte stream is little endian so only covers two of four cases. If you want to read a little-endian byte stream on a big-endian machine, of course you need swapping. But, considering portability, if that byte stream had been written by the big-endian machine before (or came directly from network) it would be in big-endian ordering and swapping would be wrong.<p>Assuming LE ordering on the writer side, you would need to swap again on a BE machine. Usually, however, you want to store in your target byte order, though. One could argue this is irrelevant as long as the memory doesn&#x27;t leave your application, of course. Yet, by explicitly having macros _to_cpu, _to_be, _to_le and so on you make all of this explicit.')
