Item(by='thefounder', descendants=None, kids=[25147470], score=None, time=1605773518, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25147130, text='&gt;&gt; I find the idea of a European army to be the stuff of fantasy.<p>You are not alone. That&#x27;s why some EU countries prefer to buy US millitary equipment(often at inflated prices), support US&#x27;s interests in the region and beyond(i.e Iraq invasion), accept US&#x27;s interferences and be done with it. The EU army project is too risky politically and strategically. Things may change if US becomes too erratic(i.e think of a super Trump presidency)')
