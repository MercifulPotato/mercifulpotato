I have been getting better for nearly two decades while the world attacks and dismisses me as a lunatic and teller of tall tales for the crime of talking on the internet about it sometimes.<p>I got better by looking at what we know about how the genetic defect impacts cell function in my body and learning a lot about cell function and connecting the dots between the micro -- molecules misprocessed at the cellular level -- and the macro -- dysfunction in certain tissues and how the body handles and mishandles food, among other things.<p>I&#x27;m not capable of setting aside twenty years of life experience in order to fit myself neatly into the Overton Window, especially when short of sleep.<p>It never ceases to amaze me how much negative attention my comments get, like it&#x27;s just incredibly important for people who think they know more about science than I do to quash my ability to give my 2 cents.<p>My stellar credentials include being a homemaker for two decades and spending nearly six years homeless. Everyone on the planet is more than welcome to look at my comments, decide quietly to themselves that I&#x27;m an idiot who knows nothing, downvote it and move the fuck on rather than lecturing me about the crime of having thoughts about the pandemic and what I think we should be looking at if we actually want to solve it and not treat it like we are looky-loos at a zoo seeking entertainment in the deaths of our fellow human beings.<p>Science also includes critical thinking, critique of what has been done, rigorous discussion and a whole lot of other things beyond just dicking around with exploring whatever catches our fancy for funsies.')
