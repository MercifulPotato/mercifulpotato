We could eliminate a huge swathe of spam senders from the web in a single stroke. (Right now we already apply this heuristic, but the output is just a signal for spam classifiers at the receiver, rather than a &quot;drop the mail on the floor&quot; signal at intermediates, the way that e.g. DNSRBLs are.)<p>If we <i>did</i> make this &quot;you don&#x27;t intend to send email if you don&#x27;t have the secure-origin records&quot; assumption, how much would that break email as a system? What old email servers are sitting around sending unsigned mail, that we want to protect&#x2F;preserve the functioning of (in the same way we keep Internet-realm HTTP transport around in browsers to preserve access to old HTTP-only Web1.0 servers?)')
