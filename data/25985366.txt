In theory, this would be correct at the end of the day. But in fact, we&#x27;re far from that equilibrium. For example, here we have these two major players:<p>Ruby: High-velocity development; Decisions have been made so you don&#x27;t need to make them; Suffer from scalability issues both performance-wise and architecturally in the endgame.<p>Java: Much slower development; Could be fast if correctly architected, but doomed as well if done wrong; Require a hell of infrastructures to work well.<p>But you can also find some superstars among the minor players without many trade-offs, for example:<p>Elixir: Development velocity and decision-wise are very close to Ruby; Performance is on-par or faster than Java without decisions; Messaging and cache already baked-in the language and tech stack though you don&#x27;t need them in the beginning; Hire Ruby programmers and just start rollin&#x27;')
