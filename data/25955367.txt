I do not think you did a complete or accurate analysis.<p>Randomization is NOT free. Randomization either requires that the values are pre-computed before install (which means delivering and pre-computing N different versions) or it is computed it on device.<p>If the randomization is computed on-device how to you validate that the binary or a library has not been &quot;substituted&quot; - persistent malware, APT?<p>The &quot;compute on device&quot; was a feature of very old macOS versions - it was annoying and took quite  a lot of resources.<p>&quot;TOTAL ASLR&quot; depends on a CPU arch if it fully endorses over all addresses position independent code and data (Q: homework for ARM, x86_64...). If the ABI allows violations of this you cannot glide &#x2F; slide all code and data addresses without significant runtime costs. This will likely result in a compromise.')
