I got a razer egpu enclosure and while it was certainly very well engineered, it was comically over-engineered. Weighed something crazy even without my gpu in it, I wanna say 10lbs, maybe even 15. Plus, it was huge, as big as an itx case. Then I had to drop 60$ on a long enough thunderbolt Cable to let me have the case under my desk.<p>Then there was all the issues with plugging in a laptop. Windows on a lenovo x1 carbon worked fine, with plug in&#x2F;out capabilities. Ubuntu 18.04 on same machine wasn&#x27;t plug and play, but I got it working after about an hour of fiddling. Never got plug in&#x2F;out working. Plug in worked, but unplug without shutting down lead to a crash.<p>All this and the enclosure was like 300$, and I was bottlenecked by my laptop processor anyway. In the end I think it&#x27;s just simpler to buy that expensive graphics card you&#x27;re looking at, then build a simple pc around it, and then make use of some kind of network based workflow for data sharing (git server for your code, networked hard drives for video, photo, music editing etc. Much easier, much more flexible, and imo in the end cheaper.')
