This doesn&#x27;t mean that we should force BMW workers to work for free -- it means that my expectations are not rational.<p>Similiar, if I want a 10km Uber ride for $1, which costs less than even gas, the desire is irrational. Why should workers have to work for free to satisfy this consumer&#x27;s irrational desire?<p>Same thing for grocery baggers &quot;disappearing&quot; -- of course they disappeared, there was a pandemic. They werent being paid for the risks of bagging groceries.')
