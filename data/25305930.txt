But, even as someone who is much more inclusionist than deletionist, it&#x27;s a hard problem. The rules don&#x27;t really help except at the extremes. And notability, as you suggest, is very context and scope dependent.<p>I have peers in my field, executives at major companies, journalists who have bylines pretty much every days, book authors, etc. who are quite well known in the context of my field or at least a subset of it and are easy to verify--but I&#x27;m guessing that many articles about those subjects would be somewhat arbitrarily deleted for lack of notability.')
