Item(by='tluyben2', descendants=None, kids=[24677994], score=None, time=1601808890, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24677926, text='I am very much in favour of vital infrastructure being state-owned; klm, state banks, roads, trains, trams, hospitals, cemeteries&#x2F;crematoria, pensions, vital insurance, schools&#x2F;universities, police, phone&#x2F;internet, army, firedeps should, in my opinion, all be state owned and free or dirt cheap (aka for every citizen) (tax money). Outside roads (? maybe now that changed too) and army (do we still have an army? I turned 18 in the last year it was mandatory; I was in uni so I did not have to go) &amp; police, everything is private now while in the 80s most was public... Which obviously brings the perverse incentive of wanting to make as much money as you can which gives you; if you are not rich, you can&#x27;t have anything.')
