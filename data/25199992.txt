While certainly witty, I&#x27;d question whether these are even intended to be funny. As in, do people literally read them and laugh out loud, find themselves thinking back on a particular strip and laughing and so on. I always assumed the New Yorker panels were more of an acerbic, dry, &#x27;aha&#x27; kind of observation than anything designed to be &#x27;funny&#x27; in the traditional sense. Meanwhile, Garfield while hackneyed (as the article points out, even intentionally so) has its moments.<p>The classic New Yorker panel is perhaps &#x27;On the Internet, no one knows you&#x27;re a dog&#x27; - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_...</a>\nClever, timely and memorable, sure. But inducing of mirth? Questionable.<p>Comedians make the differentiation between &#x27;funny&#x27; and &#x27;funny, funny&#x27;, as between a &#x27;bit&#x27; and a &#x27;joke, joke&#x27;, something that follows the traditional structure of a joke book or cracker. It&#x27;s an interesting distinction for something that isn&#x27;t particularly well described by the subtleties of English.')
