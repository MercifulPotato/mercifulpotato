It&#x27;s easy to do.<p>Suppose there is 1 share in existence, A promises to sell it to B and to C if price reaches X. If price gets there, A is on the hook to pay up. So now A has to buy the share if not held, or have it already. A sells out to B, fulfilling the contract to B. Now A needs that share again, so has to offer B a price to buy it, and does so. Now A closes out with C.<p>It&#x27;s vastly easier when there&#x27;s lots of shares, because it&#x27;s easier to find a seller each time you have to close out multiple contracts.<p>This is done in pretty much every part of the economy. When you put money in a bank, it can be lent. Now the bank has a debt (to you) and an asset (money owed to them by the lendee) that balance. That lendee can also lend the same money, again incurring a matching debt and asset.<p>None of this is voodoo back market evil. It&#x27;s common sense used to allocate resources, has been done for millennia in many forms.<p>It&#x27;s funny watching naive traders get upset over it simply because they don&#x27;t understand how their own markets work. It will be funny and sad watching them learn even more about how markets work in the coming days.')
