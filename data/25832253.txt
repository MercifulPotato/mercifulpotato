There are downsides like needing a phone number but it makes it very easy and means that they can do things like sending you notifications when one of your pre-existing contacts joins Signal.<p>Backups - this is my main sore point with Signal, in terms of recommending it to my friends. Unless they&#x27;re conscientious or put in extra work they&#x27;re going to lose all their message history when they get a new phone. You need to do manual backup and restore to transfer messages, and if your phone is lost&#x2F;stolen then you&#x27;re screwed.\nI&#x27;ve set up sync but it&#x27;s quite a lot of work for what (e.g.) WhatsApp does for free.')
