I use it to see issues, get notifications in vscode for new bugs and transition issues. It&#x27;s good for viewing basic text but poor for media rich content.<p>I also use the go-jira unofficial cli tool written in golang which is just a joy to configure and use. It supports a templating system for creating new issues and custom commands to do all kinds of tasks.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;go-jira&#x2F;jira" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;go-jira&#x2F;jira</a><p>Paired with GitHub Issues and PRs vscode extension, this enables me to work in the text editor most of the time.')
