This allows modern complex algorithms to easily interface and control these massive infrastructures from the cloud. We also developed the first applications which run on this OS. These applications use physics-based machine learning to control industrial refrigeration sites across the country, transforming them into electrical grid assets which can trade and respond to electrical grid signals in real-time.  We turn dumb facilities into smart ones.<p>It’s our goal as a company to not only deploy the first industrial facilities operating system, but also make a measurable impact on climate change.<p>About this Role:\nWe are looking for our first DevOps Engineer (remote) who will be responsible for the infrastructure running our highly available (HA) safety-critical control platform. You will collaborate with research physicists and technology personnel across all aspects of our software development lifecycle playing a critical role in infrastructure spanning CI&#x2F;CD, BI, and IOT being used in manufacturing systems worldwide.<p>Responsibilities\nManage AWS, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Postgres and other infrastructure components, including IIOT (Industrial Internet of Things) devices\nBuild a “self-service” Infrastructure-as-Code platform that developers can build on to deliver our software.\nEnsure the infrastructure is monitored (both infrastructure and application monitoring) and assist with infrastructure needs for application monitoring. \nWork with test team on CI&#x2F;CD infrastructure, Science team on ETL infrastructure\nResponsible for wearing many different hats covering a vast swath of infrastructure (operation, provisioning, compute, observability, automation, SRE, and data)<p>Qualifications\nSeveral years of production AWS or GCP experience (including cloud optimization)\nDeep knowledge of Kubernetes architecture\nExperience with Infrastructure as Code in CI&#x2F;CD pipelines\nExperience with many different infrastructure open source projects\nMust be proficient in several programming languages, including some scripting languages and some compiled languages\nExperience in high-velocity (multiple deploys a day) team-based development\nTeam player<p>If interested, please email Katie Castillo at katie@crossnokaye.com.')
