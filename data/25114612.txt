They enroll a bunch of people, inject them with the vaccine or a placebo, and then wait. Everything up until the &quot;waiting&quot; part can be and was expedited. The waiting part depends on how quickly the pathogen is spreading.  In this case, very fast, so it took months instead of years to get enough data to draw conclusions.<p>That part can&#x27;t be rushed. There was no shortcut to proving efficacy.<p>The Phase 3 trials haven&#x27;t stopped and they will continue to record information about safety and side effects. But the Phase 2 trials already proved the vaccine to be safe, which is necessary before injecting it in to tens of thousands of human beings, as was done for Phase 3 trials.<p>New information about safety and side effects could emerge, but in the meantime, the various national health agencies will have to decide if the data on safety is sufficient to give emergency approvals.')
