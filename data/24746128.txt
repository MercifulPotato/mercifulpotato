For eg, I found out recently about the &lt;aside&gt; tag, which works great alongside the click-to-open nature of the &lt;summary&#x2F;details&gt; tags resulting in a semantically accurate aside tag that my readers can click-to-read. Works great as a in-content footnote of sort. Demo on my site[0].<p>What I&#x27;ve realized recently is that there are fewer people left with the ability to write raw HTML these days. Most content platforms these days either hide away raw HTML, or disallow it (like Medium) - resulting in users that can&#x27;t use these features.<p>While writing in markdown is great, it only covers the lowest-common-denominator of HTML, and we need modern editors to embrace these new HTML features somehow.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;captnemo.in&#x2F;monopoly-deal&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;captnemo.in&#x2F;monopoly-deal&#x2F;</a>')
