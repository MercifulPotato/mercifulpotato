There is vastly more CO2 from fossil fuel entering the atmosphere today, but it’s only a difference in quantity.<p>Which is the issue, CO2 produced today will generally still be around in another 1,000 years.  Across geologic timescales it’s going to be sequestered, but on human timescales it’s basically permanent.  There isn’t a clear transition point where suddenly this ton of CO2 kills of the Great Barrier Reef, it’s a very gradual transition that means coral has a very slightly harder time growing today than it did yesterday.<p>Not burning a ton of coal in yesterday would have been as useful as not burning a ton of coal tomorrow, the only difference is we can’t go back to yesterday.')
