It&#x27;s mostly night hours between 23:00 and 5:00.<p>Contrary to conventional power sources, wind power can be regulated basically &quot;on-the-spot&quot; by turning turbines on and off.<p>Living next to a small on-shore wind farm, I can tell you from first hand observation that most of the time turbines are turned off deliberately, because production simply exceeds demand.<p>A chart like the one you&#x27;ve linked to doesn&#x27;t tell the whole story and can be very misleading indeed. You&#x27;d need to plot the actual load on the grid versus production to get a better picture.')
