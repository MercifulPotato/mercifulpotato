The plugin is also for an application that uses that ~20MB library, distributed separately, and in turn many users install a standalone version of that library to use alongside the program. That&#x27;s 4 copies of the library just for one application on Windows, and this library is common and most likely also distributed with many other apps on most users PCs. All of them will need separate updates.')
