Java dev tools suffered from poor performance and poor UX for the longest time.<p>Eclipse, despite its early promise (SWT and native widgets) has much &#x27;rougher&#x27; UX compared to IDEA. But I remain surprised how much better even simply typing feels on IDEA, and how good the refactoring tools are. (The latest Eclipse has improved a lot in the refactoring dept, though.)<p>Java&#x27;s combination of openness and poor dev tools definitely helped Jetbrains a lot and gave them a cachet in the marketplace that helped them as they expanded into other languages. That said, I&#x27;ve also used their Microsoft VS addins and those were very good too, but they likely would have made much less money if they were a Microsoft-only shop.')
