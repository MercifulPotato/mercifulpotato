I started in college, and I have had two chest colds in my entire adult life (and only one up until a couple years ago).<p>Diaphragmatic breathing (autocomplete tells me that&#x27;s the word but it don&#x27;t look right) assists the cilia in ejecting foreign matter from the lower lungs.  When I was a kid I&#x27;d feel like I was drowning when the cold hit its apex, even when I was into endurance sports, and I knew I was on the mend when I started clearing my lungs.<p>(If there&#x27;s a downside it&#x27;s that I clear my throat all the fucking time when I have a cold now, but I&#x27;ll take loud over bacterial pneumonia)')
