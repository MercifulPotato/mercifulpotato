Nearly $3 million wasn&#x27;t enough? That&#x27;s about $420k per year for the time he put in, not counting anything he already took out. Keeping the extra money only increases that to about $530k&#x2F;yr.<p>And it sounds like the early employees get nothing, other than not getting fired immediately.<p>I like the Baremetrics product but man this really leaves a bad taste in my mouth about Josh personally.')
