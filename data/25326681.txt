It is somewhat unfortunate that the official fan lets you read the fan speed, but not set it.  I put a Noctua fan on my Pi and it sucks in a surprising amount of dust; mostly an artifact of too much ventilation when the computer doesn&#x27;t actually need the airflow.  (I put a filter on it and it&#x27;s fine now, but sometimes I wonder whether the dust is actually filtered out, or if it just reduces airflow by so much that you don&#x27;t suck in any dust to begin with :)<p>While writing this comment, I decided to investigate whether or not speed control is even possible on a 5V fan with 3V3 logic and found this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;noctua.at&#x2F;pub&#x2F;media&#x2F;wysiwyg&#x2F;Noctua_PWM_specifications_white_paper.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;noctua.at&#x2F;pub&#x2F;media&#x2F;wysiwyg&#x2F;Noctua_PWM_specification...</a><p>The answer is: I still don&#x27;t know.  They say that the PWM voltage is pulled up to &quot;3.3V&#x2F;5V&quot; internally but the spec says the PWM signal has to be 5V, so I suppose the results are undefined (and they just left 3.3V in their document accidentally).<p>But, a first-party fan could make this work, so I&#x27;m kind of sad that they just chose some off-the-shelf fan that was cheap today in Shenzhen.  If you could do better than Noctua, then there&#x27;s value in making it first-party.  If you can&#x27;t, why bother?  Everyone that wanted a fan already has one.')
