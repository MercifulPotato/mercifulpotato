Always remember that your freelance rate should be double your full time rate (maybe more) so really it&#x27;s like a $75&#x2F;h job or $135k&#x2F;y equivalent, and then there is the fragmentation of time mentioned, and the fact you have to mentor in real time (unlike coding you can wake up at 4am and get a bit done).<p>Therefore I think it&#x27;s a reasonable price to charge. Whether it is worth $150&#x2F;h to you (or your employer) I guess depends on the business. But if your company has say never used mongodb before (for example), it&#x27;s not much to pay to get someone with all the battle experience to come in and get people up to speed rather than say have production outages as people didn&#x27;t know what they were doing, or alternatively hiring someone full time at a cost of $200k just for their mongo expertise.')
