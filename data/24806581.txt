It was supposed to be kindle&#x2F;tv&#x2F;radio&#x2F;everything replacement, for your living room.<p>Bezos wanted &quot;kindle, without the hardware&quot;.  Like, read off of your outstretched hand, or a piece of paper, or the wall.\nInteract with hand gestures and voice controls, and it could track your location in a room through sound using a microphone array and loads of math. (my contribution)<p>But it turned out that despite getting it to &quot;kinda&quot; work, the 20KW power requirement for the huge computers, motors, and projector, and low resolution made it seem like &gt;20 years out from a real product, not ~3 years out.<p>At the time, I jokingly proposed scrapping everything but the audio subsystem, and cram it into a tiny box, but then quickly added that such a product would be doomed to fail.  You can&#x27;t fit the necessary compute in a tiny box, so for it to work it&#x27;d have to transmit the audio to the cloud for processing.<p>No one in their right mind would willingly buy a small device for the home with a microphone array <i>always</i> listening, tracking their location, always processing and transmitting data to the amazon server farm, consumers aren&#x27;t <i>that</i> stupid, right?<p>I still get pissy whenever I see one of those things.')
