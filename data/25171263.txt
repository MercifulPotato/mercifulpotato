There are many folks that have basically done what you did and still find it insufficient and experience cold rooms and drafts. This may not be a popular opinion but new Windows do very little to increase the comfort of your home unless the old ones were absolute trash. Sealing the attic and adding insulation can definitely help since it stops the chimney effect of warm air rising in from the bottom and fleeing through the top of the house.<p>Here are a couple of things you can do. Seal the area between the first floor and the basement along the perimeter of the structure, if you have a basement. This is the area above the perimeter wall top plate and the first floor joists. Typically the area between first floor joists lets in a lot of air and sometimes has no insulation. This area should be sealed and insulated.<p>The one other thing you can do that will make the biggest difference without tearing down all the inside drywall in your house to insulate (forget pour in foam, it&#x27;s not worth it), is insulate from the outside of your home by applying <i>Stucco</i>. It&#x27;s not cheap but is less intrusive for an existing house that is occupied. A contractor will basically apply a 1 - 2 inch thick foam board adhered to the outside walls (Brick?)and then apply stucco to that. It will prevent your outside walls from getting cold in the first place and seal your home to a pretty good level. It can be around $10 + SQ&#x2F;FT. That is the advice I usually give folks who are in your situation and don&#x27;t want to do a major interior RENO.')
