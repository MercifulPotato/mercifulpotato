It&#x27;s gone to literal shit.<p>Hacked server credentials, &quot;cheap server for mining!!&quot; VMs purchased via stolen credit cards and resold for spam, attacks, and crypto mining until they get shut down for abuse or chargeback, hacked .edu emails, hacked MSDN credentials, cracked software for money (it&#x27;s a 50% chance they&#x27;re offering stolen-credit-card-acquired keys, and a 50% chance they&#x27;ll just send you probably_trojan_crack_keygen.exe and tell you the software needs this patched to work and to not download it from the official source).<p>Plenty of abusive services on offer, like &quot;we&#x27;ll upgrade your dropbox to pro for life&quot; where the instructions are to send them your email and password and they just add a stolen credit card to pay annually.<p>The usual shitty &quot;buy likes and followers on social media&quot; scammers where their own account has 9 obviously bot followers with half naked women profile images, and nothing else.<p>Random half page selection: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;LiG25q8.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;LiG25q8.png</a>')
