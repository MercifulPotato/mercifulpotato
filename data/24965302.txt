Item(by='probably_wrong', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604298904, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24965072, text='Here&#x27;s a tip: take a picture of your real, actual background from the POV of your webcam, and set <i>that</i> as your meeting background.<p>Advantages: it looks natural, it covers whatever is going on behind you (in case you are not alone and people walks by, or if your living room is messy), and it blends better than fake backgrounds (because it&#x27;s the same image behind it). I have a picture of my office that I use both at home and at my real office, and most people can&#x27;t tell. And since I took the picture with my phone which has better resolution, my video feed looks better for cheap.')
