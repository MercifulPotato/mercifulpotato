I feel like working from home 3-4 days a week, and then in the office 1-2 days a week is the <i>best</i> of everything:<p>1. I have much more freedom to choose where I live because my commute is much less of an issue if I&#x27;m only doing it once or twice a week.<p>2. I feel like I get the best of all worlds: I get great &quot;focus time&quot; when I&#x27;m working from home, but I am still able to have more personal relationships from meeting people in person at the office.<p>3. Our company I think has done a great job segregating heads-down work time from specific days where we have more meetings or more collaboration.')
