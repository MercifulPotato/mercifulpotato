The local Starbucks, for example, has a sign that says free coffee for military personnel. A relative who used to run a coffee shop also always offered free coffee to military people. It&#x27;s a small thing, but important.<p>It&#x27;s not about glorifying the military, but about acknowledging the risks they take on our behalf.')
