The stripper doesn’t think there’s anything wrong with doing that, because her mortgage broker told her she could always refinance her mortgages when the prices of her houses went up. And housing prices would always go up.</i><p>Of course, our Government ended up bailing out people like the &quot;stripper&quot; who would complain that they &quot;lost their homes.&quot;<p>Let&#x27;s hope the new administration doesn&#x27;t bail out crypto specu-vestors.')
