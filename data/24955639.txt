This language uses the actor model like Akka and Erlang, but allows for the safe sharing of data between actors enforced by an an ingenious use of the type system. The result is an actor programming model with better performance than Erlang because mutable data can be safely shared.<p>I have been a long time Java developer, and I have worked a lot with highly concurrent code. Pony really opened my eyes to what was possible.<p>Unfortunately, the language, standard library and runtime is  still pretty immature. It does however have very good &#x27;C&#x27; interop. So for some problems it would be a very good fit.')
