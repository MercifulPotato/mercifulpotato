You might have a 60 Amps grid supply, or even a 100Amps split phase 120&#x2F;240V as is typical for newer US homes, which allows drawing 24KW from the grid at full power. Your neighbor might have the same.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean everybody in your neighborhood can draw 24KW all night long. Those are maximal currents for intermittent loads like heaters, clothes driers etc. You might have a single 100KVA polemount transformer suppling a whole street and a single 15KV &#x2F; 300Amp line servicing a whole neighborhood.<p>When everybody attempts to draw even 5-10KW in the air-conditioning season, you get circuit breaks because the main feed  is incapable of supplying sufficient power. The upgrading will be done but it will take a decade or more, especially considering the push from local municipalities towards buried power feeds which are very expensive.')
