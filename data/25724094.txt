We don&#x27;t need to separate ourselves from people with different viewpoints. I&#x27;m lucky enough to be friends with people on the left and the right, but I think that&#x27;s only because we stay away from politics.  In fact, it&#x27;s something that used to be a Christian ideal - to be able to maintain a courteous friendship with someone you are fundamentally at odds with (See: Song of Roland, Christian &amp; &quot;Saracen&quot; Knights).<p>It&#x27;s not often something I see folks right of center doing, but it seems like a ton of people left of center have been distancing themselves from people with whom they disagree too strongly.  It&#x27;s too bad. We need to open up to more discourse, not less.')
