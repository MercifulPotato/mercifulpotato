Platforms engaged in mass, coordinated de-platformings and people lapped it up because orange man bad. Now the orange man is gone, but the mass coordinated de-platformings still remain and are now being wielded for YOLO reasons.<p>I have been on wsb subreddit and discord server for a long time. There has been zero change in the culture or the type of content or the tone of the conversations in all that while, right uptill the discord server was banned. Either these platforms knew there was bad content but did nothing, or they know there is no bad content but are using it as a flimsy excuse to help out their fellow Harvard MBA&#x27;s.<p>Ironically the orange man would be the one laughing at all of this today.')
