If I wouldn&#x27;t have stumbled over Ansible 6-7 years ago I would have left the industry already. I don&#x27;t mind complexity in general but I feel it should be in line with company needs. And k8s often isn&#x27;t.<p>You are right, FreeBSD jails, lxc, etc are great technologies. It&#x27;s k8s and related topis I have my issues with.<p>Do you regret leaving the industry?<p>I have invested a lot of effort into my career and it would feel kind of stupid to give up on it because I have some issues with today&#x27;s industry trend.\nOn the other hand you are right, k8s is the technical side of a people problem in the industry. While I&#x27;m hopeful that things around k8s will settle on the long run, I&#x27;m pessimistic that the cargo cult and believe in easy answers to complex problems will disappear any time soon.')
