Android phone set to &quot;do not disturb&quot; permanently. The only exceptions calls&#x2F;texts from starred contacts which include only my immediately family, work when I&#x27;m on call (and only then), and I&#x27;ll temporarily add a starred contact if I&#x27;m expecting a call (eg I&#x27;ve called a tradesperson leaving a message and expect a call back).<p>And even my immediate family talk to me primarily via chat apps that aren&#x27;t covered via starred contacts. Therefore I know when my phone makes a sound it is something I need to respond to in a timely manner.<p>Everything else causes a notifications pulse, with different colours for different apps (purple for a chat app, yellow for work email etc). It&#x27;s so unobtrusive I don&#x27;t notice it unless I deliberately look at it.')
