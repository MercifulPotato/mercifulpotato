My experience is : they call up, I say &quot;Do not add channels, do NOT add a channel that I have to cancel later when billing starts.  REPEAT: DO NOT ADD CHANNELS. Thanks for calling. Good bye.&quot;\nAnd they add channels. NFL and other sports need to team with Youtube, hulu or netflix next time.')
