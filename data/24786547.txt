People with mobility issues will need to use an escalator, or even an elevator (if there is one, and if it actually does work). And what happens when an escalator breaks?<p>As a rule of thumb, any overpass or underpass is any or all of the following:<p>- hostile design for pedestrians (majority)<p>- money sink &#x2F; expensive to build and maintain<p>- architect&#x27;s wet dream &#x2F; resume building<p>- only looks nice on paper &#x2F; rendering, but in the real world, at 1:1 scale it is ugly and makes the city look ugly')
