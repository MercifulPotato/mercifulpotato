That makes no actual difference to someone trying to spell a word they can say or say a work they&#x27;re reading.<p>The point here is that for many words in English, there is no actual link between the letters in the spelling and the sounds in the spoken word.<p>I&#x27;ve been learning German for  a few years. The spelling is easy. I spell 90% of words right first try. If I hear a word I can spell it well enough to look it up in a dictionary and learn what it means.<p>The opposite is true in English. Does a word have &quot;ie&quot; or &quot;ei&quot; in it? There is no way to know. Does a work starting with an &quot;n&quot; have a silent &quot;k&quot; in front (or worse, words like honest that start with an &quot;o&quot; sound but are spelt with an h)? No way to know. Does a word end -ite or - ight? No way to know.<p>There are a lot of surprise complexities that serve a purpose (when you have 2+ words with the same pronunciation but different spellings) or that are just sytlistic (colour vs color). I don&#x27;t object to that.<p>But we should stop pretending you can spell out words or that written and spoken words are linked, at least 25% of the time they&#x27;re not. Just look at that last sentence: there is no W in written and no L in should. No wonder kids struggle with this crap.')
