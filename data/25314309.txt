Item(by='bregma', descendants=None, kids=[25314649, 25314432], score=None, time=1607174219, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25311964, text='I work with a fully POSIX-compliant OS that uses 32-bit unsigned int time_t. Unfortunately, most software these days (including the runtimes of major production languages) assume incorrectly that time_t is an unsigned int because that&#x27;s what it is in the GNU C library used on GNU&#x2F;Linux, and they end up using it as a general arithmetic type. The end result is undefined behaviour. But hey, it just happens to work on Linux so it must be correct. Grrr.')
