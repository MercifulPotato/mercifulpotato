Item(by='dwaite', descendants=None, kids=[24830915], score=None, time=1603139527, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24830303, text='&gt; In that pre-announce video Apple dared to insinuate that attestation by current devices is de-anonymizing, when that isn&#x27;t universally the case.<p>Most hardware devices use batch attestation, where some group of (say, 100 000) keys all get the same private key. This does still provide some data for correlating users based on make + model + batch of their authenticators.<p>ECDAA was meant to be an approach to solve this with pairing-friendly curves and crypto, but the industry stayed clear of this as an unproven algorithm.<p>Apple (and the rather similar SafetyNet approach by Google) use a service. The interaction between the device and this service is black-box and we do not yet know how much information is exchanged. By its nature, this service can change in the future and we will not know.<p>However, it _could_ be limited to an RSA or EC-based DAA attestation from the Secure Enclave, a curve point on P-256, and a SHA-256 hash value to embed. There&#x27;s no reason Apple needs to know either the specific piece of hardware or the site a user is going to.<p>&gt; Further, it&#x27;s up to the site to decide whether to use an anonymous attestation or not. The user will not be informed either way.<p>Several browsers will give the user the option to not send attestation if a site asks for it, to the point where capturing attestations is a UX-impacting action. You could say the UX impact is intentional - not only do basic attestations leak some tracking information, but they limit user choice in how to authenticate.')
