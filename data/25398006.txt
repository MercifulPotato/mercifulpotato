The videos look almost perfect, with &quot;almost&quot; still oscillating around the uncanny valley. Self-driving cars are almost totally self-driving and are almost not killing people. GPT3 uses fluent English and can be used to generate almost meaningful content in most contexts. Speech recognition progressed enormously and can be used to transcribe most well-pronouncing native English speakers in favorable circumstances. It seems like we&#x27;re slowly getting there, but the last mile is the hardest to finish.<p>For many companies this is not a problem because they can afford not to care. When you operate at the scale of Google, you can not afford <i>not</i> to use some form of ML to detect abuse, and you don&#x27;t care about false positives because they&#x27;re meaningless at this scale - you just get a couple of grumpy folks complaining they lost their accounts. But when you do something more meaningful, for example translation, you can&#x27;t depend on machine translation - you can very well use it for the first draft, but if you delivered it to your client in that form, you&#x27;d be laughed at and you&#x27;d quickly be out of business. So yes, great advancements, still far from being there.')
