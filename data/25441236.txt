All theories have a pespective. Perspectives derive from a position in time and space, specifically social and political time and space ... There is, accordingly, no such thing as theory in itself, divorced from a standpoint in time and space. When any theory so represents itself, it is the more important to examine it as ideology, and to lay bare its concealed perspective<p>In this case it could not be clearer that the theory of &#x27;trickle down&#x27;&#x2F;supply side&#x2F;neoliberal economics - that is, liberalisation, privatisation and deregulation - were for the wealthy, and they were for the purpose of capturing a greater share of wealth (upward wealth redistribution). That&#x27;s why they acquired prominence and political support, and that&#x27;s why they&#x27;ve been so hard to dislodge in spite of the overall harm they&#x27;ve done.<p>Personally I think it&#x27;d probably be ok to try something else')
