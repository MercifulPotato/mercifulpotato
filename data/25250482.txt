But this is a study about a deterministic mechanistic action.<p>We know that DMT binds with sigma-1 receptors (S1R) which is known to promote neurogenesis, such as fluvoxamine (in addition to many other SSRIs) in humans; we further know that the medication causes neurogenesis in humans, as do other medications with S1R affinity[0].<p>We then know that DMT does as well, we then measure that neurogenesis is observed in mice due to the same exact mechanism as SSRI&#x27;s (i.e. medications with S1R affinity) in humans.<p>Perhaps at some point we should realize deterministic action in the context of the mammalian brain over human exceptionalism.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;20373470&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;20373470&#x2F;</a>')
