Managers will push back with &quot;rules&quot; that only apply if management doesn&#x27;t want to pay you more. Or they will go to HR to get an exception <i>if</i> they think you are worth that exception (that is, if they aren&#x27;t worried about not being able to match an offer for an employee that they <i>really</i> care about). You can absolutely negotiate.<p>In the past, I&#x27;ve been quite open when I thought that I needed more money to my manager, and have even given specific ways of making me &quot;not distracted by money concerns&quot;. Sometimes they can meet those goals, sometimes they can&#x27;t.<p>Personally, the offer as you&#x27;ve given it is probably more adversarial than I&#x27;d prefer. Something like &quot;I feel like I&#x27;m worth more to the company than X, I feel like I&#x27;m worth Y, and here is a list of reasons, here is my career goals, etc etc&quot;. Then if they don&#x27;t match it, you can accept that other offer. But YMMV.')
