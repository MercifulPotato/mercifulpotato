I can&#x27;t imagine China having a strong welfare state or super expensive healthcare for the elderly. So old people won&#x27;t cost China much (though they&#x27;ll probably have miserable lives if they didn&#x27;t save enough).<p>Even the population going down isn&#x27;t really an issue, they have more poor people to take out of poverty than the entire US population, so more than enough labor force. Plus if their population declined 50% (a super far fetched scenario that could happen over an entire century), they will still have 2x the US population.<p>For most individuals living in China will still be mediocre to bad, but that&#x27;s still enough for them to create in aggregate an economy 2x the US one.<p>Japan just couldn&#x27;t do this, they were always smaller than the US.')
