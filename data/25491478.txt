In which case it would be valid for people to be calling for sanctions let alone revocation of state aid.<p>Iirc, hacking team dissolved or greatly downsized after their leak. I do not recall any cases against them for their export license to be revoked. I&#x27;m sure if the Italian courts rejected the case baselessly then there would be consequences (maybe further legal action&#x2F;sanctions on specific individuals) as Italy does not operate with the same unique impunity that Israel does.<p>The difference with Italy is that it does not receive state aid from the Americans.
