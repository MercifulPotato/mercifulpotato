This is a piece of code which was already heavily optimized for many years as speed is critical for the engine&#x27;s performance. One guy (although very talented one) re-wrote it in C and got the speed gains. Another guy (also very talented one) re-wrote it in assembly and got even bigger speed gains (see CFish and asmFish projects)<p>It looks to me that you are comparing badly written C to decently written C++ and claiming speed gains. I use C for my own software(solver for a popular game) and I wouldn&#x27;t dream of using stuff like &quot;pointer chasing structures&quot;.\nIf you need to use stuff like hash tables in your performance critical code you have to code them yourself anyway as using some generic hash and memory handling algorithm is a recipe for being slow.')
