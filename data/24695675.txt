I&#x27;ve got a Furna motorised standing desk, a wobble board and a kneeling stool. Apart from looking like a middle-class numpty in some kind of hellhole physio studio, it&#x27;s actually pretty great having lots of options.<p>I&#x27;ve also taken to being fairly strict with a Pomodoro routine. 25 minutes focused (strictly locking down email!) work, 5 minutes when I get up and have a wander around the house. I think my attention is better, my eyes get a chance to rest, less aches.<p>The other thing I did was to start using mouse left-handed. I got terrible RSI with my right (I&#x27;m naturally right-handed) and actually although I&#x27;m slower with my left it&#x27;s no bad thing - my movement is more considered, less jerky, and I think has a lower impact on anything likely to trigger RSI.<p>So yeh, I think I&#x27;m ok for a death-trap lying down desk, thanks anyway...')
