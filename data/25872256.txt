It wouldn&#x27;t need to redo the computation across all tweets.<p>Unlike every other similar framework I know of, Differential can also do this for programs with loops &#x2F; recursion which makes it more possible to write algorithms.<p>Beyond that, as you&#x27;ve noted it parallelizes work nicely.<p>I wrote a blog post that was meant to explain &quot;what does Differential do&quot; and &quot;when it is or isn&#x27;t useful&quot; and give some concrete examples that might be helpful. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;materialize.com&#x2F;life-in-differential-dataflow&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;materialize.com&#x2F;life-in-differential-dataflow&#x2F;</a>')
