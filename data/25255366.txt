We shouldn&#x27;t be treating online learning the same as in-person learning.  I took distance learning classes back in the early 00&#x27;s.  Some courses required proctored exams, some had open book exams. For proctored exams, I would do them in the library, then the librarian would send the test back to the school.  The open book exams weren&#x27;t really any easier - you were expected to know the material and therefore the tests were more challenging.<p>In my professional experience, GPA has little correlation with how well someone can do a job.
