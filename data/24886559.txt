I searched for &quot;handler&quot; and saw no hit. It&#x27;s a very interesting topic for me. I wouldn&#x27;t call them &#x27;algebraic&#x27; anymore because the way they are done in OCaml the algebraic aspects are fairly obscured. It&#x27;s the handling semantics which is critical. Anyway, this is besides the point.')
