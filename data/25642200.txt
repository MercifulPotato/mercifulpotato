I think most users can do atleast that if you have a Google account. Using adblockers, fingerprint avoiding browsers, and diligently opting out of all forms of tracking where possible is also doable. This only minimizes data collection.<p>It&#x27;s sending companies like acxiom and sift science requests to delete your data based on identifiers that most people will likely not do.<p>I would like to see banning of data collection IDs, including IDFAs. No ad re-targeting IDs, no Verizon injecting IDs into network traffic, no Facebook SDK IDs, no IDFAs enabling data collection. I think that would do wonders for big tech minimizing their data collection.')
