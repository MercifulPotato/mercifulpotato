That is not what is being discussed here.<p>The question is, can we find a notation that is much better at teaching the intuitive relationship between these 3 operations. Because notation isn&#x27;t just about formalizing. Notation is about enabling better understanding. And for a large part, good notation should help teaching. Especially something like exponents, roots, and logarithms which are taught to many. People who happen to not get this probably stop doing math, and we need more people who can do math it seems.')
