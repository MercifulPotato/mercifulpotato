This response ratio means organic yields were typically ~2&#x2F;3rds of conventional across US, EU for most produce types.<p>I think a real path forward is reduction of pesticide&#x2F;herbicide usage through highly targeted techniques, as well as greater embrace of biodiversity in the field (even at some cost to yield). However it is also not reasonable to switch to all organic right now, since we would then produce only 2&#x2F;3rds the food we have now.<p>I think where move from conventional is most critical is for animal products. “Conventional” in the US comes with lots of cruelty. Even if we net eat less meat supporting meat sources that treat animals better is important, and will not likely cause net decrease in calories produced.')
