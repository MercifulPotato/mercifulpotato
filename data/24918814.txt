Those are quite different from somewhat more normal custom build licenses for these kind of vehicles once they are entering limited production. This has not been approved for any other usage like limited production and is only valid for this specific vehicle. While this license is &quot;European&quot; there are lot of issues driving these kind of vehicles with this licenses across Europe legally.<p>Addendum: This means they cannot sell them yet as they first have to show production compliance. And have more stringent testing for those vehicles.<p>Addendum 2: It also has no aircraft license so flying is not an option.')
