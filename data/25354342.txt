It is GPL compatible but can also link to (and be linked by) proprietary code. It is file-based, so the rule is that if you modify one of the original project files, it has to be provided under MPLv2 - but extensions to the original library in separate files are permissible.<p>It also provides a lot of the same protections that Apache 2.0 provides in comparison to MIT&#x2F;BSD licenses.')
