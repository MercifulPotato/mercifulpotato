But this is exactly the point that the article seems to miss: there&#x27;s basically no such thing as a good gift for a lot of people. The only things I want I either already have or are so high-price that I wouldn&#x27;t want someone else to buy for me (and frankly I can do without those). No amount of advice can change that sorry fact for the would-be gift giver.<p>The exceptions are things I didn&#x27;t know I wanted until I was given it, maybe I didn&#x27;t know it existed. And some consumables, like nuts and chocolates.')
