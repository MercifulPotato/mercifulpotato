I&#x27;ve tried competing products and they never worked as well as a complete package. Sure, they might have had a feature or two that was better by some metric, but overall Apple stuff works well for my use case. Does this mean I&#x27;m in love with Apple? I don&#x27;t think so, but for now they work.<p>Love and hate are also pretty similar emotions. I find both the people who love Apple <i>and</i> hate Apple to be...odd. I really don&#x27;t understand either. It&#x27;s a company, either use their products or don&#x27;t.')
