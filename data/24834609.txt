On Twitter, the root of a discussion thread is a post made by a particular user on their feed. If I want to talk about another person&#x27;s post, I don&#x27;t need to reply on their thread - I can just create my own. Maybe this leads to an explicit bifurcation in conversation and similarly in perspectives and point of view.<p>For example, if I disagree with something that Donald Trump said, I won&#x27;t simply reply to his tweet where everyone including his supporters can see it, I will reply to in on my timeline. Similarly, my followers won&#x27;t follow Donald Trump to hear what I have to say about him, they will only follow me directly.<p>Given the root of discussion is always a person rather than an idea it forces people to judge in advance the content they read based on who said it. Perhaps if Twitter didn&#x27;t allow retweets and separate comment threads, this kind of division in commentary wouldn&#x27;t happen so much.<p>PS - I hardly use Twitter at all, the above is just speculation.')
