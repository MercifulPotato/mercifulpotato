That means in 2016, the DKIM was already deniable. And it made no difference whatsoever.<p>Both journalists and investigative groups (and conspiracy theorists) treat DKIM as a sign of authenticity, even when the key material is long past its prime. Wikileaks still prominently displays a &quot;verified&quot; marker next to their archives.<p>&gt; Did DKIM change anything about the podesta emails? Or were they basically acknowledged as authentic regardless, and had a lot of other verifyable info in them?<p>That&#x27;s hard to say, but it&#x27;s also not the point. The point with being able to crack the key is that a motivated party could intersperse <i>false</i> information with otherwise verifiable information. And, well, what&#x27;s a conspiracy theorist to do? Only believe the non-juicy parts?')
