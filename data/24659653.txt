So in a way, a bunch of clear and settled cases would provide the &#x27;best path forward&#x27; because then we&#x27;d know where the lines are - but - a bunch of &#x27;weird outcomes&#x27; that cost other companies bazillions would probably hurt a lot and it will strike fast. You won&#x27;t be able to get your investment if your flirting with a situation in which some other corp got banged for $2B, even if technically you are in the clear.<p>It&#x27;s probably a very bad idea to &#x27;sue for money&#x27;. The objective of the legal cases should be &#x27;clarity&#x27; and the cases should be chosen on that basis if the open source community really wants to thrive.')
