The rights we have are naturally ours, by nature of our very existence, and the constitution enumerates them as a mechanism to keep the government from infringing on them. It is very clearly written this way, and to say that our foundational natural rights don&#x27;t matter in any context is dystopian and authoritarian. That is to say, rights exist outside and beyond the constitution. The question is really one of e.g. my rights vs Facebook&#x27;s rights.')
