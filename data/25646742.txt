The USA would have had a great response to COVID if it weren&#x27;t for American anti-intellectualism.<p>Not all totalitarian regimes have been handling COVID well. Russia hasn&#x27;t done any better than most European countries and may have done worse if they&#x27;re cooking their numbers (which is likely). Iran has done poorly. The thing that I think made China do well is a combination of an obedient authoritarian society and a large number of scientists and engineers in positions of authority. An authoritarian society is very good at problems of the form &quot;have everyone do X,&quot; but that only works if X is the right thing.')
