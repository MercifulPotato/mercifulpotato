To expand it slightly, Vector is a tool to collect observability data (logs, metrics, etc) from wherever it&#x27;s generated, optionally process that data in-flight, and then forward it to whatever upstream system you&#x27;d like to consume it. It does this by providing a variety of different components that you configure into whatever pipeline you need. In your example, you could use our new k8s source and plug it into our Kafka sink, our S3 sink, or both.')
