Imagine that any &quot;screen&quot; you need to access _must_ be bundled within the distro. So, compared to Linux distro – you should have your local mirror of all possible features any particular user would like to have. For example, Gentoo handbook says &quot;Hosting a mirror requires a minimum of 550 GiB available disk space.&quot; 550 GiB just to run a Chromium? No – to have an opportunity to run it when you&#x27;ll need it, because it&#x27;s all or nothing. Either you get every program with all of its features, or get nothing at all.')
