This isn&#x27;t my area and you&#x27;re right I haven&#x27;t researched this topic in any depth (though I did look at Diaspora), so I&#x27;m not surprised it shows. My original comment was around meta-ethics and this is pretty far from that starting point.<p>Decentralized platforms like Diaspora may be viable alternatives someday, but my possibly ill-informed pragmatic gut tells me they won&#x27;t be viable alternatives for many years to come.<p>Thanks for your patience and persistence. It was interesting!')
