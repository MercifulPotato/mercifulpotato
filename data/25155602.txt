If it succeeds, it shows other businesses how powerful ARM can be.<p>Apple does not need to dominate the PC market to make money. What they deliver pushes other competitors to improve.<p>I, like the commenter I&#x27;ve replied to, can&#x27;t believe that we&#x27;re even able to frame a processor power shift like this in a bad light. It shows companies they can build something big without x86 - that&#x27;s good for hardware in the long run, irrelevant of whether it&#x27;s Apples variant or not.<p>It&#x27;s our responsibility, as enthusiasts, to make sure legacy lives on. Plenty of people are building emulators, making home networks with old hardware.<p>It would be much easier if Copyright&#x2F;Patents expired shorter after the big money has been made. Things should become open source to let everyone in after the inventor has reaped the benefits of their creation.')
