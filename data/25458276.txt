You can type e.g. German umlauts (äöü) and eszett (ß) effortlessly (Option+u a&#x2F;o&#x2F;u, and Option+s respectively), or British Pounds (£, Option+#, where it would be on a UK keyboard), all on an ANSI layout. Maybe less so for «», which is Option+\\ and Option+| (i.e. Option+Shift+\\). Might&#x27;ve been nicer to put these on Option+[ and Option+].<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve always hated the ISO enter key and QWERTZ (although that&#x27;s a bit of a tangent). I also think having a different keyboard for every European language is a losing strategy, especially when people might be required to type in two languages. If you know about it, for some languages the macOS approach works really well.<p>iOS is also passable; a long press brings up options (e.g. on s -&gt; ß&#x2F;ś&#x2F;š). It&#x27;s a bit more tedious.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25457638" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25457638</a>')
