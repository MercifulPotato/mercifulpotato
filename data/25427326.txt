Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608010083, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25427282, text='&gt; Most farming in the US is done by the same kind of bigcorp groups that do everything else, with a tiny number of well-educated employees mixed with mass seasonal agricultural labor (who usually aren&#x27;t even citizens in the first place).<p>It depends on how you measure &quot;most&quot; but a lot of food is produced on farms owned by large agriculture companies. The food is grown by farmers who live in the rural areas. The farming itself doesn&#x27;t occur in a vacuum, the entire economy of the rural area is mostly built around supporting the farming activity.<p>&gt; tiny number of well-educated employees<p>Some have a b.s. in agriculture. I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by &quot;tiny number&quot; except that there are a lot of non-farmers living like sardines in urban areas.<p>&gt; It happens in rural locations because that&#x27;s where land is cheap, not because it&#x27;s actually being primarily operated by some idealized urban farmer.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this is relevant, the cities where people live on welfare or develop marketing programs from cubicles are dependent on people in rural areas growing their food.')
