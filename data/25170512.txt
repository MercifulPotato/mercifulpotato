It was awesome to have a mental and physical box to store my electronics so they wouldn&#x27;t bug me. A turned off monitor still distracts me with the potential for surfing the web and work. An office or study becomes a dedicated computer room as soon as I put in a pc. I really enjoy closing cabinet doors on a pc so it feels organized and I am no longer distracted by its presence.<p>Does anyone use furniture to store and mentally zone out computers (or phones) when shutdown?')
