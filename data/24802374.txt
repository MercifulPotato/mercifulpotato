It&#x27;s been a while since I used apt in depth, but I do know that pacman tracks that and will log error messages if a file already exists.  For example when config formats change, if I have &#x2F;etc&#x2F;example.yml created already, pacman will throw an error and put the new file at &#x2F;etc&#x2F;example.yml.pac-new (or a similar scheme).<p>&gt; (if, say, both app1 and app2 need ImageMagick with different policies) ?<p>Debian typically handles that by building fat binaries&#x2F;libraries with all the possible options enabled.  In cases where there are multiple incompatible options, I&#x27;m not an expert, but I believe you create a virtual&#x2F;meta &quot;package&quot; that can be satisfied by installation of any of the incompatible binaries.  Pacman handles it similarly.  Gentoo is an oddball in that it tracks a set of system flags and enabled&#x2F;disables features in builds based on which flags you have set.  It&#x27;s able to do that because it compiles the packages itself, so you can choose the options at install time.')
