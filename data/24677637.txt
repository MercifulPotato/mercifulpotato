I will „never“ go back to a Mac.<p>One of the reasons was that I couldn‘t make Mail.app working with Exchange&#x2F;Microsoft 365 (especially shared mailboxes) and the other that Docker is so slow (volumes with many files are unusable). It‘s sad to not have a single OS for everything. I now need Windows to write e-mail and Linux to do my work.<p>I would have kept a Mac and installed Linux in dual-boot but I need something that „just works“ because I need to do work sometime and I wasn‘t sure enough that it will work smooth.')
