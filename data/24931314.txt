They usually only C&amp;D projects bring their IP to <i>other platforms</i> (discounting emulation for a bit since emulation doesn’t directly infringe). They have allowed numerous ROM hacks to exist completely unimpeded. If Mario Royale had been a combination ROM hack and LUA script&#x2F;custom emulator, it’d probably still be around. I’m honestly surprised I haven’t heard much about them going after the SM64 ports.')
