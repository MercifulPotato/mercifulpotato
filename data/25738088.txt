Kind of like how email is federated. Doesn&#x27;t really matter to me the feature set. My thought is, if one could get to some kind of adoption, folks might see how much better things could be. You&#x27;d get to select your own &quot;onramp&quot; to the social network, follow people the same way you do on email (I&#x27;m following sfblah@hackernews or whatever), etc.')
