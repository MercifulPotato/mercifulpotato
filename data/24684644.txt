You can’t just choose a nice place to build shelter for yourself - that’s “property” and it’s owned by someone already. You can’t hunt or farm your own food for similar reasons. Society demands, from birth, that you follow social laws that limit your own ability to be self-reliant.<p>I believe it’s reasonable then when OP proposes that the balance of that social contract might mean that society should also provide a safety net for the basic necessities of life.')
