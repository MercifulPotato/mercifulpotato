Item(by='xur17', descendants=None, kids=[25984939], score=None, time=1612142103, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25983398, text='&gt; I&#x27;m sorry, but it is a fact of banking that you can never, ever, admit to having liquidity issues. If it triggers a bank run, then the firm is dead, and, notably, not only the employees and managers of the firm suffer, but also the clients; and they suffer more than if the run had not happened. So, what you portray as a huge nefarious plot here is just a CEO of a startup trying to keep things going until they calm down again (which, incidentally, seems to have worked).<p>I dunno. The webull ceo discussed why they had to shut down buying, and his explanation actually made sense. He explained the T+2 system and <i>why</i> that was causing them to run into issues. The Robinhood ceo could have said something similar, and it wouldn&#x27;t have caused a bank run + it wouldn&#x27;t have felt like the ceo was hiding something from us (arguably even worse).')
