Item(by='patio11', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609210419, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25562832, text='I think you need to hear &quot;Sorry.&quot; from someone, and I&#x27;m someone, so I&#x27;m sorry this happened. I don&#x27;t specifically recall it happening, because my access to candidate-related communications doesn&#x27;t last an indefinite amount of time after the fact (y&#x27;all can probably predict reasons why the opposite would be unwise), but I&#x27;m disturbed that I can&#x27;t immediately rule out something similar to it having happened.<p>I have little within my immediate locus of control, particularly with many of my coworkers being away on break at the moment (as I am), but can promise we&#x27;ll look into what happened. This would be well below our bar. I respect that it might be too late to help you out, but we will postmortem the process.<p>For the benefit of other HNers: we try to be extremely accessible. There are some operational challenges in working with (a very large number) of candidates per year, but those are our operational challenges rather than yours, and to the extent we ever drop the ball we would far prefer knowing than not. If you ever feel like you need a bat signal, my email address is my HN username at stripe.com, and Patrick Collison&#x27;s is patrick at the same domain.<p>Nothing we do on any given Tuesday is more important than making sure Stripe is still capable of hiring great engineers&#x2F;etc.')
