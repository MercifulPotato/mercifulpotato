The weight and integrated lights and non-shitty look are particularly nice next to the typical ebike offering.<p>&gt; Suffice it to say, you&#x27;d rarely see a commuter using a carbon bike.<p>The first thing I thought about seeing this bike is how great it would be for commuting. I live in a rainy city and work on the second floor. I&#x27;ve carried my fairly light non-ebike up to the second floor about 200 times and it&#x27;s still no fun. Pulling a bulky ebike of those stairs is a hard no.<p>Likewise, I know a lot of apartment dwellers who have to carry their bike up to the second floor. Plus, in general older people. Lifting a 35 pound eBike onto your bike rack is a non-starter. A lot of my older friends who bought ebikes also bought newer lower bike racks because of the weight.<p>This bike isn&#x27;t a general use-case bike for certain, but it&#x27;s got a lot of appeal in my eyes. Doubt I&#x27;ll buy one (an e MTB is way higher on my list!), but if I was looking to replace my commuter bike it would be up there.')
