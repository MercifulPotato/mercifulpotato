But the shape of it changes over time - you’re what, nine months in? that’s still the hard time. Over the next few months, it will get easier, little by little. The kind of attention that a child needs changes, and while it continues to be intense, I find having a 2-year-old so much less mentally draining than having a small baby was.<p>If you can, just try to be present in the moment. Maybe you can’t work right now, but what you’re doing is important. Being a good parent will do more good for the world than almost anything you will ever do for money')
