That&#x27;s the name of Crayola&#x27;s new blue crayon inspired by OSU&#x27;s YInMn blue, the pigment discovered by OSU chemist Mas Subramanian. The announcement came after many months and more than 90,000 submissions by fans around the world. The name Bluetiful beat out the other four finalists, Blue Moon Bliss, Dreams Come Blue, Reach for the Stars and Star Spangled Blue. Replacing the retired yellow crayon Dandelion, Bluetiful will debut in new crayon boxes this fall.&quot;')
