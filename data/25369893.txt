China must be having lab incidents as well. There isn&#x27;t a smoking gun to indicate either that this is a lab outbreak or natural. However, in the absence of evidence we need to ask ourselves which is more likely:<p>1) A disease traveled hundreds of miles to a large city without leaving a trace of evidence<p>2) A lab had yet another outbreak<p>Almost all of the outbreak attention has been focused on the Wuhan lab that received international grants [1]. However, that lab is miles away from the initial outbreak and there&#x27;s another lab that&#x27;s a block away from the Wuhan seafood market that also does bat research (but not gain of function). This lab is also adjacent to the hospital that dealt with initial outbreak. This was pointed out by Chinese researchers in a preprint that was quickly taken down [2].<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsweek.com&#x2F;dr-fauci-backed-controversial-wuhan-lab-millions-us-dollars-risky-coronavirus-research-1500741" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsweek.com&#x2F;dr-fauci-backed-controversial-wuhan...</a><p>2: The possible origins of 2019-nCoV coronavirus 10.13140&#x2F;RG.2.2.21799.29601<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200214144447&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;339070128_The_possible_origins_of_2019-nCoV_coronavirus" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200214144447&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.resea...</a>')
