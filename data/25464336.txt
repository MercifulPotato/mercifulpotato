Item(by='peteretep', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608271377, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25459290, text='&gt; I think most in crypto are<p>Wild-ass guess: &quot;most&quot; is true of &quot;number of humans that own cypto-currency&quot;, but probably not true of &quot;percentage of crypto-currency by value held&quot;, if that makes sense. More succinctly, I&#x27;d expect more crypto to be held in exchanges than in individual wallets, if you&#x27;re able to somehow account for coins&#x2F;value stored in lost wallets.<p>Update: looks like figuring this with any real accuracy is probably near impossible')
