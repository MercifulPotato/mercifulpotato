You can also get a CNAME from last week pointing to a CNAME from 5 minutes ago pointing to a nonexistent hostname in a nonexistent zone. This feels very much like hammering on DNS to make it look like a bad copy of etcd or something.<p>Also, http(s) within SVCB is an ugly special case to be handled differently than other SVCB records. And one SVCB answer doesn&#x27;t contain all you need. E.g. there is no intent to be a replacement to or consistent with TLSA entries, so you will still need to do mutiple queries. It just contains the ECH key, so it rather looks like a half-baked kludge to make ECH work somehow.')
