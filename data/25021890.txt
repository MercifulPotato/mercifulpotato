In general I identify as very progressive (especially by US standards), but I hold some opinions that are somewhat outside of the leftist norm, and I&#x27;m more or less completely unwilling to discuss them online as I don&#x27;t trust that I will be treated in good faith.<p>The sad thing here is that I&#x27;m genuinely open to having my opinions changed, and have a history of changing my view in response to argument in the past. But can&#x27;t have my view changed if I&#x27;m too scared to even have the discussion ;-).')
