Then I realized this is basically the same concept as Unix pipes.<p>I have my little individual programs, grep, awk, sed, jq, etc, and then I can endlessly mix and match those different components to do what I want.<p>The limitation that I have seen with Unix pipes isn&#x27;t often with the ability to process or manage the data it is that it only works if all the data is setup the proper way. As I have been in the industry longer it seems to me that most code that gets written isn&#x27;t about actual computing but just centered around importing and transforming data that is expressed in different ways.<p>Is there something that makes reading in disparate data records easier so I can focus on the computing part of computer program and less time on parsing data?')
