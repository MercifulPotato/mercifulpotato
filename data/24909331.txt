I think most comments here think that this means locally overriding policies leads to elevated access on the server, but what is demonstrated is only enabling certain UX features that are disabled per server side policy by lying to the <i>client</i>. For example, the video demonstrating &quot;bypassing cloud storage restrictions&quot; only enables the client side button to add providers other than SharePoint, but this has no effect serverside. Similarly, bypassing editing and deleting policies client side is shown but with no mention of whether this has any effect on the server or is just a cosmetic effect on the client.<p>Another blog post could be written titled &quot;I wrote my own teams client where I&#x27;m allowed to edit messages locally&quot;, would that be a security issue?<p>In other words there is not really anything of note, if I read the post correctly.')
