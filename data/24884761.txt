It has been some time since I read Three-Body Problem and I bounced off The Dark Forest. This also means it&#x27;s possible my impressions are either erroneous because I forgot something important or it&#x27;s explained&#x2F; ret-conned in the subsequent books.<p>In Three-Body Problem as I recall there&#x27;s some pretty hand-waving stuff about sophons in particular. They&#x27;re basically a MacGuffin which is used to explain whatever is necessary to the plot so as to have the Trisolarans able to interfere in Earth&#x27;s affairs essentially at whim yet not obviate the invasion itself. So that&#x27;s not very Hard SF.')
