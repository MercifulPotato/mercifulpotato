And there would be no exchange of money.<p>It&#x27;s kind of sad people have to hire people to do friendly things, but this is a pandemic. And you would &quot;rent-a-person&quot; to move probably in most places (unless you had great friends haha).<p>Also this makes sense &quot;I&#x27;m not a friend or an acquaintance. I&#x27;m free of the bothersome things that accompany relationships, but can ease people&#x27;s sense of loneliness&quot;<p>So you want a throwaway friend. Or a casual therapist that does things with you. Rent them. Ok I guess not as weird as first glance. We have something similar in the US - life coaches which seemingly everyone on LinkedIn is nowadays.')
