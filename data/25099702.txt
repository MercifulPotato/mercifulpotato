There&#x27;s no boat to miss, you&#x27;ll probably be fine. Just keep a couple of things in mind<p>- The fundamental skills that you need are mathematics and software engineering. Depending on your background it might take years of additional studying.<p>- There is a big oversupply of people for the junior-mid level data science jobs. There are more people who want to get in the field than there are jobs. If you drastically switch careers, you&#x27;ll take yourself out of a field where your skillset is incredibly rare and your competition is limited and put yourself in a place where everyone else wants the same job.<p>- The fact that you have a PhD is going to help you. Personally, I don&#x27;t think that a PhD in a field other than mathematics&#x2F;computer science is that relevant but employers tend to favor applicants with PhDs mostly because there are too many candidates for any given job and asking for a PhD is just a strong initial filter. There are also research jobs within data science for which a PhD requirement (in a relevant discipline) makes more sense but these are a small proportion of all the data science jobs.<p>- If you&#x27;re already employed with your agriculture PhD, there must be a number of opportunities for you apply the techniques that you&#x27;re currently learning wihout leaving the industry. That&#x27;s probably the path that I would suggest - it would allow you to expand your skillset without taking big risks and you&#x27;ll have more options in the future. Use the career capital that you already have and explore your options instead of making a sharp turn in your career direction that might leave you disappointed.')
