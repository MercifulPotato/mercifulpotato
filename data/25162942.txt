We were required to read plenty of novels that attempt to be philosophical, but analyzing them was always a nightmare because it&#x27;s completely subjective. Is this paragraph literal? Symbolic? Metaphorical? Nothing at all? In many cases the author never explains, so there&#x27;s no way to know. Everyone is free to project their own opinions onto everything.<p>I still remember being extremely frustrated when our teacher kept telling us it was &quot;ironic&quot; that the most physically fit character drowned in Stephen Crane&#x27;s <i>The Open Boat</i> (sorry for the spoiler). It wasn&#x27;t ironic at all because he was foolish, and foolish people get themselves killed all the time!')
