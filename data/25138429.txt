You seem to be arguing that the world would be better with non-repudiable email. But then I ask how many disputes have been resolved with DKIM and you have no idea. So basically your argument has zero basis in reality.<p>You&#x27;re asking for every email user to have non-repudiation enforced unwillingly to them in every email they send so that someone maybe someday may solve some imaginary dispute with Amazon by using DKIM.')
