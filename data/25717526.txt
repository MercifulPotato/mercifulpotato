As in, each service has its own database.</i><p>Ideally yes, to scale.<p>Sometimes you have a service with obvious and easy-to-split boundaries, and microservices are a breeze.<p>Some things that are easy to turn into microservices: &quot;API Wrapper&quot; to a complex and messy third-party API. Logging and data collection. Sending emails&#x2F;messages. User authentication. Search. Anything in your app that could become another app.<p>However, when your data model is tightly coupled and you need to choose between tradeoffs (data duplication), having bigger services, or even keeping it as a monolith.<p>Btw, if you don&#x27;t care about scalability, sharing a database is still still not the best idea. But you can have a microservice that wraps the database in a service, for example. Tools like Hasura can be used for that.')
