This is really bad for community relations. With a PR model, we can review edits and provide feedback, actually having conversations with contributors, building relationships with them, and helping them learn.<p>This is a longstanding debate in wiki&#x2F;collaboratively written content, but it it interesting to note that Wikipedia and the other WMF projects have been pretty successful with the anyone can edit, revert or fix after. The review first model is used on specific pages, where it is called pending changes protection, although this is not really like a PR in that there is no comment functionality, and the standard for acceptance is lower--I don&#x27;t remember the exact wording but it is closer to &quot;this is not vandalism&#x2F;not obviously wrong&quot; rather than &quot;I personally endorse this&quot; much less &quot;this is the community consensus.&quot; These edits have no special endorsement once approved and can still be changed by other editors freely. One benefit of the PR model is finality, once an issue&#x2F;PR is decided no one else is supposed to open another one with virtually the same change. Wikipedia sort of has that via article talk pages, but there is of course no centralized &quot;maintainer&quot; to adjudicate each and every controversy. Also, many editors just don&#x27;t check or even understand them.')
