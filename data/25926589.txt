For example, I want to paint my house with a less toxic paint. I can’t trust any academic research.  I have to now research what is toxic in paint?  Then I have to find ways to measure various chemicals and gases?  Etc...<p>This seems like a complete utter waste of time.<p>In real life most life impacting academic research is much more right than wrong.  You are far better served assuming so.
