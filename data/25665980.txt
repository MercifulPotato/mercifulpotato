Communication did not happen because:\n1) cancel culture\n2) snowflake culture\n3) main stream media bias, completely shutting down one side, and lying often<p>There has been a huge decline in how people are able to deal with uncomfortable conversations, so it&#x27;s not surprising there is widespread confusion and frustration.<p>We&#x27;re all somewhat guilty of sometimes not communicating perfectly, but which culture over the past four years promoted censorship? which culture promoted shutting people up and demonizing them? We will see these times very differently in the near future, I think.<p>edit: and of course this gets downvoted lol. When are we ever going to at least start listening without visceral emotional reactions, I wonder.')
