That limit decreases, the closer you are to the temperature limit.<p>So yeah, higher-temperature superconductors could either give you higher-temperature supermagnets, or same-temperature stronger magnets. The latter is being explored with relatively new materials, for smaller tokamaks, which enabled by stronger magnetic fields.')
