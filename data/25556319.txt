The underlying premise was “USA #1” therefore if another country is doing better then let’s pipe up with a irrelevant excuse meme. The pattern is tragically hilarious.”<p>Seems like what you mean by ‘trying to help’, is to assert that and that the US problems are the result of excuses and an attitude problem.<p>Do you seriously think that no Americans are interested in how other countries do things?  As people have pointed out elsewhere, one of the two major political parties makes a point of citing other countries as models.<p>You say you are trying to help, but you haven’t offered any helpful suggestions.<p>You keep saying other countries are better governed, but somehow you haven’t identified a single thing the US could actually do to govern better.<p>It’s entirely possible that what looks like ‘better government’ isn’t a feature of a system at all, and just the result of a simpler situation of not having had to face particular challenges.<p>Without actually saying what the US could do better, you really aren’t making a case for anything.<p>What we do know, is that you keep saying that other countries are better than the US, and that you firmly believe this.<p>How is this different from the people who believe that the US is better than other counties?  Aren’t you just the mirror image of the thing you are criticizing?')
