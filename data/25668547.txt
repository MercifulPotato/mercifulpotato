You fell into one marketing trap with WhatsApp and have now fallen for another.<p>Signal is another private entity with complete control of the servers and end client binaries. The fact they happen to open source the code is kind of moot since no services are allowed to write alternative implementations, no one can run their own servers or prove what code is running on Signals servers, nor can anyone even distribute reproducibly built binaries from said source code for accountability (e.g. f-droid).<p>There are so many better options. I suggest Element&#x2F;Matrix which can even bridge to WhatsApp and Signal as needed thanks to community contributed bridges.')
