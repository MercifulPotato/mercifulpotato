But I can&#x27;t subscribe to everything, and would prefer a single-shot purchase (even if I were to end up upgrading the year after, I would have the option not to).<p>Other than that, the app seems to be _exactly_ what I need when compared to, say, Agenda (which I already own and use). So, in a nutshell, I&#x27;d likely switch if the pricing were different solely for the plain text storage.')
