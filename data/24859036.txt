Each to their own, but for myself, these are surely not something to be taking like a coffee or tea.  And even then I don&#x27;t think coffee, tea or processed sugar is something we should take regularly either!  But I&#x27;m a bit hardcore.<p>Pretty much the only circumstance that I think it is ok to take hallucinogens is when you believe you have adopted a negative approach in viewing reality, when you&#x27;ve gone down a cul de sac of sorts.  If this is a day in day out experience perhaps a &#x27;pattern interupt&#x27; is a good thing.<p>Hallucinogens can be a way appraise the world and enjoy its many manifest glories - daily I look at trees or clouds and am in admiration of the wonder of nature in this experience.  So, in the right circumstances, if LSD et al help you break out and get closer to one&#x27;s more natural, feral state, then great  :)')
