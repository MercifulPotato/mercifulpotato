Actually this is a part of Apple&#x27;s marketing for ignorant people.<p>I have been using various Linux distros and Android phones for years and never got a malware and virus because:\n- I install software from trusted sources or compile from the source\n- I keep SW, OS and kernels up-to-date\n- It is getting harder and harder to exploit modern systems thanks to improved sandboxes in browsers, namespaces, ASLR and other techs<p>What people just need is a bit of training on how to use a computer. They don&#x27;t need Apple.')
