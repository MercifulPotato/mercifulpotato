This, however, rests on the assumption that there is a &#x27;holy grail&#x27; in physics (aka a theory of everything). It&#x27;s a matter of taste, but I don&#x27;t like that idea that there is a theory of everything because it doesn&#x27;t seem reasonable that every last bit of our universe is explainable by a single theory. Why would that be? Seems like a conspiracy, if this was the case. To me, it&#x27;s rather quite comforting to assume that there is something (be it the position and momentum of an electron) which we won&#x27;t ever be able to understand because it just seams realistic. If this wasn&#x27;t the case and we could show that there is a theory of everything I would immediately start my quest to find Morpheus to ask him to give me the right pill to wake up.')
