I hated using laptops for software work. Nothing was powerful enough and specs were limited. My last laptop had a max screen resolution of 1366x768; I was disgusted when I booted it. I don&#x27;t like Macs.<p>Due to Covid I moved away from our central office, but next year I&#x27;ll have to commute there every month or two for meetings. Obviously I can&#x27;t lug a massive desktop around on a train.<p>So I bought a customised Dell Precision Mobile workstation. It cost a small fortune, but I reckon I&#x27;ll have this for years. The CPU will probably outperform my current 4790K and it allows more RAM (128GB) than my current motherboard (32GB). I can also stick a 4G SIM card into it so I&#x27;ll have broadband pretty much anywhere I am. Ideal for these days of remote working.<p>I&#x27;ll get work to buy a M.2 drive and I&#x27;ll stick a VM on it and restrict work activities to that. If I leave I can just send that back.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy another desktop if my current one goes kaput. Potentially for gaming, but I don&#x27;t do that quite so much these days. (Ryzen would be a temptation though.)')
