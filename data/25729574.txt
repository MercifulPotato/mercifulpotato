It seems like the problem here is the auto-braking feature kicking on, perhaps disorienting the driver or causing a following car to need to panic brake+swerve. This isn&#x27;t an instance of a driver becoming inattentive because they expect the computer to act for them. Rather it&#x27;s an ever-present system erroneously deciding to take control of the car - analagous to a mechanical failure. What could a driver do to avoid this behavior, besides knowing to disable that system off ahead of the hazard?')
