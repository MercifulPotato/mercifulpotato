Implementations pick and choose new features based on customer demand.<p>Also, COBOL is dominated by large legacy codebases, which means that if there&#x27;s a discrepancy between an implementation and the specification, the users normally don&#x27;t want it fixed, because they may have written code that depends on the &quot;incorrect&quot; behaviour and it&#x27;s a lot of work to audit.<p>IBM built a new backend for its COBOL compiler using the optimizer from their JVM. IIRC by the time I left it generated code that was ~2x faster than the old compiler, but uptake was still slow because of migration concerns. In particular, we spent a lot of time working on features to help guarantee that code with some forms of undefined behaviour would have the same result as the old version.')
