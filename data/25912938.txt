He&#x27;s a young German guy living here in New Zealand. After a quick examination: &quot;So! You have solar keratosis! How long have you been wearing the hat?&quot; Me: &quot;Oh 5 years or so&quot;. Him: &quot;And how long have you lived here?&quot; Me: &quot;All my life, 60 years&quot;. Him: &quot;Just so! It seems all Kiwis have solar keratosis ja?&quot;.<p>In other words, there are downsides to being outside in that 1000 times (maybe 10000 times here) brightness. The really annoying thing is that my eyes were buggered from a young age too, despite all that brightness.')
