You can ruin someone&#x27;s life by exploiting their SSN, but in Brazil, the damage that can be done by knowing your CPF is way lower, specially because it is supposed to be a public number and security is implemented in other ways.<p>That said, yeah, the CPF can be used to do cross company identification, BI&#x2F;AI&#x2F;Data science and all sorts of optimizations in the marketing and can be used to scam you. But lets be honest here: Software industry in Brazil is mostly incompetent and largely lacking the expertise to make it happen. A few companies might do well using this data, but the cost is so high, for so little gain, it is completely laughable in comparison of what US companies just with your email and phone paired together.')
