The more people realized this the more the job market was flooded until the .com bubble burst. Which was a good thing, really.<p>Here we have the same thing again. The things I remember most from last bubble that match with this are for-profit &#x27;technical colleges&#x27; with &#x27;degrees&#x27; but they arent really because they&#x27;re un-accredited. Now they just call them  coding boot camps, but I see no difference.<p>It all smells like taking advantage of the most desperate of people in the worst spots who want nothing more than to genuinely improve their lives.<p>I believe ITT Tech and Hallmark eventually got sued over the same stuff- lying about job placement ratios, constant teacher turnover, constant ripoff and high pressure tactics stories.<p>Also fanny packs are back again, so why not for profit pretend schools?<p>All we do is visit the same crimes to each other.')
