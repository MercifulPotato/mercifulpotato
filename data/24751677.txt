Why? Because in the cases you want to use FUSE (for example, to implement a locally mounted Google Drive&#x2F;Dropbox&#x2F;etc.), you could also just spin up an NFS server instead. That actually makes a lot of sense to me, because that NFS server is much easier to for example containerize (you can&#x27;t actually containerize a FUSE implementation and use it on your host. Or maybe you can but at least that would be a very involved process). I&#x27;m not sure of NFS is the best protocol for this use case (maybe something like CIFS is better), but the general direction is actually interesting.')
