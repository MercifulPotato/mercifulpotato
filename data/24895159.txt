An immune response means that the immune system actually is taking action against the viral antigen.<p>Glass half empty: We don&#x27;t know how the immune response measured relates to protection from or lessening of the infection. This is what the ongoing trial is trying to find out.<p>This is, IIRC, the second report of successful immunogenicity in older people.
