He&#x27;s a hardcore conservative.<p>His childhood&#x2F;teenage hero was Janosik, a highlander bandit along the lines of Robin Hood. Being a fan of vigilante justice is not a good sign if you&#x27;re a minister of justice.<p>He&#x27;s bothered by independent courts and independent prosecutors. He puts pressure on judges ruling not along his will, he harasses them, stripped one of immunity for investigating a break of parliamentary statute. If you do something he doesn&#x27;t like, he might relocate or harass you under a pretext. Make an example out of you. His actions are clearly aimed to produce a chilling effect. But priests accused of pedophilia get silent protection, including getting a peek into court documents. He also likes to micromanage court cases, especially in flashy cases where it&#x27;s easy to get an emotional reaction from people, such as accusions of rape, pedophilia (except by priests), murder.<p>He gets in bed with Ordo Iuris, a para-legal branch of the Brazilian catholic sect TFP, condemned by bishops in Brazil in the 80&#x27;s. They are absolutely against abortion and openly seek goals like forbidding divorce.<p>He&#x27;s a mediocre lawyer.<p>He objects to the idea that European Union cares about law-abidingness and asked the consitutional court to check if the idea is compatible with constitution. Political goals and &quot;good of the nation&quot; are more important to him.<p>He&#x27;s a paranoid, petty and vindictive person. Also, very power hungry.<p>&gt; does not break Polish law<p>The ruling party intentionally creates ambiguous law that can be applied in an arbitrary manner. Be on the party&#x27;s good side.<p>Current Polish government is a lite version of authoritarianism, and getting more so over time. It doesn&#x27;t control all aspects of life like a totalitarian party would, yet. But it&#x27;s trying, for example religion, against sexuality(including basic sexual education), edits history textbooks, paints new people as heroes and erases old ones. Doctors and experts don&#x27;t have much to say in matters of the pandemic. One party official openly stated they have no use for experts because they refuse to implement the party policy.<p>Don&#x27;t miss the fact no ruling party member congratulated Joe Bidden on winning the election. The closest they got was congratulating him on a &quot;good campaign&quot;, echoing the statements of those like Vladimir Putin. They are very much fans of Donald Trump. NATO&#x27;s new focus on &quot;defense of democracy&quot;, EU&#x27;s attention to law-abidingneness, Biden&#x27;s ostensible emphasis on values and democracy are all dark clouds for the Polish ruling party.<p>The bottom line: for the pro-West, pro-EU Poles, Ziobro is an awful person.')
