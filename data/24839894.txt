Item(by='smsm42', descendants=None, kids=[24840354], score=None, time=1603213961, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24839830, text='&gt; A person who is looking for a full-time job that pays a living wage — but who can&#x27;t find one — is unemployed<p>&quot;living wage&quot; here adds a layer of confusion. Some argue &quot;living wage&quot; is at least $15 an hour, some argue even more. Certainly living in San Francisco on $15 an hour wage, even working fulltime, would be a challenge. However, this has nothing to do with &quot;unemployment&quot; as it is commonly understood. This is just confusing separate economic and societal problems to arrive at flashy number that actually doesn&#x27;t mean much, as it is a result of different people having different economic and personal challenges.')
