Which even on a PvP server, relatively few numbers of people actually do these days (especially if they are grown men). Doesn&#x27;t take much of a man to fight someone who is defenseless, whether it&#x27;s virtual or the real world.<p>FWIW, I thought it was funny at the time when it happened in the game, but not so funny now after hearing of the allegations and feeling like this guy actually has serious issues.')
