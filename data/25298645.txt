But it&#x27;s a closed system\n...\n&gt; Apple did something truly revolutionary<p>While I don&#x27;t deny they deserve a lot of credit for this, I think it&#x27;s important to keep in mind that in many cases Apple does this by exploiting its lack of openness. ie: these things are not unlinked.<p>So where some people see Apple innovating and achieving breakthroughs, I also see them exploiting and leaching off an ecosystem in a toxic way. It&#x27;s like a chemical plant that dumps its waste into the local river - they get a free ride (not complying with interoperable &#x2F; openness) which is fine if they are a small part of the ecosystem. But if every company was like that we would be living in technology hell. There would be no internet, no ecosystem of reliable affordable server infrastructure, there wouldn&#x27;t be a single phone you could write an app for if it wasn&#x27;t in the corporate interest of a mammoth entity, etc etc.')
