Certainly they had a culture of being ... not good, and that probably filtered down to customer service and processing, which hosed me over multiple times in the short time I had used them.  They ended up costing me hundreds of dollars in fines and late fees because they mishandled escrow (and I was told it wasn&#x27;t just me, they mishandled a lot in my county), so... ~$140 15 years later is probably not all the useful.  A more accurate figure may have been, let&#x27;s say, ~$1000 15 years ago, to cover the late fees&#x2F;penalties along with my own time&#x2F;stress figuring it all out (multiple trips and calls to county office, time away from work, etc).')
