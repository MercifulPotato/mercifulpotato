Search engines were Hotbot and Webcrawler after Yahoo.  Cannot recall the others.<p>When I think back IE browser was the top browser and there were all sorts of workarounds to get it html compliant (or rather IE compliant).  Easy to learn html, but hard to get it working right.  Then adding in javascript for the added dynamic flair.<p>I wanted to learn javascript &amp; I ended up learning first java not knowing the difference at the time.  Fun times were also spent at Barnes &amp; Nobles &#x2F; Borders (bookstore in U.S.) - checking out technical books and eventually I toiled through learning VBScript &#x2F; Windows IIS to extend out a simple ecommerce site and possibly paving my way into the technical field.<p>Didn&#x27;t Netscape also have email integration?  I can&#x27;t recall anymore as I went through multiple internet providers like Aol.')
