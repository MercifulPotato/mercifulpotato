Setting up a strawman “absolute purist” (and yes, this <i>is</i> a strawman - no, you <i>haven’t</i> worked with real people taking the extreme strawman TDD position that could magically justify this) and then using needlessly insulting or belittling language to condemn the fake strawman is totally ridiculous. Your attempted defense of it is not acceptable.<p>You could just as easily say something like, “People who take TDD to an extreme are hard to work with and ultimately their inflexibility and unwillingness to appreciate other approaches does more harm than good.”<p>See how that’s <i>not dehumanizing</i>? See how that accomplishes the same thing without disgusting juvenile insults like saying someone of a different ideology has a “frail little mind”?')
