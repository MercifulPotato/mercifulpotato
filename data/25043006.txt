When I migrated to Fastmail, I just had to tell Fastmail that I wanted it to handle mail from the domain, set the MX records at my domain&#x27;s nameserver to point to Fastmail, add a TXT record there for SPF, and add some CNAME records for DKIM. Fastmail gives instructions for all that here [1].<p>There was no need to update any sites with my email address because my address did not change. And there will be no need to update any sites if I ever decide to move from Fastmail to some other mail service, or to go back to running my own mail server.<p>Even simpler, you can use Fastmail as your DNS provider. Then it is just a matter of registering a domain, and telling your registrar that Fastmail is your DNS provider. Fastmail takes care of setting up the mail-related DNS records then. Here are there instructions for this approach [2].<p>The only serious things I use addresses that aren&#x27;t @mydomain for are things that I might need to receive email from in order to resolve problems with @mydomain.<p>I strongly recommend this approach.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastmail.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;receive&#x2F;domains-setup-mxonly.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastmail.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;receive&#x2F;domains-setup-mxonly.h...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastmail.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;receive&#x2F;domains-setup-nsmx.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fastmail.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;receive&#x2F;domains-setup-nsmx.htm...</a>')
