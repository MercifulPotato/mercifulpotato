I haven&#x27;t taken them for ~1.5 weeks and my perception has completely changed. They pulled me out of my head and thoughts, I am now much more aware of my body sensations and visually aware of the things around me, colors, angles, layouts. It feels like a completely different world.<p>In my early 20&#x27;s I had similar experience that I would have absolutely described has hppd. I smoked heavily for ~6 months and when I stopped it was so unsettling and caused me extreme anxiety and mental anguish; my visual perception of the world was completely different. There was a &#x27;before&#x27; and &#x27;after&#x27; perception and my mind couldn&#x27;t accept it. I had crippling anxiety, would avoid people, couldn&#x27;t hold a job, would have panic attacks and believed I was going crazy. It was literally hell.')
