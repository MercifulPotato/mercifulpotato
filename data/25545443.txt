I don&#x27;t they were so dumb.<p>The process of &#x27;making&#x27; engages us on an entirely different level than intellectualizing, and I think really differentiates the discipline. There are many bits of software that we use daily, not made by &#x27;genius&#x27; but rather the sweat and effort of &#x27;some guy who did it, mostly because it worked&#x27;.<p>You don&#x27;t need any maths, but it&#x27;s probably a good sign if you do.')
