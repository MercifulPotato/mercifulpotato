What else is being loaded up into RAM besides page content for tabs, and extensions&#x2F;plugins for the browser?<p>Understandably, the more a tab loads, such as a heavy page full of large ads, the larger that tab&#x27;s helper process will be. Conversely, if one loads a basic HTML file with just a few paragraphs of text, that tab will be ~20MB.<p>But then, why does the browser process itself take up 400-500MB, and for that matter the GPU renderer another 500-800MB? What leads to this bloat?')
