Democracy is kind of like everyone voting on a menu item and then everyone gets the mode, in the employment model everyone gets their own choice.<p>&gt; It has a correspondence in the syllogism I was replying to. Sure, you could become self-employed, but in the same way you could also become a politician.<p>Everyone gets what the apparent majority has chosen, everyone gets to choose their own employment. I&#x27;m not sure I see the parallel here.<p>&gt; Employment seems to be even more of a sham than democracy.<p>Quite the contrary, in employment <i>quid pro quo</i> is the going rate, in democracy some people consider it correct and another group consider it to be corruption of the system.')
