I think a much better method is to recognize that if you have trouble figuring out a gift for a person, you either haven&#x27;t put enough thought into it, or you don&#x27;t know the person as well as you might like.<p>&gt; &quot;I love X author&quot;<p>This is fine as long as you realize they probably own all of author&#x27;s works and maybe even pre-ordered the latest release.

If you personally know something about the hobby this can work. But if you find yourself saying &quot;The minimum wage employee at Best Buy told me this widget was the best one&quot;, you&#x27;re gifting an obligation to use what might be an inferior product or one that doesn&#x27;t meet their needs or expectations. It might even be one they ruled out for themselves.
