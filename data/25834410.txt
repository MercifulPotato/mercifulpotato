The way to make money is to offer support or hosting. However, many businesses would prefer support and&#x2F;or hosting from a big enterprise. For example, a lot of CTO’s would prefer Amazon Elastic Search vs a separate agreement with  Elastic if for no other reason than that there is a single bill and a single entity to call for support. You don’t want Elastic saying it’s an AWS issue and Amazon saying it’s an Elastic issue.<p>In addition, the fact that API’s are not copyrighted makes this even more in favor of the big enterprises like Amazon, as they can release something with the same API.<p>Honestly, the problem of how to sustain an open source business in this environment is an open question.')
