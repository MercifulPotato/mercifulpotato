The author is really complaining about encoding and decoding domain objects (happening to use JSON as a representation) and being able to rehydrate them into full blown objects. This is actually a very trivial problem indeed!<p>You gotta remember that JSON doesn’t support all of the types that many languages do. So you need to engineer around that by annotating your attributes with a type or relying on a naming convention on keys. You can’t get mad at JSON for not being good at this. It would like getting mad at a dog for barking at the mail man. It’s doing what it was designed to do.<p>There are lots of tools and approaches for doing this. The native DynamoDB storage format comes to mind.')
