That is fine, it is the nature of computers, they are basically abstraction machines. And OS&#x27;s are pretty mature and stable, I don&#x27;t really ever need to debug the OS itself in order to deploy software to one, for the kind of software I write. (Others might need to know more).<p>But personally I still haven&#x27;t figured out how to use K8, heh.')
