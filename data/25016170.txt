Many universities grant software engineering degrees and apply principles of engineering to software.<p>The whole point of this article is to treat &quot;engineering&quot; as a reserved and hallowed word and vocation.  Its name and usage must be protected at all costs lest we let just anyone call themselves an engineer.<p>It&#x27;s an argument of arrogance and appeals to maintaining the status quo of exclusionary system.  You didn&#x27;t take a certain test or wear an iron ring? Sorry, you can&#x27;t call yourself this one title.  The title of &quot;doctor&quot; has similar historical exclusion, with infighting common amongst multiple professions (e.g., medical doctors not thinking dentists or PhD&#x27;s are actual doctors).<p>Language evolves.  Stop being protectionist about a certain word.')
