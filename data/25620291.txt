I never re-implement working code using new features just because I can.  I have enough on my plate to just use the most convenient features initially. Over time, especially if I have a performance or code complexity issue will I take the time to read up on and understand new features.<p>My philosophy is:  Don&#x27;t fix what isn&#x27;t broken.  I suspect that might also be the case for most large code bases.')
