If you don&#x27;t do it moxie&#x27;s way then you&#x27;re doing it wrong. I was once shut down on HN by the Signal posse because I said that I&#x27;d like to have a Signal client library that I could use to write my own custom lightweight client. Apparently I&#x27;m not worthy and clearly incapable of writing secure code. Meanwhile I have to use that crappy, gigantic official electron app that cost them at least one serious security vulnerability in the past (JS injection, if memory serves).<p>If you want to make a nerdy niche chat client that&#x27;s probably a good mindset, but if you hope to appeal to the masses you&#x27;ll have to put some water in your wine eventually. I managed to convince a couple of my groups to migrate away from WhatsApp lately, but unfortunately always towards Telegram. Signal is just not there yet if you want a drop-in replacement.')
