It saves them money. Using bad data to make bad decisions about employee careers does not benefit the employer.<p>Most of this information is already available. I don’t anticipate this actually being a problem. I could be wrong! But so far in my 14 year career I’ve not been held back by bad decisions based on bugs closed, lines of code written, or diffs landed. I do not anticipate a new set of even less relevant data changing this.')
