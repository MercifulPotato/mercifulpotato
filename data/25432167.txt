Other encoding and playback characteristics are just way more important if you aren&#x27;t building for videophiles.<p>Netflix limiting mac chrome playback to 720p is case in point if true (though I&#x27;ve never heard this). What % of their &quot;high-end&quot; users is this? My macbook has more than five times as many pixels than 720p... I&#x27;ve never noticed this, and Netflix surely recognizes that they don&#x27;t stand to gain much by streaming higher resolution to most users.<p>Netflix, of course, <i>does</i> build for videophiles, but I still hold my conviction to the extent that I constantly question the priority of work to make something 1080p or 4K.<p>I will certainly concede that VR use cases need higher than 720p resolution.')
