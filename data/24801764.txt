I get the sense that overall they&#x27;re spending less time staring at the internet.<p>I think the key insight that many people have reached after ~20 years of social media use is that, while there&#x27;s a dopamine-feel of communicating and socializing, you&#x27;re actually just consuming entertainment, so why not split the issues and make both your entertainment consumption <i>and</i> your socializing more direct and intentional.<p>I suspect that pattern is also part of why the social media systems that are successful in the modern era are those that deemphasize content in favor of social interaction (whatsapp, discord) or deemphasize social interaction in favor of content consumption (instagram, tiktok)')
