Item(by='hakfoo', descendants=None, kids=[25655523], score=None, time=1609914763, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25652266, text='The value for an American middleman should be in curation and market understanding.  &quot;Don&#x27;t bother selling the metric part here, it fits no local products&quot;, or &quot;That meme ran its course already here, nobody&#x27;s gonna buy a phone case with it anymore.&quot; and also &quot;there&#x27;s already 5000 people selling blue widgets, don&#x27;t try to jump into that crowded market.&quot;<p>A big risk factor is choice paralysis.  I know legitimate purchase intent browsing&#x2F;searching gets derailed when customers see too many choices and lose confidence. Did I specify the wrong search criteria?  Am I buying the right one of these 500 near-identical items?  Is there a better deal I&#x27;m missing?  Should I check five other shops?<p>If marketplace sellers practiced good curation, this risk is reducible, but I suspect marketplace platforms prefer large numbers of sellers and massive inventory count to convey vast selections (of things you don&#x27;t actually want).')
