It&#x27;s relatively hard to imagine how you&#x27;d have widespread increase in price without increase in cost of labour.<p>As to your case study of a low wage worker, if he doesn&#x27;t have any assets, inflation doesn&#x27;t mean much. If he has debt, which he likely has, student debt say in the US, inflation is a good thing. The (correct) conventional wisdom is that debtors benefit from inflation and creditors don&#x27;t.<p>And if you&#x27;ve got money in a pension fund like many Americans, or you have index funds, or you have anything else that broadly represents the economy, cash flowing into the economy rises prices but it also appreciates assets.<p>There really isn&#x27;t any point to fear moderate inflation from the standpoint of a worker. If anything the opposite is true.<p>I agree with the fact that gig work is terrible and lots is wrong with economic insecurity, but steady inflation isn&#x27;t an issue.')
