How? That&#x27;s incredible... In big cities I always hear of people Uber-ing food, and never once I heard people doing a door dash? Is dashing a verb? \nIn the article it highlights how airbnb-ing is part of our vocab. For example you say &quot;I am just gonna airbnb it&quot;, so that really tells me that airbnb have done their marketing well...\nUnlike doordash, &quot;uber it&quot; and &quot;get it on uber eats&quot; is commonly heard...so I wonder...playing in hard mode is great but only when you win. Who&#x27;s truly winning?')
