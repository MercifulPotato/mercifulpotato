When you find one, they seem to charge a minimum fee of £12 regardless of how much you use.<p>Most chargers are slow. Either 7kw or 11kw is common; 20kw is considered rapid in some places.<p>The fragmentation of networks means you need at least four crap apps just to get around and then you’ll probably need to install a new app if you’re going somewhere new.<p>What you call convenient locations are a mixed blessing. Spaces for chargers are often ICEd in my experience because they’re in busy car parks.<p>I just want to pull up, plug in, and tap my credit card. The charge networks seem to go out of their way to make using the service painful.')
