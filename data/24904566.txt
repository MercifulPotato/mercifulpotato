Because you sound like you&#x27;re ready to trade off people&#x27;s lives using whatever traits you think are equivalent, in the name of diversity or some symbolic goal you wish to achieve.<p>When someone lives in a certain state and applies to university, they have the opportunity to show their worth and skills by their achievements.  When Harvard seeks to broaden their search for those people to new geographies, all to the better.<p>When Harvard says that no matter how good you are, because you&#x27;re Asian, your achievements will be weighed a little less because we have enough of them, I cannot believe that you are unable to see how that&#x27;s different.<p>And your principles of how you judge whether there are &quot;enough&quot; Asians, well, sir, they could equally be used by someone to say there are &quot;enough&quot; black students or Hispanic students, or any minority, by someone less well-intentioned.<p>I would rather have the approach where no one is deciding that there&#x27;s &quot;enough&quot; of some group based on their favored characteristic of the day.')
