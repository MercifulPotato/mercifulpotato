I don&#x27;t know much about AI or this group she&#x27;s in, or her for that matter. But I&#x27;m all for diversity in tech and women&#x27;s rights, etc.<p>What strikes me is how out of touch she seems to be. We&#x27;re in the middle of pandemic and millions of people are out of work. The worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. However, due to luck, her credentials and research, she has been able to continue working for one of the top companies in the world and is even able to take a vacation. Good for her.<p>And yet, while <i>on vacation</i>, she makes demands of her employer that perhaps she was aware they wouldn&#x27;t&#x2F;couldn&#x27;t meet.<p>I&#x27;m stunned by the <i>if you don&#x27;t accept my conditions, I&#x27;ll deal with you, when I&#x27;m good and ready, when I get back from vacation</i>. Like, how out of touch and tone deaf is this?<p>Anyway, the first thing she does, after rage quitting, is to run to Twitter to complain. She even said on Twitter that she didn&#x27;t have a lawyer and wanted to find one ASAP. Honestly, everything Google did seems perfectly reasonable. Is her behavior unbecoming of a manager? Based on what I saw on Twitter, I&#x27;d say &#x27;Yes&#x27;.<p>I had been following her on Twitter and saw this pop-up last night. It was kind of confusing and seemed like it was going to become very annoying, so I unfollowed. Then today, it kept showing up in other people&#x27;s feeds, so I blocked her and muted people who retweeted her.<p>There is such a thing as a &quot;brilliant jerk&quot; and usually companies keep such people around too long. Seems like Google decided this headache wasn&#x27;t worth it, and cut her loose. But now we see a &quot;brilliant jerk&quot; who is female and a minority&#x2F;POC.')
