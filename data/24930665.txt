I&#x27;ve read the books and know about the SLA&#x2F;SLO and honestly it doesn&#x27;t make any sense for smaller companies with few services.<p>I code up alerts for various metrics, act upon said alerts, sometimes do the fixes my self if it&#x27;s simple, otherwise just hand it off to devs by logging a bug.
