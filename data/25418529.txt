Turns out that the &quot;Probe&quot; component (installed on machines in remote networks to act as a centralized data collector within that network) does use the affected Orion DLL, but the version appears to be older than the malicious version.<p>If this hadn&#x27;t been spotted sooner I wonder if the affected component would have ended up being bundled into n-Able and being shipped that way too.')
