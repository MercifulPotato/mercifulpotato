Those components can be run on the server without losing any interactivity. Especially if a component has highly branching logic, this reduces the amount that has to be sent to the client by a large margin.<p>The programming model is very similar and it’s possible to make one component that works on both server and client simultaneously, which means you’re not locked in if you want to move a server component back to the client later.')
