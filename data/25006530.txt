Trying to understand things like observability &amp; metrics are going to be highly different between systems<p>Literally none of this matters for a home server. I have a mail&#x2F;web server that I haven’t had to change the configuration on since I last setup letsencrypt like 4 years ago. I don’t check metrics or have observability other than “does it work” and that does fine.<p>You’re caught up sucking in a bunch of technical debt preparing for something that simply doesn’t matter.')
