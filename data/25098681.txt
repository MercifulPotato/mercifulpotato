If the answer is &quot;no&quot; then don&#x27;t do it.<p>For instance, maybe you have a graduate degree from a prestigious university but for whatever reason you don&#x27;t want to work at a place where that&#x27;s a filter, so you leave it off.<p>Maybe you&#x27;ve been doing technology X for a couple years and you&#x27;re both good at it and really sick of it. So you leave that off too.<p>Really, this is about the kind of culture you want to be part of, the kind of people your want to work with and where you think you&#x27;ll be happy.<p>You&#x27;ll get fewer offers but you won&#x27;t be working a job you hate that makes you miserable for the next year or two. Isn&#x27;t that the more important thing?<p>Make sure you&#x27;re sending <i>your personal</i> right signals')
