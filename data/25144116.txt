The attribution is imperfect in some places, lacking in other places.<p>If you&#x27;d like an example, examine the map on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.facebook.com&#x2F;Stekerlapatte" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;m.facebook.com&#x2F;Stekerlapatte</a><p>Facebook is, in all fairness, contributing to the OSMF&#x27;s efforts to come up with new, better, clear attribution guidelines, and they are understandably waiting for them to be approved before overhauling things.
