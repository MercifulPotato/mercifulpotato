Item(by='yjftsjthsd-h', descendants=None, kids=[24807194], score=None, time=1602895194, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24806399, text='&gt; It&#x27;s hard for me to imagine that atlassian would allow individual instances of jira&#x2F;confluence&#x2F;etc in their cloud versions to get nearly as much resources as you need to give them on-prem.<p>I always wondered that, too! Like, you&#x27;d think that if you have devs building a product and a team running a hosted instance of the product in the same company, that they&#x27;d have a very good feedback loop and make it easy to run the thing and to do it well. Although, I wonder if the answer is that it&#x27;s <i>not</i> the same product - like with bitbucket, where the thing they run in the cloud isn&#x27;t the same thing as they sell for on-prem. Or even a lighter version (BB, AFAIK, is literally 2 separate codebases), where they cut features in order to make the cloud version work.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s hard for me to see how &quot;Java&quot; and &quot;cloud&quot; go together.<p>Nah, it&#x27;s not Java, it&#x27;s the specific product. I&#x27;ve worked at a SaaS shop that did all Java, and while the pathological cases are comically bad, it&#x27;s actually fine most of the time IME.')
