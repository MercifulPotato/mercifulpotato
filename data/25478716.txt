Right now if you&#x27;re not in a daily COVID-facing role (i.e. an actual front line medical worker) or in a nursing home you should not be getting the shot. This makes my blood boil. There should have been laws passed regarding ordering of the distribution with criminal penalties for line jumpers like this.<p>There&#x27;s an article in our local paper with a happy picture of one of our state&#x27;s congressional representatives (a healthy 34-year-old!) getting the shot. Like WTF? There&#x27;s doctors and nurses who are <i>treating covid patients</i> who can&#x27;t get it yet. Why the heck does Congress get priority over them?<p>Not only do these people have no shame, half of them even have the nerve to brag about it to the rest of us plebes who will have to wait months or more to get it.')
