Item(by='kube-system', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611175356, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25850551, text='IANAL, but I would think the artist would have copyright as normal for a couple of reasons —- the involvement FedEx did was for hire —- and FedEx’s actions were used as tool in creating the work that they didn’t even know was being created. The artist still caused it to be created.')
