These systems were planned in a post-war, high-growth context. A lot of countries are having some kind of trouble with pensions, resorting to increasing minimum retirement age (Portugal, UK, Russia come to mind -- I&#x27;m sure there are others) or otherwise trying to find alternative funding for increasingly expensive pensions.<p>Again, I still think the trade is fair (less &quot;personal&quot; income in exchange for more social benefits, healthier and happier society), but I find the certainty people talk about pensions a bit odd.')
