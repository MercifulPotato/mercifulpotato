Item(by='jfengel', descendants=None, kids=[25050529], score=None, time=1605036377, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25045467, text='&quot;Well-written communication&quot; is slightly better idiomatic English than &quot;good written communication&quot;, but the latter isn&#x27;t incorrect. &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;written&quot; are both adjectives modifying &quot;communication&quot;. The potential confusion with &quot;well-written&quot; (where &quot;well&quot; is an adverb modifying &quot;written&quot;) makes &quot;good&quot; feel a little awkward, but it&#x27;s valid.<p>That&#x27;s hardly the worst thing about the sentence. &quot;Today&quot; is vacuous. &quot;It&#x27;s&quot; is passive. &quot;Almost&quot; weakens &quot;obvious&quot;, so we haven&#x27;t even gotten to any actual information in the sentence and we&#x27;re already quibbling. &quot;Creates a business advantage&quot; is awkward and vague. How does it create an advantage? What does this advantage accomplish?<p>All it means is &quot;Good writing is important&quot;, and that is in fact so obvious that it doesn&#x27;t need to be said. So skip it and move on to something the reader might actually want to know.')
