After few weeks my Google Ads account got banned forever (no appeal available) for fraudulent clicks. There is no way to reverse this ban. I am 100% sure I didn&#x27;t click on my own ads. I guess someone could easily do some suspicious activity on your ads (or just extract your Ads ID from Android APK) and then get your account banned. Fortunately, they only blocked me from Google Ads for life, but not from the rest of the account. Also - never ever open a Google Play developer account with your personal Google email.
