The argument &quot;This isn&#x27;t what the web was made for&quot; is kind of a cowpath argument. The web is being used to (among other things) browse applications. Whether or not that&#x27;s what anyone planned is irrelevant. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening right now.<p>I think it&#x27;s fair to suggest paths forward that both accommodate users and also bring sanity, but tagging every attempt at progressing applications-in-browser as &quot;Square peg, round hole, need native app&quot; just totally dismisses most of the users these applications are trying to capture.')
