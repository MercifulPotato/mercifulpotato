What people tend to ignore is that the defenders do this <i>while sustaining much higher casualties</i>. Oh, and civilian casualties are typically an order of magnitude higher because high explosives aren’t very discriminatory.<p>On one hand, that’s an interesting discussion about modern warfare. On the other it is not a convincing argument about how you shouldn’t be too worried about the US military, because while a guérilla campaign might be able to stop them, it would only work after getting hundreds of thousands of people killed in your country. Not exactly a comforting argument.')
