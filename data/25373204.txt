(Or any other percentile.) If not, what would falsify that statement?<p>I don&#x27;t honestly know. Quality of life is in my mind the most important factor and is hard to measure, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any one statistic or small group of statistics that can capture it.<p>What worries me at the moment is the trend of 40-50 years of productivity increases leaving wages far behind. The elimination of secure, well paying jobs for the lower working classes that have been replaced with gig&#x2F;service work where you hope you&#x27;ll be given enough hours to make end meet that week. Sectors of local economies destroyed or made dependent on global capital firms with huge losses. I want to know where it will end, because all I can see in the future is rising inequality and stratification.<p>&gt; Close to my heart (coming from Germany) is the absence of pervasive occupational licensing in Singapore. Similarly the absence of minimum wage laws.<p>I&#x27;m not familiar with occupational licensing in Germany. But I don&#x27;t have a problem with it if it&#x27;s done to ensure safety&#x2F;quality and there are minimal barriers to entry, employers seem all too happy to introduce inexperienced workers to situations which may not be obviously dangerous to the worker without proper training.<p>Minimum wage is a fairly contentious issue, what is it you dislike about it in particular? Interestingly it looks like some sectors have enforced a minimum wage:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.minimum-wage.org&#x2F;international&#x2F;singapore" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.minimum-wage.org&#x2F;international&#x2F;singapore</a><p>I&#x27;d be interested in knowing why cleaning and security were singled out specifically rather than a more general rule.<p>&gt;I am currently living in Singapore, and so far the &#x27;propaganda&#x27; has been so effective that even living here I still see that it&#x27;s fairly pro-market.\n&gt;And that includes talking to &#x27;normal&#x27; locals, and also to people running businesses here.\n&gt;Malaysia is useful for contrast. The government is a much bigger drag on the economy there.\n&gt;The paper you quote is fairly old, and also doesn&#x27;t seem to reflect the consensus of economists. (It&#x27;s nonetheless interesting though.)<p>It was interesting to see how far back the disagreement on Singapore&#x27;s economy goes.')
