And that&#x27;s what many people don&#x27;t like, hence the whole thread. For you that might be fine, but please understand that there are other people out that who are not okay with it so easily.<p>&gt; Java&#x27;s type system is sufficiently powerful for 99% of real-world use cases<p>Rather the opposite. Every big project that uses reflection&#x2F;introspection or annotations or some kind of code generation tooling shows that the typesystem is not sufficient. Yeah, there are some cases where the above techniques were used and could have been avoided (while keeping typesafety), but often they are just required.<p>And then Java does not even have proper sumtypes or union types (enums only work when the structure is identical and I mean... we could count some strange workarounds with static classes and private constructors that pretty much no one uses due to horrible ergonomics). And these literally appear everywhere.<p>I diagnose that you are suffering from the famous <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.c2.com&#x2F;?BlubParadox" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.c2.com&#x2F;?BlubParadox</a>')
