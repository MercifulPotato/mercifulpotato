If I was working for this bank and developing their client-server app, should I consider this a step back in my career?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;99percentinvisible.org&#x2F;episode&#x2F;the-next-billion-users&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;99percentinvisible.org&#x2F;episode&#x2F;the-next-billion-user...</a>')
