I&#x27;m sure they don&#x27;t <i>mean</i> to be authoritarian and it&#x27;s just a reflection  of the cultural norms from the places many of them come from and everyone else keeping their mouth shut (because nobody wants to rock that boat in a tourism economy) but having a reason doesn&#x27;t excuse it.  Yes I know I&#x27;m generalizing, please don&#x27;t paint a straw-man and act like I called your hardliner libertarian uncle from Portland an authoritarian.  Clearly I mean it at the statistical level and mean it relative to the other parts of Maine.')
