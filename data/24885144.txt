I was surprised how far I could stretch it before I had to switch to Rust with pulldown-cmark (just went for Rust for learning although it turned out to be a good decision).<p>Pandoc filters allowed me to transform the AST in useful ways. For example I turned the image tag into HTML figures with captions, used the video tag if the URL was a video, and called ffmpeg to encode the video in another format for browsers that didn&#x27;t support the other format.')
