Item(by='bregma', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605535846, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25109287, text='&gt; you basically have to reinstall from scratch every time<p>My main dev machine started as a Thinkpad running Ubuntu 9.04 and has not only been upgraded many times but has migrated its hardware twice and is now an Intel NUC on my desktop. Never reinstalled anything.<p>I used to reinstall Windows machines regularly because they&#x27;d bog down to uselessness or stop working after a few months. Since it&#x27;s only a games machine I have learned the best maintenance program for Windows is to toss the machine every few years and replace it with brand-new hardware and software and reinstall the games from original media (mostly Steam). Also, never reboot because it will bog down my home internet connection doing a massive set of downloads from all MS and all the driver vendors and resynching all its trackers. Also also keep it isolated in the DMZ because it should be considered asymptomatic but infected at all times.')
