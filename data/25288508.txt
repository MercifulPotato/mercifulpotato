The cook stove has a cistern (water tank) for greater thermal mass and the stoves have baffles for high efficiency. The fuel grows all around me do it&#x27;s carbon neutral (except for the chainsaw gas, but that&#x27;s a luxury I will not forego).<p>This is not a used-to-was thing. It&#x27;s the norm outside of towns in my county.')
