Unskilled labor is not all equal.<p>&gt; Satoshiâ€™s concept was to use hashcash to both secure the ledger and issue currency. This was brilliant but antithetical to the no-currency concept, and re-ignited the debate<p>Satoshi&#x27;s most important advancement was in making a currency and using it as its own rate-limiter by paying, in it, to publish.<p>Bitcoin&#x27;s weakness is that computation isn&#x27;t priced in BTC, so scripts had to be nerfed. Vitalik applied Satoshi&#x27;s rate-limiting solution to computation and Ethereum scripts can now be allowed to grow arbitrarily complex.')
