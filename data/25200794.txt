Item(by='igorbark', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1606239604, title='Ask HN: How do you make friends at work while keeping personal/work boundaries?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I maintain a strict detachment from my workplaces for a few reasons. This has never bothered me before, but I&#x27;m inching towards a year at my current job. That&#x27;s way longer than I&#x27;ve been at any work place before (a fact with a bidirectional causal relationship to the detachment), and the walls I&#x27;ve put up are starting to chafe.<p>I really like my teammates and I want to be friends with them, not just work friends. If I&#x27;m going to spend several years working alongside people, I&#x27;d like to have a loving, caring relationship with them because I have love for them and care for them. But expressing and exchanging love and care requires vulnerability, not detachment.<p>Some of the boundaries I maintain in my personal life to make vulnerability safe are incompatible with employment. Especially, the ability to not interact with someone when you don&#x27;t want to, or stop interacting with them entirely. I&#x27;m curious to hear how other folks have navigated this problem:<p>- I turn work and my work friends off when work ends. I don&#x27;t want to turn my genuine friends off when work ends. How do I decouple my interactions with them as a friend from the financial contract obligating me to respond to their messages?<p>- It feels way worse to hide something about myself from a real friend than a work friend. But I hide things constantly from my work friends. I am trans, autistic and generally live outside of many of society&#x27;s norms. Many basic aspects of my personal life could be considered not appropriate for work or offensive to an individual. How can I be genuine friends with someone when the environment that mediates many of our interactions isn&#x27;t accepting? What do I do if I find a friend isn&#x27;t accepting, but then I&#x27;m forced to work with them?<p>- How do I tell someone I don&#x27;t want to be friends because of a personal&#x2F;work life boundary? Especially, if I attempt to be genuine friends with someone but it turns out we do not make good friends, how do I restore our work friendship?')
