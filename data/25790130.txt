If your boss doesn’t like the color of your hair, they can fire you on the spot. Doesn’t mean they will, but they can as long as it’s not for a “protected class” reason (as in, they can’t fire you for your race). The justification for “at will” employment is that your duties to the company are also “at will.” If you want, you’re free to walk out the front door on your break and never come back.')
