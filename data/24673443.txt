Studies of standards, communications, R&amp;D, etc., fascinating for the sort of person fascinated by this sort of thing, focus strongly on such organisations and operations.<p>The thermometer-watcher, and set of practices for avoiding incidental explosions and runaway heat would be examples of this.<p>There&#x27;s an interesting contrast, brought to mind with the focus on remote work, of autonomous working groups operating remotely an incommunicado for extended periods:  merchant and military sailing ships, before the eras of radio and particularly of steam.<p>Ship captains were not subject to Zoom calls, Slack channels, keyboard and video monitoring, or daily virtual stand-ups, from superiors.  They operated autonomously, at distance, for days, weeks, months, even years at a time.  They were given mission objectives and empowered to act as agents for their merchants or militaries with remote vendors, counterparties, countries, even novel cultures.<p>And no, it didn&#x27;t always go well.  Mistakes were made, atrocities committed, misadventure encountered, fraud, abuse, and violence.<p>For long periods, the distinction between &quot;merchant&#x27;, &quot;sailor&quot;, and &quot;pirate&quot; was at best vague:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etymonline.com&#x2F;word&#x2F;pirate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etymonline.com&#x2F;word&#x2F;pirate</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etymonline.com&#x2F;word&#x2F;corsair" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etymonline.com&#x2F;word&#x2F;corsair</a><p>But it was the best option available, and worked, after a fashion, until replaced as new capabilities emerged.')
