One thing I find particularly interesting about technologies of this kind is that they&#x27;re often sold as &#x27;the future of X&#x27;, in this case transport. Just like Zoom is the &#x27;future of doing conferences and work&#x27;.<p>Has anyone noticed in recent times that this is almost always the American future, rather than everyone else&#x27;s future, in response to essentially rot of public infrastructure and state capacity?<p>Go to China, or Singapore, Or Taiwan or South Korea and ask them if their future is work from home because of Covid, or hyperloops because apparently nobody in the US can built a train any more. You&#x27;ll be surprised.')
