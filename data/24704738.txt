IMO, the problem isn&#x27;t that teachers and authors aren&#x27;t thinking from these angles (they have for decades) it&#x27;s that in practice, it&#x27;s really hard to teach and assess skills without ending up testing recall. The solutions that work well (lots of individual attention from human experts) don&#x27;t scale and the things that scale (multiple choice tests) don&#x27;t work well.')
