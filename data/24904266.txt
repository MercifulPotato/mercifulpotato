You should instead move to Michigan for the beautiful lakes and rivers, and the low cost of living (which is often much higher on the aforementioned lakes - especially the tourist towns in western MI).  As with any place, the most desirable locations, i.e. Ann Arbor, are more expensive.<p>It&#x27;s also a place where most of the investment, whether corporate, private, or civic is in suburban areas, so at least for people of means, suburban life is very comfortable.<p>A few cities have made comebacks (Detroit to an extent, Grand Rapids) but it&#x27;s still marginal compared to the wealth of the suburbs.  Rural and post-industrial areas can be very bleak.<p>But for anyone imagining it as an escape: it is as complex a place as any other place in the US today.')
