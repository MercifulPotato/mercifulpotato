Will it get renamed considering it supports ~1155 websites (based on <i>docs&#x2F;supportedsites.md</i>)? If it does get renamed, how are we going to know its name? Where do the developers going to push their changes, where is the development being continued?! Fuck everyone who complies with such retarded laws.
