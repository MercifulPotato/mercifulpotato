They say 80% of new households will be 1-2 people as though this is a lasting trend towards smaller households.  That&#x27;s just people moving out of their parents house.  The majority of those will eventually become 3+ households.<p>The people that the suburbs were built for still exist.  People that aren&#x27;t rich and want to have a family.  They&#x27;re just doing that in their early 30s now instead of in their early 20s.')
