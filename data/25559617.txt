This &quot;cheap&quot; product will for a long time ridiculed as toy (but nevertheless sell in huge amounts because it is cheap) - until it suddenly &quot;lifts off&quot;, becomes an inconvenient competitor, and disrupts the market.<p>Does this description of disruption sound like any market prediction from the last 10 years how the market for VR glasses will develop? I don&#x27;t think so.')
