In fact I couldn&#x27;t have written it better myself.<p>That said, you seem to have presupposed that the people doing the censoring are always (or mostly) right. Why? Because they happen to be in power?<p>Twitter (and I think Facebook) censored the New York Post, even disabling their account, over a major news story that turned out to be <i>true</i>. It went against thev censor&#x27;s preconceived ideas of how the world is, and they smashed that button as fast as they could.<p>What makes you think the people doing the censoring are somehow unbiased righteous purveyors of truth, absent their own instinctive biases that mislead then into censoring unfairly?  Surely history has shown that to rarely if ever be the case.<p>I totally agree with your analysis of the problem, but I follow it to a much different conclusion: humans can&#x27;t be trusted to wield power of speech over others. They are too subject to their own instinctive and emotional reactions to information they don&#x27;t like.')
