It’s not just that you’ll fill up the card before you’re done a single recording session; often an SD card just won’t have the IO bandwidth to persist writes at the speed the camera wants to stream them in at. (How do smartphones do it? By having lots of RAM for buffering, and expecting that you won’t record for very long.) The SD Forum is always trying to bring new SD interfaces to market to up the total bandwidth; but the needs of professional videography always outpace the implementations of those standards arriving in the market.<p>What we do instead:<p>• DSLRs, when used as video cameras in professional workflows, are usually wired directly to a computer, streaming down the wire like a webcam.<p>• Purpose-built professional video cameras record directly to <i>SSDs</i> (either regular ones, like Samsung T7s; or proprietary ones, like RED’s “mini-mags”) that you’re expected to mount to your computer over USB — either by them being regular USB3 devices themselves; or, in the proprietary case, by the manufacturer selling a USB dock you’re supposed to buy for your editing workstations.<p>Regarding commercial photography: SD cards have gotten so large — and wi-fi sync so fast — that even the largest RAW photos sync instantly and hardly make a dent in your storage. There’s no real point in taking a 512GB SD card <i>out</i> of a camera.<p>Keep in mind, <i>integrated</i> ports are only really a demand of professionals when <i>urgent, portable connectivity</i> is a requirement; i.e. when even the time required to find and plug in a dongle would be SLAs broken and revenue lost. This <i>was</i> a true need for professional photography when SD cards were small, as you’d often fill up an SD card in the field and need to “dump it out” onto your laptop to continue shooting (or swap it for another while handing off the first to your editor to establish a pipeline.) Today, it’s not.<p>None of the other tasks you listed have ever been urgent, in-the-field tasks; they’re tasks where you <i>do</i> have time to go back home&#x2F;to the office, and plug in an SD-card reader dongle to do the task.')
