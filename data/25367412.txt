While it&#x27;s somewhat related, there is a bit of a divergence here.<p>As I said in another comment, stocks will naturally rise at the very least due to inflation. Prices will go up because the value of the dollar goes up, and the companies perceived value is still roughly the same and grew with inflation.<p>If inflation is on average around 2%, then stocks ideally increase 2% year over year. This can happen to infinity. That&#x27;s not the same as infinite growth, but it does hit a lot of the same concepts.<p>Add this to efficiencies over time, expansion of service offerings which might include capturing new verticals, companies have plenty of room for growth.<p>This is also why people invest into specific stocks depending on their objectives and risk tolerance. Investing in Apple isn&#x27;t likely to make you a crap load of money today. But, it&#x27;s fairly stable. It should outpace inflation so it&#x27;s a good way to save money with a higher possible yield than say a high interest savings account.<p>You can also apply this to dividend stocks. Some people make their gains off constantly returning dividends even if the stock itself doesn&#x27;t increase drastically year over year.<p>And then you factor in that a lot of companies don&#x27;t have physical products today. So you can squeeze out even more gains because you can have a relatively fixed cost pricing model that scales well. This is more and more common today than 30 years ago.<p>As for bringing in an externality like climate change, in an ideal capitalistic situation you&#x27;d have companies that would pop up that address these issues thus creating value.<p>But, if we look at these types of existential threats (which I totally believe are real and matter, don&#x27;t want to twist that at all) they essentially collapse our current economic system. Therefore, literally nothing matters in terms of buying or selling stocks. We will be facing a massive global crisis that overshadows economic gains to the point that the stock market doesn&#x27;t matter, and fiat currency is largely diminished.')
