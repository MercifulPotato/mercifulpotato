It seems like progress comes in waves. We have periods of advance and periods of stagnation or regress. From about 1000CE to 2000CE was mostly advance, although there were some questionable periods where arguably that was not true (late 1700s-early 1800s, 1914-1945, for example). It looks like we&#x27;re now entering a period of regression, but it could turn out to be another temporary period of stagnation&#x2F;reorganization followed by renewed growth.')
