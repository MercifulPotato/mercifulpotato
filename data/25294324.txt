I mean I alone can not be responsible for their sales volume.<p>And then I start to wonder if I should be more critical of Apple, so I fire up my Windows machine and think silently &quot;No, this is still a worse experience&quot;. So I fire up my Ubuntu and have the same reaction. I just don&#x27;t understand the vitriol some people have for Apple, to me it is hands down always the better platform.')
