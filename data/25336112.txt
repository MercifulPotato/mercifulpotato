If you have significant damage, there&#x27;s a good chance they&#x27;ll &quot;total&quot; your car. This means they&#x27;ll write you a check for the appraised value (minus your deductible), and scrap the car. And it&#x27;s awfully hard to find a worthwhile replacement for the book value of your old one, so even with insurance you&#x27;re not avoiding the bill.<p>What irks me about insurance is that when you raise your coverage limits the premiums go up significantly. I can&#x27;t imagine the long tail of extreme damages form a significant part of their actuarial tables, so it feels more like price discrimination based on your own assets that you&#x27;re trying to protect. But really the entire point of insurance is to protect against the vanishingly small long tail - the idea of liability coverage limits should be done away with (if someone causes a million dollars in damage and can&#x27;t pay, their insurance company shouldn&#x27;t be able to walk away!), and the main cost-saving lever should be your deductible.')
