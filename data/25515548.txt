Item(by='lazyjones', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608710900, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25511251, text='YMMV (I am in Austria), but there are advantages and disadvantages, it&#x27;s not a clear decision. In my ex-company we decided to hire janitors, mainly because we didn&#x27;t want to deal with different people all the time whom we&#x27;d have to teach how to treat computer displays and keyboards every time, with some perhaps slacking or even stealing. The main disadvantage was that as a small company, you&#x27;re in trouble if all your janitors (or your only one!) are sick or on leave and you can&#x27;t get a replacement at short notice. Our first hired one still works at that company after 18 years - not bad for an IT startup.')
