However, CDNs face a cold start problem. CDNs have POPs all over the world, and it takes time for all these POPs to cache your content. Depending upon how busy the POPs are and how often your content is requested, it may even get ejected from your CDN&#x27;s cache. I have an idea for a service that will keep your content in your CDN&#x27;s cache  at POPs all over the world. Would you pay for a service like that?<p>I have learned from HN that one must talk to customers before building a product. In this case, I have already built a system for my own use case but to convert it into a proper product for others will require some effort.')
