Everything else we are doing can (and probably should) be replicated to another region, which would resolve these types of issues.<p>However, Cognito is very region specific and there is currently no way to run in active-active or even in standby mode.  The problem is user accounts; you can&#x27;t sync them to another region and you can&#x27;t back-up&#x2F;restore them (with passwords).  Until AWS comes up with some way to run Cognito in a cross-region fashion, we are pretty much stuck in a single region and vulnerable to this type of outage in the future.')
