To get to that 250 million estimate we would have had to have 167 million new infections in less than a month, or more than tripled all the infections we had up until now. That seems very unlikely.<p>Also their estimate is that 1 in 4.6 of Covid infections are being reported, not 1 in 10 like that Business Insider article (which is dated July 2020, looks like they revised the ratio since).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;cases-updates&#x2F;burden.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;coronavirus&#x2F;2019-ncov&#x2F;cases-updates&#x2F;burd...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;livecoverage&#x2F;covid-2020-11-27&#x2F;card&#x2F;vNkshCuxwSGLw7zkSx4z" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;livecoverage&#x2F;covid-2020-11-27&#x2F;card&#x2F;vNksh...</a>')
