If the measures help against the flu, why not against Covid?<p>I don&#x27;t like appeals to authority, but this perspective that people who have spent their entire lives studying epidemiology have just got this all wrong, don&#x27;t understand what they are doing, and that appeals to &quot;common sense logic&quot; will reveal the truth ... really irritates me.<p>I mean, just as a basic starting point, most people have immunological exposure to the flu, so a fairly effective method to prevent spread of the flu virus will have outsized effects on the incidence of flu (even more so if that fairly effective method is even more widely utilized by those most at risk from flu). But no humans prior to the end of 2019 had immunological exposure to SARS-COV-2, and so any &quot;leakage&quot; in the efforts to stop its spread will have much greater impact than with influenza.<p>More generally, this is really basic epidemiology, and I don&#x27;t understand why you think it&#x27;s so useful to question this stuff in this way.')
