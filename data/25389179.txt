I think it should be aggressively pursued, but very carefully - we don&#x27;t want replace one distortion and unfair system with another.<p>Painting my impressions with a very broad brush: It seems that capitalism was formerly sold to the public as good for society: It provided economic growth, opportunity, and fairness. Those were the goals, and where there were market failures (such as monopolies or prejudice), society would step in and correct it, to further those goals. Now capitalism itself seems to be the goal, the religion, the ideology. It serves no higher purpose - the highest purpose effectively becomes the capitalists. If society steps in, it&#x27;s rejected as a perversion of capitalism.')
