Bans are also familial: reddit tends to do “ban waves” where they also ban similar subreddits, irrespective of whether they have rule violations or not. There’s no communication; no appeals; no “you got this wrong”.<p>If you’ve ever participated in one of the banned subreddits; you’ll know “hate speech” or “doxxing” are a big fat lie. WE are the ones getting doxxed and brigaded!<p>It’s not too different to police using marijuana laws to target Black communities. In a free-to-join community of thousands to millions of people, you will get people breaking the rules. Moderators clean them up. The only difference is unwelcome viewpoints get their subreddit banned with this as the pretext.<p>Source: moderator of 3 banned subreddits; from political to sexual kinks like <i>consensual</i> rape fetishes (which 31% of women say they have fantasises; just FYI).<p>Admins have never; ever, ever engaged with us during my tenures.')
