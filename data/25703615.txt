Fossil repositories are available and discussion is available on NNTP.<p>- Free Hero Mesh - a puzzle game engine, for grid based games such as Sokoban, Hero Hearts, etc. - The behaviour of the game seems to work perfectly as far as I can tell, but the level editor doesn&#x27;t work, audio doesn&#x27;t work, destruction animations don&#x27;t work, there are no examples provided, etc.<p>- TeXnicard - a program for making card sets for card games using special cards, such as Magic: the Gathering, and making up your own card games. - Many features work, but the package manager and version control system are incomplete, and the typesetting engine could also be improved, and there are no rendering templates provided. Also, the Separations Output Format used for rendering probably isn&#x27;t implemented anywhere else as far as I can tell.<p>- sqlnetnews - a simple NNTP server software with SQLite. - Peering with other NNTP servers is not currently implemented, nor is authentication, nor the email&#x2F;web interface.<p>If you are interested, please mention it; maybe you are able to help with them, because I would want help with some things, I think.')
