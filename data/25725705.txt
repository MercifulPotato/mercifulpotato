Automated code analyzers will often not even see these.<p>And the former must be kept duplicate. Unless you can make it functionally duplicate too. Automated code analyzers will often flag these wrong.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong: I love automated analysis in a CI or my workflow. But it is not binary like a linter: pass or fail. It requires context and interpretation; I see e.g. CodeClimate as suggestions, not laws.')
