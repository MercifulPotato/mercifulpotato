That&#x27;s why I like this article that compares it to a home-cooked meal. I can&#x27;t speak for others, but I don&#x27;t cook to change the world. It just feels rewarding to make good food. Likewise it feels good to write software that scratches an itch.<p>You can make software like you bake cookies, for the enjoyment of a select few. You can enjoy writing code in obscurity like you can enjoy looking at a landscape without sharing it on social media.<p>The point of creating is not the result, but the process itself. It teaches you new things, and gives you a better appreciation of the world around you. Gardening turned my local forests into living, breathing museums. It allowed me to look deep beneath the surface, to literally see the forest for the trees. If I wanted pretty flowers, I&#x27;d buy plastic ones.')
