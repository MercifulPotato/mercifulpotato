A lot of the &quot;worst offenders&quot; of these types of release notes are structured and work much differently. They release updates 1-2 times a week, sometimes release features weeks after the code has shipped to users, and sometimes in stretched out rollouts.<p>They say there if there is a will, there is a way, so in a sense I agree that these companies probably could do something about it if they really wanted to, but I also don&#x27;t think it would be easy, and considering how few people actually look at release notes, I am not sure the investment is worth it.')
