Item(by='benibela', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607898141, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25409695, text='I have astigmatism and nearsightedness<p>And I did what burkemw3 did: Astigmatism-correcting glasses only.<p>But it was very difficult. I went to an optician to buy them, and they told me, I would not need them, so they won&#x27;t sell them to me. When I am nearsighted, all my glasses should correct nearsightedness fully.<p>And to make it worse,  they were not able to measure my astigmatism. The first one I went to measured 1.5 D cylinder and gave me such glasses, but that was a little blurry, so I went to several others and measured them and then said you have 20&#x2F;20 vision, so everything is perfect. I finally found one who measured my eyes from scratch  without taking the value of the old glasses and then he found 2.75 D cylinder, leading to a 30% better vision than 20&#x2F;20.<p>However, some of the opticians had wavefront eye laser scanner. That is a really advanced method to measure directly how the eye affects lightwaves rather than trying different lenses.  The devices measured that I actually need a 3.6D  cylinder. But the  opticians always discarded that measurement, because it was not possible that I had 20&#x2F;20 vision if my glasses are two diopter too weak.<p>Anyways, since they did not sell me computer glasses, I  bought them online, and just put zero for spherical value of the prescription. Although there seems to be something wrong, since I am always seeing sharper on one eye than the other. I also tried buying a stronger cylinder online to check it out, but that was not possible since the online sites did not sell any cylinder stronger than three diopter.')
