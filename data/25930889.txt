My naive assumption is that the relationship between a company and it&#x27;s stock is (mostly) one-way. If a company cuts jobs, this along with all other signals from that company will be perceived by the market in some way and potentially impact the price of stock in that company. Would the opposite (<i>&quot;Our stock price is going down, lets fire people&quot;</i>) be at all likely to happen?')
