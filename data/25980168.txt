It&#x27;s one of the most satisfying things I&#x27;ve ever gotten involved in. That follows from an interest in all kinds of outdoor adventures, and a background in physics. It&#x27;s a good background for technical rescue work.<p>I have also been helping to develop an approach to landslide monitoring in small watersheds. Basically if a watershed is just the right size, there seems to be a strong correlation between river levels and landslide activity. In smaller watersheds the height of the river changes rapidly with localized rainfall. It seems that monitoring the river height becomes a proxy for measuring the primary landslide risk factors such as soil moisture content. I&#x27;m hoping to help develop a real-time monitoring system for parts of southeast Alaska, which are facing more frequent landslide activity as a result of changing rainfall patterns.<p>It&#x27;s also really important to not try and work 40 hours a week. Working 60% is really freeing, and I&#x27;m glad to hear you don&#x27;t have to grind as hard as we&#x27;re often pushed to these days.')
