Let&#x27;s make the perceived ability line flatter.<p>People tend to overestimate their own ability, so we should move the perceived ability line up which leads to an intersection on the right.  Causing us to find that the best performers are the most accurate, explaining DKE.<p>But the harder we make a task the more we push that perceived ability line down.  And if we make a task sufficiently hard then the worst performers are the most accurate judge of their own ability showing the opposite of DKE, due to the intersection being pushed left.<p>So really DKE is an artifact.')
