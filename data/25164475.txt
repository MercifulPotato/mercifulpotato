Thanks for the amazing work!<p>My question is about the coding style - @jph00 Iâ€™ve read your fast.ai style guide and worked with APLs like q&#x2F;KDB (written by Arthur Whitney who you cite).<p>My experience is that brevity is great, until you need to collaborate or have individuals working on small parts. That was my experience as well trying to write an extension to the fast.ai code (where I had to read large amounts of source to understand how to implement a small change).<p>Given that a key motivator for literate programming is collaboration&#x2F;communication, how do you think about this?')
