They&#x27;re basically identical to the formations that are already used to store natural gas.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24621709" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24621709</a><p>&gt; Not really. It has lower energy&#x2F;mole. There is the possibility that if CO2 is present that microorganisms could react the two to make methane. But aside from that, where is this much greater complexity coming from? The equipment required for storing either is similar.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24626876" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24626876</a><p>&gt; And did you read my post? There is already a great deal of equipment for manipulating hydrogen on an industrial scale. What, did you think they rip that stuff out every month? The issue you are raising is already well solved.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24633530" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24633530</a>')
