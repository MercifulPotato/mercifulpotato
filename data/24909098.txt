We are trying to be as fast as possible but maintain a quality level (we talk to each host before), so hope to add a couple of events more by the end of this month!<p>The activities shown in the webpage are real events that can be booked already. The price policy is determined by the hosts. But if you have hit your budget already I am sure that we could adapt to your needs! lmk @joalavedra')
