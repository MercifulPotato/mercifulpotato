I&#x27;ve only seen a couple of broadway shows, and simply seeing there were actual people playing music in the pit enhanced the whole experience (occasionally music was played on stage too in the shows I&#x27;ve seen).<p>On a side note, these broadway performers and musicians were awesome and incredibly professional and talented. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect (as a kid, I found these musicals so boring) but it was great.')
