The other flags being sarcastically listed as replies to this comment stand for higher ideals, whether or not those ideals were misguided and whether or not the nations behind those flags lived up to those ideals.<p>If someone puts a sign up in the break room that says “don’t steal other people’s lunches” and then proceeds to steal everyone else’s lunch, you can still point to that sign and say, yeah, that’s a standard we should strive to live by.
