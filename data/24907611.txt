Item(by='KSteffensen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603808119, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24907442, text='Soft cores use the configurable logic matrix of the FPGA. You can choose to implement them or not, depending on your use case. They can also be tuned to the use case, adding or modifying CPU instructions, cache structure, e.t.c. This involves writing RTL code, with all the design, verification and backend synthesis work that comes with that. Tools like Synopsys ASIP Designer tries to help with this effort.<p>Hard cores are not part of the configurable logic matrix but are separate resources on the FPGA. That means they can&#x27;t be tuned to the use case in the same way as a soft core. The trade-off is that they typically are better optimized with regards to clock frequency and power consumption since the components are made to be a CPU and not generic configurable logic. One example of an FPGA with a hard core CPU would be the Xilinx Zynq devices.')
