The key to the song is building it up. The song starts with: &quot;There&#x27;s a hole in the bottom of the sea&quot;, and the song builds the sentence up. Indeed: having a grossly complicated sentence is the &quot;Fun&quot; of the song, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that its grammatically correct (and actually understood by the listener &#x2F; singers).')
