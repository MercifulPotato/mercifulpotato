Why? Even if there is no foul play, that is a terrible thing to do. It. Looks. Bad. And it&#x27;s illegal. Votes need to be tallied in front of both parties. They may have invalided hundreds of thousands of votes depending on a lawsuit.<p>Election fraud and voter fraud are very difficult to prove. America is no stranger to it (Remember Bush v Gore and Diabold voting machines?) But I think people had some hope the system was that corrupt. They were wrong, and America is.')
