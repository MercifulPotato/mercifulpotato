It sucks to get a PR that was clearly work that you want to reject because it&#x27;s a direction you didn&#x27;t want to go, has big flaws, or would be hard to maintain.<p>I&#x27;m mostly talking about simple PRs, little bug fixes, even documentation improvements.<p>But even big PRs, all I ask is basic human courtesy that we provide each other in meat space.  It&#x27;s totally fine to say, &quot;Thanks but I&#x27;m sorry we won&#x27;t accept this.&quot; especially when it&#x27;s out of the blue.  What isn&#x27;t fine is being rude.  It&#x27;s wrecking the community.')
