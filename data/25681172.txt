A university typically has four groups it serves: students, faculty, administration, and staff. Each of these groups tend to have only small variations in needs within their group. If you can design for the needs of these four groups, you&#x27;re doing well. A city on the other hand may have hundreds or even thousands of different groups of differing conflicting needs. Even a smallish city with a population of 20,000 is going to have more complexity than a large university with 40,000 students plus several thousand in the other three groups.')
