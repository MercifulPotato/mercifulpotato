They never get dealt with out the gate because business evolves via iterative value delivery, and most systems capable of creating value can work just fine with massively simplified assumptions to keep the lights on.<p>Also, if you think timezones&#x2F;calendars&#x2F;seasons are bad, just understand that many people specifically have a difficult time with shifting their mind into a frame of reference where you can actually talk about time in the sense of &quot;there is a moment in time $now, where I am, the clock displays X because formatting, the system clock is actually Y, and I want people in P to get experience Q which had relationship R to X and S to Y. I have libraries T, U, \nand V to work through the abstractive layers of. These same people are all inclined never to admit this difficulty or the complexity inherent thereto.<p>Throw in the fact most folks in the U.S. don&#x27;t even understand the written script of more than a handful of places, and you have a recipe for !quality. Again though, there&#x27;s only so much political capital you have as a Quality person, and prioritization tends to be the Project Manager&#x27;s shtick.<p>Also throw in that the real optimization function in the market has been &quot;the crappiest software that can still maintain usership&quot; and it should be no surprise that the software packages that do localization right are far fewer in number than otherwise.<p>It&#x27;s a rather sad state of affairs, but it is what it is.<p>Just... Wanted to point out there has been at least one person who brought up your points in design meetings everywhere they&#x27;ve been, and never ceases to end up receiving platitudes.')
