I just ignore it altogether... They&#x27;ll eventually give up and ask the actual question.<p>This is my tactic too. About 50% of the time, they finally cave and just ask the question within a couple of days, and the other 50% of the time I never hear from them again!<p>Still annoys me though, as it&#x27;s just one more thing in the back of my mind when I&#x27;m trying to focus on something.')
