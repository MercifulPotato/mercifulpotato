Most software from the 80s is commercially useless right now; should it still be protected by copyright? Books from the 1700s are still culturally relevant; is it OK that they aren&#x27;t? What would society lose if I could create an adaptation of The Wizard of Oz that includes red shoes? Literally everyone involved in the original creation is dead, but WB owns it until 2035[1]. Is that ethical?<p>There&#x27;s a balance somewhere between the rights of the creator and the rights of society to adapt and disseminate our own culture, and the argument we&#x27;re making is that the scales are currently tipped way too far on the side of the creator. I don&#x27;t care how easy it is to watch Frozen in 2020, I care about what the children who grew up with that film can do with the culture they grew up in when they are adults.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Copyright_status_of_The_Wizard_of_Oz_and_related_works_in_the_United_States#1939_film" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Copyright_status_of_The_Wizard...</a>')
