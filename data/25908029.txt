Notes are just a tool to support you in achieving your goals.  If you don&#x27;t need to recall information instantaneously, skipping review-as-memorization is just fine.  If important items aren&#x27;t being inadvertently neglected and falling through the cracks, skipping review-as-reflection is ok too.')
