Stu Halloway even mentions it in the interview:<p>&quot;And what we would quite often see is that people would write a Java app in Clojure, or people would write a Ruby on Rails app in Clojure. And not surprisingly, it would have weaknesses that you associate with idiomatic Java apps or idiomatic Ruby on Rails apps&quot;<p>Clojure, as a language, makes it very easy to do stuff and sometimes that stuff means making code look like code that only makes sense in other languages.  This is a <i>terrible</i> mistake but one that is easy to understand.  Very few developers have any real background in functional programming and it is too easy to start hacking things together.<p>As a longtime Clojure user (dating back to attending the very first Clojure conference in Durham, North Carolina), I think there has been a little bit of &quot;ego-driven&quot; developer syndrome with projects in the language.  There is definitely a tendency for new Clojure programmers to get too fancy.<p>This is <i>not</i> a problem with Clojure the language though.  I made the mistake myself in early projects.  The more I have used Clojure, the more I have realized that when I am doing it right, I am spending significantly more time understanding the problem I am solving than throwing code together . . .')
