Clearly shows that computational complexity by itself is not very useful without knowing the assumptions. It is one thing to see substring search and immediately pattern match it to something from CS course like Boyer-Moore or Knuth-Morris-Pratt, but these algorithms require pre-processing that makes sense only if you know you are going to search for the same pattern repeatedly. Pure library function cannot make that assumption, and REPNE instruction is just an icing on a cake.')
