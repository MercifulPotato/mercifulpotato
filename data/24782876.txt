And, of course, the high-population counties are the urban ones that reliably vote Democrat. This is just one of many examples from around the country of Republican governors&#x2F;legislatures moving to reduce or remove early voting infrastructure.<p>This is indeed an usual election, but there is unquestionably also a systematic campaign being waged to reduce voting by the Republicans.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;alisondurkee&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;13&#x2F;trump-judges-reinstate-texas-limit-on-ballot-drop-off-locations&#x2F;#62f523fb6c68" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;alisondurkee&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;13&#x2F;trump-j...</a>')
