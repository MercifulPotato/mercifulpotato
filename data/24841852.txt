It&#x27;s primarily focused on photo digitization for families - but I&#x27;ve also done a ton of tape media. I can help any local HNers that need access to hardware. (Or just some info&#x2F;direction)<p>Technology Connections (YouTube) does some good coverage of capturing&#x2F;converting analogue video - hardware choices make huge difference. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZC5Zr3NC2PY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=ZC5Zr3NC2PY</a><p>There&#x27;s clearly a need&#x2F;desire for this kind of stuff (though it&#x27;s sad how many times I&#x27;m approached as someone is near death). Don&#x27;t wait til that moment to save the stories and memories that you have.<p>I&#x27;ve been back and forth about how much I want to dive in with this project.
