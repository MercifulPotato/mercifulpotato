To start with, the sadness you felt on vyvanse sounds like dopamine depletion. You want to be taking l-tyrosine to make sure there’s plenty of fuel for the amphetamine to work with. ALCAR + ALA counteract the psychomotor agitation and tolerance formation. Magnesium + zinc help with muscle cramping. Selenium is neuroprotective. And of course you want to make sure you’re getting enough electrolytes (sodium + potassium) and balancing your intake, as a general rule for life, but especially if you take stimulants.<p>With the aforementioned supplement stack I’ve been able to go off doses as high as 60 mg of adderall per day without any significant withdrawal symptoms. It’s been a complete game changer in terms of making this medication a sustainable option for me. I will say as a caveat that things which reduce drug tolerance formation also typically attenuate some of the effects. In my case, ALCAR + ALA basically erase the potential for euphoria but don’t seem to diminish the mental benefits.')
