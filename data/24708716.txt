I&#x27;m not surprised that they do unconventional, scrappy things.<p>I&#x27;d be totally comfortable with the wood load spreaders from last month&#x27;s stories or the fact that some of the cars are built in tent factories. I don&#x27;t think those issues are blockers. I do think they have a general need to improve their quality and fit&#x2F;finish, but those are in some cases things that must come from experience and track record of mass production, but I think those are unrelated to scrappiness.<p>(Disclaimer: I am short $TSLA on the basis of comparative valuation only, not because they are incapable. For that, I&#x27;m short $NKLA.)')
