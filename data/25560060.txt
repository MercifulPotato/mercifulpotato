Today the stock is 24.39.  On 30&#x2F;10&#x2F;2019 I purchased a quantity at $12.40.<p>Let&#x27;s continue.  I sold it all in 2&#x2F;2020 in 3 separate transactions between $32-$37.  Later, I repurchased it at $22, and again two more times as it dropped to the 18&#x27;s.   I then sold everything again at $28... about 10 days ago.<p>So it was two sets of purchases and sales, not three.<p>So no, buying and holding would have not maximized my gains.  And this is true for many stocks.<p>By the way, this is in an IRA account so there is no need to think about short v. long-term cap gain taxes here.  The behavior in my main brokerage accounts accounts a bit more for the potential tax implications.  However, if it&#x27;s a volatile stock and I think went up or down in an extreme way that I think isn&#x27;t justified, I&#x27;ll jump in.')
