Since the machine is learning the most appropriate coefficient based on some heuristic (best of X random).<p>Wouldn&#x27;t it be better (and more honest) to say then that, simpler ML models and learning techniques can often yield good enough result that don&#x27;t justify going to more advanced model and learning techniques?')
