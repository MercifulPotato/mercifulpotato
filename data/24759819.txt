Item(by='bsder', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602539337, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24752836, text='&gt; For instance, a developer writing the software for the sensors of a forklift<p>Industrial is a <i>very</i> poor choice of counterexample.  You should have stayed with consumer space counterexamples.  <i>Everybody</i> in the industrial setting wants their telemetry and data transmitted to centralized computing whether they know what they are going to do with it or not.<p>As for sensors, how are those distance sensors connected to the microcontoller?  Perhaps a redundant automotive bus with real-time constraints like CAN?  CAN often has a fairly decently sized, badly written, vendor supplied communication stack in order to use it.<p>Is that forklift&#x27;s sensor telemetry going anywhere?  If not, then you&#x27;re probably going to lose out to someone who does when you sell that forklift to Amazon or WalMart.  They probably want to know about where the skulls are (gotta track those lazy humans) more than they want to know about where the forklifts are.<p>&gt; Are all these ARM? NO.<p>Actually, they increasingly are.  USB-C PD negotiation chips, for example, are basically ARM M3&#x2F;4 cores with specialized hardware.  The cost differential between 8-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers is so low that unless you have <i>extreme</i> volumes, you might as well use the 32-bit one and gain all the infrastructure that provides.<p>&gt; Are all these connected to the network? NO.<p>Are you <i>sure</i>?  Hotel locks had security vulnerabilities because they had a USB port.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t whether I can use the I2C bus on your Cuisinart to break into it--if you used a &quot;standard&quot; driver written in C I probably can.  These small system don&#x27;t have to worry about &quot;secure&quot; simply because they aren&#x27;t worth breaking into--until some really creative person makes them worth breaking into.  (Hey, there&#x27;s a speaker on that innocuous thing that&#x27;s loud enough that we can talk to Alexa.  YAAAARRRR, Me Mateys!)')
