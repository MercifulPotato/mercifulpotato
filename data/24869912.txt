I&#x27;m kind of confused as to why that would be an issue. But happy to hear more about it.<p>Odds are good that if health insurance benefits are pushed out of employers, you&#x27;re going to see it funded by a tax on top of wages, not a corporate income tax, because the former is directly tied to the number of people the org is supporting in the United States and the latter is not. The classification of employee vs. contractor is still salient. It&#x27;s still a good idea nonetheless.<p>&gt; Ok so then is the cap 8 hours? 10? Is it 7? It seems to me that you&#x27;re inventing more problems to solve a different problem than is worthwhile. You can have more drivers doing less hours, if the economics of it work (and neither of us know whether or not it does, and ironically enough I doubt the State of California does either).<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any philosophical merit to claiming someone working 7+ hours a day is not a full time worker. We may not know the exact economics, but we do know they&#x27;re not great. Uber loses billions per year, and pays substantial money to deal with high driver turnover. A mixed system makes it worse.')
