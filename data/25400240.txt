If you test everyone who walks in a hospital door (which we are), you’re going to find “cases”. If you did this with influenza, <i>you’d find the same thing.</i><p>People go in to the ER for a broken leg, have a positive covid test, and get counted as a covid admission. This isn’t fiction: multiple state health departments have <i>admitted</i> it is happening. It’s too difficult to try to determine if Covid is “the reason” for an admission, so nobody tries.<p>Therefore, the only important question is: how are hospitals faring relative to any other year? And so far, the answer is that it looks like a moderately bad flu season. To hype the narrative that “hospitals are overwhelmed”, the news media routinely cherry-picks one or two hospitals, fixates on them for a week, then moves on to the next.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;justin_hart&#x2F;status&#x2F;1327740997078380544" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mobile.twitter.com&#x2F;justin_hart&#x2F;status&#x2F;13277409970783...</a>')
