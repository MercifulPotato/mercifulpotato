I am an old school trained navy machinist. We use to hang the long stringy chips from the over head. The angle of the dangle = power of the puke in heavy seas.   \nBTW, US subs don&#x27;t have lathes, well at least the smaller ones don&#x27;t. You can do a lot with a hack saw, files, cold chisels, etc, if you have to. The small US frigates have a lathe, with a milling attachment!')
