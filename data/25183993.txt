It&#x27;s horrible for people to have to be bombarded by trolling and lies by the president on a daily basis.  (To those who wish to deny that, please don&#x27;t bother because you are wrong, it&#x27;s not a debate).<p>&gt;For years I thought he&#x27;d be removed from office. Turns out redditors blew unbelievably small things out of proportion<p>Eh yes and no.. any other president before trump would have resigned in disgrace about 100 times.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s blowing things out of proportion when the PRESIDENT is constantly calling people names on twitter on a daily basis and doing his best to divide.<p>Anyway.. I agree the best solution is to try and avoid seeing shit daily, and I&#x27;m really really hoping in two months we can go back to not hearing about politics every fucking day unless we really want to seek it out.')
