Item(by='Quarrelsome', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601988899, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24696227, text='&gt; I see this defeatism all the time regarding climate change too.<p>And I see people suggest that we aren&#x27;t completely screwed because we got 10,000 people to walk down a street one time. Its an insane position and we need dramatic measures that the human race in its current form are unable to enact.<p>* Climate change is going to happen because people like cars and supermarkets and nobody is asking anyone to _actually_ sacrifice anything. Much of the climate change movement is &quot;someone else should do something about it&quot; and those that cut themselves by going &quot;off-grid&quot; just make themselves quieter and are replaced by twenty more people with growing carbon footprints.<p>* Online security is fucked because the vast majority of people can&#x27;t handle more than a modicum of detail. Its on the technical class (i.e. the 5%-15%) to protect it by hook or crook. It will lose in a democratic battle to preserve it because people aren&#x27;t interested enough to care and its too complex.<p>My suggestion is that defeatism posits a better question to answer: &quot;What do we do once we&#x27;ve lost?&quot;.<p>The answer to that question yields something useful instead of the suspension of disbelief that the human race will suddenly turn over a new leaf.')
