I like that. No bloated JS framework taking 10 seconds to load, no obnoxious whitespace, minimal changes to the desktop experience when they implemented mobile. I admit they&#x27;re a little slow to implement quality-of-life things (the hover-over preview being one of them). I also think link rot is a real problem too. Even though it&#x27;s not necessarily their domain, I think Wikipedia should attempt to do something.')
