If you need to expand it, the previous address space is imported as a subset of the new one.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cr.yp.to&#x2F;djbdns&#x2F;ipv6mess.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cr.yp.to&#x2F;djbdns&#x2F;ipv6mess.html</a><p>I will never forgive the IPv6 for not making the 32-bit IPv4 space a subrange of the 128-bit IPv6 space.  <i>Years</i> after winning the IPng wars they admitted their mistake and standardized NAT64, but it was too late.  NAT64 should have been part of IPv6 from day one, and every IPv6 router acting as a default route gateway should have been mandatorily-required to offer NAT64.')
