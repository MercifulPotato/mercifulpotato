Item(by='pyrale', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610549319, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25760699, text='&gt; Iâ€™ve never spotted an instance where something has been rewritten in a different language because c# was lacking in some way.<p>The truth is, languages rarely have an impact on the success or failure of a project. The reason some companies blame failure on language is because the organization fails to adequately adapt its procedure to the tools it uses.<p>Starting on a fresh language and not getting involved in the community because a dozen pizza to host a meetup every 3-4 months is too expensive? You&#x27;re headed for trouble.<p>Going for a new stack and letting poor management drive away the team? Even with a mainstream language, the hit you&#x27;re going to take is going to be huge.<p>Willing to rewrite old code but not interested in giving people time to adapt and learn? Good luck.<p>The only difference between languages like Java or C# and Clojure or F# is that it&#x27;s much harder to blame the former for organization&#x2F;process issues.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that languages don&#x27;t have an effect on productivity or dev experience, I&#x27;m saying that effect is way less important than other factors, and as a consequence, it&#x27;s rarely the factor that tips the scale.')
