He was alone in a vast, unfamiliar city. He’d destroyed his relationships. He left his apartment in anger. And then, as he traversed the mountains, walking through sugar maple and oak, hickory and poplar, stepping over roots and rocks, he tamed his demons too. The many people who met him didn’t sense the dark, brooding, sometimes dangerous person who left Brooklyn.</i><p>People who decide to commit suicide sometimes appear to others to be feeling a lot better in the time between the decision and the final act.  It can look externally like an upswing, like they&#x27;ve gained a new perspective and things aren&#x27;t weighing on them as heavily.  It sounds like he was conscious that his behavior was bad for other people, and he didn&#x27;t believe he could change.  That&#x27;s a terrible position to be in:  to feel you can&#x27;t fully function in the presence of others but to feel their absence keenly as well, to be incapable of being with others without hurting them, but also incapable of being alone.  I can&#x27;t imagine how bad it would have to be to starve yourself to death, but I can&#x27;t help wondering if that&#x27;s what he did.')
