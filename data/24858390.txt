It&#x27;s DDoSing your disbelief with technobabble to allow for whatever plot the episode&#x27;s writer had in mind.<p>(Though it&#x27;s not impossible to make something relatively consistent out of Star Trek&#x27;s universe; &#x2F;r&#x2F;DaystromInstitute is a subreddit essentially dedicated to doing just that. It&#x27;s an exercise in function interpolation, but having lots of data points does constrain possibilities.)<p>&gt; <i>Most of the time, the story isn&#x27;t about the technology (in the same way that Westerns aren&#x27;t always about animal husbandry and gun manufacturing), and it&#x27;s sufficient that you push some buttons, pull a lever and spaceship go brrr.</i><p>There&#x27;s very little point in choosing sci-fi as your setting if your story is setting-independent. The westerns whose story is entirely interchangeable with action movies set in ancient times or present days don&#x27;t tend to be very interesting movies (YMMV). Or at least I tend to avoid those, because I find them boring. With sci-fi, if the story is all about setting-independent human drama, I can have that with any other genre. I like my sci-fi when it extrapolates and elaborates on science and technology, and its impact on societies.')
