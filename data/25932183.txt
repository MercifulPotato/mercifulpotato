Now we&#x27;re down to only the single Tesla connector out there for charging in the wild, and effectively only Tesla cars. Is this a good thing for innovation? Do you think this will increase or decrease innovation? And all because they were first to market with a proprietary connector they heavily pushed. Effectively, if you want to buy a car with the ability to charge in the wild you will be forced to buy a Tesla due to a monopoly of charging stations. Sounds like a good future filled with innovation to me!<p>Lets also look at it the other way in a theoretical to analyze the idea of widespread proprietary connectors and their connection to innovation. Say Nissan had a proprietary connector and made the big investment to deploy a massive charging network. The Nissan cars are technically vastly inferior to the Tesla cars, but because Nissan made a well-timed capex they&#x27;ve got a leg up on the chargers. People then tend to buy the inferior Nissan cars because of the brand presence and vast availability of chargers. While the Tesla cars are technically better, all of those owners already have proprietary Nissan connectors at home. Their offices have Nissan chargers. Their grocery store has Nissan chargers. The highway rest stops have Nissan chargers. Truck stops have Nissan chargers. Do you think the technically better Tesla wins? Imagine when new construction of houses starts to have vehicle charging connections common. If your house came with a Nissan charger and it&#x27;ll cost you $500 to swap it out for a Tesla one, doesn&#x27;t that raise the price of the Tesla $500 simply because of the cable in your home? Sounds terrible to me.')
