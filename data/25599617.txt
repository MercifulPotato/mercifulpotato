For example there was one update in 2020 that caused appeared to delete any files placed in the users Desktop folder (although the files weren&#x27;t really deleted) and another which caused running chkdsk to corrupt users filesystem in a fashion that typically required fixing the filesystem offline.<p>Furthermore such updates which usually require a reboot can easily interrupt important work or a long running task.<p>Just yesterday my Windows install which exists solely to run steam and steam games updated and then committed suicide in a fashion that can&#x27;t be automatically repaired and requires a reinstall with zero explanation. For reference the hardware is fine as is the Linux install on another drive. The windows drive is a ssd less than 6 months old.  I can even mount the ntfs filesystem which appears to be just fine.<p>There is absolutely no excuse for not letting users pick when or if they would like to update their OS especially when their QA has completely gone to shit and they cannot realistically promise that their update wont break your install.')
