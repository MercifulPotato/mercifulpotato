Then the question becomes much deeper in terms not only of whether writing code is efficient, but also a question of life choices in general, with regards to the utility the individual brings to the world as well as whether said utility advances moral goals (as opposed to e.g. growing a human economy in some unsustainable way).<p>Going down the rabbit hole really illustrates the hypocrisy of this line of reasoning: what of the immorality of some small task when one can be judgmental of virtually everything in the same way to such an extent that civilized society as a whole might be considered immoral if put under the same level of scrutiny.')
