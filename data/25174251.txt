I read all sorts of books, self help, philosophy, technical, sci-fi.<p>I’m so happy I finally started enjoying reading, and I will never stop now. It’s not only made me more calm, but also I tend to listen more to others, rather than needing to say my opinion on some subject. It’s like the more I read the more I know I have a lot to learn from others.<p>Even though I started late, it’s nothing I regret :-)')
