He probably just needs a mentor&#x2F;friend to help him get through stuff.<p>He&#x27;ll do great at uni, and although a degree isn&#x27;t a requisite, it will make his path a lot easier and if he&#x27;s in a position to get one, he absolutely should. Despite what people say, it is basically invaluable.<p>And kudos to you for looking out for your son, the world needs more fathers like you.')
