Politico-turned-economic elites acting as egalitarian champions is par for the last 30 years.<p>Life-long Californian here.<p>&gt; Which states besides CA would you describe as &quot;autonomous&quot; vs not?<p>Massachusetts, for a start, since they don&#x27;t just talk about what they are going to do. You should visit.<p>The reality is that the CA representatives routinely declare that they are not going to abide by federal guidelines. Ostensibly, that&#x27;s the autonomy being referenced.<p>Totally ignoring the poster&#x27;s intent and swapping in your own bias as their content is outright trolling. If you don&#x27;t understand (or can&#x27;t imagine an interpretation that makes sense) it&#x27;s rather civil to act in good faith and ask for clarification. SMH')
