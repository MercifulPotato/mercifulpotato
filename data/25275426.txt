Item(by='weinzierl', descendants=None, kids=[25275729], score=None, time=1606908401, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25274785, text='&gt;  It would be very different if the book had just been called &quot;How to make friends&quot;.<p>I think it is the other way round. People criticize it because <i>&quot;How to make friends&quot;</i> is the first and more prominent part of the title, while the book is not primarily about that. <i>&quot;How to influence people&quot;</i> fits the content much better than <i>&quot;How to win friends&quot;</i> but <i>&quot;influence&quot;</i> isn&#x27;t the most appropriate word either and I guess that would not have sold the book nearly as well as its actual title.<p>Apart from that I think there is nothing to criticize about the content, it might be trivial to a degree, but it is solid and ethical advice, if I remember it correctly.')
