It too was advertised for sale via bitcoin (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Shadow_Brokers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Shadow_Brokers</a>).<p>Great post overall, but I disagree here. It&#x27;s indeed very likely Russian intelligence did the compromise, but it&#x27;s still unclear if this particular &quot;leaks for sale&quot; offer is legitimate or just a random unrelated troll trying to make quick money before they get outed as fake. It does sound similar to the Shadow Brokers offer, but that could easily be emulated (and probably would be emulated if a scammer was trying to sound like Russia).<p>It could be legitimate, but I would be highly skeptical unless&#x2F;until they release some samples of what they have. The Shadow Brokers started out not providing anything but later started leaking things to prove they weren&#x27;t lying.<p>So I&#x27;d say this is worth keeping an eye on, but shouldn&#x27;t be taken very seriously until they post at least some shred of evidence supporting their claims.')
