This block is reserved for fictional numbers (which is why it shows up so often in television) and again, most systems accept it. This way I get to pick a last 4 that I can remember, and which other patrons in my area code are less likely to randomly choose.<p>Of course, I&#x27;d prefer not to provide a phone number at all, but some of the local businesses (especially hair salons, for some reason) get downright hostile when I try to explain my preference. It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s completely unheard of to not hand your phone number out to strangers. This gives me a way to &quot;relent&quot; without causing a scene.')
