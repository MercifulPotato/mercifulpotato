I don&#x27;t see much emphasis on that anymore though. Has React incorporated a native function for that? Is it the context API?<p>Edit: What I don&#x27;t understand with the context API is that it looks like I need to access the instantiated context externally in every component, while MobX injected it through the component tree automatically.')
