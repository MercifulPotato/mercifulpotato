Water has a surface that basically applies force relative to how fast you&#x27;re going.  If you go slow the water displaces and nothing happens, if yo slap the water it stings your hand, if you hit the water at terminal velocity you may as well hit concrete because it can&#x27;t displace fast enough for you to sink so your body decelerates rapidly from terminal velocity to a much slower sink leading to massive amounts of internal damage.')
