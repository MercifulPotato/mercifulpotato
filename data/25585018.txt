I got this for my wife so it only has 8GB of RAM, but even so Xcode runs surprisingly well on it. I&#x27;ve had a few times where it&#x27;s gotten really slow for a few seconds when I suspect it&#x27;s swapping. Since it happened the first couple times I made an effort to keep only the basics open and it&#x27;s been great.<p>Overall, it compares quite well to my 2016 Intel MacBook, it makes up for the memory issues by being generally snappier in most other places. I suspect a 16GB rig won&#x27;t have these issues and would compare even better versus the i9.<p>I was considering getting a mini, but I&#x27;m going to content myself with using my wife&#x27;s M1 Air until the next M series CPUs come out. I want to see what the next generation has to offer before pulling the trigger.')
