What people are complaining about are the obvious biases exhibited by the large social media companies.  Take this new Hunter Biden example.  Twitter claims that they don&#x27;t want to promote hacking and releasing of private information.  Hunter Biden&#x27;s laptop was abandoned, not hacked.  Besides, where was that privacy stance a week or two ago when Trump&#x27;s taxes were leaked?  Facebook claimed unreliable sourcing for the story.  Where were such concerns when anonymous sources were claiming that Trump had said that our troops were &quot;suckers and losers&quot;?  Or when anonymous sources were claiming that Trump had been peed on by Russian hookers?<p><i>We have independent election observers.</i><p>Yeah and we balance things out by letting both major parties watch for funny business.  Who watches Facebook and Twitter?  Those companies are loaded with ex-Democrat operatives in senior positions.  They&#x27;ve run out anyone who even smells halfway conservative.  Facebook and Twitter have demonstrated time and again that they aren&#x27;t just getting rid of fake news and bots.  They&#x27;re weighing in on complex political and statistical issues by silencing information sources that they don&#x27;t like.<p><i>there are actors who want to harm the free and good faith discourse of our public forums</i><p>Yeah and evidence shows that some of those people are controlling information from within the social media giants.')
