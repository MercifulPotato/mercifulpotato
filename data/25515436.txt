I learned you got to be the best of the best and then luck needs to fall onto you as it did for my songwriting classmate, Luke Laird (wrote many Carrie Underwood and country number one songs.. was best writer in class.. not sure how he got his break).  During college I was able to intern at record labels and attend fun industry functions like CRS (country radio seminar), NARM and the parties that happened after each day of the event.  At NARM in Orlando I went to the events during the day and then found the parties the labels held for record store (2001 when record stores existed lol) people.  At one of the parties I met some executives and partied with them and then one introduced me their friend.  Her friend was the guy I mentioned and we hit it off, gave him my business card and a month later he left a message on my voicemail (was back in Nashville) saying he wanted to hire me for a marketing job at RCA&#x2F;Victor (jazz label ... Etta James was on it).<p>I only lasted 6 months (he forced my boss to hire me and she hated me) in my supposed dream job in NYC, but it was a fun and interesting (witnessed the twin towers falling from Times Square in my office&#x27;s 41st floor) time in my life.')
