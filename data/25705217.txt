It&#x27;s clear most people don&#x27;t care about violence being a limit given that violence was used tremendously throughout the entire year in all those protests and supporting them was the trendy position among the elites, that now suddenly decided violence must be opposed at all costs and those who support it must be terrorists. Give me a break.<p>Call it for what it is, when one side uses violence it&#x27;s good, when the other uses it it&#x27;s bad, because this is a battle, and in a battle all that matters is punishing your enemies and rewarding your friends. I&#x27;m glad that this is becoming more and more clear as time passes and all pretense of principles is being dropped, and anyone with any sense can see that this is true.')
