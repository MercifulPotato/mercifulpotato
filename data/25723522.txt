I am fully in support of arresting all who participated. But my point is that it is not reasonable to conclude that Trump&#x27;s speech incited people to illegally invade the capitol, commit theft&#x2F;vandalism, and assault officers. His speech literally had a line saying &quot;peacefully protest&quot;. The vast majority of people hearing his speech did not break the law. So how can there be a conclusion that he incited people to break the law? Those who broke the law are independent humans who hold personal responsibility for their actions. Unless Trump explicitly urges them to commit crimes, charging him with incitement is wrong.')
