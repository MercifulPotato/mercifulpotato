Someone else might have a better answer for that as I&#x27;m too young to know. Wikipedia French page on &#x27;New Math&#x27; mentions it but not in details.<p>&gt; Is it still going on in French schools today? Or was it 60&#x27;s&#x2F;70&#x27;s only?<p>Unless you are in a reaally elitist high school in Paris with a really old teacher, this should&#x27;nt happen nowadays.')
