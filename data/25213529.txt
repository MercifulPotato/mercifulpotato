The chicken you&#x27;re eating lived for generally seven to nine weeks, probably with limited or no access to the outdoors and likely in a small cage. It was then transported a fairly long distance with no food or water on a lorry, then killed by either being hung upside down on a conveyor and dragged through electrified water, or gassed (usually with CO2, which is not painless).<p>This all sounds much, much worse than a fairly instant death almost immediately out of coming out of the egg, to me...<p>I suppose it&#x27;s kind of _unaesthetic_, and maybe people have unrealistic impressions of what the lives of the chickens that don&#x27;t get shredded are like, but I think this is all mostly a perception issue.')
