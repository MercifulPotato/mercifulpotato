Item(by='Symbiote', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606780417, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25256115, text='Sugar (in the form of sugar) is cheaper in Europe than sugar or HFCS in the USA.<p>£0.65&#x2F;kg in Tesco in the UK, 7.5kr&#x2F;kg ($1.20) in Føtex in Denmark, but $1.80&#x2F;kg at Walmart.  Corn syrup at Walmart is more expensive, $2 a pint, but presumably cheaper in bulk packaging.  (Last time I was in the USA, I saw an entire freight train of tank cars full of HFCS.)<p>(You&#x27;ll also note that plenty of rich Europeans prefer large &quot;normal&quot; cars, like Audis, BMWs, Mercedes etc, and a nice apartment in the middle of a city.)')
