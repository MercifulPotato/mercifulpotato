It&#x27;s debatable of course; something that predicted failure based on changes in data transfer (that presumably precede sectors being flagged), would be a bigger predictive step, but I never got that far in modeling; using flagged sector counts was enough to turn unscheduled drive failures into scheduled drive replacements for me.')
