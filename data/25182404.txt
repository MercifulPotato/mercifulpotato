Science is in as much of an agreement about the threat of the climate disaster as they are about the negative health effects of smoking. Sure some scientists might not agree, but they are wrong.<p>If Zach lives in the Willamette Valley, OR, Zach will in effect be smoking several packs of cigarettes every day every late summer due to increased wild fires. If Zach lives on the Keys in Florida, Zach will like have to find a new home in 40 years. You are not wrong that Zach is likely to have a long life, but you are also wrong in denying that the climate disaster is like to negatively effect Zach in significant ways in the next 40 years.')
