Item(by='knorker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604911620, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25030465, text='&gt; Sorry, which websites were warning users of potential security issues before?<p>Not just websites, but applications too. If you had to click &quot;fuck off&quot; to 100 cookie popups today, then when your email client pops up &quot;exe files are dangerous&quot;, or your browser says &quot;this website is not secure&quot; you won&#x27;t even read that, but just press &quot;fuck off, make it happen&quot;.<p>&gt; Any website that is doing that is basically being forced to wave a big red flag &quot;I AM DOING DODGY THINGS WITH YOUR DATA&quot; when you visit.<p>But since that&#x27;s every website, it&#x27;s meaningless. Especially since nobody looks at that red flag because of popup fatigue.')
