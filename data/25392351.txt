Item(by='rglullis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607725911, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25391515, text='My answer is &quot;I will wait&quot;, but most honestly it would be &quot;<i>No, unless the vaccination rate gets to a point that is not high enough to achieve herd immunity but is large enough to be considered safe and free from unexpected side-effects</i>&quot;. Reasons:<p>- It&#x27;s too new - not Lindy.<p>- I am reasonably convinced that I had it back in February, when people were not talking about it. It was very different from every year that I got the &#x27;flu and I experienced anosmia, which <i>never</i> happened before. I still take all the precautions possible, but for all intents and purposes, I consider myself already immunized.<p>- I&#x27;m already working from home, my social life is the one of a parent of two small kids - i.e, almost non-existent, occasionally meeting small groups of either family or close friends. My parents are on the other side of the ocean and aside from them I haven&#x27;t much interaction with people that could be at-risk.<p>- If herd immunity is achieved with ~60-70% vaccination, why take the risk when the social butterflies and those with key activities (health care workers, teachers, people working in retail) will likely be rushed to take it?<p>(Okay, I try to avoid complaining about downvotes, but downvoting a comment from someone that is just providing <i>personal opinion</i>? You can do better than that, HN...)')
