While from user perspective it didn&#x27;t get much better (maybe it got worse?) since Lion release in 2011, I still find it a major advantage of Macs.<p>If I were to switch to another system, I&#x27;d probably go with another laptop too - I&#x27;d get something with HDMI port, maybe touch screen, maybe the Lenovo laptop-tablet thing? There&#x27;s been quite some innovation out there that Apple simply ignores, yet I can&#x27;t convince myself to try Ubuntu or Windows again.')
