It is quite simple: the missile test scared a herd of reindeer and they ran along a path known to them, which passed through the tent. The Russian authorities even now cannot disclose information about the tests, because those who launched the missiles are still alive and have high ranks (and if the information is disclosed, these military personnel would have to be jailed for causing death by negligence). The Mansi wouldn&#x27;t tell about the reindeer because they were afraid they would be exterminated. That&#x27;s where the science ends, the rest is just the tour guide&#x27;s thoughts.\nAlso, the tour guide said that Dyatlov&#x27;s group was not an exploratory group, but just a few students going on a hike. It was known about the snowstorm in advance, but for some reason it was still decided to go on, rather than wait out the good weather. Another important factor was that the group had left warm clothes for the return trip, so those who got out of the tent just froze.\nSorry if there are mistakes, I used DeepL.')
