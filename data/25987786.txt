Item(by='krapp', descendants=None, kids=[25987946], score=None, time=1612179669, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25987637, text='Trump was alleging fraud since the beginning, because it&#x27;s a common belief among Republicans that the Democratic Party takes and maintains power primarily through fraud and criminal activity. Remember the narrative in 2016 was that the mainstream media and social media were all controlled by the globalist left taking orders from the Democratic Party, collaborating to &quot;rig the election&quot; for Hillary Clinton. Trump didn&#x27;t mean that as a metaphor, he was literally accusing the Democrats of doing what he would accuse them of in 2020. Trumpists believe that it was only through the revolutionary power of their populist uprising that Trump was able to be elected at all... but it could happen again. Remember, people were literally accusing Hillary Clinton and the DNC of committing treason and claiming Trump was going to lock her up as soon he got into office (note the throughline between the DNC email leaks, Pizzagate and eventually QAnon is &quot;Democratic Party&#x2F;leftist&#x2F;liberal corruption.&quot;)<p>Populism like Trump&#x27;s is always driven by a persecution complex, the belief that the populists have been humiliated, wronged or cheated from their rightful destiny by some nebulous enemy within (be it Jews, immigrants, socialists, Democrats, what have you) and the promise from a strong leader of just retribution against that enemy through revolutionary action (and often violence.)<p>Of course, this is just a means of control. The Democrats didn&#x27;t try to rig the election in 2016 and they didn&#x27;t steal it in 2020 but people driven by irrational fear and hatred are easy to manipulate, because once you know your enemy is pure evil (literally they drink the blood of the children they rape for their satanic orgies <i>and they&#x27;re Marxists!</i>) and that the system is always rigged against you and enemies within are everywhere, all decisions become simple. Trust God, trust the Leader, trust the Plan.')
