It was amazing.<p>You don&#x27;t need to do denoising and deinterlacing these days, so... I&#x27;m not sure why you think things were better back then? Nowadays encoders are more concerned about banding in particular, so they may specifically add noise on a scene-by-scene basis.<p>&gt; When&#x27;s the last time you&#x27;ve seen high quality karaoke on fansubs?<p>If you get <i>actual</i> fansubs these days instead of simulcast rips, you&#x27;ll find they have high quality karaoke. I particularly remember the Railgun S karaoke which had realistic-looking lightning striking each syllable. And more recently, you may find the English translations have been worded so that you can sing along in time with the original song.<p>&gt; You don&#x27;t often see translation notes any more either.<p>If you&#x27;re talking about TL notes in the subtitles themselves, they really went out of style. Nobody wants to be the next &quot;Translator&#x27;s note: keikaku means plan&quot;.')
