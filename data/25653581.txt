The underlying mechanism they&#x27;re using to enforce this is essentially: if your app can write to a directory, it can&#x27;t execute from that directory.<p>Apparently this is plugs a vulnerability known as W^X. See their explanation in the issue here[0]. Personally I would love to know how many real-world exploits they can blame on this specific vulnerability, stacked up against the number of truly useful apps like Termux that have now been hamstrung.<p>Also, this leaves the state of running native executables on Android as something of a joke. Any executable you want to run has to be named `lib&lt;exe_name&gt;.so`, and included in your jniLib directory at build time.<p>It&#x27;s clear what side GOOG has picked in the war on general-purpose computing[1].<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;issuetracker.google.com&#x2F;issues&#x2F;128554619" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;issuetracker.google.com&#x2F;issues&#x2F;128554619</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HUEvRyemKSg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=HUEvRyemKSg</a>')
