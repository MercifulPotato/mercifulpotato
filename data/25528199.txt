As much as they sucked I kind of miss the HDD grunt - I could hear when stuff was using my disk, it was kind of reassuring that the PC was working. Sort of like that floppy drive boot check sound. That HDD seek rumble and CD spin when you were installing games. Objectively these things are a negative but I kind of miss it. This also made me realize where car fans complaining about the electric car feel are coming from :)')
