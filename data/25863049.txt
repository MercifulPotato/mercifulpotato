You&#x27;re also absolutely right that disagreements can engage the emotions in the way you describe.<p>But consider your example, software. People have strong emotions about, say, Windows vs. Mac vs. Linux as a platform. This isn&#x27;t just about the feels. Real issues are at stake. The Unix-hater&#x27;s handbook points out how &quot;root&quot; was a terrible security model. Similar comments might apply to Windows.<p>Well, I think art matters too. There&#x27;s no bright line between &quot;art&quot; and the other ways people have of expressing ideas (political speeches, say). If our art is clichéd, it means our ideas are clichéd. At worst, it means we are hiding from reality in a bubble of uplift and togetherness. At present (in my view as an outsider) Americans really need to come together as a nation - but that will require more than repeating the clichés of one&#x27;s own political tribe. So in that sense, I think this poem is a bad omen.')
