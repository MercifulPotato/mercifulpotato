When that&#x27;s very big part of that dystopian worlds settings, always has been, and not some specific dig against trans people.<p>Makes me wonder how much of that is simply a pile-on effect from the general situation in Poland with LGTBQ+ issues and CDPR getting drawn into that as some kind of scapegoat.')
