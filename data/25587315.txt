They are never bad guys, they always have some good reason to fight: freedom of their country, justice for their people, etc.<p>It&#x27;s the chosen method of fighting that matters. In democratic society you can protest peacefully, which means not attacking the police, not looting the stores, not setting cars on fire. If you can&#x27;t refrain from this, then you are terrorist and I don&#x27;t give a fuck about the cause you&#x27;re fighting for, it&#x27;s not an excuse.')
