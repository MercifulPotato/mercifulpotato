Item(by='thaumasiotes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607003253, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25286303, text='&gt; my first inclination is to be skeptical that the property would still hold, since we&#x27;re &quot;potentially&quot; slicing up a necessary sequence and adding 2s in the middle.<p>No. If the sequence you want occurs between places <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> of <i>z</i>, then it is a substring of the full sequence between places 1 and <i>b</i> of <i>z</i>, and all such sequences are included within the expansion of <i>z&#x27;</i>. (Going by example again, if you&#x27;re interested in the sequence that occurs between decimal places 41,028 and 315,001 of <i>z</i>, then that sequence will occur within the part of <i>z&#x27;</i> that repeats places 1 through 315,001 of <i>z</i>.)')
