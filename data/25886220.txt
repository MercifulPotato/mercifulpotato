Facebook.com is private commercial property, they can define rules and decide which customers they work with. The only thing they cannot do is restrict users by categories, protected by law.<p>It&#x27;s pretty clear the GP wants to change the laws to make such actions by Facebook illegal. Facebook is private of course, they still have to follow the law. Are you saying you don&#x27;t know specifically what the change in the laws would be (of course we can&#x27;t expect the GP to have all the details worked out) or do you not understand the concept that we as a society can change the law to regulate Facebook&#x27;s actions?')
