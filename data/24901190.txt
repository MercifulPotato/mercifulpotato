Most of the people that care however are large legacy enterprises that are running line of business applications that they don&#x27;t have the source code for or require libraries they don&#x27;t have the source code for. While they are migrating it&#x27;s not a quick process in many cases.<p>As for 16bit HANDLEs for 32bit programs, it wouldn&#x27;t have solved the issue as the HANDLEs are kernel tokens. The kernel doesn&#x27;t actually care whether the user space application is 32 bit or 64bit in many cases. That&#x27;s all handled via WoW64CPU.dll and friends. They proxy all kernel calls from 32bit code and then segment switch to a 64bit segment before calling the kernel. The same happens in reverse when coming back. So it would incur significant performance overhead in many cases to add that when it isn&#x27;t really necessary and would negatively impact already memory constrained programs. Instead MS chose to let them get the best benefits they could from 64bit mode: all 4GB the 32bit address space can be used for 32bit things instead of just the bottom 2&#x2F;3GB (depending on being flagged &#x2F;LARGEADDRESSAWARE). In the end it&#x27;s a lot more complicated than just telling people that aren&#x27;t using very memory intensive apps in the first place to just run 32bit Windows which already works... and supports vm86 mode.')
