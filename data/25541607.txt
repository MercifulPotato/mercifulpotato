The typical &quot;reinforced&quot; criteria was being able to handle 2-3psi over pressure and storm force winds (70mph).<p>This particular building is an old AT&amp;T-cum-BellSouth-cum-AT&amp;T tandem office. It&#x27;s where end offices (that connected to actual customer phones) would be connected together and connected to inter exchange carriers.<p>AFAIK AT&amp;T tended to build their tandem offices as reinforced style buildings. They are larger than end offices and needed high availability because they were the central node for a region&#x27;s telephone network and its connection to other networks.<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen any central office in a regular home in a neighborhood. Even end offices, while smaller than tandems, required a lot of equipment and power backups. Besides the equipment in the building they&#x27;d usually have secured parking&#x2F;storage for service vehicles.')
