Apple built not only the marketplace but the actual devices themselves. Apple is giving developers a marketplace of users with powerful processors, fast internet connections, and credit cards already connected. Installing an app is easier on a smartphone than any desktop. A big cut is well worth deserved, and the contract terms seem pretty fair. I can&#x27;t see how Epic wins this one -- not only did they agree to the contract, the contract isn&#x27;t particularly outrageous, in my mind. Compare it to something like a movie theater. The movie theater gets almost no box-office revenue. Apple lets you keep most of it.')
