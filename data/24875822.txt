Industrial use cases (think data centers, factories, etc) likely reduce usage during night time hours but they surely don&#x27;t drop by 50% usage.<p>&gt; The bottom half of the demand is the easy half, why would you use your most expensive power for the easy stuff?<p>Factoring in carbon footprints nuclear would likely beat our battery based storage options if carbon output was taxed. Nickelâ€“metal hydride battery and LiPo are not carbon neutral and are consumable components.<p>&gt; In other words, you&#x27;re running your nuclear at a 50% duty cycle, doubling it&#x27;s price. I don&#x27;t think there is much appetite for power that costs over $200 per MWh.<p>50% duty cycle means 50% fuel usage (not really but not not) meaning you&#x27;re not really &quot;wasting&quot; energy here.<p>Another question to ask ourselves: we make the Total Cost of Ownership of a plant far better than it even currently is? We can do this by extending the lifespan of a plant to amortize construction. If you could design a power plant to last 100 to 200 years, that could be amortized further factoring into lower costs. We can also do this by reducing construction costs or improving efficiency.<p>I think those are accomplish-able goals (at least judging by China&#x27;s adoption of Nuclear). Current plants in the USA operate for ~40 years. That means current plants were built with ~$today-50 (or more) years of physics and material science knowledge.<p>For context, that&#x27;s the 70s. In the 70s:<p>- C was invented<p>- TTL logic was just starting to be used<p>- Stainless steel <i>did not exist</i> &lt;- this statement was wrong<p>Edit: philipkglass pointed out that stainless steel is quite a bit older. Disregard that last item.')
