You have several deployment paths, platforms, modules, features, signing and what not. Then the build is akin to a small program. Thatâ€™s still reasonable. The problem is that all build tools that allow this make it more complex than simply writing a small script that does exactly what you need. Add to that that some dependemcies use a different build tool that you use. Adding a cmake dependency to a make project makes everything even more complex.')
