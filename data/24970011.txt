The engineers already have fea models which they build reduced order dynamic equations out of.  By monitoring the response, you can estimate the damping factor relatively easily which could provide the feedback whether your shocks need to be replaced.<p>I mean some people take machine learning to include anything with parameter fitting, but it seems like classic engineering to me.')
