Attack them in a way that has plausible deniability and is socially acceptable for some reason.<p>But if you look at the overall pattern of behavior, the real point is to attack or exclude a particular person or particular group of people.<p>Among other things I&#x27;ve had a college class in Social Psychology. I object to a gossipy piece of garbage getting so many upvotes on HN while bringing down the quality of discussion here.<p>If you find something meaty in his analysis of pg&#x27;s work, then why don&#x27;t you comment on that instead of arguing with me?<p>If my comments here are so off the mark, why do they have so much attention? This piece is failing to generate meaty discussion. It&#x27;s mostly generating hot takes about Paul Graham and not commentary on the criticism of his work because the framing of the piece doesn&#x27;t really fit with the idea that it&#x27;s about criticizing his work.<p>If it were really about criticizing his work, what we should see here is debate about whether or not that criticism holds water. And I&#x27;m not really seeing that.')
