Why aren&#x27;t the hackers asking for cryptocurrencies using zero-knowledge proofs like ZCash or Monero?  Bitcoin?  What&#x27;s their plan next?<p>I&#x27;m not saying you can&#x27;t get away with this (there are coin &quot;mixers&quot; and decentralized exchanges) but still, this leaves lots of traces left and right.<p>For example we saw a lot of people getting busted recently while they thought they were smart using cryptocurrencies, including a money launderer ring... And they were using mixers, decentralized exchanges, people located overal several countries&#x2F;continents and whatnots if I recall correctly.  Yet: all busted.<p>For all we known in six months the headline could be: &quot;Hackers who extorted 1.14M USD from UCSF arrested by Interpol&quot;<p>Besides that: what happened to offline backups?  How exactly are hackers coming for cloned, unplugged, HDDs&#x2F;SSDs stored on shelves &#x2F; bank safes? (I know several companies doing just that as offline backups)<p>I hope this serves as a wake up call to companies&#x2F;institutions either not doing backup properly or outsourcing to incompetent companies not doing backups properly (the latter being not really excusable).')
