If you&#x27;re doing web development professionally, using Rust will make you more productive and happy.  The first few months onboarding with the language are challenging, but working with Rust is a very rewarding experience.  The thing about Rust web dev expertise is that once you reach parity in capabilities with that of another language, there&#x27;s no reason not to use Rust even where performance isn&#x27;t absolutely necessary.  There&#x27;s no going back once you&#x27;ve gone down the Rust path because you&#x27;ll be able to build better solutions with even greater velocity than if you were doing so with a dynamic language.  Again, the first few months working with Rust are challenging, but it pays off!')
