The 64m dish at Parkes observatory weighs in at about 1000 tons [0]. An expendable Falcon Heavy can lift about 26t to GTO which is a bit more than it could put into a TLI. Let&#x27;s say 22t into TLI. That vehicle needs to actually land on the Moon rather than orbit or crash into it so <i>usable</i> payload to the Lunar surface will be much less than the vehicle&#x2F;fuel mass. Let&#x27;s say 14t since it&#x27;s all unpressurized payload. That&#x27;s for $150m a pop. You&#x27;ll need at least 71 of those launches which comes out to a cool $10.6b. The construct-o-bots will need a few more launches so let&#x27;s round up to $11b.<p>That&#x27;s all assuming building a huge instrument on the far side of the Moon with robots is all a solved engineering problem.<p>Then there&#x27;s the Lunar environment. The reason the Moon is covered in Moon dust is because it is constantly bombarded with micrometeoroids. I&#x27;m pretty sure the operating manuals for a lot of the sensitive instruments mounted on the Parkes dish say &quot;don&#x27;t shoot with a gun&quot; which is about the energy equivalent of a lot of micrometeoroids IIRC. One hit to a cryogenically cooled receiver will result in it ceasing to be cryogenically cooled.<p>That tens of billions of dollars for <i></i>one<i></i> Parkes equivalent could buy you about 60 FASTs (~$170m) or 30 Arecibos (~$350m).')
