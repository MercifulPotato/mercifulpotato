I’ve been developing on the Django stack for the past 10+ years. I have fixed many bugs if mine and of others. It has been extremely rare, if at all, that they were bugs caused by an incorrect type. The closest I can think of is a typo in a method or class name, but is it really a bug if you catch it instantly? These are just not the types of bugs that end up creeping into the code.<p>In the meantime Django provides productivity like you can’t get many other places. It’s just a pleasure to work with and aside from a couple of setting-related places it’s code is a pleasure to read.')
