Looking at the historic Tether market cap on CoinMarketCap - which is practically equal to all non-destroyed tethers due to USDT being pegged to the USD - however does not reveal any significant drop in Tether market cap ever that could be an indication of actual redemptions. And I refuse to believe that in all of Tethers&#x27; history, with all of Bitcoins&#x27; ups and downs, there has never been a period in which people weren&#x27;t pulling more money out of the crypto ecosystem than other people were putting fresh money in. I would expect that to be the case in most of the Bitcoin deflation phases.')
