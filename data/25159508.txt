Appending to file just doesn&#x27;t work under NT kernel since WriteFile blocks even if you use overlapped io.<p>Devs just need different mentality when it comes to Windows programming compared to Linux. Due the fact that everything under NT kernel is operated asynchronously you&#x27;ll have to adapt your code to such concept. Meanwhile under Linux you had no other alternative for nearly 30 years (io_uring and friends) so if you wanted to be portable with minimum OS specific code then you had to implement things in synchronous way or write two separate code paths for each OS.<p>Guess which one is used in practice.')
