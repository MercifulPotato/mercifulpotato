What they like is all over the place.  We don&#x27;t force or bribe them to eat anything - we put their options on their plate (usually around 4 things) and let them eat whatever they want.  Everything they eat my wife and I eat, and we don&#x27;t make things we don&#x27;t like to eat.<p>Usually only around half of what we serve them will be eaten by all 3 kids. What they don&#x27;t eat I generally eat for lunch the next day.<p>There are also some completely random habits.  Take asparagus for example.  One toddler won&#x27;t eat the tips.')
