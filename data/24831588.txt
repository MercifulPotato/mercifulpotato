We&#x27;ve stated this many times, unequivocally. Our monetization puts the user as the customer, not say, the product to be sold to advertisers (read: other social networks.) We think that this alignment of incentives sets us up to do the best by our users. Our monetary success depends on how great an experience we can build for our users, such that they convert to a paid subscriber - while not gating everything behind a paywall. Hence why our premium subscription service generally includes cosmetic incentives, that are optional to the core experience of chat, and as well, and unlocks stuff like higher quality streaming (since it costs us more to run, we unlock higher quality once you pay us.)<p>As for where it&#x27;s stated that we don&#x27;t sell user data, it&#x27;s in our privacy policy: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.com&#x2F;privacy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.com&#x2F;privacy</a><p>&gt;  The Company is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you.<p>&gt; No Sale of Personal Information: The CCPA sets forth certain obligations for businesses that sell personal information. We do not sell the personal information of our users.<p>&gt;  Because Discord does not sell the personal information of our users to third parties, this is not applicable.<p>And also in our safety center: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.com&#x2F;safety" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.com&#x2F;safety</a><p>&gt;  We do not sell your data, nor do we share it with third parties for advertising purposes.')
