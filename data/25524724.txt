Battery life can last 2-3+ weeks with litte heart rate monitoring. Sleep tracking is there, but I can&#x27;t comment on it&#x27;s accuracy, although it should be pretty good.<p>It&#x27;s better than Fitbit in every category, and significantly cheaper. There&#x27;s plenty of 3rd party app support and it&#x27;s easy to extract data into a privacy conscious health app, if you don&#x27;t trust any of the apps too.')
