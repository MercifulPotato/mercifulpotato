Item(by='alickz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610534669, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25760283, text='True, it might not be a monopoly, or even a duopoly, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s much better. Do you think if a politician is banned from Facebook, Twitter, and Google they have even a small chance of being elected?<p>It wouldn&#x27;t even take all 3. If Google decided to heavily promote pro-Trump articles in their SEO, and heavily downplay pro-Biden articles leading up to the election, do you think it would have gone the way it did? And if not, do you think that&#x27;s OK?<p>Of course they can do what they like, it&#x27;s their platform. And if Biden supporters didn&#x27;t like it they could boycott and tell everyone to use Bing or DDG. But I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s a realistic solution.<p>I&#x27;m not making any strong claims here, I certainly don&#x27;t know the right answer or if this is as much of a problem as it seems to me. I&#x27;m just worried that a handful of companies control a significant amount of the discourse in not just their own countries, but internationally. It might not be a current issue, but I could see it being a future one.<p>Or I could be completely wrong, I&#x27;m just musing.')
