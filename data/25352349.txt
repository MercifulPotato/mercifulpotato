It was more about the general idea.)<p>Edit 2: y&#x27;all are making a good point about making music not being easy either (I did underrepresent that), but there is no point posting the same reply five times. The subthread where I replied to that is here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25352484" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25352484</a>')
