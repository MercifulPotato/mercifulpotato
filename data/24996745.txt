Yes, NPT can&#x27;t do this. No, you don&#x27;t need an additional proxy. All the usual methods work, they&#x27;re just not called NPT. On linux MASQ and REDIRECT targets work on ipv6. You can change addresses and ports exactly the same way you&#x27;d do it for ipv4.<p>There are other wrong things in this rant too. I&#x27;m curious if the author ran into many issues while implementing ipv6 or just doesn&#x27;t like the idea in general. The problems and some solutions seem very contrived and there are better ways to solve them.')
