If you want to return a future to a caller, or have a method that blocks until the work is done, you still need a way to differentiate that.<p>Golang does essentially the same thing and uses channels instead of &quot;futures&quot;. However, some APIs will have functions that return a channel that you receive a message on later.. Which is a lot like a future. And if you provide a more simple non-channel API along side(instead of making the consumer wrap your calls in a Go routine or always use a channel), you now have &quot;colored&quot; functions.<p>I believe this is just a solution to a scheduling problem(pre-emptive vs cooperative).')
