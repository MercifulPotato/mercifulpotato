On the image format part, PPM is indeed a great way to get off the ground.<p>If you really want something more portable like PNG then it happens to be quite a fun library to implement.  I encourage you to write your own.  It’s basically:<p>- some magic number bytes<p>- a static header to announce the image is 8bit RGB zlib-compressed unfiltered non-interlaced<p>- a final set of magic bytes to say “here’s the actual image”<p>- zlib compressed rows of RGB bytes, with a 0 at the start of each row<p>So really just a fancy image.ppm.gz.  What’s cool is that with 10 more lines of code you can implement animated PNG.')
