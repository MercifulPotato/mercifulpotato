The schools basically put up with me because I was in a gifted program, though I must&#x27;ve been an annoying AF over-eager hand-raiser and a weird, nerdy kid.<p>My family wouldn&#x27;t allow psychological or psychiatric intervention because they believed it was a conspiracy against children.<p>25 years later, I&#x27;ve tried the main classes of AD(H)D medications and cannot tolerate them even though I need them to function in society. (On benefits at present, looking to start a 3D printed custom parts business.)<p>Antidepressants: I wish there one that worked, but I&#x27;ve tried 14 of them; I&#x27;m looking at the dissociatives, psychedelics, TMS, medical implants, and surgical options.')
