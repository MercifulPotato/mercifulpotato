At least something more than &quot;dang, I need to have a Macbook for that?&quot;<p>My girlfriend is a UX professional that does most of her work in Sketch. She doesn&#x27;t care about macOS beyond the fact that it&#x27;s required by the tools she has to use.<p>I impulse-built an overpowered Windows machine earlier this year and tried to pawn it off on her, but she didn&#x27;t even want it because it doesn&#x27;t run Sketch. She&#x27;s stuck on a Macbook.<p>Some people are replying to you saying there are these great benefits to being macOS native, but they really pale in comparison to having to learn something as complex as Sketch. A few familiar component paradigms don&#x27;t really put a dent in the learning curve, or it&#x27;s at least vastly overstated. I&#x27;d liken Sketch more to Photoshop in the sense that some native components aren&#x27;t going to make the hard stuff easier.<p>I think you&#x27;re right, hard to imagine it&#x27;s a hill worth dying on.')
