For US and UK (which dominate the statistics on stuff like this due to language and other factors), women spend significantly more.<p>&gt; The 2013 data contradicts your claim.<p>It doesn&#x27;t. Men want iPhone less than women. My initial point was simply that people here and on reddit (men dominated sites) are not reflective of apple&#x27;s focus.<p>31% of men wanted Android while only 24% of women wanted the same.<p>&gt; PS: Only the latest iPhone has best camera. They traded places with Pixel, Samsung, etc... over the last few years.<p>This is misleading. While iPhones fared worse than pixel in photo department for 3 years, they make up to it in other aspects especially video. As for Samsung, it depends on what you consider better camera. iPhone arguably has the best color profile and accuracy while Samsung phones does beautification and increase contrast which does make them look nicer but overall, not accurate.')
