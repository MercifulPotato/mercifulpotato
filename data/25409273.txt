I sure hope they do, but at the current rate of spread in Europe and the Americas, it is not totally implausible that they won&#x27;t be able to make it in quantity until it&#x27;s too late to have an impact on this pandemic.<p>Which would not be a reason not to have made it (we would want it for the future), but it&#x27;s still rather early to say how much impact this vaccine will have.  There is also the possibility that some other vaccine will be able to roll out doses for 300 million people before this one has successfully made doses for 10 million.  I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s likely, but it&#x27;s certainly within the plausible range of possibilities.')
