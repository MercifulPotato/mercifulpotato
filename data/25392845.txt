Put those solar panels in Portugal and Spain and the difference between winter and summer is much less. I ran some numbers recently for Portugal&#x27;s grid and was surprised to find out that with the current seasonality of solar, wind and hydro we have on the grid, we could scale up solar and wind to have 100% renewables with very little overcapacity and we could keep going and produce twice our current needs while exporting about the same amount of energy every month of the year. Solar and wind&#x27;s seasonality match up quite well and hydro gives great flexibility.')
