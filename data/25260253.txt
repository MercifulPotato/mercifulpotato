It has a different emphasis, like not aiming at compatibility the way Octave does.<p>It grieves me to see how much money squander on MATLAB (and they&#x27;re apparently not allowed to compare notes, which says something).  The ones I&#x27;m familiar with pay around (or more than) enough to fund a full-time support post, so there could instead be a significantly-sized sustainable research support team working in that area, just in the UK.')
