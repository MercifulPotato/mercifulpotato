Ableton Live is NOT my instrument, I would like to just use it as a tool.<p>It takes years of practice to learn any musical instrument and become a musician that other people would want to listen to. Maybe the same applies to Ableton? It takes years of hard practice to master it? If so it would be proper that their sales literature would be up front about it. You will need years of study to master this instrument in order to produce something that other people would want to listen to. You will need to commit to it :-)<p>The difference between Ableton and &quot;ordinary musical instruments&quot; is that Ableton runs on a computer, therefore its use should be easy enough to not require years to learn.')
