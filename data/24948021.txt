Only move to Wayland when there is a real path for what you want and need. And it does it without hacks.<p>About porting I would look at what MATE is doing or at the code of Wayland shells, protocols or things like Waybar at GitHub. You don&#x27;t have to write an entire compositor if you don&#x27;t want to. Even better get in touch with the people who know what they are talking about, I think they have a wayland IRC channel.')
