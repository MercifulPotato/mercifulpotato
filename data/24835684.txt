I&#x27;ve seen similar things the other way around. Someone didn&#x27;t use Facebook. People didn&#x27;t switch; they got left out and forgotten.<p>I probably should have said it was a tech-savvy academic community, and a somewhat small one (ca. 50 people).<p>&gt; Another one was Google Groups (a type of mailing list). Someone didn&#x27;t want to use a Google account. They couldn&#x27;t figure out how to subscribe. Was the group willing to switch to another provider? No of course not. In the end an admin manually subscribed the person with their non-Google address, but if that hadn&#x27;t been possible, the group would have let them go rather than switch service.<p>Google groups was what we ended up with, after facebook caused resistance. The thing with google groups is, it&#x27;s not really a walled garden -- it&#x27;s just a mailing list; you have all your data archived in your email unless you choose to delete it yourself, and if it fails for whatever reason, you can just manually send an email with a huge Bcc instead. Google in generally is pretty good at &quot;export all your data&quot;; while partly due to antitrust pressure, I think that this is mainly a way to keep the techie audience semi-loyal. I am more worried about github&#x2F;lab, ironically, due to the &quot;superstructure&quot; they add on top of the repositories (issue trackers mostly). In theory there are tools that can export all of it &quot;back&quot; into the repository, but in practice people are loath to use them.<p>&gt; Yes and no. Everyone uses email, but many only use it inside Gmail, which is a bit of a mess if you&#x27;re subscribed to a bunch of mailing lists, and trying to keep track of events you&#x27;ve been invited to.<p>Anything is a mess if you need to keep track of lots of events. Has Facebook figured out how to make calendars non-confusing?')
