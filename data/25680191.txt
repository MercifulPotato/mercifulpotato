The orange dot signifies how strong the genetic correlation is for that outcome from genes not related to IQ. The blue dot is the correlation with genes that correlated with IQ. The grey dot is the correlation of educational attainment with the outcome.\nWhen theres an asterisk, it means there was a significant difference between the IQ based genetic correlation and the non IQ based, so you can infer how much of a role IQ plays for that outcome as compared to non IQ related genes.<p>So take cigarettes per day for example. You can see that the non IQ genes were more correlated with cigarette usage than IQ genes, which tells us a little but about what mediates that outcome.&quot;')
