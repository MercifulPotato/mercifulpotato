I&#x27;m glad it turned out well for you.<p>I have impingement syndrome in one shoulder and it flairs up every once in a while. That shoulder has never been the same since the injury, but it&#x27;s not nearly as painful or debilitating as I hear frozen shoulder is. I should probably do exercises&#x2F;stretches more often so it doesn&#x27;t flair up or get worse.')
