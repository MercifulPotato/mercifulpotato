I don’t think it would be possible for humanity to reap it’s advantages.<p>Back when it was invented people actually had to drive the things around on public roads that had a bunch of pedestrians walking haphazardly accross them continuously.<p>I was an autopilot skeptic, and it’s entirely for this reason. I didn’t think it would be possible for anyone to actually do what needed to be done to get this technology across the line. That is to say, give it to customers <i>before</i> it is safe.<p>If Tesla is actually able to keep doing this without it getting killed politically, then I think it actually will happen, and that gives me some hope for humanity more generally.')
