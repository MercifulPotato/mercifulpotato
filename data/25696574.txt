For example, I see Sunstein as being very interested comparing human behavior against rationality (in its various forms).<p>One of Sunstein&#x27;s main points is that overreactions can cause more damage than the triggering event. This is a valid point, even if COVID-19 did not play out this way.<p>May I ask, what is your experience when reading economics-style writing? In my experience, the authors are often misinterpreted. The tend to operate at a different level of abstraction even though the words seem familar.<p>In this case, I don&#x27;t think Sunstein is trying to call out individuals for acting irrationally. He certainly doesn&#x27;t dismiss them. Knowing how people behave, he wants to build better systems to serve them. Sunstein, of all people, understands many nuances of human behavior, including risk tolerance. His &#x27;project&#x27; (you could say) is connecting the dots between individual behavior and systemic problems.')
