A good teacher can help you with that. You need to learn to keep your fingers and wrists as relaxed as possible - which is unbelievably hard to do when you&#x27;re also trying to learn how to read music.<p>Watch some slow piano music being played by a concert pianist, and you&#x27;ll see that - except for the odd flourish - they move fingers and wrists as little as possible. The hands float, they don&#x27;t hover in a tense way.<p>It also depends on the keyboard you&#x27;re using. There&#x27;s a big difference between a soft and fast keyboard action and a piano action with real or simulated hammers. The latter is much harder on your fingers to start with, but gives you more control and stamina later.')
