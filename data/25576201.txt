That includes room, board, books, tuition, and $4,000 of personal expenses for transportation, etc. The closest university is about $16k for everything except personal expenses, so let&#x27;s add $4k to that to get to $20k (probably a bit high, but we&#x27;ll use it to use).<p>So that would come to:\n$11k\n$11k\n$20k\n$20k\n-----\n$62k<p>The $16k we budgeted for personal expenses is probably a bit high and I living on campus is much more expensive than other options, but at $15 per hour, you&#x27;d only need to work half time to cover all your expenses.<p>So lets say you work 20 hours a week for 39 weeks during the school year and 40 hours for 13 during the summer. That is 1,300 hours per year. You need to bring in $11.9 per hour to cover your expenses without being particularly frugal. If you live at home, live off campus and cook your own food, graduate a semester early, etc. you can drop your costs down by quite a bit.<p>For students who did ok in highschool (3.5 GPA, 29 on ACT) the university will give you at least a $2k scholarship. Pell grants will give you up to $5k that you don&#x27;t need to pay back depending on your financial need. Graduating debt free is very VERY doable.')
