Meanwhile I was out there doing 3 hour a day intense workouts.<p>Trying to say there is &quot;one diet to rule them all&quot;, well, it doesn&#x27;t work. Any given diet subreddit is going to be full of people for whom that diet works really well, and a self-reinforcing community will form. Back when I was super active on &#x2F;r&#x2F;keto people would come in and ask why it wasn&#x27;t working for them, and after going through the regular checklist, I&#x27;d add &quot;and maybe this just isn&#x27;t for you!&quot; because sometimes that is true!<p>I wish I had links to a study I saw where they worked to find an optimal diet for different people and were able to discover that different protein&#x2F;fat&#x2F;carb ratios worked well for different people. No one plan worked for everyone!<p>There is a lot we don&#x27;t know about human nutrition, and while we can learn from past populations, holding up any one group as having an ideal diet that&#x27;ll work for anyone, meh.<p>Heck I&#x27;ve seen people throw citations back and forth at each other for how good&#x2F;bad cow milk is. Legit research, biochemical pathways explored and explained, and each side seemed to make some good points. None of which changed the fact that people people do GOMAD and put on insane muscle, while other people just get really bloated.')
