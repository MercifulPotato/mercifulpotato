They have salaries to pay. Period.<p>That&#x27;s not what Open Source is.<p>What&#x27;s actually happening here is that people disagree with the goals of the FOSS movement, which is fine, but then instead of going out and joining any of the many other movements around software licensing that are better suited for them -- instead of releasing products as source available or shared source or noncommercial-reuse&#x2F;creative-commons or just under any generally permissive license -- instead they act like this is our problem to solve.<p>The point of Open Source is not to share knowledge, it&#x27;s to allow people to reuse&#x2F;share <i>code</i>. There are other movements that are better equipped to solve your problems if your goal is primarily just to share knowledge. But we&#x27;re not going to drop everything we&#x27;ve worked to build just to accommodate you.<p>Nobody is forcing you to be a part of this movement. Nobody is forcing you to release your software under MIT or GPL licenses. You can do whatever the heck you want with the software you build, just leave us alone and stop acting like it&#x27;s our problem that our movement isn&#x27;t accommodating your goals.')
