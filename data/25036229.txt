That goes for feature requests on open source projects ...</i><p>While I&#x27;m sure there are some open source developers who see feature requests as a burden, lots of us just want to make useful software. If someone lets me know about a way that icdiff or anything else I maintain could be better, I&#x27;m happy to hear it.<p>I&#x27;m not always up for implementing changes, in which case I&#x27;ll typically say whether a PR implementing the feature would be welcome, but it is extremely far from unethical to file a feature request.')
