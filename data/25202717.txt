Item(by='crasl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606249996, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25185487, text='&gt;But how? Let&#x27;s say I have one BTC. You offer me 15k USD to buy it, I say no. You say, ok, what about 18k USDT (that you just printed)? I reconsider and say, yeah, ok. So you inflated the price ok, but then what?<p>It doesn&#x27;t really work like that. It&#x27;s more like: you see BTC being traded at 15k, and you refused to buy because that&#x27;s ridiculously high. Two days later, the price pumps to 18k (which is, at least partially, caused by Tether printing). Now FOMO kicks in and you saw a tweet by some rando that says that Bitcoin will breach the ATH and get to 25k for sure due to his TA. You decided to buy in at 18k.<p>Notice that in this entire thought process, there&#x27;s no difference between USDT price and USD price. They are considered one and the same, at least in the vast majority of traders, holders, miners and crypto media.<p>Now, you may have access to USD exchanges like Coinbase, but many people don&#x27;t. For those, their only FOMO option is USDT exchanges like Bitfinex, which means they need to buy USDT first, which means the Tether ecosystme just got some new cash inflow and someone else got to cash out their USDT.')
