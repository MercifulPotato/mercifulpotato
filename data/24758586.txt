Item(by='bdowling', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602531702, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24758182, text='&gt; By the sounds of it playstation &#x27;owners&#x27; were paid compensation, but could not get the Linux feature back, in other words they were not made whole.<p>Members of the class could opt out of the settlement and sue Sony individually. A court could theoretically enjoin Sony to restore the feature for those individual plaintiffs, but the plaintiffs would have to show that monetary damages would be insufficient. Generally courts don’t like to force defendants to do things when paying money would be an acceptable outcome.<p>&gt; In my view this Sony case looks like compensation for breach of a lease-like contract.<p>I haven’t read the complaint in that case but the plaintiffs probably alleged a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. So, yes, possibly a breach of contract claim but not a lease. (Note: A lease is a specific form of contract in which a lessor transfers possession of property to a lessee, but retains a future interest in the property after the contract term ends.)')
