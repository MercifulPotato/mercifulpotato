This is not even pushing a political agenda or a judgment of value. Just &quot;everybody&quot; calls that like that, so there is no point in overloading the term for other approaches. Using another term for other things is perfectly fine and there are plenty of them possible with a positive tone, in case they bring positive things to the table.')
