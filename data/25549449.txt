I&#x27;m in my mid 30s, software developer, and generally open to spirituality but not in the conventional, western, judeo-christian sense.<p>One of my foundations of belief is that life is entirely about probabilities and chance.  It&#x27;s a sort of guiding force that I follow.  I view everything similarly to how you do, in that we cannot possibly know for sure it&#x27;s outcome.  By extension, we cannot possibly know what the right choice is for us.  Sometimes, you have to close your eyes and roll the dice.<p>I&#x27;m deeply interested in the random nature of the world &#x2F; life.  When you stop to think about it so much of our existence is truly random in nature right down to our conception.  It boggles the mind to think how little control we had over even our own existence.<p>As for identity I&#x27;m also a free will skeptic as you put it.<p>Anyways, just thought I&#x27;d let you know that people like you are out there.  I also find it a bummer that we&#x27;re a huge minority, but such is life I suppose.')
