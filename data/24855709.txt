They all died of colon cancer.  She got it too, but since she went to the doctor with her symptoms instead of staying at home, they were able to remove part of her colon before it got really bad and she lived for many more years.)<p>Moral of the story: go to the doctor if you&#x27;re bleeding from unexpected places.')
