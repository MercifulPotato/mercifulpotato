Item(by='morelisp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604744385, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25011627, text='&gt; overnight trips are not normal behavior of teacher trying to help poor gifted student.<p>The forms have changed but only slightly. ~All G&amp;T programs in the US run summer camps and weekend trips. Schools outside of major cities take overnight field trips to the nearest major city to access museums and galleries, often with additional costs for families. Extracurricular programs (not only sports but also forensics, mathematics olympiads, OM and FIRST, etc.) require family resources for students to participate outside their immediate city. For older students, teachers often organize overseas trips with enormous associated expenses.<p>The importance of this might be lost on people who grew up in countries more functional than the US. The lack of decent inter-city rail&#x2F;bus networks means children from impoverished families may otherwise never get outside their city (maybe even neighborhood) until they can drive themselves.<p>(I am less familiar with the norms of early 20th century Austrian schooling but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it looks more like modern US schools than it does modern Austrian schools...)')
