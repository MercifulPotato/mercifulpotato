I don&#x27;t like MagSafe.<p>The cables fray and the MagSafe tips wear out, that means buying an entire new charger (or soldering on a donor cable), I&#x27;m on my 5th or 6th. The surfaces get dirty, and because they just butt up (rather than sliding) they become high resistance and heat up.<p>If MagSafe 2021 doesn&#x27;t fuse the cable to the charger brick, then I might consider it. The fickle electrical connection is inherent to the design though.')
