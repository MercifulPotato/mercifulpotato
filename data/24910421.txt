What a joke. Worst part is that since you&#x27;re not actually banned, there&#x27;s literally no recourse or support you can get either.<p>But then these new accounts with no followers can spam thousands of tweets to big accounts and get away with it? Very strange.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.twitter.com&#x2F;en_us&#x2F;topics&#x2F;company&#x2F;2018&#x2F;Setting-the-record-straight-on-shadow-banning.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.twitter.com&#x2F;en_us&#x2F;topics&#x2F;company&#x2F;2018&#x2F;Setting-t...</a>')
