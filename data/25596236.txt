They took a public good and effectively privatized it, ostensibly for the public benefit (reducing infrastructure costs on NYE) but conceivably for private benefit (passing out VIP tickets as favors or steering a profitable security contract to an ally).<p>There&#x27;s <i>nothing</i> in economics that says the optimal outcome will naturally emerge. There&#x27;s the concept of equilibrium in price theory, but that only exists under conditions of <i>perfect competition</i> - zero exit&#x2F;entry costs, absolute market transparency, and fungibility of what&#x27;s traded. To parallel your firework example, that works quite well for commodities like oil or many ag products, but not for housing.<p>Check out this book, which provides a good explanation of why it is politically profitable to do things like privatizing public goods: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Dictator%27s_Handbook" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Dictator%27s_Handbook</a><p>Essentially, the authors&#x27; argument is that political power can easily be modeled as transactions in a political capital market where access to public goods is traded for political support (participatory or vote delivery blocs in rigged elections, or non-interference by military actors in more obvious dictatorships). The wiki article includes a link to their more rigorous academic exploration of the topic which is almost equally readable.')
