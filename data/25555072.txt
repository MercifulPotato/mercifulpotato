I really appreciate that it&#x27;s &quot;intermediate-level&quot;, and really focused on &quot;how do you build real software&quot;<p>Lexicon Valley &lt;- Incredible and well-presented linguistics topics w&#x2F; some idiosyncratic music choices thrown in<p>JS Party &lt;- from the same folks that make changelog. I honestly don&#x27;t listen to every episode after the change in format after the incredible Season 1, but I stay subscribed and listen when the topic grabs my attention.<p>Sinica &lt;- I came for the China content, but I stayed because these are the smartest conversations I hear about any topic anywhere.<p>Software Engineering Radio &lt;- I don&#x27;t listen to every episode, but it&#x27;s good when it&#x27;s good, mentioned by a few other commenters.<p>Stuff You Missed in History Class &lt;- well worth an archive binge, there&#x27;s a LOT of fascinating content deep inside.<p>This American Life &lt;- I still listen even though I don&#x27;t live in America anymore. :-)')
