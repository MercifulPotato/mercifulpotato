A quick google search for &quot;disguised encrypted chat app&quot; found one called CoverMe that can disguise itself as a photo album. There are probably more sophisticated options available now, and there will be an explosion of them if the EU bans encrypted chat apps.<p>With a <i>marginally</i> more sophisticated user, they can get far more hidden. The Android anti-theft app Cerberus, before the company behind it imploded spectacularly, could be installed as a system app on any rooted device, then hide itself until a user-specified code was entered on the phone dialer. If there isn&#x27;t already an encrypted chat app with that feature, there surely will be after an EU ban. The barrier to entry is not high.<p>I&#x27;ll grant it would likely result in a small number of gang members spending a greater percentage of their lives in jail, but that&#x27;s not a lot of benefit for an extremely high cost.')
