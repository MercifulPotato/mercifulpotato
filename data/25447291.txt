The name &quot;Rocky Linux&quot; sounds too homebrew and unprofessional. CentOS sounds Enterprise-ish. I find it hard to believe any corporate client would take it seriously.<p>That seems a pretty specious argument for not using a product.<p>Especially since the name was used to honor one of the founders of CentoS who is now dead.<p>That seems like a pretty good reason for a name to me.<p>What&#x27;s more, I&#x27;d be more concerned about <i>functionality</i> than a name.  But that&#x27;s just me.')
