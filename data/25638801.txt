Maybe <i></i>on paper<i></i> some of these ideas <i></i>seem<i></i> ok, but it really is either silly or humiliating or both.<p>EDIT: To clarify, I&#x27;m referring here to folks who are already employed at some firm, and that same firm is asking them to interview (again) for their existing job, or a new job that is almost identical to the legacy job...all within the same firm.')
