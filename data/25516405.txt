Or maybe not. How do I know?<p>Not reddit, but I bookmarked this example a few years ago. It is a very little thing, but very showing. Remember when T. was trying to negotiate some deal with North Korea? One of the things which came out of it was DPRK returning some remnants of U.S. soldiers from the Korean war back to the U.S.<p>I consider the New Yorker to be one of the best pieces of journalism which the U.S. has to offer (no irony here). Here are two articles from there: one is about that story, the remnants of soldiers coming back, another one is about Diet Coke. They were on the front page of their website on the same day, and I clicked both.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;news-desk&#x2F;waiting-for-a-box-of-bones-from-north-korea" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;news-desk&#x2F;waiting-for-a-box-o...</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;culture&#x2F;cultural-comment&#x2F;the-decline-and-fall-of-diet-coke-and-the-power-generation-that-loved-it" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;culture&#x2F;cultural-comment&#x2F;the-decli...</a><p>One of them mentions T, another one does not. Can you guess which one? Can you guess whether it is a &quot;positive&quot; mention?<p>So, now back to your question:<p>&gt; Maybe the reason you don&#x27;t see anything positive about T where you describe is because there isn&#x27;t a whole lot to say in that regard?<p>Maybe. Or maybe not. How do I know? I&#x27;m not from the U.S., but I guess that you are, so you tell me.<p>For now, I can tell you that I lost a lot of trust in the U.S. media, but maybe you can change my mind. I&#x27;m not a T. follower, so (according to you) there might be a possibility of a dialog.')
