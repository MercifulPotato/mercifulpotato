We have no (other?) proof of any cultural phenomenon older than maybe 50k years ago even existing, never mind being passed on. To imagine such a specific story surviving for such a huge amount of time while being disconnected from reality seems MUCH more unlikely than having similar stories arise independently about a hard to see but still visible star.<p>Also, Occam&#x27;s razor says nothing about which explanation is more likely to be correct. It is simply a sensible rule about which explanation is more useful to go with when you have two that explain the same facts equally well. It&#x27;s a pretty clear rule in physics when you have actual mathematical models to chose between, it&#x27;s much too hand-wavy in the soft sciences like anthropology.')
