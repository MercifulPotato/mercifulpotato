Along that line, voting in person should universally become optional with mail in&#x2F;drop off becoming the norm. I&#x27;d always had a valid reason for absentee voting when I had residency in my home state and it would take me atleast a day to properly research the down ballot candidates. I now live in a state with judges on the ballot and it took me an entire weekend to actually look through everyone that wasn&#x27;t in the federal races. Mandatory voting, especially without universal access to absentee voting, would just exacerbate the issue of people just voting based on name or party instead of stance when there are so many people on the ballot.')
