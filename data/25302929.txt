Which is only usable if your sensitive site is also using a custom, nowhere-else-deployed font. That doesn&#x27;t seem to be that painful security wise, compared to, say, telling websites which browser you&#x27;re running.<p>Regardless - I support less reliance on custom fonts and a slimmer web overall.')
