Maybe you give to a food pantry instead-- what about the people that use them for the free food but don&#x27;t really need it?<p>How do you define scammer? If a person is homeless, but holds up a gas can with a sign that says &quot;ran out of gas please help!&quot; then they&#x27;re lying about why they need the money, but they aren&#x27;t scamming in terms of not actually being homeless.<p>What about junkies too-- they still need to eat. Absent enough money to do both, they might choose just to get high, deteriorate more, have even less chance of recovery.<p>There&#x27;s no easy litmus test here. No easy way to ensure the money you give is going to be used in the best possible way to improve someone&#x27;s life.')
