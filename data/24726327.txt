LIDAR has a fixed range it is useful for, which is greatly shrunk when you also need to factor in vehicle response time. Cameras can see as far as humans can (further actually, as it can see things more reliably at greater distances than humans). Going beyond 25mph is already massively encroaching on the upper ranges of safety with LIDAR systems.')
