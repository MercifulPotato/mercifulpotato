Perhaps minuscule is an exaggeration, but it&#x27;s really darned small. I audit tech companies getting purchased for $2M to $1.5B, average prob $50-100M. We see very little PHP aside from say the company website. In the 50 I&#x27;ve done in the last two years, I&#x27;d say 3-4? And they were tiny shops. I haven&#x27;t seen anything with more than $5M in ARR built on PHP. The majority of successful mid-sized tech companies are still .Net and Java. After that, Ruby, Python, Node. (Although tons of Python in the ML space for them now, which seems to be the obligatory buzzword tech ...) Hardly any are using PHP in their real production apps. Yes, I know you can come up with a list of exceptions, but there are a metric tonne of tech companies out there and the majority are unglamorously making money out of the public eye on .Net or the JVM.<p>Note: I am not saying they <i>should</i> use C# and Java - just that they <i>do</i>. I was a Python dev for 15 years before doing this, and I was very surprised to see how dominant those still are in companies over 10 years old and over $10M in revenue. And the bigger the company, the more likely it is be on C# or Java. I think every one I&#x27;ve seen going for north of $100M was at at least mostly on them (i.e. they might have a few services in Go or Node or something too, or some model engine in a niche language). Once a company is into the land of bankers selling it to other bankers, a lot of decisions get made for &quot;safe&quot; reasons, like ease of hiring good developers, enterprise infrastructure support, well audited security, and so on. And from the perspective of the investment firms, that frankly makes a lot of sense. By the numbers, most successful tech companies are not particularly exciting places to work anymore.')
