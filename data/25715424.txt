However, we know it needs more work and some more killer features. In that sense it&#x27;s half-baked.<p>Lipee Keyboard ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=in.svayu.lipi" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=in.svayu.lipi</a> ) is a keyboard for Indic scripts and languages that uses gestures to speed up typing by 100%. I am also my own prime user, typing various texts (messages, social media, etc.) in Indic scripts, so I can also vouch of its utility myself.<p>A video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=UgW9V4YOHGQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=UgW9V4YOHGQ</a><p>The first novelty is that it solely focuses on people who do NOT read&#x2F;write English, but know their own mother tongue and script well. So, a native Kannada user (of Kannada script) or Bhojpuri person (of Devnagari script) are our prime targets.<p>The second novelty is that almost all Indic scripts add an extra line&#x2F;symbol next to consonants, called &quot;maatras&quot; to create sound out of a consonant. Each sound has a unique maatra, for any consonant. We use gestures to add such a maatra to all consonants, which speeds up the keyboard typing hugely.<p>We know we can add more features and killer technologies to make typing in Indic scripts very smooth and fast.<p>We need more tech talent and support to make this happen, and I hope to on-board a CXO or a senior free-lancer for rapid development.<p>Do up-vote if you like this project, and spread the word!<p>Thanks!')
