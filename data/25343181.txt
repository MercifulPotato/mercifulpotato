The trouble was that the initial cost projections called for 50+ flights per year, but demand only warranted 3.5 flights per year on average.<p>It&#x27;s a fate that <i>every</i> heavy orbital transport system shared so far - just look at the Falcon Heavy. How many launches did it have? Two (technically three, if you include the maiden flight)? That&#x27;s 1 flight per year with another two classified DoD payloads scheduled for next year.<p>There&#x27;s simply no demand for heavy lift vehicles outside of building space stations and DoD contracts. In the end STS was too big and expensive for just ferrying people into space and too complex for just getting payloads into LEO.<p>It could&#x27;ve made up for that by always doing both, but there simply wasn&#x27;t a destination in LEO for people to go to and not enough 27.5t LEO payloads (~10t GTO).<p>For instance in 1985 there were only 25 orbital launches in total, 9(!!!) of which Space Shuttle launches and 6 other US rocket launches. Nowhere near the envisioned weekly or even just fortnightly launch cadence required to get the cost down.')
