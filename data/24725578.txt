Are you the one seriously arguing that it&#x27;s illegal to lie on Twitter? Or to lie a newspaper? \nOf course faking a document is perfectly legal as long as it&#x27;s not used for fraud. Tricking people on Twitter or at a newspaper isn&#x27;t fraud unless they&#x27;re contractually paying you for authentic documents and you deceive them for monetary gain.<p>Is this really that hard? The Onion fakes documents all the time and claims to have quotes from police officers and government officials on a daily basis.<p>Free speech is the most essential of all freedoms, and you&#x27;d trade it away for a song and a dance out of sheer ignorance.')
