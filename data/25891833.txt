Imagine if Rust had shipped without String&#x2F;str and they were added after the fact, would Rust manage to avoid splitting the ecosystem? That&#x27;s an open question as far as I&#x27;m concerned.<p>And I also hope that we never find out. Rust&#x27;s fundamentals have proven to be very solid so far. Having things like OsStrings (something missing from most programming languages, including Python 3 AFAIK) shows a great amount of foresight and understanding of the problem space. Contrast that with Go which seems very intent on completely ignoring 30 years of programming language evolution.')
