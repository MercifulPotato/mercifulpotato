You can&#x27;t simply wave the problem away by stating the state can take all they want.  Many democratic states would be hesitant to do that and it would have far more grave long term consequences.  If agriculture was more diverse, perhaps that wouldn&#x27;t be a concern.  The problem is the lack of diversity creates the potential to concentrate power over the food supply under the current model, never mind one with strong IP rights.')
