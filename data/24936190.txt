They did indeed never send the money to the company but we know from the senate report that CEFC did indeed send 5 million directly to Hunter. And official documents showing no role for joe biden is expected as this looks really bad for him. We know from Hunter Biden&#x27;s email that his share was being held by his family members. Again Hunter Biden wrote that not Tony.')
