I suddenly had total control over them because they couldn&#x27;t control me. My ability to ignore them and to not respond to them in kind was a new kind of power. They couldn&#x27;t get what they wanted, so they eventually found new people to mess with.<p>When we lash out at people, when we &quot;whip up a Twitter frenzy&quot;, that is not resilience or strength. That is being blown around by whatever wind happens to be hitting you at the time. When your self-worth or mental state can be disrupted by someone who said something that offends you, then you will perpetually be the victim and the only way you &quot;win&quot; is when others do exactly like you want them to do whenever you are around. That&#x27;s not strengthâ€”that&#x27;s manipulation.')
