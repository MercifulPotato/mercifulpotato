Like running shell script, or connecting to servers.<p>Since we swapped to SAM, we no longer get breaking changes from minor patches... Features are available almost instantly, and we can easily modularize and deploy in parallel (we often do 30+ simultaneous deploys without issue).<p>I still don&#x27;t claim TF out Ansible are useless, just that they are fixing a problem I don&#x27;t have... I&#x27;m not multi-cloud.. and all the BS that was sold about these tools being easily transitioned from one cloud to another is junk. You can&#x27;t just pick up lambda, change 3 lines, and it drops into azure.')
