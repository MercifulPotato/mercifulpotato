Item(by='greenyoda', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603669699, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24890927, text='&gt; I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see established companies expand on cheap real estate and start offering closed offices to employees.<p>As much as I like closed offices, I think that companies that want to save money still won&#x27;t offer them. The cost of closed offices isn&#x27;t just more square footage; they also incur construction costs that open office space don&#x27;t: walls, doors, their own heating&#x2F;cooling&#x2F;ventilation ducts, their own lighting and electrical wiring, etc. And an office layout with closed offices is more expensive to modify.')
