Let&#x27;s say that Google&#x27;s tools say that 10% of people who saw the ad converted. That&#x27;s incredible! But considering that they were already on your mailing list, maybe they were going to buy anyways - or maybe your TV ad is actually what convinced them to buy.<p>You test for this by creating a holdout group from that 100k. Let&#x27;s say 5k people. These are people that could have seen your ad, but we&#x27;re intentionally not going to show it to them. We&#x27;ll still use the conversion pixel&#x27;s measurement functionality on them, and we see that 8% of those 5k people buy your product.<p>Now, we have a clearer picture - the Google ads drive 2% more conversions for your audience - or people on your mailing list who see an ad on Google are 25% more likely to convert than those who don&#x27;t.')
