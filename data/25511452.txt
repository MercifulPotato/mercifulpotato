But the debate over the appointment of ACB struck me as a great example of why I find aspects of the Democratic platform to be objectionable. ACB is, in the tradition of Scalia, an originalist justice. She is not perfect, but her commitment is to interpret the constitution as it was understood when it was written, not as she wishes it to be understood today.<p>&gt; The principle objection to this appointment was that she might overturn Roe v Wade or the ACA... even if an originalist interpretation of the constitution might (but not necessarily would) show that the ACA is unconstitutional. It seemed like an indefensible position to be saying &quot;we don&#x27;t like her because she tries really hard to interpret the constitution correctly&quot;.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure if that was the &quot;principle objection.&quot;  Maybe in normal times it would have been, but in these times her confirmation was egregiously hypocritical given the treatment Merrick Garland got (and the <i>stated reasons</i> for that treatment).<p>It&#x27;s also a stretch that originalists interpret the Constitution &quot;correctly&quot; (and therefore others interpret it &quot;incorrectly&quot;), given there&#x27;s <i>no prescribed interpretive framework</i>.  The label &quot;originalist&quot; may be considered a clever bit of propaganda, because even Scalia, who did the most to define that view, would interpret it as he &quot;wish[ed] it to be understood today&quot; when it suited him (IIRC, he was called out on this in a dissent by one of the other justices in a gun rights case).  This idea of judicial originalism also breaks down in light of the fact that you arguably can&#x27;t apply &quot;the constitution as it was understood when it was written&quot; to <i>things</i> that were not understood when it was written.<p>In a novel situation, a judge is going to have to break new ground just to do his job, and that will be labeled &quot;legislating from the bench&quot; or not depending on if the commenter agrees with the decision or not.')
