I have a disdain for people walking down the street with their phone in an outstretched hand, having inane hour long conversations while virtual bunny ears, cat whiskers or horse heads adorn their faces. Not everyone wants to put on a performance every time they speak to you. Sometimes I just want to call and say hello without having to think about whether the shirt I&#x27;m wearing is cool.')
