In fact I have many systems running it :) Raspberries but also a Pinebook. I&#x27;m also getting an M1 mini from work.<p>I just don&#x27;t like the almost-religious overhyping of everything Apple. They&#x27;re doing a great job. They&#x27;re not perfect.<p>For example: Moorhead makes a good point IMO. Yes he&#x27;s talking about software issues. But in the case of Apple, you can&#x27;t separate those two. The OS doesn&#x27;t work on other hardware and (in this case) the hardware doesn&#x27;t work with other OSes. This works to their (huge) advantage in some cases, being able to optimise each component perfectly. But it can be a drawback too like it is here.')
