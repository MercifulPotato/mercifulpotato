For instance if you like heated seats, you can pay a fee and have them unlocked for a year. Or a radar-based cruise control, or satellite radio, or sport driving modes - everything will have its own price.<p>Their argument is that in US, something like 90% of all new BMWs are leased - so it&#x27;s &quot;great&quot; for customers and for businesses, since you can now lease a BMW for your employee very cheaply in the most &quot;basic&quot; spec, and if they want some extra features they can pay for them themselves.<p>Obviously, it&#x27;s horseshit. But that&#x27;s the argument they are using.')
