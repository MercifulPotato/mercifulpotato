Do you have to repeat the experiment if his phone number changes? Indeed, we assume that this is not an &quot;experimental condition&quot; to take into account. There is no way to determine this a-priori, and one could conceive of a universe with an arbitrary amount of such strange influences. But we do not appear to live in such a universe, which is why we get to apply Occam&#x27;s Razor.')
