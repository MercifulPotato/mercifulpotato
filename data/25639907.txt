It&#x27;s a loaded term that has all sorts of negative connotation. New decade, new world of tech, new term for collectivized labor. I will admit, the police union problem is a hard counter. It&#x27;s a solvable problem though, I think.<p>Maybe we should bring &quot;guild&quot; back into fashion.')
