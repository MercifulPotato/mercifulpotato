No mention of what led to the arrest, but it seems to be a stop and frisk type of encounter.<p>The other is the guy who allegedly had a wagon of molotov&#x27;s, and was also carrying some type of firearm.<p>Neither seem to be incidents of the people being in the act of using the weapons. Although if the guy had actual molotovs, yeah that&#x27;s not good.')
