It was always slightly wrong each time, even after it was fixed. I think it&#x27;s better now, but I never considered doing it myself as an established team member.<p>Though I once inherited a large enterprise code base that I had to study and build a dev environment for pretty much all by myself. I had maybe 2 calls with the original team and a couple of emails but was mostly by myself just figuring it out. It was a pretty incredible experience and taught me a tonne about how the system worked and was put together. This helped immensely when we spun up a team to work on it. So, I get where this article is coming from due to that experience, but didn&#x27;t think to do this kind of stuff on purpose.')
