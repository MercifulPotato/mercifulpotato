And that $1500 didn&#x27;t even get you a keyboard; if you wanted one of those it was an extra $150 or something.<p>- Very poor support for x86 software by Microsoft.<p>There was little convincing reason to buy one over an Intel equivalent. Realistic starting price was $1650 for something that was slower than Intel laptops for ARM software, was essentially unusable for x86 software, didn&#x27;t have significant battery life advantages, and wasn&#x27;t in a normal laptop form factor.<p>&gt; Thus the real question is, though there are ARM laptops since mid-2010s why is Apple taking once again credit for making a &quot;revolution&quot;?<p>The usual. Apple took a thing that people had previously done, badly, and did it well. That is more or less Apple&#x27;s thing; they rarely invent truly new markets, but they do take existing but irrelevant markets and make them relevant.')
