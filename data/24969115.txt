Item(by='counterpoint1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604331011, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24967771, text='I disagree with your claim that Biden and Clinton are &quot;well to the right of the median US citizen&quot;. They are clearly to the left in literally every assessment - whether in the actual elections or polling done by any reputable organization. You&#x27;re imagining that &quot;median US citizen&quot; is somehow far left of &quot;median US voter&quot; and that&#x27;s just not true.<p>Additionally, everything you listed is just exposition on your initial claim. Saying that you will &quot;End Welfare As We Know It&quot; sounds like a potentially wildly liberal plan - perhaps UBI, government-guaranteed employment, housing and healthcare or some other fundamental shift. The victims of crime are disproportionately the poor, people of color and people who are structurally disadvantaged so removing the threat of violent crime from their lives falls well within the standard goals of liberals (even if the actual implementation of the bill you&#x27;re referencing had more mixed results).')
