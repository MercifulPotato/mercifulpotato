All companies have a political agenda one way or the other, even if it&#x27;s just driven by profit.<p>As a thought experiment: imagine if Twitter did the same thing as Coinbase did, got rid of all the politicized people.

It&#x27;s been instrumental to Bolsonaro&#x27;s election due to the astroturfing and dissemination of fake news by pro-Bolsonaro supporters. Do you think it&#x27;s due to Facebook&#x27;s employee being pro-Bolsonaro? Or Facebook itself espousing a pro-Bolsonaro stance? Of course not.<p>It&#x27;s really missing the forest for the trees IMO.')
