I was looking to deploy an app and the choice is either Heroku or manage your own server which I don&#x27;t want to do.<p>Heroku gives instant deployment for the most common types of apps (python&#x2F;java&#x2F;ruby). It&#x27;s PaaS done right, it&#x27;s fantastic. You should really have a look if you&#x27;re not aware of it, it&#x27;s only $7 for a starter app.<p>Problem is, scaling up is about $50 per gigabyte of memory which makes it a dead end for anything non trivial. You&#x27;re forced to go to digital ocean &#x2F; Linode &#x2F; OVH instead to have something affordable.<p>That leaves Digital Ocean as the only alternative (don&#x27;t trust Linode) and it sucks because it only gives me a server to manage. I don&#x27;t want to manage a server I want to run a (python) application. It&#x27;s 2020 this sort of things should auto deploy from GitHub without bothering me to manage an operating system.')
