Check out the wealth gini here [0] to see that Germany and the US are much higher and China is more comparable with France.<p>&gt; If your theory of is based on China having less wealth inequality than the US, you really should also look at countries with much less wealth inequality than either.<p>Also to be clear, my &quot;theory&quot; is <i>not</i> based on China having less wealth inequality. My &quot;theory&quot; is that the people making large capital allocation decisions in China are typically smarter.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_wealth_equality" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_wealth_eq...</a>')
