Something like in the 1980s a Media Lab teacher gives the class a computer vision assignment where they&#x27;re supposed to be able to tell whether or not an image contains a bird, and 40 years later they&#x27;re still working on it? Lobe.ai reminds me of trying to identify plants with Google Goggles 10(ish?) years ago. It didn&#x27;t work very well then, and then Google killed Goggles. Side note: none of the &quot;click on the leaf feature&quot; web-based plant identifiers gave a satisfactory answer either.')
