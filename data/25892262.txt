I don&#x27;t know why some don&#x27;t see that. But no one is paying bankers trillions just because of our legacy.<p>I agree the uk and London are high cost. For the uk that won&#x27;t change. For London, it&#x27;s high cost and high wage. Maybe when the wages disappear the costs will fall. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what people want. At least not what they claim to want.')
