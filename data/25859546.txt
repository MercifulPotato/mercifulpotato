Macroeconomists understand that people should keep savings in assets that are tied to real production, not just fiat. It&#x27;s important to make currencies not too attractive as a savings vehicle. A stable currency is very useful as an exchange and negotiation medium so we want to have it, but it being used too much as a savings medium is dangerous to the aggregate economy.<p>It gets problematic when people&#x27;s savings are too tied to promises&#x2F;tokens&#x2F;ious. I mean, if everyone owes everyone else their savings, on the aggregate, does anyone really have any savings?<p>Things like gold remain sufficiently unattractive to not interfere with production markets because it is volatile and cyclical (Price of gold is highest when the average person is buying it and lowest when it is selling) usually making it a poor investment. Hopefully, cryptocoins remain that way too.')
