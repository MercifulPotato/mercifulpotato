Since then some really interesting people have come and gone, most notably of course BK finally got pushed out the door. By the point he was gone though they were truly neck deep in the mud. Having failed to get a CEO who would actually take the company on they now have Bob Swan (former CFO) which gets any Intel employees&#x27; heads twitching since the HR department spent the last decade telling anyone who would listen that BK was in charge because Intel is a manufacturing company.<p>Intel have now burned an enormous amount of capital through failed acquisitions (Mccafee, Altera, Nervana etc) - mainly because their attitude was &quot;Oh we can do that too, and that&#x27;s a really big market&quot;. They can&#x27;t make FPGAs better than an FPGA company, they can&#x27;t make security software better than a software company, they can&#x27;t make AI chips better than a company that <i>does AI</i>.<p>What would make them successful again is to focus on their core business (a business they departed because the growth wasn&#x27;t there). So that means spinning out fab (which let&#x27;s be fair, will probably die), spinning out Networking, I was going to say spinning out FPGA but I just went and looked up the head of that group and he works at AMD now (unlucky for AMD). Spin out the data centre group. Spin out the IOTG group - who can then operate on reasonable scales rather than refusing to work on anything smaller than 100 million units. Spin out MobilEye (they fucked up the BMW project that got them acquired in the first place). Then what you&#x27;re left with in Intel proper is just Martin from HR, and he was useless anyway.')
