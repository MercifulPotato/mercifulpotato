It&#x27;s been covered in so many outlets, gotten positive PR, and just looks great for KFC. Can&#x27;t have cost more than $100k to get the casemod built and the marketing executed. Excellent move coming from a fried chicken company.<p>Secondly: there is actually a really clever bit of engineering here. There&#x27;s a grill on top (!). This is using the heat generated by the machine. So the cooling here is basically a heatpipe used to grill chicken. I&#x27;ve never seen heat being used in such a way in a console. I think it&#x27;s really creative and shows good UX thinking (at least within the constraints).<p>I wonder if there are interesting ways the heat from a CPU or GPU could be used. Maybe to power fans? It reminds me of how scooters charge up their batteries by having the wheels spin. What other applications could there be?')
