Item(by='gambiting', descendants=None, kids=[25623246], score=None, time=1609693181, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25622752, text='&gt;&gt;Whats the total cost of parts for installing a socket, even with electronics, £50-£100?<p>According to the latest version of the electrical regulations, any external socket used for charging a car(and that includes regular domestic 3-pin sockets) has to have earth independant of the supply earth. Meaning that a separate earth stake has to be installed for each socket. I&#x27;ve gotten several quotes to do this recently and they all came back at around £400-500 mark. But even ignoring that, you are completely off the mark when it comes to parts, proper external armoured sockets and cables cost a lot more than &quot;£50-100&quot;. That&#x27;s dumb sockets that don&#x27;t do anything. Commercial charging points that provide just regular 13amp charging without anything fancy go for multiple thousands of pounds, but you think a £50 socket would do? Have you considered why it might not? If you want to do it on the entire street then multiply that number + add the costs of digging up the street which can be a small fortune(ask OpenReach how much they charge per metre of groundworks, it&#x27;s not uncommon to get bills for £100k for a 50ft of cable laid in ground).<p>&gt;&gt; It costs a fortune and you seem to totally ignore.<p>Uhm, I don&#x27;t, but I just don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s relevant. I&#x27;m also not saying that we should continue using petrol. Just that building this infrastructure in our cities is going to be incredibly expensive, and our councils already struggle so much to provide <i>any</i> support to our streets and roads. But somehow there are people who believe that by 2030 councils will magically pull the money out of their backsides and build it. I just don&#x27;t believe that will happen.')
