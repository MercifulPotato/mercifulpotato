If you want to consume less stuff on your phone, you can reduce the consumption without replacing it with anything - you don&#x27;t have a phone time quota that you need to meet on any given day, just cut down on the things you don&#x27;t like.<p>When you&#x27;re creating anything, it makes sense to do it in the best possible environment that you have for it - I would rather write code on a laptop instead of using a phone and I would pick a desktop computer over the laptop. Phones are rarely the best environment for any creative task apart from maybe pictures, videos, vlogs and other social media stuff (if we can put those in the creative category).')
