One thing I think that complicates matters is companies and teams that adopt SOME engineering principles but not others. When the chips are down I find that QA and Writing tests go out the window to a certain extent in favor of &quot;just get it done&quot;. That&#x27;s not something I imagine happens in &quot;real world&quot; engineering especially when lives and safety are at stake.<p>The other piece of this is that often I think Engineers are planners and not doers. They make the spec, do the match to figure out the tolerances, etc. Then some other people build the bridge or machine the part or whatever.<p>In software &quot;engineers&quot; are both planners and builders which seems like a weird mismatch of skills. The people who are better at building than planning get labelled hackers, the people who are better at planning and testing and verifying are labelled engineers.<p>Fun fact: In Canada you cannot call yourself an engineer unless you actually complete an engineering program and join the brotherhood of engineers or something. They have promise rings and a secret handshake.')
