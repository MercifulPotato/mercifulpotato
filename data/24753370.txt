That really puts things in perspective. I don&#x27;t think you could make the major leagues pitching in the low 80s today. By comparison, the starting velocity for the Rays rotation is in 96 mph. Most bullpens now throw out pitcher after pitcher that can touch 95+. It really makes you wonder if most of the currently players would be considered all time greats if they played in the 50s.')
