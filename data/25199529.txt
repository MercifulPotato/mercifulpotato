Item(by='cogman10', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606233217, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25195048, text='Sort of &quot;You know it when you see it&quot; situation.<p>I can come up with examples of unethical production, I doubt I could come up with a solid definition of unethical which covers all definitions of an unethically produced good.<p>For now, it&#x27;s easy enough to say &quot;Goods produced by slave and child labor&quot;.  From there, I think it is healthy to expand the law and regulations to capture missed or current unethical production practices.  For example, production which produces a lot of CO2.  Or production which pollutes the local environment.  You could even go so far as saying &quot;production where anyone in a company is making more than 10x anyone else&quot;.<p>Some may disagree with my examples of what are unethical.  Which is fine.  I think there are sections, though, that nobody should disagree with (and if you do, you&#x27;re a monster).')
