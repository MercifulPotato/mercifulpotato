I believe the question, or their answers are poorly parsed.<p>I presume a lot of the dread is really about Rails. And the rest partly hearsay of the slow performance of Ruby.<p>Rails is, to me, a blessing, but also a terrible framework. It helps to rapidly ship products. Just cobble some gems together in a controller or two, mix a gem or three into your models and you have a demo. A rapid Proof of Concept. But also a product that is practically unmaintainable. I&#x27;ve been doing Rails from its very beginning, solving this (trying to) has been my primary job for over seven years now.<p>And performance? Yes Ruby is slow. But the speed of the language is unmeasurable in, I daresay, the vast majority of the projects of people who tell you it is too slow.<p>That legacy mysql setup, this poorly evolved domain model, or that badly integrated external API is almost always the thing making it slow. The ms of Ruby handling that JSON to CSV conversion then is practically unmeasurable.<p>Rust is not going to speed up those 3000ms spend in that ugly SQL query. Go&#x27;s multithreading is not going to solve the slow API which you call thrice per minute. And Java is not magically making the tangle of classes, jobs, callbacks, listeners and whatnot dissapear.')
