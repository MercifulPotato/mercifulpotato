This money gives political parties some freedom to act, to nourish the political debate... seen as a way to straighten the political debate and the democracy ; good for the general interest.<p>Still the number of members of a given political movement and the share of people voting for it is giving it the real power. And as someone only forced to give (indirectly) some money to a given movement is then entirely different than being force to join such a movement. And that is the same here for union.<p>Please note that as a worker, you are forced to &quot;pay&quot; for the stockholder. If you are not happy with it you can pick another oragnisation. Same goes for union, you are always free to join a union free company...')
