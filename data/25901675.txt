They are african-american, created in the US (and for specific historical circumstances, including food price concerns, and local food availability).<p>As for &quot;jerk chicken&quot; that&#x27;s just an imported popular dish. Carribeans do eat it, but you aren&#x27;t carribean for eating it any more than you&#x27;re Mexican for eating mexican..')
