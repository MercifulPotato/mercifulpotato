But their life no longer resembles reality for many American middle-class families.<p>I believe it&#x27;s because those shows are still made for the same people, those who were kids in the early 90&#x27;s. So show makers don&#x27;t adapt them to the modern world, they let their viewers enjoy snapshots of their past, it&#x27;s an anchor in their modern world.<p>For context: When I was a kid, I lived in a western european country where the Simpsons were clearly a kid &#x2F;teen thing.')
