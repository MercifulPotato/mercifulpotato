Some company owning all the machines and then uber-ing out the hard work of siting them and restocking them. Gamifying the process of monitoring, &quot;your fleet&quot;, the &quot;ching&quot; on your phone when someone buys a bottle of water or candy bar. Special deals for site owners. Branded supplies.
