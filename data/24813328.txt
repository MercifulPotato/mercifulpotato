I think most people would. I think the governments should take the same approach.<p>And yes, sure, most of the time it&#x27;s super hard to decide what to do, but for this virus, we know all you have to do it isolate from each other for a few months. It&#x27;s not even that hard.<p>---<p>As a side note I can&#x27;t wait till somebody uses that 10m figure and applies it to deaths as a result of obesity. You think social isolation is hard, you should try giving up sugar, now that is hard!')
