Also, I’m not discounting the opportunity for shared bonding over something that at least one of us enjoys though.  Is this category of recommendation a symptom of having a weak theory of mind? I don’t know).\n  * Loyalty (they’ll recommend products by friends&#x2F;associates&#x2F;compatriots, irrespective of quality).\n  * Financial kickbacks&#x2F;business connections.  (Still can be useful).\n  * Pyramid schemes (almost no experience with this, thankfully. I guess the same as #4 but also creepier).</code></pre>')
