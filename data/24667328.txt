Or when big news is about to be released.<p>But as much as people were unable to sell, there are nearly as many situations where being unable to sell is a good thing.<p>I guess we’re eventually going to argue for 24&#x2F;7 stock exchanges and for some reason very few are.<p>My own experience in Canada is that a lot of big Canadian stocks also trade in NY, and when one market is closed and the other isn’t because of different holidays, not a lot happens.<p>I guess an unexpected crash is different, but my guess is that everyone takes the day off, avoids releasing any big news out of respect for the situation and gets back to it tomorrow.')
