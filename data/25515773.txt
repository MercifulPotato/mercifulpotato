On linux I can&#x27;t install and run a program without giving it access to my network and write access to all of my data. For the average person, the whole point of a computer is to be able to run software that usually interacts with things (data on disks) and people (over the network).<p>My mum doesn&#x27;t want to be able to brick her computer by pressing the wrong sequence of keys &#x2F; buttons in the control panel. And she doesn&#x27;t want a malicious program to be able to use her credentials to encrypt and ransom all her company&#x27;s data. <i>Removing</i> features from my mum&#x27;s computer makes it a better device for her. And sometimes a better device for me - I trust my iphone to safely run 3rd party software more than I trust my linux desktop.<p>Apple&#x27;s philosophy - while very different from what <i>I</i> want in a computer - is absolutely oriented toward a sensible, well thought out vision of computing. I think us hackers do a disservice by dismissing the use case.')
