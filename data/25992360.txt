Even before the pandemic, many criminal cases were taking 18 months to get to a jury trial in my area. Speedy trial my ass!<p>The issue I&#x27;m dealing with is just a summary offense. It would have been cheaper just to pay the $50 fine and avoid going to court. Unfortunately the trooper wrote it up wrong so we were forced to go to court, which costs way more ($300 fine + $100 court costs, not to mention time off, lost wages, certified postage, and mileage). It&#x27;s pretty much the definition of a racket if costs more to defend your innocence than to just pay the fine. That&#x27;s all they care about - the money.')
