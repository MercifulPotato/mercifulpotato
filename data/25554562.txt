Item(by='robocat', descendants=None, kids=[25554646], score=None, time=1609105855, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25554393, text='My original point is “The problem is there is no better” is a defeatist attitude: there is a lot better.<p>Every other country in the world manages to model their own policies by using other countries of smaller or larger size, that have wildly different societies and governance.<p>Each state government in the United States holds legal and administrative jurisdiction within its bounds, yet somehow US states are special, and other countries have nothing worthwhile copying.<p>Almost every time someone says that other countries manage to do something better, the same tired canards are brought out in attack, usually with the undercurrent of “USA #1”, therefore any other way of doing things is wrong or inapplicable.<p>I don’t normally argue the point, because the counter-arguments like yours are so predictable and so spectacularly irrelevant.<p>You mentioned Covid. Watching the arc of excuses made by citizens of the US has been a black comedy: it started with excuses about how China managed to control Covid, it moved on to different excuses when some other Asian countries managed low death counts, then the excuses changed again once some first world countries got their shit together. The underlying premise was “USA #1” therefore if another country is doing better then let’s pipe up with a irrelevant excuse meme. The pattern is tragically hilarious.')
