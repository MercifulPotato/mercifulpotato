The privatization of law enforcement through DMCA takedown orders does not extend to alleged circumvention tools; it includes only copyrighted material that is allegedly &#x27;pirated.&#x27;\n    The RIAA is engaging in an abuse of process that Microsoft has no obligation to cooperate with. The fact that Microsoft didn&#x27;t tell the RIAA to go Disney themselves means that 100% of the blame lies at Microsoft&#x27;s feet. No exceptions.\n\n    . .\n\n    That said, the youtube-dl maintainers should file a bar association complaint against the RIAA lawyer(s) who wrote the DMCA takedown. Filing invalid motions is an ethical violation that should result in sanctions.</code></pre>')
