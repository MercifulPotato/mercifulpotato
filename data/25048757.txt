I ended up working on TURN, WebRTC and DTLS and feel I made the right choice. The impact vs time spent was worth it. I don&#x27;t think there is any other language I would have had a better experience. Either it is too niche, or it is so popular that the community is anemic.<p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pion&#x2F;dtls" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pion&#x2F;dtls</a><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pion&#x2F;webrtc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pion&#x2F;webrtc</a><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pion&#x2F;turn" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pion&#x2F;turn</a><p>Go is really great as a &#x27;teaching language&#x27;. I have seen lots of software pop up that was inspired by reading the Pion code. I think that is great, it is much harder to read and learn from other languages. Also really great for contributions. I get so many people making their first Open Source commit. The languages simplicitly really makes it easy.<p>The most frustrating thing about Go isn&#x27;t even the language, it is the community for me. It is very business&#x2F;corporate focused. Everything is all about Kubernetes&#x2F;cloud. I apply for conferences&#x2F;meetups non-stop, but never have any luck. It is always the same company reps. I am envious of the Rust community here, but maybe grass is always greener on the other side?')
