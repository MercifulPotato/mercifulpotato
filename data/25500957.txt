I have Nikon gear due to a chance decision back in the film days after my Pentax K-1000 was stolen and I replaced it with a Nikon FE. With product lock-in, I&#x27;m still a Nikon user, although both dSLR bodies I have are a decade old.<p>Outside of macro and wildlife photography (basically, extreme closeup and extreme telephoto), I tend to use my phone more than my dSLRs. It&#x27;s smaller, more convenient, and the pictures it takes are 70-80% as good as I&#x27;d get on my heavier gear. Well, there&#x27;s also an annual parade I shoot where I want to be able to control depth of field and trigger some strobes, and I use the dSLRs for that too.<p>I&#x27;ve been eying a body upgrade, but I can&#x27;t really justify it. Having one crop sensor body and one full frame, I&#x27;d rather spend the money on new, fancy lenses. And the computer-designed lenses really are incredible. I have an 28-300 lens with vibration reduction that is frighteningly good for the range it covers. It has some distortion, but nothing that&#x27;s not easily corrected in production. And it&#x27;s very nearly as sharp as some of my pre-autofocus primes.<p>It seems one of the problems that Nikon (and the other manufacturers are facing) is that the quality of camera gear is just incredibly high across the board. I could spend a few grand to get a body with an extra stop or two, and a bunch more pixels. But I can hand-hold a modern vibration-compensating lens at 400mm down to somewhere around 1&#x2F;100th of a second and get good results. I don&#x27;t print large, so I don&#x27;t need more pixels. Why spend the money?')
