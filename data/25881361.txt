It&#x27;s not like miners demand electricity to be from fossil fuels. The electricity gets paid for, how you use it is up to you.<p>If Bitcoin would run 100% on solar power I guess then it would be fine? Or maybe you&#x27;re unhappy with Bitcoin because of its goal and not the means it gets there? That would be different discussion.<p>It feels like people want to argue against Bitcoin, don&#x27;t have credible arguments, and bring out the climate card.<p>Climate is going to shit, but not because of Bitcoin.')
