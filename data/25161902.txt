There is a simple and wrong idea that they can just break off Youtube, Android, and the search engine. Except \nthat has as much logical coherence as saying Walmart should not be allowed to own their own pharmacies because they have too much dominance in groceries. None at all.<p>They only have angry old confused vested interests trying to protect their fiefdoms and no plan. It is a replay of the &quot;Repeal and Replace!&quot; bullcrap where after going on propagandizing for years prove they never had a goddamn plan and never tried. Mark my words - these techlash morons will be the dog who caught the car if they actually got what they think they wanted. Yet again like with the link tax where they complain about free advertising and then are outraged when nobody decides to link to them.<p>At this point I just wish all of those morons going on about antitrust would shut the fuck up because they know nothing but useless demagoguery and making things worse.')
