You can solve any problem you like with it.<p>Maybe my comment was somehow badly written, because you (and \n the only other reply from chriswarbo) clearly misunderstood me.<p>I know that recursion is equivalent to iteration^^<p>My point was that some problems fit the one or the other better.<p>Look at fft for example.
