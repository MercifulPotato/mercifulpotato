Some of those have reasonably low power consumption under load, but they&#x27;re all bad at idle compared to client&#x2F;consumer SSDs. But now you also have me wondering about Intel&#x27;s Optane cache SSD modules, which like enterprise SSDs don&#x27;t have any volatile caching, and they&#x27;re also cheap enough to make some sense in an RPi context. I&#x27;m tempted to do some voltage margin testing on one to see where it browns out compared to a typical consumer SSD.')
