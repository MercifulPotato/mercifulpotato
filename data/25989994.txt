Get away from the infrastructure as a whole so you can focus on code, and let the cloud providers wave their magic wand to enable scaling?<p>Clearly there are limits even with the largest cloud providers. You&#x27;ll have to engage a bit of critical thought in to whether you&#x27;re going to get near those limits and what that might mean for your product.
