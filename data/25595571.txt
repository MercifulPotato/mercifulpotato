Item(by='dolni', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609439834, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25595039, text='&gt; There&#x27;s a massive gulf between revenge killing and boys fidgeting.<p>I mean... no shit? The point wasn&#x27;t to compare revenge killing to fidgeting. The point was to illustrate that impulse control is necessary for a civilized society to function.<p>&gt; Development is different than adulthood. Your argument is like saying breast feeding a child is crippling it&#x27;s ability to integrate into society later in life.<p>It&#x27;s frankly insulting that you would take the stupidest possible interpretation of my argument, make a counterargument, and claim slam dunk.<p>How do you think it is that kids become adults? Do you just let kids run wild, controlling none of their impulses, and then they turn 18 and suddenly they&#x27;re in full control of themselves? That&#x27;s absolutely laughable.<p>It&#x27;s development for a reason: you&#x27;re _developing_ the kids. They are going to be at a lower level of ability than an adult with regards to impulse control. That&#x27;s why you start to teach them. Babies can&#x27;t chew hard food. It&#x27;s impossible. So you don&#x27;t give them hard food. It&#x27;s _NOT_ impossible to teach a kid to control some of their undesirable impulses.<p>&gt; I haven&#x27;t seen any compelling evidence that you can train impulsiveness out of a child. You have a lot more faith in public schools than I do if you think language arts workbooks have that effect.<p>Uh... wat? No, you can&#x27;t train _all_ impulsiveness out of anybody. But you can absolutely train people to recognize and mitigate negative impulses.<p>Almost the very first skill any kid learns is to control the impulse of blurting out when they want to speak in a classroom. They are taught that they should raise their hand and wait to be called on. And lots of parents have to teach their kids that they can&#x27;t hit other kids.')
