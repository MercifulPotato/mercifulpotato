The dashboard was &quot;lit up like a Christmas tree&quot;. (Does not including normal wear items like brakes, battery, filters)<p>Mechanical failures - Water pump, air condition compressor, loose seat bushings<p>Sensor failures (Possibly all from the same sensor supplier) -  fuel level sensor (!), all oxygen sensors ($$$), passenger seat airbag sensor (!), air mass-flow sensor, engine air intake sensor, rear ABS brake sensors, coolant temperature sensor, cam position sensor<p>These are known problems and fixes documented on car forums, thus home garage repair was possible for everything except the AC. The price of parts and sensors is high (compared to   Honda).')
