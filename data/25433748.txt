It seems likely that is primarily for the same reason that e.g. a tech company with a bad policy is more incentivized to fix it if it happens to stub the toe of anyone with an audience.<p>That&#x27;s exactly what I see as problematic with it. When the only way to get google to fix something is by having an audience, that&#x27;s really bad. When the only way to get society to fix something is by having an audience, that&#x27;s really bad too.<p>There&#x27;s an analogy to product reviewers. If the chef gives something different to the reviewer than they give to everyone else, the review isn&#x27;t useful or is even misleading. When something happens to reviewers or journalists, it makes front page headlines. Until then, it just happens more quietly, which is dangerous. I&#x27;m just tired of the media not making a stink about important things until it happens to them, then suddenly this things is Import and and it Must Change Now.<p>&gt; The other parallel I think folks are drawing is that abuses of journalists in particular is a common feature of dictatorships.<p>Totally agreed. I don&#x27;t think we should withdraw protections from journalists. We need everyone to get the protection to see what&#x27;s happening with their own eyes, talk about it, and post about it.')
