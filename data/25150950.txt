Desktop machines with much faster processors would choke due to bandwidth limitations, but Apple can custom tune every aspect of the iPad architecture and aren&#x27;t limited to standard, generic interfaces between components.<p>The original 5k iMacs were a similar case in some ways. It was only possible in an all-in-one design, because there wasn&#x27;t a standard video connection at the time that was capable of the throughput.')
