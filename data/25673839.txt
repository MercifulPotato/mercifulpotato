All the years of messier boring day to day policies won&#x27;t be mentioned, just the summary single word conservative, &quot;advocated conservative policies&quot; etc.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have the same effect.<p>So you end up with a little blurb that says his name and the list of offices he held and that he was famous for declining to participate in a coup attempt.<p>I think I could see it actually that he will be remembered as a patriot.')
