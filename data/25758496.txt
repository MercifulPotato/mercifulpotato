Worse when you were planning on implementing it soon anyways, but now if you do it&#x27;s &quot;rewarding&quot; their behaviour (in their eyes at least), and they become invigorated to go and spread their toxicity even further. Alternatively, you can hold off on implementing it until things cool down, but then all the nice users who have been patiently waiting get screwed.<p>I&#x27;m forever grateful that I actually get FAANG salary to do this -- I wouldn&#x27;t keep it up if I was getting the little-to-noting many FOSS contributors get.')
