The fingerprint is only used as a presence check by the security key, which digitally signs a challenge using its own internal non-exportable key material. So you would have to both steal someone else&#x27;s security key (note you cannot &quot;clone&quot; it, at least not trivially), and also get their fingerprint, if you wanted to &quot;hack&quot; them.')
