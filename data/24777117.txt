Knowing simplified I can read traditional pretty effortlessly and even communicate with a relative in HK typing in traditional, but cannot write it by hand from memory. I liken it to being able to read but not draw the Gothic &quot;T&quot; in the New York Times.<p>Still, I&#x27;d claim that regardless of the direction, learning the simplification map (and some patternless exceptions) is a small incremental task compared with the thousands of hours learning the broader language. What&#x27;s a few hundred mapping rules + exceptions, after learning 3000+ characters? If someone asked me which character set to start with, barring real issues with availability of education material, I&#x27;d say to learn whatever you want if you&#x27;re committed to it! Just be ready to spend a few hundred more hours at least due to the increased amount of information to memorize in traditional.')
