I was literally searching for cards on eBay last night. I would love to see a game like Perplex City return some day. It was one of the first ARGs I followed on Unfiction, and it helped introduce me to the world of puzzling and puzzle hunts, and also helped push me towards my current career path. So, I guess I want to say thank you for working on such a unique and interesting game that had a massive positive influence on me when I was a teenager. It was so exciting to see the mid-2000s internet work together in a whirlwind of multimedia creativity.<p>Also, this is completely random, but do you happen to know if there&#x27;s a warehouse somewhere with a bunch of unopened boxes of Perplex City cards? I always keep an eye out for cards, but it&#x27;s hard to find people selling things from a game that ended over a decade ago.')
