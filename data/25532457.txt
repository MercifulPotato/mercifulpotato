Some groups want to function like academia, with reading groups and paper talks and stuff.  Some want to function like software companies with standups and Trello boards.  A PhD will fit in better with the former type of group.<p>Edit: I dropped out of a PhD to go work, and that was optimal for me. I got a couple extra years to independently build my skillset, I was very hot on the recruiting market being a step above the new grads, but I didn&#x27;t waste ages learning skills that would ultimately be irrelevant (published no papers.)')
