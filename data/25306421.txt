This is based on a question I just asked him on Twitter at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;dhh&#x2F;status&#x2F;1334953167327547397" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;dhh&#x2F;status&#x2F;1334953167327547397</a>.<p>So it sounds like NEW MAGIC will probably make it super easy to push &#x2F; broadcast stuff from the server to the client, but to get everything working with a really nice API and it being seamless will require a substantial amount of work if you planned to re-invent it in another framework.')
