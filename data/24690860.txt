My plan included the following phases:<p><pre><code>  1. Idea + POC (solved technical issues) =&gt; Done\n  2. Build a MVP =&gt; Done\n  3. Get some feedback and see if there is any interest. =&gt; Here we are!\n  4. Based on feedback, add (premium) features but keep the basic service for free.\n</code></pre>\nSo in summary; yes it will stay free, I might add some &quot;acceptable&quot; limitations but the goal is indeed to propose additional (non-free) features like well-known services (for instance Gitlab).<p>So feel free to share your ideas, I would enjoy to answer and challenge them!<p>Furthermore I plan to write a small survey to get more feedback.<p>About the &quot;Open Source&quot; part: as a regular FOSS contributor, I do not exclude to publish sources. However, publishing sources means maintaining them. And I don&#x27;t want to maintain a useless project. So currently I don&#x27;t want to publish them.<p>Hope it helps you to understand my strategy for this new experience!')
