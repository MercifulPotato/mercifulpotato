Then there&#x27;s a process with user filing a counter-notice, then the original filer having a chance to respond to THAT, etc., that you can see in the gitlab workflow, but most of that is just how DMCA works. &quot;If there was a valid counter-notice and no response has been received from the plaintiff within 10 days of the counter-notice being forwarded&quot; then the content might go back up.')
