Mocking FET itself is necessary and enjoyable<p>In my experience if you believe in crap like FET you generally believe in other stupid stuff that is also harmful, furthermore believers in harmful stuff tend not to shut up about their belief but want to spread it to others, which is also harmful.<p>Therefore I reserve my right to mock believers in a flat earth on a case by case basis - that said I&#x27;m no longer the fast-mouthed jerk I was as a teen, and a mocking from me nowadays is probably so mild people would just fall asleep, so unlikely to effect things one way or another.')
