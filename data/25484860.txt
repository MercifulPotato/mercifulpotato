It&#x27;s definitely not &quot;batch&quot;, and it&#x27;s definitely really cheap. I think that the fact that the author doesn&#x27;t look at the economics of various deployment mechanisms is pretty revealing - within the first three hours of my first cloud engagement we were making faces about the costs of different options. To be honest this is the biggest preoccupation of every team doing cloud that I have looked after. It&#x27;s also the reason (the <i>only</i> reason why business are going to cloud. If you can get 20% e-2-e soup to nuts savings that is <i>fantastic</i> but in terms of system architecture that&#x27;s a very thin and high risk landing zone to aim for - it&#x27;s really easy to screw up and get +20%. Serverless is one of the methods that can help a project drive overall costs under the line, and I say &quot;good for serverless&quot;.')
