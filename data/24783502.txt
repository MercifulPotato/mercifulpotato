They don&#x27;t want to be hijacked by another &quot;leaks&quot; story days before the election but now the suppression of this has become the entire story, and its convinced a lot of people the story is true and dangerous to Biden. Even if the email is true I don&#x27;t see how its dangerous and if the only media carrying the story are the NY Post and Fox it doesn&#x27;t hurt Biden.')
