Software written for non-tech folks. We have a 100 shiny JIRA clones but some niche software for nurses has awful and slow UX.<p>Everytime I’ve gone to a doctor, they’re using a different kind of software portal. Many claim its an expensive software the hospital bought but doesn’t do what they want so they write things on paper instead.<p>This is one of my fears as a dev.
