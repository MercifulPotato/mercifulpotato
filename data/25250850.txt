Item(by='ProofMe5GIsSafe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606712023, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25244518, text='&gt; I have not seen anyone make unqualified predictions of &quot;disaster in 2-3 weeks&quot;.<p>Unqualified predictions of &quot;disaster in 2-3 weeks&quot; was the narrative of the (I guess progressive left-dominated) science and experts, to cement and aid with the &quot;flatten the curve&quot; meme, to help mandate mask wearing. &quot;Why should I wear a mask? Well, because if not, in 2 weeks we will have seen exponential growth and your grandparents could die. Why didn&#x27;t our grandparents die? Well... just wait 2 more weeks, or its simply proof that mask wearing helped&quot;. I feel, partly in response to the politicization of the conservative right complaining about overreactions, strict curfews that made no logical sense, and government mandating their religious services.<p>Because the conservative right very much started out believing that this was the Apocalypse. Even when contained to China, they were talking of upcoming Pandemics, about buying supplies if you needed to go into the woods, about procuring N95 masks or gas masks for when COVID inevitably arrived in their country.<p>While the left was still doing photo ops in the China towns of their cities, deriding people who were afraid as racists or unsupportive&#x2F;anti-social. Opposing drastic measures like banning flights as anti-immigrant. To complain that you were saying &quot;just wait two more weeks&quot; two weeks ago in January. Parroting authorities that masks were only to be used by sick people, and not protective for general public.<p>This narrative completely flip-flopped around April. In part due to new information (The left is more acceptable to science). In part due to politics. In part because COVID now was mainstream and authority, so new avenues for conspiracy and suspicion turned up (COVID&#x27;s not so bad as they would like you to believe. Vaccines will be forced and change DNA, Bill Gates wants to give mark of the beast, in form of microchip).<p>It was interesting to see, and should make finding sources possible, but difficult (for instance, find authoritative websites debunking Vitamin D, before the randomized trial studies came out, you need the internet archive now, but these existed for sure!). Many poor (but qualified&#x2F;we-should-listen-to-this) predictions and articles, supposedly accepted and common knowledge, were deeply flawed&#x2F;ill-motivated in short-term hind-sight and this cemented distrust. Especially because the people that made such poor claims, are the arbiters of truth and in charge of managing the &quot;infodemic&quot;.')
