It doesn&#x27;t support reactions (which are essential if you don&#x27;t want a chat with many people to devolve into incessant pointless notifications), nor does it allow easy editting of the message you just sent (another essential feature, given how often small mistakes can totally change the meaning of text).  I can&#x27;t collapse pictures&#x2F;gifs that annoy me, I can&#x27;t chat with people on other services. It won&#x27;t let me use whatsapp web on multiple other devices simultaneously, it won&#x27;t let me use whatsapp web when my phone is out of battery (the exact time I most need it!).  I can&#x27;t invite people to chat with me on whatsapp without them having to create an account and give up their phone number (and usually their contact address book too).<p>It&#x27;s very strange to me to hear people describe Whatsapp as having good UX.')
