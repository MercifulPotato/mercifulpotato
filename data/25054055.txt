I added this context to indicate that I have more first hand knowledge of what it means to be a sex worker than someone who well... doesn&#x27;t date an online sex worker.<p>My girlfriend has mentioned that some women do not handle the money well or make emotional compromises with work hours etc that can at times lead to very sad outcomes.  It would be a sad day if it was socially &quot;okay&quot; to ask any random woman if they &quot;have an onlyfans&quot; so you can see them naked for $8.  That is a sad state of affairs, granted we&#x27;re already half way there since asking if a woman has an Instagram in many cases could be perceived as asking &quot;do you have an instagram filled with soft-core pornography of yourself?&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m open to objection by any of the members of HN who likely (ironically) identify as male feminists.  For the record, my gf finds your cause hilarious and pandering at best ;)')
