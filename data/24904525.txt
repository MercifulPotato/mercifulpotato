When you see a mostly-well-designed open source page, your brain just feels like you&#x27;re being tricked. You feel like someone&#x27;s trying to charge you for something, or it just feels wrong.<p>Design is contextual, and what we think of as &quot;well-designed&quot; tends to be from a SaaS perspective, and that sends the wrong message. You see it and think &quot;oh, this is a SaaS product,&quot; and your brain just feels weird.<p>This is true for all design. In markets, generic brands use a worse design to signal they&#x27;re &quot;cheaper,&quot; cereals for kids use cartoons, etc. The vibe needs to match the product, or else your brain sets off alarm bells.<p>Open Source projects use design to project what they value. Org mode for Emacs should feel like... a site for emacs. Simple, clear, no frills. Whereas a site like Prettier looks nicer, because that&#x27;s the whole point.<p>(Also, separate &quot;design&quot; from &quot;usability&quot;... this site isn&#x27;t pretty, but I can find everything I need super easily!)')
