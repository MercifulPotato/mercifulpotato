This is quite bad. ~10% of Android, or approximately ~300M.<p>Edit: Actually it is even worst since it is Android 7.1 Or below [2], \nthat is 7.1 + 7.0 + 6.0+ 5.1 + 4.4, a total 21% of Android devices. or 600M. These numbers exclude China so actual number would be even higher.<p>Although by 2021 those devices would have been 4 - 5 years old at least and need a replacement. It still saddens me how the Internet, and just simple web pages have now turned into a whole HTTPS, lots of complexity and encryption by default.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Android_Nougat" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Android_Nougat</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gs.statcounter.com&#x2F;android-version-market-share&#x2F;mobile-tablet&#x2F;worldwide&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gs.statcounter.com&#x2F;android-version-market-share&#x2F;mobi...</a>')
