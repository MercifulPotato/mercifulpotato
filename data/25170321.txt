I can say for sure that of all the programming trends, there has been almost no discussion around interface complexity. There has been plenty of discussions around FP, dependency injection, type safety and a host of other trendy programming topics but I&#x27;ve never heard anyone point out interface complexity as a problem.<p>Complex interfaces lead to &#x27;tight coupling&#x27;; developers have known for decades that this is bad but we don&#x27;t seem to be discussing it much anymore. The reason why JSON-based REST APIs became so successful is because it greatly reduced interface complexity (compared to XML-based SOAP) and in doing so, it loosened the coupling between different services.<p>Until we start discussing interface complexity, nobody will fully realize what the drawbacks of TypeScript are. My main problem with TypeScript is that it is most useful when code quality is low (high interface complexity; tight coupling). That&#x27;s what I mean when I say that it encourages bad programming practices; the people who find TypeScript most useful are those who tend to produce the worst code in terms of interface complexity.')
