Username + Password is a cumbersome workaround because (so far) machines couldn&#x27;t use biometrics to authenticate a user. Now they can, so we can let go of that very problematic and often insecure model.<p>Think like this, when you go to visit your grandmother and knock on her door you don&#x27;t have to provide a password. You don&#x27;t have to provide anything, because the human brain is capable of determining your identity in less than a fraction of a second. This is why as soon as your grandmother opens the door she&#x27;ll have a smile on her face and welcome you in. That <i>IS</i> biometrics. Now machines can do the same. It&#x27;s the oldest and most secure form of authentication in human history.')
