It&#x27;s a democratic or popularity contest where if a word is used enough it becomes part of the language and accepted.  Dictionaries have standards where a word must appear in print a number of times to be accepted.<p>Other languages are less dynamic so they are less responsive to introducing new words.  Some of those and others controlled by official bodies which may or may not represent the population are less popularity driven.
