Just as a sex worker can choose to engage in their activities because they are of the opinion that it is okay, one can certainly choose to have a negative opinion of their choice. As long as those opinions don&#x27;t turn into adverse action (e.g. banning one&#x27;s rights to engage in sex work) I don&#x27;t see what the consequences of having opinions is.<p>Personally, I choose to avoid people who choose the easy path in life and refuse to accept reality or be accountable for their actions. Whether it&#x27;s people refusing to admit that they have an addiction (to porn, drugs, alcohol, sex, gambling, video games) or women engaging in sex work and then complaining of the consequences (e.g. not being able to find the partner they want after they quit doing sex work), people who don&#x27;t take responsibility for their choices given their circumstances, whatever they may be, are unpleasant to be around at best (often complaining about how unfair things are) and are dangerous at worst. If the circumstances are that some woman does sex work because she comes from an impoverished background and desperately needs financial freedom, I understand why she may choose sex work (though I really wish there were institutions in place so that she didn&#x27;t have to make that choice; late-stage capitalism has made the world a harsh place). If she does it because she can make a lot of money and wants nice luxuries, I know that that sort of person and I would have no overlap in our worldview. As another example, I decided to cut out some close male friends of mine in certain athletic endeavors when they started using performance-enhancing drugs.<p>It&#x27;s nothing about some form of prudish morality. It&#x27;s about not wanting to associate with anyone who makes key choices in their life that I think reveal a certain morality that I don&#x27;t agree with. Everyone has this right (to free association) and I don&#x27;t think any sort forced association should be palatable to anyone living in a country with modern governance.')
