Slaves aren&#x27;t an effective asset in this century. After a generation or two there&#x27;d be basically none left because nobody would want one.<p>[citation needed]<p>&gt; Look at Apple, AWS, Google, etc, etc vs some slave-run plantation in wherever-they-have-slave-plantations. Which one would people rather invest in, just from a greedy capitalist perspective? All the money is in owning productive capital and businesses made up of motivated employees.<p>I&#x27;m having trouble taking this comparison seriously. There has always been employees aside of slavery, usually at different positions.<p>Look at Apple&#x27;s production history in China, or Amazon warehouse workers or Google&#x2F;Amazon turk work. If there was no regulation, and with unscrupulous C-levels, those positions would probably be slaves, from a &quot;capitalist perspective&quot;.')
