However, these weapons tend to be very expensive and hyper targetable.<p>But just killing literal pigs, in the wild, with really no restrictions at all, and practically no need to track the kills or process them for food, is a nearly impossible task. Just pure, cheap, blunt weapons will do the job more than fine. But there just isn&#x27;t enough, even with the massive spendings.')
