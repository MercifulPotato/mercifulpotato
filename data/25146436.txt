Item(by='tristor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605762657, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25145448, text='&gt; absent some specific customer segment that has special credit situations<p>It seems from the S-1 that Affirm has grown it&#x27;s market quite a lot, but my first and primary exposure to them is in the car scene.  Affirm entered this customer segment and dominated pretty quickly as the creditor integration of choice for long time-scale projects with up front costs like custom engine builds.  I imagine to some degree they are able to make decisions partly based on the nature of what is being purchased.<p>Their S-1 indicates this is shifting, but I have historically seen Affirm in places where a more typical online consumer credit organization like PayPal Credit &#x2F; BillMeLater &#x2F; etc doesn&#x27;t play.  Affirm seemed to be focused on larger sized purchases which would otherwise be paid on an installment plan, but filling that gap.  Exercise equipment like Peloton is a great example, just as engine builds is a similar type of transaction.')
