Sure it&#x27;s fucky for Apple to make glass back for no functional purpose, but breaking glass doesn&#x27;t render phone useless. Mine got replaced in a dodgy shop for $130 NZD (I guess they would be able to do same in US for $50 or $20 in SE Asia). They just unglued everything and stuck new aftermarket glass.<p>Reality for smartphone fixes is 90% of cases they gonna replace screen, remaining - battery. Both jobs take something like 10 minutes.')
