I&#x27;ve worked remotely for the past 4 years, and this year has easily been the most difficult and most unlike typical remote work:<p>- Normally, I&#x27;d try to mix up my day and get some socialization in by going to a co-working space 1-2 times a week.<p>- I had a lot of freedom to catch up with friends after work, or over lunch, and while that&#x27;s not impossible in 2020, it&#x27;s very different (it&#x27;s a much smaller group, always outside, and never over food or drinks - mostly just a walk or something like that).<p>- I had much more freedom to travel (YMMV depending on your work, but I would work remotely from a cottage, or a nearby city sometimes if I was meeting up with someone - even a couple of times from more exotic locales).<p>- For gigs where an office was close by, I still had the option to pop in once in a while, and for really remote jobs, I still tended to have some form of face to face interaction by doing a bigger visit every few months.<p>If you&#x27;re not liking remote work during 2020, I don&#x27;t entirely blame you. I still don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for everyone, but I would recommend trying it outside the context of a global pandemic.')
