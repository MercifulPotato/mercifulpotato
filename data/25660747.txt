Item(by='danudey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609958578, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25660631, text='This article should be taken with a cosmic-scale grain of salt. Specifically, it&#x27;s worth noting that the article discussions how complaints about &quot;microaggressions&quot; (typically from visible minorities) are a form of &quot;oppression&quot; and refers to &quot;pathetic little snowflakes&quot;.<p>This comes across as some kind of conservative boomer complaining about &quot;kids these days&quot;, with their avocado toast, who aren&#x27;t willing to work as hard as their grandfathers were in a world that&#x27;s vastly different from the one they grew up in.<p>The crux of the article with regards to Simon Pegg seems to be that movies have moved to &quot;spectacle&quot;, but when did that happen? And who is going to see those movies? And why?<p>The world is going to shit; the 1% own most of the world, climate change is destroying our planet, and politicians are more concerned with their own success than the lives of their constituents. Is it any wonder that people these days need more escapism than their grandparents in the &quot;golden age of America&quot;, where employees would work hard their whole lives and companies would take care of their employees, where you could work a typical job and still be able to afford a house and a comfortable lifestyle, and where you didn&#x27;t have to feel bad about hurting someone&#x27;s feelings by being overtly racist all the time, because you never ran into black people because they weren&#x27;t allowed to use the same water fountains or bathrooms as you.<p>This article, in short, is garbage, and should be treated as such.')
