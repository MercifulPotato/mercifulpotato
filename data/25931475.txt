We are told 90% less antibiotics, half the energy and so on and so forth; well all these cost money so presumably if they use much less energy and antibiotics per same yield and have not rolled up the industry there must be valuable things they consume more of. What are they, and is there realistic hope they can be rendered less harmful than consuming 10x the antibiotics and 2x the energy etc?')
