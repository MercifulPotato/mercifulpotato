Just in case you are still here let me try. BTW am a fan of your popular math stuff.<p>TLDR expectiles are to mean what quantiles are to median.<p>A longer explanation follows.<p>Mean can be looked upon as a location that minimizes a scheme of penalizing your &#x27;prediction&#x27; of (many instances of) a random quantity. You can assume that the instances will be revealed after you have made the prediction. If your prediction is over&#x2F;larger by <i>e</i> you will be penalized by <i>e^2</i>. If your prediction is lower by <i>e</i> then also the penalty is <i>e^2</i>. This makes mean symmetric. It punishes overestimates the same way as underestimates.<p>Now if you were to be punished by absolute value <i>|e|</i> as opposed to <i>e^2</i> then median would be your best prediction. Lets denote the error by <i>e+</i> if the error is an over-estimate and <i>-e-</i> if its under. Both <i>e+</i> and <i>e-</i> are non-negative. Now if the penalties were to be * e+  + a e- * that would have led to the different quantiles depending on the values of <i>a &gt; 0</i>. Note <i>a \\neq 1</i> introduces the asymmetry.<p>If you were to do introduce a similar asymmetric treatment of <i>e+^2</i> and <i>e-^2</i> that would have given rise to expectiles.')
