Is this how yall do things? Everything so far feels less mature, thinly pieced together, barely holding up, fast moving, unnecessarily bloated, and no care for longevity, robustness and discipline. Seems like every thing is on Youtube, no real good books (yeah, go ahead and search for &quot;React JS&quot; books on Amazon and see if you find something solid that is well praised). It&#x27;s these 8 hour fucking Youtube videos that I need to watch and probably not remember anything. I watched one of those and its horrifying what kind of stuff these people are teaching. I am obviously generalizing, sure there are some really smart people involved in Frontend tech, but boy if you take a sweeping look from ten thousand feet, it ain&#x27;t pretty.<p>Well, first reaction for most people would be I am offended by this. But, I am speaking from the heart. This is <i>exactly</i> how I bloody feel, change my mind. The entire frontend ecosystem including browsers and the horrible mess that html&#x2F;css&#x2F;js is needs to be redone properly from scratch. Unfortunately, we can&#x27;t because we&#x27;ve dug ourselves deep into this hole. How do we get out of this?<p>&#x2F;rant')
