And then someone posts something like &#x27;I tried installing Ubuntu but thing X didn&#x27;t work, how can anyone do real work on this joke operating system? I stopped using it immediately&#x27; and they just want to provide a different perspective.<p>...because they have entangled their identity with their OS of choice such that they interpret &quot;I had a problem with this and therefore don&#x27;t use it&quot; as some kind of personal attack. This is not only unhelpful, but an actively repellent behavior.<p>&gt; Personally I bought a Windows laptop a few years ago and had to stop using the OS because both sleep and the Intel wifi drivers simply didn&#x27;t work. Yet if I tried to use that experience to proclaim that that Windows was a non-functional, useless operating system developed by people who don&#x27;t give a damn, I would not be taken seriously.<p>Case in point, who is saying Linux is <i>useless</i>? Useless for their particular use case or workflow, sure. Even people who like Windows generally, like myself, say the developers don&#x27;t give a damn (see some of my other posts on the subject). Fact is, a lot of use would <i>love</i> to be using an OSS system, but the community actively fights us when we have issues with their stuff and their echo chamber of &quot;our way is the best way!&quot; remains unbreached, so our use cases and workflows are never accommodated and we, consequently, can&#x27;t use it. This has been going on for about 20 years now. It&#x27;s pretty damned tiring.<p>&gt; By the way have you considered what reporting bugs like this for Windows is like?<p>I work supporting Windows systems, so I know how useless Microsoft support is. You know what I don&#x27;t get when I talk about a Windows issue with other Windows admins though? &quot;Well it works fine here...&quot;<p>&gt; Talking to real driver and OS developers directly on Linux bug reports is magical in comparison.<p>Sure, if they listen, which they often don&#x27;t. Spend some time in Ubuntu&#x27;s issue tracker if you don&#x27;t believe me.')
