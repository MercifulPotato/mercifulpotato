Or unequivocally supporting Connery? I&#x27;ve read every reply completely and all I see is a group of people wrangling what is a difficult topic.<p>I&#x27;ll note you seem remarkably dismissive of any viewpoint that isn&#x27;t full agreement, and even the parent&#x27;s reply isn&#x27;t good enough to meet your standard.<p>All I can say is that if you wanted to rake someone over the coals rather than have what seems to be a pretty mature discussion, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find what you want from this. Otherwise, there&#x27;s a lot to unpack in what I think is quite a philosophical conversation.')
