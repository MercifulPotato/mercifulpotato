Thus the politeness doesn&#x27;t cost you anything.  Also in those rural areas it is somewhat common for someone with the right away to have a reason to drive much slower than the speed limit and so giving up your right away makes things better for everyone - the other person doesn&#x27;t have to try to pass you latter.<p>When there is traffic you giving up the right away is impolite to the person behind you and shouldn&#x27;t be done.  unless traffic is so heavy that you won&#x27;t be able to move, and so you should give you your right away to someone who can go.')
