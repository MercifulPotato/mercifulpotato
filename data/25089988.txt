I used to run a Mac.<p>This doesn&#x27;t exclude you from being  a mac hater. In fact judging from the comments you read on every post on HN that is remotely related to Apple, that seems more likely than the typical blind hatred you see on the internet broadly.<p>&gt; And I&#x27;m not scared, I&#x27;m sad. I would love to have 3 or more open competitive desktop&#x2F;laptop platforms (Windows, Linux and MacOS) but my view is that the release of the M1 makes that not very likely.<p>Based on what, exactly? Very few people have their hands on an M1 mac and there hasn&#x27;t been any reviews of the systems from third parties yet.<p>&gt; If we look at the M1 compare it to the A14, we can see that Apple has made almost no modifications to the architecture to make it fit in a computer rather then a mobile device. They didn&#x27;t add more cores, they didn&#x27;t add support for PCI, GPUs, Ethernet, or anything else that makes it more like a Computer CPU.<p>You don&#x27;t know what they did or didn&#x27;t do to adapt the M1 for computers. There has to be some degree of PCI-E support since they are using thunderbolt ports. There is ethernet on the mac mini with the M1 chip. It remains to be seen whether or not supporting discrete GPUs will be a thing and that&#x27;ll largely depend on how their GPU scales. The computers that use discrete GPUs in macs right now haven&#x27;t released an Apple silicon variant yet.<p>&gt; Maybe this is besides the point, but to me it was very telling that they didn&#x27;t update the physical design of any of the 3 computers. The thermal envelope of the M1 Should make it possible to make some much sexier designs, then the old designs we where given. It tells me a lot about how Apple allocates its resources.<p>I think it is beside the point. There&#x27;s no reason to delay new chips just for the sake of being in sync with a new redesign of the chassis. It may or may not happen next year with the iMac or Macbook Pro 16, we don&#x27;t know that yet.<p>&gt; Apple have neglected the mac and especially the pro segment for a long time. There was always a chance they would get their act together and build reasonably priced, top speced machines, that could compete with Linux and Windows boxes, but with this move, I cant see them put the resources behind their silicon to compete with AMD, nVidia, and Intel when it comes to Performance and features.<p>They only released their entry level computers. You have nothing to base this argument on. There have only been leaked benchmarks all of which seem favorable towards Apple. We won&#x27;t know what it means until people start getting them and testing them.')
