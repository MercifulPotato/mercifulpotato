Grounded in the traditional Ethnic Studies discipline, comprised of African American, Asian American, Latinx and Native American studies, the requirement can be fulfilled through a broad spectrum of course offerings that address historical, current and emerging ethnic studies and social justice issues. The requirement advances a unique focus on the intersection and comparative study of race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, religion, immigration status, ability and&#x2F;or age. CSU courses on Africana literature, Native Californian perspectives, police reform, disparities in public health and the economics of racism, to name just a few, would meet the new requirement.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.calstate.edu&#x2F;csu-system&#x2F;news&#x2F;Pages&#x2F;CSU-Trustees-Approve-Ethnic-Studies-and-Social-Justice-General-Education-Requirement.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.calstate.edu&#x2F;csu-system&#x2F;news&#x2F;Pages&#x2F;CSU-Trustees...</a>')
