You had to agree to all the permissions an app needed before installing it but they changed it to be progressive like iOS and I think it&#x27;s more flexible than iOS now. For example, my phone has the ability to disable network permission for single apps like wifi, vpn, data, etc from settings.<p>&gt; Is there any reason to think users care about it enough to switch based solely on this feature?<p>People buying flagship android phones definitely. They cost as much as iphones. Others, I am not sure.')
