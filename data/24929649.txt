Thanks for that.<p>Finding modern cognates to medieval nobility is fraught. In the republican era, it basically means &quot;finger the bad guys.&quot; There&#x27;s a tendency to label whoever you have beef with. Investors, bankers, the wealthy, political elites, the upper class...<p>Does Peace and War go into inter-nobility issues, or does the thesis rest on just the problem of a fixed size peasantry supporting a growing nobility? I could imagine these issues resulting in famines and peasant revolts. But, I can also imagine conflict emerging among nobility.<p>You can confer as many titles as you like, but France only has so many hides of land. Landless knights and penniless descendants of counts hanging around palaces and competing viciously for favour seems like it could be a recipe too. Somewhat more parsimonious with this modern thesis.')
