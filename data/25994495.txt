Members of the team are self-motivating, curious, and have a hands-on attitude, and take pride in their work and accomplishments. We use the Clojure programming language, almost exclusively, to ensure that our servers are fast and very stable; we use GraphQL and good old-fashioned conversation to keep our internal clients informed, engaged, and productive.<p>Our team&#x27;s primary mission is giving customers access to their online and in-store purchase history; this includes receiving and storing a constant feed of receipt information from thousands of Walmart and Sam&#x27;s Club stores.<p>Our daily cycle includes a brief &quot;standup&quot; meeting to ask questions, check on progress, call out interesting problems and solutions, and otherwise keep in touch. We try to keep the rest of the day free from meetings, to actually get things done.<p>Because we are, and always have been, a remote-first team, we rely on good communication: both in writing, and via video.<p>We have full ownership of, and responsibility for, the life-cycle of our code, and the servers that code runs on, as well as monitoring tools. We deploy on a daily basis, and we continually work to improve our DevOps tools and processes.<p>Our systems sit between front-end developers building web pages and mobile apps, and other back-end teams and their APIs; an important part of the job is working out the best solutions that address the needs of both sides, then implementing those solutions with a focus on stability and scalability. We expect you to have a good intuition for building systems that meet our clients&#x27; needs but won&#x27;t fail under pressure.<p>Candidates should be able to demonstrate the ability to think and work in Clojure.<p>Skills list &#x2F; technical stack: Clojure, GraphQL, Cassandra, Kafka, Elasticsearch, Redis, Prometheus, Ruby, Ansible, Spark, Docker, JVM<p>If this sounds good, please apply through our LinkedIn post <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;talent&#x2F;hire&#x2F;427994092&#x2F;job-post" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;talent&#x2F;hire&#x2F;427994092&#x2F;job-post</a> (preferred) or email me at bcarrell@walmart.com.')
