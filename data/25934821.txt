It&#x27;s not a shining jewel of analysis on a normal day.  Right, now it&#x27;s a pure stampeding herd of FOMO with metaphorical taxi drivers giving stock tips. Which is pretty canonical bubble material.<p>I think <i>some</i> of the fundamental analysis on WSB is sound, but doesn&#x27;t support the existing valuation. The &quot;short squeeze&quot; play is interesting, but I don&#x27;t have access to the ticker and book to read the details on what is actually going on. It&#x27;s stampede material.<p>Sure, I&#x27;ve got a little in AMC&#x2F;GME, but even if we, ahem, &quot;go to the moon&quot;, because, eh, why not, it&#x27;s a fraction of a fraction of my net, why not pick up a few bucks on the side. =)<p>The vast bulk of my investments are perking along in Vanguard index mutuals and will not even notice GME.')
