I mean, they don&#x27;t. The largest media network by most metrics (at least in the sense that people normally mean by media; Comcast and Liberty Global would be bigger, but are mostly comms companies, really) is News Corporation and its affiliates. This owns Fox and the Sun and various other right-wing gutter press, along with some more respectable, but certainly right-leaning, organs like the Times and WSJ.<p>Other top tens include Sinclair Broadcasting Co (hardly left-leaning), and the Daily Mail and its affiliates.')
