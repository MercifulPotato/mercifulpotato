They also have flaked several times on me-- no delivery after an hour.  They seem to have a weakness dispatching drivers.  The restaurants are doing their job.<p>What happens if the restaurant completes a Doordash order but then Doordash fails to deliver it and must issue a refund?  Does that transaction still get recognized as revenue?')
