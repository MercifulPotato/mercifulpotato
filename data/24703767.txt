Item(by='learc83', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602027732, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24701999, text='&gt; I&#x27;m always direct when pointing out that I left the South partially because of discrimination<p>Any reasonable person who reads will infer that &quot;the South&quot; is that thing that is discriminatory in general. If you instead meant something else you worded it very poorly.<p>I honestly have a hard time believing that you don&#x27;t understand how the sentence &quot;I left X because of Y.&quot; implies that X is Y.<p>&quot;I left my marriage because of domestic violence.&quot; It&#x27;s entirely possible to construct a meaning where your spouse wasn&#x27;t the one beating you, but that&#x27;s the logical inference.<p>If you didn&#x27;t intend to generalize that the South is discriminatory overall then why didn&#x27;t you just say: I left my hometown because of discrimination? What additional meaning does &quot;the South&quot; add to that if you really just mean:<p>&quot;I left my home town because of discrimination. My hometown happens to be in the South, but I don&#x27;t think the South at large is any more or less discriminatory than any other region.&quot;<p>&gt;All that said, I do think there are accurate generalizations you can make about the South, or any large region.<p>Sure. I don&#x27;t think you can based on the experience of having lived in one tiny area of that region.<p>&gt;Forsyth County, for instance, is definitely exurban and just as definitely part of the Atlanta metropolitan area.<p>Exurban is one step away from farmland. The differences between Cumming and say the area around Little Five Points is much greater than the difference between that same area of Atlanta and San Francisco.')
