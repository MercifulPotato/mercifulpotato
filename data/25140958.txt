But this is probably consistent with Apple&#x27;s economic incentives. Especially because the major role of Macs in the world is to provide a platform for developing iOS apps.<p>This week I ordered an M1 Macbook Air. Not because I really need it, but because a couple years from now I will be happy I have a machine that can run Big Sur, which will be remembered as the least restrictive OS of the Apple Silicon era.<p>Apple is the biggest corporation in the world. We can like their products, but we shouldn&#x27;t give them more credit than, say, ExxonMobil or Foxconn or Goldman Sachs. They will make choices based on what creates the most profit, nothing more.
