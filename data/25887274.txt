Item(by='Swizec', descendants=None, kids=[25887445, 25887537, 25888873, 25888209, 25888575], score=None, time=1611445700, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25887188, text='&gt; Now start talking the top 1-2% and the story changes dramatically.<p>Probably the top 5-6%. The numbers are lower but the behavior is similar. You’d be surprised how soon you hit the “More money than I know what to do with” line.<p>Make 150 to 200k&#x2F;year (not uncommon on HN) and what are you gonna do, buy a new car every year? Rent is paid, food is paid, clothes are good, 1 or 2 vacations per year, go out to eat whenever you want, one-off nice purchases aren’t a big concern ... it’s cushy. Not enough to buy real estate cash or anything like that, but def more slosh than you need.')
