Mutt holds a very special place in my heart, even though I haven&#x27;t used it in like a decade.  I did use it for a very long time, and it was fantastic!  Well into the 2000s I had UUCP delivering email to postfix on my laptop, read and sent using mutt.  UUCP was extremely capable for handling e-mail on a laptop, whether disconnected because I was traveling and on a CDMA connection, on a spotty wireless, or at the coffee shop.<p>I have kind of given up on e-mail...  I don&#x27;t even check it daily for work, and a few times a week personally.  I use gmail because they do a really good job of spam filtering and I don&#x27;t have to deal with infrastructure.')
