But ultimately, you are just locking yourself further &amp; further &amp; further in to the hostile, hard to work with environment, bending yourself into the bizarre abnormal geometry the serverless environment has demanded of you.<p>To me, as a developer who values being able to understand &amp; comprehend &amp; try, I would prefer staying far far far away from any serverless environment that is vendor locked. I would be willing &amp; interested to try serverless environments that give me, the developer, the traditional great &amp; vast powers of running as root locally that I expect. Short of a local dev environment, one meets both vendor lock in, &amp; faces ongoing difficulties trying to understand what is happening, with what performance profiles&#x2F;costs. I&#x27;d rather not invest my creativity &amp; effort in trying to eek more &amp; more signals out of the vendor&#x27;s black box. Especially if trouble is knocking, then I would very much like to be able to fall back on the amazing toolkits I know &amp; love.')
