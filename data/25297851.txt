It&#x27;s obviously hard to work at something for weeks, see the numbers (even knowing you really tried for days to move the needle) and then still publish numbers that seem impossible. And again, if you look at TSBS, this isn&#x27;t the first time we&#x27;ve run benchmarks on other databases, so we were just as shocked and put extra effort into it.<p>In the end, if you read the article (and not just the headlines - not saying you are, but it&#x27;s easy to see 6000x and latch on to it), the comparison is absolutely focused on this one, pretty straight forward use case (although we normally run 5 different scenarios):<p>From one client, given a specific kind of workload (100 hosts, 10 CPU metrics every 10 seconds for 30 days = ~1 billion metrics) - how fast could we save the data. Most other time series databases at least perform marginally well with the same setup... load data with one client.<p>But Timestream just doesn&#x27;t seem setup to work that way. Some of the responses today imply that we need really large clients with thousands of threads to get those speeds. And that might work if we kept going and spent more time and significantly more money.  We just haven&#x27;t ever had to do that before.<p>If your use case better aligns with what Timestream offers, then it might be a great product for you. Given some of the many other concerns we discovered along the way, it doesn&#x27;t yet seem like the time to jump in.<p>All the best!')
