Collect circumstantial evidence and allow for an objective ruling on discrimination and racism in the workplace. If the circumstantial he-said she-said is of any substance, you can prove your guilt.<p>Don&#x27;t do trial by (social) media. Especially when your accusations are incredibly heavy and damaging. Don&#x27;t play judge when you are not capable of objectively looking at all the presented evidence.<p>Coinbase presented their side of the story: nothing went to court. No investigation found anything of substance. If the circumstantial evidence was so strong to hold up in court, why didn&#x27;t it?<p>For the law, intent is of utmost importance. For (social) media, just &quot;circumstantial evidence&quot; of exhibiting patterns of discrimination is enough to act. It is <i>not</i> enough to act, if you are a decent person.')
