Some speculate that they <i>inexplicitly</i> sell subpar&#x2F;low freq chips, which would mean that they were selling an official 7-core, an official 8-core and a faster <i>but otherwise non-advertised</i> version of 8-core. And on top of that, the latter would be installed in Mac Air that has the worst (passive) cooling solution from all current M1 offerings...<p>That doesn&#x27;t make sense on any level and is just something Apple could not do and successfully hide from everyone, especially that they already have an <i>explicit</i> binning process.')
