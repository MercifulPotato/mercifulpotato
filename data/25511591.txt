Its not cyberpunk because the young protagonist has a glib jacket?  Its not cyberpunk because the plot impact is high?  Lots of cyberpunk works have high impact plots.  Ghost in the shell and Neuromancer had some global military AI.  Snow Crash had a villain with a nuclear bomb.  A lot of the characters in these books were not deep at all.  In fact I think accepting the dystopia as normal and living inside it&#x27;s rules is almost a hallmark of the genre.<p>I don&#x27;t really understand the plot complaints other then they just didn&#x27;t like it that more or that it didn&#x27;t fit their idea of what the game should be.')
