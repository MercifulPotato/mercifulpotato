Not only Valve but the community in general even if they weren&#x27;t directly involved with the gaming part.<p>Manage your expectations, I would treat it like a console, you won&#x27;t be able to play 100% of &quot;PC&quot; games but you will have a very  large selection of games including AAA. And in comparison by raw numbers Linux have many more games than regular consoles, not to mention all the emulators you can use.<p>Performance wise Source engine games run better than on Windows for me and a few Proton (Wine) games runs better too, but that&#x27;s not the rule as there is a small penalty from the &quot;translation&quot; layers. Vulkan games run very well.<p>If you try to run all games even the ones that Valve didn&#x27;t approved to run with Proton (&quot;1-click in the UI and it just works&quot;) you will have to tinker and do nerd stuff like using different versions or compiling from source. Don&#x27;t blame the platform if you go that route without proper knowledge and patience. Also in the same line of thinking don&#x27;t try to use Wayland yet, specially if you have a NVIDIA card because there&#x27;s no support from them, and I hope they do something about that but I wouldn&#x27;t hold my breath.')
