Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25825605], score=None, time=1610995841, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25823326, text='I think this is possibly misleading.<p>&#x27;We&#x27; never did &#x27;collective&#x27; parenting in the broader sense.<p>Both Asian and Western families were essentially nuclear, but multigenerational, and closer ties to extended family.<p>70 years ago, this was generally normative - and frankly often today - in that families were 2 parents + kids, but grandparents, uncles&#x2F;aunts &#x2F;cousins were part of the mix.<p>Obviously, more so in some places than others (particularly with parents living-in i.e. Asia, Italy)<p>Even today: 100% of my buddies who are married live within 2km of their mother-in-laws.<p>I think the term &#x27;collective&#x27; is just a little bit too broad, and Romanticizes these quasi-aboriginal notions of truly more collective parenting, which frankly hasn&#x27;t been part of the mix for a very long time (i.e. millennia) in most places.<p>The basic, communitarian concepts which we are mostly all familiar, which is to say &#x27;quasi nuclear with strong extended family ties&#x27; will work just fine.<p>I think both neoliberalism and certain kinds of progressive social ideologies, without necessarily intending to move away from this, are effectively doing this, and pushing us into the &#x27;hyper nuclear&#x27; (i.e. 1 or 2 parents only) scnenarios, which I think is less than ideal.<p>Having grown up in a single parent situation, and then two parents later on, it took me 30 years of reflection to realize how much single parenting is a massive disadvantage. Surprisingly, there is reluctance among many progressive circles to recognize this, whereupon the notion of &#x27;single motherhood&#x27; is contemplated on equal footing with 2 parent families. (Though I think this is usually derived from concerns over the fact that single parent households are often the result of abuse etc.)<p>This odd paradox can be seen within the African American community whereupon well over 50% of kids grow up without having much of a relationship with their fathers. To some, this is an abomination, and a &#x27;root cause of malaise&#x27; (and I&#x27;m not pointing fingers here, there are lot of men in jail that don&#x27;t need to be), but surprisingly among many, they just don&#x27;t see it as a problem for a variety of triggering reasons.<p>The nuclear+extended and obviously - community participation (i.e. teachers, role models) I think will work just fine so long as we recognize it.<p>And any parents who adopt foster children are straight up heroes, of that there is no doubt.')
