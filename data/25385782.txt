Item(by='yjftsjthsd-h', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607695146, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25385066, text='&gt; Modern PC EUFI bootloaders are bigger and more bloated than any uboot build in existence, and things like device tree support in linux means that you can support various boards with the same kernel (including boards that don&#x27;t exist yet). Sure you&#x27;ll probably still need custom bootloaders for most boards, but it&#x27;s not like you can swap your motherboard BIOS&#x2F;UEFI chips and expect them to work either.<p>This feels like, <i>at best</i>, getting back to where PCs already were, at least as a user. If a device tree can be embedded in firmware and fed to the booting system, then that&#x27;s fine, it&#x27;s just a minor implementation detail. If you need to go get a file and put it on your boot media, then that&#x27;s extra friction. Likewise, I don&#x27;t really care what the hardware&#x27;s boot firmware looks like, but if I need a different bootloader per-device then that&#x27;s a problem - can you imagine if Dell laptops and HP laptops needed different GRUB builds to work?')
