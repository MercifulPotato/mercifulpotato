Preprocessor options have no place in CFLAGS, which is for compiler options.  I guess you meant CPPFLAGS?  Putting a preprocessor option on CFLAGS is always wrong and expected to fail.<p>&gt; But distribution that i use installs it in<p>If your distribution installs headers outside of the preprocessor path (or somewhere inside CPATH or C_INCLUDE_PATH), then I&#x27;d say that this distribution is broken: it has not installed the library, just copied the files somewhere.  The makefile is then, correctly, expected to fail.  It&#x27;s just as if you had unzipped the library on &#x2F;tmp, of course you would not expect the compiler to find it!')
