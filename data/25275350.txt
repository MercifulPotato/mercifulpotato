And also would be quite interesting to understand how it works.<p>But I&#x27;ve never heard of any specifics.\nLike what brand does this? What data is it trying to send?<p>It&#x27;s easy to spoof a public hotspot and then at least identify what domains it tries to connect to.<p>Failing that there might be information gleaned from wireshark.')
