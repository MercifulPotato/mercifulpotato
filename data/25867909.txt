I&#x27;ve run it for a year or so and it&#x27;s great.<p>I use (and recommend) the Kodi addon as the client. I had stability issues with the jellyfin Android (TV) app, but Kodi runs on all sorts of platforms and it&#x27;s very well supported. I use it for music, too (there&#x27;s a dedicated music player for it in f-droid called &quot;gelli.&quot;)')
