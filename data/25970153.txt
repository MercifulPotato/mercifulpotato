Of course this assumes that you&#x27;re touch-typing and not looking at the keyboard because otherwise its labels might confuse you.<p>As for communicating in different languages, though, why do you feel the need to regularly switch between the German and US keyboard? IMO the German keyboard can do everything at least as well as the US one can (in terms of accents and so on), except for braces and brackets.<p>If the latter bother you (I know quite a few people who use the US keyboard for this reason): Why not adjust the second and&#x2F;or third layer of your (German) keyboard layout and make braces and brackets more easily accessible? Same goes for any features that you might be missing.<p>A lot of people seem to be recommending switching to an entirely new (first-layer) layout while your issue could probably be fixed by:<p>1. changing the second and third layer<p>2. using that same layout <i>everywhere</i>, on both US and German keyboards.')
