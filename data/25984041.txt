A money supply you can’t adjust cannot respond to shocks and it can’t respond to changes in the economy or society. The crash in 2008 and again now would have been much much much worse without an ability to control supply. Inflation is defined in terms of supply and velocity. Velocity plummeted so supply was raised to offset and lo and behold the fed nailed its 2% inflation target in 2020 in spite of epic global chaos. Gold would have ruined us.<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; wages have kept pace with inflation.<p>Wages are up 10% since 1963 on an inflation adjusted basis (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2018&#x2F;08&#x2F;07&#x2F;for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades&#x2F;%3famp=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;amp&#x2F;s&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2...</a>). Google is your friend.<p>Yes wealth inequality is a problem, that’s a fiscal and social issue not a monetary policy issue. Tax the rich.<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; slush fund<p>Nobody’s stealing anything. The inflation target is public and goaled on. Inflation has a purpose. You don’t like that purpose maybe because you don’t understand it maybe because you do, but it’s not theft. There is every chance we’d all be worse off under a 0% inflation environment because it would drastically reduce the liquidity that underlies the entire global economy.<p>Think about it: if poor people have no money and real salary has kept pace with inflation <i>what wealth is inflation reducing</i>? And if we use a 0-inflation or negative inflation currency, what’s to say wages wouldn’t stay flat or go down.<p>Again if you want to help the poor and narrow the gap, <i>tax the rich</i>, this inflation thing is just the game, and railing against it is tilting at the wrong windmills.')
