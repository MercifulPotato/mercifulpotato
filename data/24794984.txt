It has never meant freedom from the any impact. This article (facebook et al blocking&#x2F;removing&#x2F;deplatforming) is functionally no different than a newspaper choosing what to publish in their editorials page, a property owner having a bulletin board whose postings they control, or a shopping mall not allowing someone to stand up on a soap box and proselytize.')
