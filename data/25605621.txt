Renewables like photovoltaics and photothermics, along with heat pumps, are also increasing in price, because there is high demand on specialized workers for installation. The only thing that actually is getting cheaper is wood, a stove is comparatively cheap anyways (few hundred euros, compared to over 10k for anything renewable), and current climate plus tree pests cause a large amount of cheap firewood.<p>Also, there seems to be the dogma with professional renewable planners that room temperature should not rise above 18Â°C. I know people where their renewable heating was dimensioned too small, who then supplement by wood stove to at least get a cozy living room in winter.')
