Right now their M1 devices are objectively the cheapest practical ARM64 workstation products on the market. I don&#x27;t see why they shouldn&#x27;t be able to maintain that lead for a while as costs come down for ARM64 workstations in general. And I think it is reasonable to expect that ARM64 platforms will eventually be cheaper than x86 ones.')
