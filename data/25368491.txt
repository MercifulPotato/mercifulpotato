Yet somehow that is one of the states being accused of widespread fraud...?<p>Only the swing states that Trump lost are being accused of fraud, but only in the presidential election. This is extremely disingenuous and lacks all credibility.<p>Now the GOP seems to be arguing in court that there wasn&#x27;t even fraud, but they just don&#x27;t like the outcome and want to reverse the will of the voters in swing states based on weird technicalities.<p>This entire thing is nonsense, and youtube should censor it because it is entirely just a scheme to subvert our democracy.
