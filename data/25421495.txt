They&#x27;re doing CYA policy. They do whatever seems to be the strongest possible thing, users and reality be damned.<p>I was in a team whose security group eliminated the use of DVD drives for <i>reading</i> (not writing) data except for a few permitted individuals. Creating a massive chokepoint in every process where data had to come from off-network. Security didn&#x27;t care, it took the realization of the cost (delays, people too busy moving data to do their actual jobs) for management to step in and end the nonsense.<p>The same will be required for things like password policies. Until the issue becomes realized (weak&#x2F;written passwords lead to a compromise), these policies will stay in place within organizations and teams. It doesn&#x27;t help that the majority of the policy setters are <i>not</i> IT professionals (or only in the loosest sense, they can install software but have no <i>real</i> understanding of IT systems). In DoD, most come from a physical security background (retired&#x2F;separated security forces).')
