I&#x27;m not interested in the newest and latest (hearing about a book years after it was published is a signal of quality) so that saves me a lot of money.<p>Also, I&#x27;m not attached to those books as much as I would be if I had bought them new, which means I have less of an issue clearing them out to save space.')
