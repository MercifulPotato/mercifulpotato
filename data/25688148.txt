Teaching programming with imperative constructs first encourages imperative thinking. Teaching programming with computational concepts encourages computational thinking. Both require some reasoning about syntax and control flow before they sink in enough for beginners to use them effectively. But I really don’t think human language has any bearing here. People are also very likely to already understand expressions, as they’re taught from a very early age in arithmetic and it’s very common for people to at least have some algebra education. Expressions are fundamentally easier to reason about, and there’s no reason they would be more difficult to a beginner.<p>I’d even say that people usually have a good grasp on recursion even if they don’t know that’s what it’s called. Multiplication is just recursive addition. Exponents are just recursive multiplication. And so on.')
