I had the experience, once, where I felt the VP of Operations was waiting for me to fail instead of supporting my success.  I chalked it up to bad leadership on her part which threatened my ability to achieve the goals I was tasked with.  Guess what?  No one cares.  Part of the pathway to success is to be able to navigate around such obstacles.  It took me two years to build up trust with her and turn it into a productive relationship.  As a manager, I learned a lot about what <i>not</i> to do by watching her, which was a pretty invaluable lesson.')
