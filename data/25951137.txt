While this is technically legal, I think it&#x27;s incredibly immoral and unethical.<p>And, quite frankly, the short squeezers are trying to do the same thing to the hedge funds. I don&#x27;t think you can condone one and criticize the other; to me, everyone involved in this fiasco have some ethical shortcomings they should look at.')
