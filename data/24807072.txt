However -- and this is big, imo -- the MDMA did help him open up about a lot of things (for example, being a sociopath) and other kinds of darker predilections that he had kept inside &#x2F; experienced in the past. And I think it made him a much better person for it, in all kinds of ways, just getting this stuff out and sharing.<p>But in the end, the relationship fell apart because I couldn&#x27;t deal with the subtle manipulation that he would constantly try to get away with (hilariously assuming that I couldn&#x27;t pick up on what he was doing, which was often very obvious -- a sociopathic trait, being unable to relate and thinking oneself superior). We had a lot of good times, and I think about those days often. In the end I just couldn&#x27;t handle the quirks... which might say more about me than him.')
