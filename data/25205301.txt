The combination of RNA, DNA, proteins, and other cellular chemical building blocks are a way that a cell could be constructed, but not the only possible way a cell could be constructed.  For an extreme example, we could have non-carbon based life.  If that is true, then all of our assumptions about what is scalable and what is not, based on our biochemistry simple cannot be trusted.  So, looking at how long it took for something to develop on Earth tells us basically nothing about how long it would take to do that with this other biochemistry.')
