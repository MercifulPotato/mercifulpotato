The idea being that some component writes into the bucket, and a consumer then fetches the data &amp; processes it. Except — gotcha! — there wasn&#x27;t a guarantee of consistency. It would <i>usually</i> work, though, and so you&#x27;d get these weird failures that you couldn&#x27;t explain unless you already knew the answer, really.<p>Same thing with how S3 object names <i>sort</i> of feel like file names, and that you might use them for something useful, and you design around that, and then you hit the section of the docs that says &quot;no, you shouldn&#x27;t, they should be uniformly balanced&quot;. (Though honestly, I&#x27;ve never felt any negative side-effects from ignoring this, unlike the consistency guarantees.)')
