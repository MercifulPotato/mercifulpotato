Item(by='Groxx', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607717678, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25384247, text='PWA won&#x27;t give you access to random device APIs that you didn&#x27;t open up for a specific use before needing them, which e.g. cameras, payment systems, etc often need.  All that still needs to be native, and that can be substantial in some cases.<p>If it <i>does</i>, say you made a generic shim, you&#x27;re effectively downloading and executing dynamic code.  Maybe not by a technical definition, but that&#x27;s not the point of Apple&#x27;s rule, nor will they care about technical arguments when they reject it.  There are plenty of examples of this happening in practice, I&#x27;m not talking hypothetically - it&#x27;s why they have a carve-out explicitly for education apps.  Even if you don&#x27;t do stuff like that, and stay entirely in the webview, PWAs (unless it&#x27;s actually being run <i>in the browser</i>, of course) are not allowed to make significant changes without going back through review.<p>edit: you can absolutely shrink your binary size with a PWA or similar though, yeah.  There will definitely be other tradeoffs you have to make though, I&#x27;m not deeply familiar with those.  Performance and integration with native libraries at the very least (e.g. map rendering).')
