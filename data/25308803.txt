Here&#x27;s a scenario, though I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the case here:<p>Image that one set of NDA&#x27;d data was included in the paper, that painted Google in a bad light, but a different set of NDA&#x27;d data was excluded in paper, that painted Google in a good light.<p>I have no idea if that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on here.
