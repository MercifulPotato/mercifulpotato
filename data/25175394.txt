I did not say it was proof of widespread fraud, but certainly more than 12 cases.<p>&gt; You say that inspite of this being the US and the election being the most watched in the world from media all over the world.<p>How many countries sent international observers?<p>&gt; You want me to believe that not a single media entity picked upon it and pursued it?<p>I am not asking you to believe that. [0] They did a cursory report and stopped covering it. Media report on PV regularly, frequently lying or misrepresenting the truth, and often having to issue retractions. [1] You are free to come up with your own interpretation for this behavior.<p>&gt; There is a multi billion dollar right wing media like fox and others, that live for these and you want me to believe they didnâ€™t look into this?<p>Actually I want to illustrate that your perception (&quot;One person finding 12 cases of fraud is a huge deal and I think you would be hailed a hero and be on the news.&quot;) is not accurate.<p>&gt; On top of that you also say that the trump administration has extremely credible lawsuits and proof of fraud?<p>I didn&#x27;t pass judgment on their credibility as the sworn affidavits of many witnesses stand on their own, since the witnesses would be subject to perjury charges if what they have said is found to be untrue. However the videos of Raquel Rodriguez are indeed proof of fraud. I&#x27;m not surprised that people who find them inconvenient would latch onto any interpretation (&quot;dramatic reconstrcution&quot;) in order to maintain their worldview and&#x2F;or rhetorical position.<p>&gt; I was discussing purely out of intellectual curiosity<p>To be frank that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case.<p>&gt; if am done here. Have a good one.<p>Yes, you as well.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxnews.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;minneapolis-police-omar-ballot-harvesting" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxnews.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;minneapolis-police-omar-bal...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.projectveritas.com&#x2F;wall-of-shame-retracto&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.projectveritas.com&#x2F;wall-of-shame-retracto&#x2F;</a>')
