They are not required to to do the former (or at least are willing to go to court to defend that belief).<p>&gt; They also don&#x27;t allow users to encrypt data stored in iCloud<p>The article you linked does not back up this assertion. It says they chose not to automatically encrypt user backups to the cloud, at the FBI&#x27;s request. I&#x27;m sure if you encrypt data and upload it to iCloud, they will not delete your encrypted data.')
