The assumption is the more money you&#x27;re willing to spend to stay alive the happier you must be.<p>&gt; Also, though this is a less important point: Life insurance is not only for paying off some fraction of your theoretical lifetime income. E.g., you can buy life insurance policies even after you have retired, even if you have no income. Obviously one reason why you would buy life insurance is to make up for loss of future income; but it could be e.g. that one thing you do is to care for other family members, and that if you died they would need someone else to do that who would need paying, and if you were buying life insurance that would be something you would take into account.<p>If you have no income you can&#x27;t buy life insurance.  How would you pay for it?<p>Retirement income is still income.  You&#x27;re still buying insurance to provide that income in the event you die before your dependents.  It should be noted however that those polices tend to be very expensive as the insurance company calculates that you may not be paying into it for very long before they have to start paying out.')
