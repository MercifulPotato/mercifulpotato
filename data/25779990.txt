Republican voters are greatly over-represented at every level of government. They get more state representatives and senators per voter than average; more representatives and senators in DC; more presidents; more judge appointments.<p>In practice that means everyone else - voters who don’t vote republicans - are getting screwed out of fair representation.<p>And the trend is only accelerating because each incremental increase in power is leveraged to entrench minority rule. For example:<p>- Conservative supreme court suspended the Voting Rights Act, freeing states to deploy previously illegal voter suppression tactics against Black voters.<p>- Senate majority leveraged to pack federal courts with partisan judges, making it harder to challenge voter suppression in court.<p>- State legislature majorities leveraged to deploy extreme gerrymandering, further entrenching unrepresentative  seats in the US house of representatives.<p>- State legislature majorities leveraged to weaken voter protection laws, and lower the requirements for transparency in campaign financing. This in turn entrenches an electoral advantage in both state and federal elections (which are run by states).<p>- Leverage state executive power to further weaken voter suppression. A recent example of this is the 2018 gubernatorial election in Georgia, where the Republican secretary of state was also a candidate, and purged record numbers of voters from the rolls in majority democrat districts; warned the public about a “suspected hacking attempt by the democratic party” on the official government website; oversaw record numbers of voters turned away in democratic districts; etc.<p>In summary, the data shows that Republicans are simply not popular enough to justify their current hold of power. They owe their victories to a systematic strategy of minority rule, which is inherently anti-democratic.')
