In many of them not having an active registration&#x2F;inspection is grounds to having your vehicle seized. Even if it&#x27;s only used on private roads.<p>&gt; What&#x27;s not fine is the government saying &quot;you purchased this legally and in good faith, but it&#x27;s not legal anymore and we&#x27;re going to need to take that&quot;. This feels like a good idea when it&#x27;s something with obvious negative externalities, but it is a wildly dangerous power to give the government. Especially since this power will almost certainly be delegated to the executive branch by the legislature, giving random un-elected appointees the ability to expropriate property without even a hint of deliberation.<p>Sure, except if compensation isn&#x27;t offered.<p>The government currently does this <i></i>all the time<i></i>, it&#x27;s actually how many &quot;public&quot; offices fund themselves.<p>Where is the outrage of this happening <i></i>right now<i></i>? We&#x27;ve already crossed that line.<p>&gt; You generally can&#x27;t punish people for something that was legal at the time that they did it.<p>We also do this currently. It&#x27;s called not having clear laws and having to argue in court and creating new precedent.<p>And &quot;punish&quot; only works if you&#x27;re not offered compensation. If the government says &quot;hey as your representatives we&#x27;re going to ban xyz for this health reason, and provide compensation for buying them back from you&quot; then it&#x27;s fine.<p>Again I&#x27;m not saying the government should waste resources going and finding wood burning systems and seizing them. However the government can ban the operation of it.')
