Of course it’s easier to build native on one platform.<p>Here in the UK, for a startup app trying to bootstrap from nothing, you are looking at paying between £10-£50 per new user install. That’s just marketing. A very small number of those users will continue using the app and a smaller number still will generate any revenue.<p>In theory you can limit your marketing funnel to just target one platform but in reality you need to maximise the ability of your app to thrive on word of mouth and social shares if you want to not just break even but continue to grow after your initial funding dries up.<p>If you’re building a companion app for an existing company with an existing client base, again you absolutely can’t launch on just one platform. Even if you do manage to swing that what I’ve often seen is the iOS app comes first (as that’s what all the developers and company executives have) but the majority of the customers are on android.<p>If you aim for simultaneous launches of two native apps you’ll find the minimum you need is two developers (one for each platform) as it’s rare to find developers that are highly efficient writing for both platforms. People often are mainly android&#x2F;iOS and a little experience in the other. That’s fine but we need to get this app out this year.<p>This can work in larger companies but what you find there is not two developers but two whole scrum teams with two apps, two APIs (for political reasons) and two feature backlogs. Over time the apps diverge with new features taking ages to hit the second platform. Resulting in angry customers “My friend’s version of Monzo does xyz why doesn’t mine?”<p>I don’t have any experience with Ionic but I have worked with React Native from very early after it was released. Yes, we found ourselves writing native modules for both platforms all the time but that’s still less work than writing the whole app twice. However I think the platform has matured nicely now and if you’re building a simple CRUD mobile app I would absolutely put my money on React Native even if you’re a large company and can afford to put two whole scrum teams on the project.')
