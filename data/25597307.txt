The reality is that most teams (or let&#x27;s be real, managers) can&#x27;t be trusted not to shoot themselves in the foot here.<p>Adding more features and more process in general is going to be a net negative for developer productivity. But how well Jira (or similar tools) works for you is completely up to how you use it. Most teams I&#x27;ve seen that hate Jira et al usually have an overly complicated process, with far too many &quot;states&quot; for a ticket, a million mandatory fields, multiple assignees, etc. This naturally results in people spending far more time <i>in</i> the tool, which is time they could be spending actually doing productive work. Conversely, teams that like Jira tend to have very few ticket statuses&#x2F;fields. Standups are quick, sprint planning is quick, everyone wins. Unless your job was moving things around in Jira for 20+ hours &#x2F; week... in which case you&#x27;ll need to find something else to do.')
