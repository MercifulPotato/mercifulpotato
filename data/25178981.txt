Not only that its being eroded by populists from both sides of the political spectrum. Its not really a facebook problem but an EC one.<p>This transgression was found by going over the accounts, not by leaks.<p>&gt; A TV ad, by comparison, is aired publically and you can see it and ask who paid for it.<p>political TV ads are illegal in the UK. Long may it continue.<p>We are also supposing that facebook adverts are actually effective. They have the power to somehow corrupt a morally &quot;good&quot; person into someone that votes for the &quot;other side&quot;. This is plainly nonsense.<p>The real issue is that facebook is a warped mirror of society. without rules and order, chaos and bad actors reign. This means &quot;censorship&quot; or if it were treated as the press, editorial standards.')
