Facts are... facts. That the Holocaust happened is a fact. Denying that fact should indeed not be tolerated.<p>What is caught in the &quot;Holocaust denier&quot; net does not consist solely of people who outright deny it occurred - there are <i>many</i> shades of grey, opinions in this realm are highly dimensional.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that censorship in this case isn&#x27;t justified or fairly optimal (in achieving gross human happiness), but if a cause is just and righteous, it shouldn&#x27;t present a highly distorted representation of objective reality, or refuse to vigorously defend it&#x27;s assertions.  If your case is correct, &quot;in fact&quot;, it should be defensible in the context of a non-simplified representation of reality.<p>If proponents of an ideology (censorship, in this case) are not willing or able to do that, then I would find it more palatable if everyone was just honest and acknowledge that a very rough approximation is being done, for reasons X,Y,Z - I think a fine argument could be made, and this way no fibs are being told.')
