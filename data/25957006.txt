SMD-soldering takes up way less space, which is important in an ultra-portable.<p>It does make sense for some forms, but look at all the offerings of Lenovo, especially for home users - even the bigger laptops all feature soldered RAM (or even the weirder combination of soldered RAM + 1 DIMM slot at a more expensive price!).<p>(Then there&#x27;s the other factor - unless we force them to explore upgradability in such form factors, they will continue to avoid doing so because the current option is more profitable for them).<p>From a consumer point of view, soldering RAM &#x2F; SSD &#x2F; CPU etc. to prevent easy upgrades and make it very difficult to repair takes away control from consumers on how they want to use their device. It leaves you vulnerable to price gauging and pigeon-holes your device to specific limited use-cases only (for e.g. a new recent trend now with home users is to create a &quot;RAM disk&quot; for heavy torrenting, to reduce the wear and tear on the SSD or HDD - obviously with limited non-upgradeable memory that 4 or 8 GB RAM will no longer be seem sufficient and even though your machine is more than capable, your options are now limited to an expensive upgrade by changing the whole motherboard with a bigger capacity of soldered RAM or buy a newer device with more RAM, hopefully upgradeable this time). Apple is a great example of the price gauging that happens to consumers when you have to depend on them for more RAM or SSD &quot;upgrades option&quot; when you are buying a new system.<p>Most of the common disparage against my post here is that 4 &#x2F; 8 GB is more than enough (yeah, just like 640k was during its time &#x2F;s). Perhaps most have forgotten that one of Microsoft&#x27;s business model is to sell their OS bundled with the machines (OEM license). Thus, Microsoft obviously has a selfish interest to ensure the OEM&#x27;s well being (which is obviously in selling more devices for more profit). And so they help them by making their OS more and more resource intensive, thus forcing its users to consider upgrading their hardware (which with soldered parts now means buying a new device). Ofcourse, hardware has outpaced software in the last decade, and with Microsoft also considering a change in its business model (renting softwares), we haven&#x27;t noticed this trend in the last decade. But that&#x27;s another threat we consumers have to live with.')
