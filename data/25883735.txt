Though it is a bit strange to think of Flutter being used server side as it&#x27;s known as a graphical toolkit, it provides a lot of useful infrastructure for Dart programming and you can basically just ignore the graphics part.<p>This is the kind of work we&#x27;ll need to have done if we ever want something like Pythons timeit module available for Dart.<p>Also, really cool to see proof in the ARM assembly that when you enable NNBD, the compiler can take advantage of that extra information at such a low level to increase performance. For example, in the article numIterations is unboxed, because the compiler can&#x27;t be sure it is not null.')
