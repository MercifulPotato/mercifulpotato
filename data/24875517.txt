He was using systems with Free bootloaders and bios etc. before Librem Purism was a thing at all, and has continually been on the bleeding edge of privacy and freedom.<p>The problem is, of course, that he&#x27;s socially Quite Something, and that makes people have a natural level of disbelief that is the polar opposite of, say, the effect that a good cult leader, con man, grifter, or salesman has in terms of convincing people. He has like a -10 to Charisma, except he&#x27;s actually really engaging and interesting, like a street preacher with 150 IQ.<p>The change he has affected in the world is phenomenal.
