It is a bit different. If you could detect that your system was being used in a test, you could yield correct results. Then otherwise yield biased results (perhaps the first so many votes of the day are always correct, and the biases are introduced later).<p>Auditing means things like paper trails (get an automatic electronic tally, but produce a verifiable paper ballot that can be counted in the case of any apparent inconsistencies). This discourages cheating on the electronic tallies because you never know when an audit may take place.')
