Item(by='jasode', descendants=None, kids=[25392034], score=None, time=1607724583, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25391535, text='<i>&gt;Democracy and free speech are intrinsically linked.</i><p>Yes but the only &quot;free speech&quot; that&#x27;s <i>realistically</i> able to be implemented is freedom of speech without fear of the <i>government</i> putting you jail for criticizing the government.<p>The other idealism of free speech implemented by <i>commercial businesses</i> is not possible because <i>we</i> (the collective &quot;we&quot;) won&#x27;t allow it to happen.<p>There is no broadcasting medium (including <i>websites</i>) in any country that doesn&#x27;t have interference and pressure to remove&#x2F;ban content via consumer boycotts, advertiser influence, subscribers, business&#x27; self-discretion, or decrees from government officials.<p>The above list of actors in society is the collective &quot;we&quot; that makes absolute free speech an unattainable goal.  There is no business with an infinite bank account that can withstand all outside pressures to censor information.  Apple has $200 billion in the bank and yet they bowed to China pressure to remove podcasts that supported Hong Kong.<p>If a successful&#x2F;influential giant like Apple can&#x27;t implement absolute free speech, what&#x27;s the proposed alternative corporate structure that can do it?  Nobody ever lays out a concrete plan that makes free speech possible.<p>[I don&#x27;t mind the downvotes but I would really appreciate some replies with <i>constructive</i> comments explaining how commercial businesses can realistically implement free speech.]')
