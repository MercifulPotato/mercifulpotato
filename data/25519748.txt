Item(by='Cd00d', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608743811, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25514586, text='&gt;With a decent down payment (lets say ~15%) that&#x27;s still less than 5 years salary even with interest<p>I recently started a mortgage and the guidance I regularly saw was that your home price should not exceed 2.5 years of your income. And, this is with very low interest rates, esp compared to the 80&#x27;s.<p>I don&#x27;t think I couldn&#x27;t afford the monthly payments on a house that was 5x our household income, even after 20% down and only 3% APR. Then again, maybe I could, but I&#x27;m more conservative with my wallet and prefer to have more cash on hand and other investments.<p>Your cost of living comparison is apt though. Maybe I&#x27;d be more comfortable with my mortgage being a larger % of my take home if everything else were significantly cheaper....')
