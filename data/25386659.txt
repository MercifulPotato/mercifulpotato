It tends to go alongside feelings of not being understood, not having anyone that you can relate to, and feeling ignored: It is also a sign of depression. This is why so many folks will be lonely while surrounded by people, yet not so much when physically alone.<p>I&#x27;ve generally been at my most lonely when my life was unhappy. I went through a short spout of it again after I moved countries, but in all reality, that one was different and I had some knowledge it&#x27;d pass (and it was more positive: I chose this, unlike when I was younger).<p>I have hobbies and such, and this should serve me well into my old age, so long as I&#x27;m able to do things. I vary myself and try to keep decent mental health. (Oddly, age itself has helped with this: I&#x27;m 42 now).')
