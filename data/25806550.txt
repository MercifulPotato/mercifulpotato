It&#x27;s cleaner and more usable, with easier access to the original image.<p>But Bing has unfortunately been going downhill, too. It does some double redirect that breaks the back button, and it often appears to be stuck. And its ads are intrusive. But the worst thing is how they inserted this thing called &quot;Shop for similar&quot;, which is a completely useless widget inserted above the &quot;similar images&quot; sidebar widget. It&#x27;s weirdly dissonant when looking at, say, a photo of people in immigrant detention centers and being offered sweaters similar to those in the photo.')
