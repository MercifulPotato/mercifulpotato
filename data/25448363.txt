This has helped in a number of projects (usually at the clean up end).<p>- Boolean algebra has helped me <i>greatly</i> simplify hard to understand nested conditionals.<p>- Understanding data structures lets me pick the right ones for the problem.<p>- Algorithm analysis has let me take program runtimes from minutes or hours on modest data sets down to seconds or minutes.<p>- Discrete math topics helped me prove a problem that a coworker had spent a few  weeks on was technically impossible.<p>- Again for parsing, understanding the ideas of parsing let me make a number of parsers over the years using a variety of mechanisms. The critical part, though, was understanding <i>what</i> was being parsed and <i>how</i> to parse so the code was clear. I replaced convoluted code with hardcoded values and assumptions about what would be in each part (line, or binary blob) with something more flexible and less hacky.<p>- Knowing how C stores data (stack versus heap) let me fix a <i>lot</i> of code from some engineer colleagues that would work, sometimes, but not reliably because they didn&#x27;t understand how memory works.')
