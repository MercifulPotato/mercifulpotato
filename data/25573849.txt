The most difficult thing is that my frequency range is skewed toward the bass. I have trouble hearing high frequency sounds, but the low frequency sounds are extra loud to me. As a result, most sound is to &quot;bass&quot;y for me.<p>I&#x27;ve been using technology to adjust for this since I was a kid in the 1980&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s: Turn the treble up, the bass down on every radio I own.<p>I recently installed VoiceMeter Banana on my PC and I can use it to do the same thing. It really can help!')
