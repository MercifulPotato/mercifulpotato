When faced with fact-checking or truth that refutes their insane conspiracies, they double down and call the fact-checkers or truth-tellers liars and invent even more insane conspiracies about how the &quot;real truth&quot; (read: heinous virulent BS) is being suppressed because the clickbait article about how &quot;liberals are planning to euthanize all whites!&quot; now has a disclaimer under it that says &quot;this claim is disputed&quot; (a caveat so weak that it&#x27;d be almost funny if it weren&#x27;t depressing how many psychos eat up the totally-untrue headline).<p>It&#x27;s the only thing that is starting to turn them on Fox News for example; though they still watch it religiously, the fact that the most feeble, CYA-grade questions were asked during their brief &quot;news&quot; segment that slightly challenged Trump&#x27;s baseless &quot;stolen election&quot; narrative now means that they&#x27;ve moved from &quot;only Fox is telling the truth&quot; to &quot;well, I don&#x27;t like everything they say, bit they do a good job, like Tucker Carlson&quot; (who is probably the most prominent disinformation propagandist on the whole festering network). In response, they&#x27;ve turned to just any old 2-hour-old &quot;freedom eagle dot biz&quot; site as their &quot;real true sources&quot;, because Fox had a brief lapse of allegiance to the Trump cult.<p>You can&#x27;t fix that with an RFC, a law, or a moderation policy because they&#x27;ve rejected any possibility of accepting the  truth. They&#x27;re thoroughly deceived, most especially by themselves, and any attempt to un-deceive them is seen as a sinister plot. They refuse the truth outright because it&#x27;s not what they <i>want</i> to believe.<p>You can&#x27;t fix it by shutting down or &quot;breaking up&quot; the site where they go to get their much-desired disinformation, because there&#x27;s always another con artist with a Squarespace or WordPress license who&#x27;ll gladly capitalize on having less competition in the &quot;cult propaganda dissemination warehouse&quot; market (like OANN capitalizing on Trump&#x27;s brief lashing out at Fox, or Parler springing up because Republicans started getting &quot;this might not be true&quot; disclaimers on their lies).<p>I&#x27;ve always seen &quot;you can&#x27;t fix stupid&quot; as a harsh redneck insult, but I&#x27;m starting to believe a slight variant on it: &quot;you can&#x27;t fix willfully-ignorant.&quot; You&#x27;d have to change their thought patterns and their habits and often their motivations, and that kind of change doesn&#x27;t come from outside but from the person themselves.')
