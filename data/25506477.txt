Sometimes you need to assume an identity know one else knows so you can try things, fail, and develop socially as a person without fear of harming your identity. People need to be able to experiment and fail without fear of repercussion (obviously within legal bounds of what they&#x27;re doing). I need to be able to walk in a bar, get drunk, and &quot;sing&quot; karaoke embarrassingly poorly and not have everyone at work the next day ostracize that behavior and have video evidence of it (just an example). Anonymity often grants failure and adventure without criticism and the direction we&#x27;re headed is going to stiffle people&#x27;s ability to explore themselves and life.')
