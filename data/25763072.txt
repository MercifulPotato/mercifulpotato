One character says &quot;we don&#x27;t have any footage of real car crashes, but we know they happen.&quot;  At the time of the story, no serious car crash had been captured on film.  Now, because there are so many more cameras, we have plenty of such footage.  A real phenomena should scale with the availability of potential witnesses, not shrink and disappear as more and better cameras come online.')
