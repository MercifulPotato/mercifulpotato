I never sold one so I&#x27;m not sure. My gut tells me it&#x27;s going to be worth way less than what you bought it for even if it&#x27;s in good condition.<p>But more generally, yeah I have no intentions on re-selling this thing if I decide I&#x27;m done with it before it physically breaks. I&#x27;d probably donate it or give it away for free (if someone wanted it).<p>I don&#x27;t see that as too bad tho. If I can get 7-8 years out of $350 device I&#x27;m pretty happy, especially if the next one costs about the same.<p>It&#x27;s a tough comparison tho because a decently decked out MBP is going to be like 8x as expensive but also have way better specs.')
