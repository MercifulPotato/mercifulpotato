Item(by='overscore', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610558397, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25764455, text='&gt; The UK will definitely continue to have open banking.<p>As discussed elsewhere in this thread, this requires a definition of &quot;open banking&quot; which is separate from PSD2 and not what the phrase commonly meant until now. The distinction isn&#x27;t between &quot;open banking&quot; and &quot;cross-border banking&quot; - the distinction is between:<p>* PSD2 compliant &quot;open banking&quot; between TPPs and ASPSPs,<p>* <i>Some banks in the UK must have APIs</i> &quot;open banking&quot;.<p>Up until January 1st, the phrase &quot;open banking&quot; referred to the former. The latter may become accepted as the definition in the UK, but it is materially different to the original meaning.')
