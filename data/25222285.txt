That&#x27;s the wrong model, and it leads to the wrong assumptions and conclusions.<p>From what I understand, this wasn&#x27;t always the case. The belief rose alongside the term &quot;intellectual property&quot; in recent decades, which was itself popularized by media companies who have the rights to lots of information, and who stand to gain financially the more we shift toward conceiving of these rights as permanent ownership.')
