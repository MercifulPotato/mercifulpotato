Do not treat F#, just another language with different syntax especially if you are familiar with Python, Ruby, JavaScript, C#, etc. You have to embrace functional programming as a paradigm....&quot;</i><p>I want to provide a little nuance around this, because I&#x27;d give the opposite advice.<p>Because F# is based on OCAML and an extremely popular IDE&#x2F;framework, it is first and foremost a <i>teaching language</i>. In my opinion, for what it&#x27;s worth, the biggest mistake other F# coders make is running off into Haskell-land and trying to drag the rest of the community with them. Yes, pure FP is love and goodness, joy and love, but that&#x27;s not the place to start with your average coder who just wants to see what&#x27;s cool. Fable and Elmish are<p>I learned functional programming by reading a lot of OCAML books and the only(!) F# book out at the time. I coded like shit. I couldn&#x27;t help it; I came from a strong OO background.<p>But then I figured out that instead of coding everything perfectly, it was more important to finish a little bit at a time, then take a look at functional smells, things like mutation. Sometimes I could fix these smells, sometimes I couldn&#x27;t. Over time I found I could fix all of them. At that point I was a functional programmer.<p>I love these high-level F# frameworks, and like I said it&#x27;s the best way to get folks involved, but wow, folks are going to create some programming disasters using them. Yes, this happens all the time withe every new thing, but functional messes are an order-of-magnitude worse than imperative&#x2F;OO ones. Good luck, guys! The destination is worth the journey.')
