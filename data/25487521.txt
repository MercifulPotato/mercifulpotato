Why not judge it by its beginning or middle instead?<p>It&#x27;s like saying &quot;don&#x27;t enjoy your meal, because at some point later you&#x27;re going to get hungry&quot;.<p>That makes no sense to me.<p>Also, regarding the lack of meaning of distraction and entertainment, it&#x27;s not like &quot;nothingness&quot; (which Buddhism tries to put in its place) has any meaning either.  So I&#x27;m not sure why one should seek to put one meaningless thing in the place of another.')
