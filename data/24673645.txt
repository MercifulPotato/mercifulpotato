Even if it is undo, and rolled back, they will redo the upgrade the next time updates are done. Because of this, there is a growing amount of bad blood against the new edge.<p>And let us not forget the stupid fucking name, having a conversation and researching shit, &quot;new edge&quot;, &quot;old edge&quot;, &quot;chrome edge.&quot; Have the stones to rebrand when you make a significant product change.')
