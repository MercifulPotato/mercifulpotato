I personally also think of myself as someone who cares a lot about himself (selfish&#x2F;self centered??) but I try to channel that in a positive way. For example, I am so self centered sometimes that I know what my goals are and I will not let anyone keep me from it. That means saying NO to a lot of people including family. It however does sometimes means that I am ignoring other people around me and I have to always try and find a balance.<p>Having said all this, I never want&#x2F;try to hurt anyone or hurl personal abuse. I do try to be direct and blunt at times which can come off as aggressive. But that&#x27;s how I roll and I cannot sugarcoat things. Sometimes it works against me. As a CEO, I have fired a lot of people over the last few years and I never enjoy doing it even though I have to be direct about it.<p>Am I a sociopath&#x2F;Narcissist ? You be the judge.')
