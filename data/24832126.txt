That&#x27;s how Discord syncs communities and read messages between my phone, tablet, and computer, either via app or web client.<p>This is a huge convenience over say IRC where (last time I looked) the way to get any client-side consistency is to run a personal 24&#x2F;7 relay on your own server and use special clients to connect to that instead of the main IRC server.<p>Which is the setup equivalent of not wanting a Dropbox account because &quot;you can already build such a system yourself quite trivially by getting an FTP account, mounting it locally with curlftpfs, and then using SVN or CVS on the mounted filesystem.&quot;')
