The advanced typing features don&#x27;t affect the semantics of programs. They just make the type system more expressive so more things can be validated by the compiler.<p>In other words, typescript doesn&#x27;t make the language any bigger. If you&#x27;re struggling to understand typescript code you could just ignore the types, and you&#x27;re back with regular JS. This is different than the issue some people have with a big language like C++, where the sheer number of features can make it hard to get a grip on unfamiliar codebases.')
