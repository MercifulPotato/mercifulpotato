The borrow checker does impose constraints on programming, but at the end of the day it&#x27;s only relevant at compile time, and you still end up with code which maps in a predictable way to the hardware.  If you hand me a synchronous rust code, I can imagine, at least in some approximate way, which set of assembly code would be equivalent.<p>An async runtime is a totally different animal.  If you hand me a block of async rust code and ask me how it will execute, the answer I have to give is &quot;it depends on the runtime&quot;.  This is the disconnect I am talking about.')
