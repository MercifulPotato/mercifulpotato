Rarely do developers desire that behavior (it makes it harder for your app to work!), and users complain about it too (when MacOS began requiring explicit permissions for many entitlements, many users complained about the constant nag screens). Browsers have historically needed to reinvent every wheel provided by operating systems to provide features developers require that can&#x27;t work within the sandbox (cookies, websockets, etc) which prevented entire classes of application from existing.<p>Browsers have enormous business incentives behind them, I&#x27;m not sure why you think that ruins the idea. Google spends gobs of money to prevent anyone from developing a competing non-Google browser, for example. Apple bans any non-Apple browser from existence on iOS and iPadOS.')
