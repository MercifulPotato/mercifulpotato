Kids begin driving age 16 and under that age are typically driven places by a friend or parent, so there&#x27;s not much need for busses.<p>Also: younger kids are ferried back and forth to school in special yellow busses that are only used for school service. So actually there _is_ a widespread public transport service all over the US but people don&#x27;t think of it as such because it&#x27;s run by the schools and only usable by school kids. Some companies run their own busses too for their workers, to and from the plant, to suit shift hours.')
