Item(by='pmoriarty', descendants=None, kids=[25278083], score=None, time=1606925914, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25277681, text='<i>&quot;There is no substitute for eggs at the moment AFAIK&quot;</i><p>It depends on what form you&#x27;re using the eggs in.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any substitute for hard-boiled eggs, or sunny-side-up fried eggs, for example.<p>However, tofu-scrambles make a good substitute for scrambled eggs, in my experience.<p>There are also a million substitutes for eggs in baking.<p><i>&quot;despite many probably pointing me to all the oat&#x2F;nut&#x2F;soy milk replacements none of them comes even close to real milk for me&quot;</i><p>Ok, they might not taste like milk per se, but I find some soy milk and other nut milks taste much better than ordinary milk.. though different.  Many of them do tend to be sweeter, and I personally like that.. they taste more like a dessert to me, which I&#x27;m usually fine with.<p>Glucose is a problem, but there&#x27;s no reason they couldn&#x27;t use sugar substitutes, of which there are many (though unfortunately some of the best, like tagatose, are still pretty expensive).')
