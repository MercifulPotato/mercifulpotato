I think that sort of dichotomy gets set in place because it <i>is</i> pretty hard to get to cheap real estate close enough for a daily commute from most of Silicon Valley.<p>But throw out daily commuting (or even, really, just accept a reasonable driving commute) and many possibilities open up in many coastal cities, especially given that many jobs aren&#x27;t in the cities anyway. Yes, if you <i>want</i> to live in the city, many of the coastal cities will be more expensive but, e.g. Chicago is not especially cheap.')
