(a) and (b) are not talking about the same kind of rewards:<p>(a) : when talking about the equalization of environments, the &quot;rewards&quot; are allocated to areas and groups of people, not to individuals.<p>(b) : the stratification of wealth is talking about &quot;rewards&quot; to individual people.<p>These two concepts are not the same, the mechanisms are not the same, and the justification for them is not the same. They&#x27;re only grouped together as &quot;rewards&quot; so they lead to the false conclusion (c).')
