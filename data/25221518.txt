While initial versions of the Rust compiler were written in C, more recent versions are self hosted and rely on the previous version. This goes for projects like LLVM too since it requires a c++14 compiler to start with.<p>Sure. This part has largely been done for many languages, including Rust: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guix.gnu.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2018&#x2F;bootstrapping-rust&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guix.gnu.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2018&#x2F;bootstrapping-rust&#x2F;</a><p>...and there&#x27;s a bootstrap path for the bottom of that graph all the way from Guix&#x27;s (fairly minimal but not quite stage0 yet) bootstrap binaries. LLVM too; since you mentioned it and I was curious, here&#x27;s the dependency graph of LLVM 9.0.1 on my system, in GraphViz and PDF formats:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;terracrypt.net&#x2F;upload&#x2F;llvm.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;terracrypt.net&#x2F;upload&#x2F;llvm.pdf</a> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;terracrypt.net&#x2F;upload&#x2F;llvm.dot" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;terracrypt.net&#x2F;upload&#x2F;llvm.dot</a><p>(That&#x27;s from `guix graph -t bag-with-origins llvm@9.0.1` on my laptop.)<p>It&#x27;s my understanding that being bootstrappable in this way is a requirement for being included in upstream Guix, so generally everything that&#x27;s available in Guix can be bootstrapped like this.<p>Now, what&#x27;s not done yet is the path from stage0 to building the bootstrap binaries, but that&#x27;s the eventual goal. The rest of it? It&#x27;s not futile, it&#x27;s <i>done</i>. Not all software is in Guix, but enough of it is that I&#x27;m typing this from a laptop running almost exclusively software from Guix.')
