Would you be making the same arguments then because, someone could theoretically download a separate web browser that nobody has ever heard of?<p>The problem with these arguments is there&#x27;s no obvious end to them. They are very much a slippery slope. It ends with people who want to criticise the Democrats having to build their own internet out of their own cables and radios, which would be a de-facto China-style totalitarian society.<p>The problem is the sort of people who now work for these tech firms are fundamentally untrustworthy, and appear to have kicked out or &#x27;converted&#x27; the people who used to work there who were. We are now left with a big pile of infrastructures and institutions that are controlled by political extremists.<p>Unfortunately this means that if Biden does win his critics will claim his win wasn&#x27;t legitimate&#x2F;fair, just like Trump&#x27;s critics claimed about Russia. Except &quot;Trump won because of Russia&quot; was investigated deeply and there was nothing there, whereas tech company censorship is plain as day and visible for all to see.')
