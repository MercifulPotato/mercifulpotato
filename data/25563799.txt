Which means there will always be hot wires at the fixture unless the circuit is shut off.<p>My experience with this comes from people who were from the southern US and who found it very weird and even at first insisted it was &quot;wrong&quot; to run the power to the switch then to the fixture. My theory on where this comes from is that this is a result of most homes in that area being built on slabs and so the power feeds are generally run through the ceiling. Whereas locally most buildings have basement&#x2F;crawl spaces so the power feeds are generally in the floor then run up the wall to the switch and extend from there to the fixtures.')
