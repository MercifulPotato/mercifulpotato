As in, Amazon tasks a few developers to each give 10 hours of time in direct collaboration with the maintainer(s) to perform tasks the maintainers may have in their queue. That way &quot;giving back&quot; for a project you use is specific and alleviats some of the burden of running a project for exactly those projects from which Amazon benefits.')
