Dividends and share buybacks are just a way to return Shareholders Equity to the shareholder.<p>In Dec 2018, MSFT had 92B of SE with a market cap of 1.2T.  In Dec 2020, MSFT had 130B of SE with a market cap of 1.7T.  They earned money which added to their SE, and they returned some SE to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks over those 2 years.<p>If in Dec 2020 MSFT sold all of its assets, settled all of its liabilities, and closed its doors, it would theoretically be able to pay 130B in dividends to shareholders.  The share price would drop by 92% (1 - 130B&#x2F;1.7T).<p>So 92% of its share price is based on its future earning potential.  This number goes up or down as the market expectations for their future earnings potential goes up or down.<p>Dividends reduce SE, which is typically why the share price drops by the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date.  Share buybacks reduce SE and reduce the number of shares outstanding, which increases each Shareholder&#x27;s equity stake.<p>GMEs share price is out-of-whack because some market participants are making decisions based off what they believe the fundamental value to be, and other market participants are ignoring the fundamentals and buying at any price.')
