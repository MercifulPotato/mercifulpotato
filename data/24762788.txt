Then same again to get into Sysadmin, after running game&#x2F;file servers as side projects. Etc etc...<p>Five distinct career changes&#x2F;upgrades over ~20 years inside IT, all thanks to building stuff I wanted to build for fun and that impressing the right people to get me hired. The only IT job I&#x27;ve ever gotten through working my way up in a company was the last one, into Project Management, and that was only due to the breadth of skills I taught myself throughout the years... on all those side projects.<p>If I didn&#x27;t do side projects, and didn&#x27;t always strive for more, I&#x27;d still be running&#x2F;packing cables for concerts and working 20 hour shifts for barely enough money to survive.')
