Bear is a term in the gay community, just like bull is a term in the hotwife community (my wife&#x27;s bf jokes apply here). Jokes happen both ways in WSB, straight or gay!<p>It&#x27;s self deprecating to go against the market and be a bear in the biggest bull run of the decade.  It&#x27;s foolish to do so. I and many others being bearish have lost money. This is the entire point behind GME.<p>Like I said, it&#x27;s all about the financials - not about you as a person.')
