Raw knowledge won&#x27;t buy machines, train people to maintain them, build factories, tune the manufacturing processes, or make relationships with design partners. By the time Intel gets something running with something they pick up and starts thinking about making deals, TSMC will be off profiting from another breakthrough.')
