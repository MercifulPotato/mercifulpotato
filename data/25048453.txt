The startup scene here is getting a lot of attention and the ecosystem is growing. However, I&#x27;ve heard mixed feedbacks with regards of incorporating in Germany.<p>We are considering to incorporate in the US not only because of the potentially more mature investor ecosystem, but also because of talent and addressable market. However, forming a European (or Canadian) company is more accessible at the moment for us.<p>Hence, my question is: if Berlin&#x2F;Germany is really ready to support high-growth startups? or if having a US entity still is the number 1 preference&#x2F; best choice when wanting to create fast growing startup? \n- Do US investors hold back on investing in European companies, even though the main operations are in the US?  \n- Are European investors still too conservative&#x2F;reserved to make large investments? \n- Are there any con&#x27;s of incorporating in the US, apart from the cost?<p>I&#x27;m happy for any kind of feedback or experience in this field. Thanks!')
