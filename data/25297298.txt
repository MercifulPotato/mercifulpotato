Item(by='quesera', descendants=None, kids=[25324964], score=None, time=1607040531, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25296178, text='&gt; A behavior devoid of reason is nothing more than a ritual.<p>Absolutely. But we&#x27;re not in &quot;devoid of reason&quot; territory here, we&#x27;re in &quot;with complex and sometimes impossible to quantify reasons&quot; territory.<p>So here are two people:<p><pre><code>    - Person A is an epidemiologist-statistician who has run the numbers rigorously for his part of his county, factored in the likelihood of inter-county travel, and concluded that there&#x27;s no benefit for any party to be wearing a mask in the specific situation they expected to be in when they left the house this morning, and that that situation is perfectly aligned with the reality of the day.\n\n    - Person B is an average underinformed conspiracy theorist who thinks COVID is all a scam perpetrated by the medical establishment for more funding and to undermine Dear Leader and that it would go away like magic in the summer, no the fall, no the winter if only the media would stop talking about it and 5G.\n</code></pre>\nNeither person is wearing a mask. Neither person is wearing a baseball cap.<p>How can you (random sidewalk passerby) tell the difference between these two people?<p>I wear a mask, no matter how smart I&#x27;m feeling that day.<p>(Note that this is not a response to why one <i>should</i> wear a mask, just a light observation of a positive side effect! But there is value in signalling, even if it&#x27;s just to normalize the behavior so that the reluctant just stop bothering to protest about such a simple thing, and thereby get a jump on any asymptomatic spread that occurs semi-randomly in populations.. :)')
