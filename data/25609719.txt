The problem here is dealing with an entirely novel transient: vaccines for a novel virus exist (or were approved) when they didn&#x27;t before, and people need them now, and then they&#x27;re done with it. The market works great once it has had time to deal with transients and do price discovery, but this particular problem is entirely about transients and price discovery.<p>Think back to the toilet paper shortage, or the mask shortage, or the hand sanitizer shortage, and how long it took the market to respond to those events. Maybe the market is the &quot;second fastest&#x27; method we have, in relative terms. My point is it&#x27;s still very slow, and if you&#x27;re saying that days matter, the market is not the tool we want.<p>(That said, throwing the military at this problem seems fine to me, honestly. It is a special case of throwing the government at the problem; it&#x27;s the branch of the government that specializes in logistics and quick decision-making in life-or-death scenarios, as you point out, and they are used to dealing with situations that arise exactly once in the history of the world.)')
