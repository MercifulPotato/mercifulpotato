Put a small wrinkle on the expensive version so it&#x27;s not too embarassing for the guy who buys the expensive one. That way you get what the cheap guy is willing to pay and the rich guy. Even universities do this with tuition fees. I have friends who write code for the government, and they also raise their prices for the same thing, they&#x27;ve even been told they were too cheap to seem credible.')
