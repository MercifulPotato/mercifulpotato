My primary career is infosec&#x2F;red team, something she’s not playing with (yet) but she’s already picked up a few cheeky habits.<p>My general rule with all this stuff is just to expose them to as many things as possible and if they show ANY hint of interest in something then give them support and unlimited resources towards exploring that topic. Even if it means I’m staying up all night learning some new sport&#x2F;software&#x2F;etc so I can give them a solid go at it.<p>This is what my dad did with me and I’ve grown to appreciate how instrumental that was in me finding my passions early and building both a career I love + passionate hobbies from it.')
