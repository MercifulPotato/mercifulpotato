You own such shares so you can get the consistent dividend (share of profits) as your return...There may be exceptions but in general this relationship holds.<p>In a non-bubble market, the capital gains are a reflection of company&#x27;s growth and expected future profits, thus the stock price is based on present-value-of-future-cashflows model (ideally of course, the reality is often messy).<p>In other words dividends and capital gains are not inherently in conflict, they merely reflect life-cycles of companies. Of course there are a ton of unprofitable companies on the market currently with high stock prices, there is a larger debate to be had on why that is and how to curtail it.')
