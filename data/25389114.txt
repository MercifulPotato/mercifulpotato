I&#x27;d like to share that our Native Nations do not give permission for scientific research of magic mushrooms outside our culture. This is not an egoistic stand, but it is for your own safety. Sacred plants on pharma and marketing industries hands will only create more damage than good. If you are interested to learn about sacred plants you must learn respect from native nations and come, live here and share for a time, then a request to research can be asked to the community.')
