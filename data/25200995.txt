It&#x27;s true that authenticity is higher, but everything else is worse.<p>Be careful though. I have found, like OP, that everything about Amazon has been getting worse over time.<p>Free shipping? Well, if you forget that your&#x27;e paying for Amazon Prime itself. Also, it seems less things I have been buying of late qualify for Amazon Prime. Is it a change in my spending habits or are Prime products as a percentage of all Amazon goods shrinking? I don&#x27;t know.<p>As for the 5% cashback credit card â€” I have the same. But I am increasingly finding that prices at Amazon are not competitive when I look around. Storage bins at Lowes, a good deal more than 5% less than the same product at Amazon. An electric chainsaw, same brand model, more than 5% less at Home Depot than Amazon. I know it&#x27;s anecdotal (and many other things are the same price when I shop around) but I am beginning to wonder if Amazon is getting their &quot;free shipping&quot; and 5% back in other ways....')
