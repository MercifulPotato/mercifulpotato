New procedures and Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) would need to be put in place, i.e. politics.  But there are more tactical teams than people realize. The FBI openly admits that the FBI maintains SWAT teams at each of its 56 field offices throughout the country[1]. The field offices are distributed ideally, so they&#x27;d probably need additional field offices. For example, there are two in VA and two in PA, but none in WV. The reason I am so for the FBI doing this is that they watch their people much more closely, and have a higher psych bar to entry.<p>Also, regarding distance for the North Hollywood incident, the FBI&#x27;s LA Field Office is at 11000 Wilshire Blvd, along with our their office in Los Angeles, they have 10 satellite offices, known as resident agencies, in the area. The estimated travel time for the CIRG from the field office to incident site is 22 minutes by car. That doesn&#x27;t count using sirens&#x2F;lights, or using a helo. The problem was likely being asked to participate, and getting approval to participate. As with many things at scale, tactical or techie, politics is more often a root cause than a technical issue.<p>[1] &quot;Critical Incident Response Group (CIRG)&quot;.
