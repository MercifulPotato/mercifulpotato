If Instagram is likely to lose your data, or otherwise misbehave, and its not the app code but the service itself, it still has a big impact on the app experience. I can&#x27;t think of a single app review that&#x27;s only based on the app code, everything is also about what the app lets you do, the services attached to it.')
