Alternative stores aren’t about user choice; software is in most cases non-fungible. If I need OneNote there is one company that sells it and I must go to a store where it’s offered. Today if Microsoft doesn’t want to follow Apple’s rules they can pound sand and lose out on the whole iOS market. Tomorrow they will just go to another store and user has gained zero choice.<p>Like it sucks that it takes a trillion dollar company and total control of the platform  to get developers to sorta kinda not mistreat their users but the “the individual right to not use bad apps” has done exactly nothing.')
