If there’s a more understandable representation of the number — <i>especially</i> if there’s a more understandable representation — then it’s data and not a number.<p>Beyond a certain amount of information content numbers just become data.  Certainly at the point where counting the number of digits is non trivial.  (There are notations to make magnitude easier to see, but these purposefully delete information content.)')
