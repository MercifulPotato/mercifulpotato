Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608098585, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25438148, text='The submitted title (&quot;SolarWinds use the password &#x27;solarwinds123&#x27; on their Update Servers&quot;) broke the site guidelines badly. Not only is it not the article title (which the site guidelines ask people to use except when it&#x27;s misleading or baity), it&#x27;s not even what the article actually says about that cherry-picked detail.<p>Titles are by far the biggest influence on threads. As a result of this title, this thread is a shallow, frothy rantfest.<p>The site guidelines say &quot;<i>Please use the original title, unless it is misleading or linkbait; don&#x27;t editorialize.</i>&quot; Cherry-picking a detail is editorializing, getting it wrong is misleading, and getting it wrong by making it more sensational is linkbait, for the trifecta.<p>Submitters: please don&#x27;t do that. If you want to say what you think is important about an article, please do so in the comments. Then your view will be on a level playing field with everyone else&#x27;s: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=%22level%20playing%20field%22%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=%22level%20playing%20field%22%...</a>')
