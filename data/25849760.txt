I understand the reasoning behind using .io to represent software&#x2F;saas startups (stands for inputs&#x2F;outputs). I don&#x27;t understand .so though. From what I remember, Notion was probably the first high profile startup using it, and it just kinda took off. Searching &quot;why .so domain&quot; comes up with nothing except a Reddit thread with the Notion founder saying it was mostly because it was just an available TLD for &quot;notion&quot; at the time.')
