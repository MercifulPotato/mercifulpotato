There isn&#x27;t really much of a question of whether we can formalize modern informal, rigorous proofs. Indeed a benchmark of whether a proof is rigorous or not is whether there&#x27;s a clear path towards formalization (similar to how we might use as an informal benchmark whether an algorithm is well-specified by whether we have a clear path to implementing it in a real programming language).<p>As such mechanizing mathematics into formal proofs has yet to meet any fundamental difficulties I&#x27;m aware of. The main thing is it&#x27;s just a slog and few people are working on it because it&#x27;s such a slog. It can usually take orders of magnitude more time to formalize a proof than to come up with its informal, but rigorous proof. But the process doesn&#x27;t really require deep insights, at least not any more than translating an algorithm from a CS textbook or paper into real code. It mainly is just because there&#x27;s reams and reams of tedium that can be encapsulated in a single &quot;mutatis mutandis&quot; or the like.<p>At this point Mizar has formalized essentially all of undergraduate mathematics and is gradually working its way into graduate mathematics. It&#x27;s yet to meet any deep roadblocks and it&#x27;s not anticipated to meet any.')
