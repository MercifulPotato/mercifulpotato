Item(by='umvi', descendants=None, kids=[25462752], score=None, time=1608241446, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25460695, text='That&#x27;s true, one drawback is that it isn&#x27;t progressive, but I would argue that the massive simplification of the tax law would allow the government to bring in much more money \n than it currently does, which it can then divert to social services for those who most need it.<p>As an example of a working implementation of this system, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints effectively taxes all their members at a flat 10% of their annual income, and I thought I read somewhere the church is both debt-free and has a crazy amount of money in the bank ($100B+). Even though the poorest members still pay 10% and it impacts them more than Mitt Romney-type members, the poor members can then go and receive assistance from the church (rent money, food, etc.) if they need it.<p>Of course, with a church people voluntarily give their money whereas with the government people do everything they can to keep their money, so perhaps it wouldn&#x27;t be as effective as I think it would be. However, what is very clear to me is that the current tax law needs to be much, much simpler.')
