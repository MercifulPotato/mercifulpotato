And by &quot;best&quot; ideas we generally meant principles of equality, science, and so forth.<p>Regardless of what you feel needs to be done... I&#x27;m sure you can agree that hasn&#x27;t been achieved. Probably more like the opposite.<p>The problem is that by amplifying <i>all</i> voices, we&#x27;ve simply created another &quot;might makes right&quot; situation. Unfettered online discourse is dominated by those who yell the loudest. This includes a large number of woefully misinformed people, and genuinely malicious actors such as (for example) the hordes of paid internet trolls funded by America&#x27;s rivals in order to sow discord and disinformation during our 2016 elections.<p>In effect, we&#x27;ve replaced the staid and conservative corporate self-censorship of decades past with something that is quite frequently worse.<p>I mean, free speech sure <i>sounds good</i>, but in reality it means that your racist uncle ranting about chemtrails on Facebook gets to be heard right alongside people who actually know what the fuck they&#x27;re talking about.<p>I unapologetically do not know what the solution is.')
