Key words there are &quot;should call&quot;.<p>I mean, yes, those words are in there, but I&#x27;m responding to your words:<p>&gt; Ada does not have destructors or anything analogous.<p>Which are factually wrong. Finalize is called automatically (per the link). And they are exactly what you say Ada lacks, analogues of destructors.<p>Your complaint, now, is that Finalize and Initialize don&#x27;t <i>automatically</i> call the same functions in the parent. That&#x27;s a separate issue, and doesn&#x27;t demonstrate that Ada doesn&#x27;t have this thing (a variant of destructors) which it very clearly has.')
