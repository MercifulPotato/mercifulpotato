Masks did not become obligatory elsewhere and roughly around the mask obligation new positive cases drastically reduced in Jena whereas the weighted average shows no such effect.<p>EDIT: moved my doubts in the study into extra comment.<p>If you think the summary is wrong, please leave a comment pointing out in which way, after downvoting.')
