Just because these people don&#x27;t know the first thing about market regulation doesn&#x27;t mean they have a case.<p>What they did was effectively form a public stock pool for the purpose of disrupting the orderly function of the market, and drive up the price beyond all reason. This kind of thing used to happen regularly a century ago until regulation was enacted in order to stem that kind of abuse. If the SEC weren&#x27;t in what appears to be a coma, they should have enforced those rules days ago by completely halting trading in the stock. But it seems that falls on private companies now for some reason.')
