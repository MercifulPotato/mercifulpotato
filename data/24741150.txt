It&#x27;s still a perfectly servicable language to do the job and it&#x27;s ubiquitous in the industry so you&#x27;d need a pretty strong reason to break from it. The terribleness of the tooling comes from other sources (mainly its sheer opaqueness, followed by bugginess, followed and excacerbated by its slowness, though the last point may be hard to get around: place-and-route is not like compiler optimisation, compiler optimisation is almost entirely local decisions, wheras place and route is essentially a global optimisation problem).')
