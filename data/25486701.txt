This then snowballs as these people pull ahead of others out of proportion to their actual contributions.<p>This makes a Meritocracy an unstable equilibrium, and such a system will not remain meritocratic for long. When other parties come along later, they won&#x27;t be able to displace the incumbents.<p>You might then be tempted to cut off the long tail and hand over the community to the incumbents. But that&#x27;s really going to be a problem if more than half your work is being done in that long tail!<p>Importantly; if you do hand over to the incumbents, you&#x27;ve very obviously just changed into something other-than-meritocracy.<p>My argument is that all systems that start as a (naive) Meritocracy will tend to fall into this trap.')
