Your team should never be your competition. Your company should never be your competition. Meritocracy works only in certain markets. Knowledge-based work isn’t one of them.<p>I really feel for people who are in these companies. Who put in 6+ years of university&#x2F;higher education and think that “if I could only fight my peers for the top spot” when “top” is relative.<p>To someone else’s point, I totally acknowledge that there are certain industries that you have to have a degree to do anything meaningful. I also know there’s tons of companies out there that need bright minds to create the next big thing.<p>I used to think that I was in competition with my coworkers for that promotion, for that top spot, to basically prove to myself that I could and prove to others I should. I stopped wasting time trying to prove what I already know and now focus on what I don’t.<p>Office politics sucks and I refuse to play the game. If I get passed up for promotion or if I’m unhappy I leverage my rights under my states at-will work laws and go find somewhere else to work.<p>The best places I’ve worked where this wasn’t a thing (the elite competition for who’s <i>right</i>) were places that acknowledged your contributions, explained why you did&#x2F;didn’t get the promotion, laid out plans for you to achieve that (or have you on that list for when it opens up) and then actually honors that promise.')
