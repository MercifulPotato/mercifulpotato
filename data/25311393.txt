They do, quite effectively; it&#x27;s just that I don&#x27;t find anything <i>else</i> about the experience to be at all pleasant.<p>To your point about genetic variation, I&#x27;m told I have an unusually high pain tolerance; at that same ER visit, when the doctor came in to discuss the CT results showing the size of the stone, she expressed some surprise that I hadn&#x27;t done any screaming. My mother tells me that she&#x27;s the same way. So maybe it&#x27;s something to do with that? I really don&#x27;t know. In any case, it&#x27;s clear from the responses I&#x27;ve gotten that to generalize from my own experience here is unwise, and I won&#x27;t repeat the error.')
