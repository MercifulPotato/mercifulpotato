I recently stopped using sway because these WMs don&#x27;t work well on large screens or ultrawides. They are optimized for smaller screens, especially laptop screens. I swapped to a 48&quot; OLED and the ideal model really is to center your active window if you can. I haven&#x27;t yet found a WM that handles this as well as I&#x27;d like, although PaperWM is pretty close if a little clunky due to Gnome 3.<p>The other issue w&#x2F; i3&#x2F;sway is you have to spend a lot of time arranging your workspace. It gives you all the power and also all of the work. In comparison, layout based tiling WMs like bspwm, awesomeWM, and xmonad intelligently place your windows in a certain way rather than requiring the user to always decide where it goes. It&#x27;s largely personal preference which you like. I think I prefer the layout based WMs but sway is the only real option for wayland as far as I know.')
