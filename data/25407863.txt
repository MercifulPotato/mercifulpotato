It is raw data.<p>I <i>believe</i> Massachusetts comes as close to capturing 100% of infections as anyone at this point, although that wasn&#x27;t always the case. There is a lot of test infrastructure.<p>CFR can overestimate or underestimate IFR. In most past pandemics, CFR significantly UNDERestimated IFR during the pandemic, because the raw numbers include a lot of people who are sick, but haven&#x27;t died YET.<p>There is a tendency to take CFR, apply very liberal corrections, sometimes multiple times, and get artificially low IFR numbers. Those aren&#x27;t really plausible, even looking at scenarios where we could catalog all cases (e.g. the cruises had an IFR just over 2%, with state-of-the-art medical).<p>My general impression, looking at data, is that the IFR was around 3-ish percent early on, and got better, potentially due to mutations making the virus less fatal, lower initial viral loads due to precautions, and&#x2F;or better treatment.')
