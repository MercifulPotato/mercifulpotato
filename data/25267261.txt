It doesn&#x27;t take a genius hacker to bypass macOS privacy protections: calling &quot;ls&quot; is a script kiddie level attack. </i><p>And doing something useful with it, to the level of malware? Is that also trivial?<p>Also, how would that &quot;script kiddie&quot; do that attack in the first place, if you get your apps from the App Store? If it&#x27;s an independent app, all bets are off anyway. E.g. if they have a serious 0-day to do that, they wouldn&#x27;t waste time with this. And they could ask the user to disable the SIP, enter root password, or whatever as well...')
