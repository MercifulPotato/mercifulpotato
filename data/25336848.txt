There&#x27;s some dumb internet idea that the type of macros are what really matter, so potatoes are bad because they&#x27;re all carbs (not protein). Really, if you want to lose weight than less quantity and less energy density (which means replacing macros with water and fibre) is going to matter a bit more than whether the macros are carbs or protein.<p>That said, yes they&#x27;ll lack some nutrients if that&#x27;s what you were getting at. Some mixed veg would be a good idea.')
