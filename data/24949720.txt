Item(by='wahern', descendants=None, kids=[24951614], score=None, time=1604129720, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24949311, text='China&#x27;s per capita CO2 emissions are still 1&#x2F;2 that of the U.S. More importantly, neither the Chinese government nor powerful Chinese politicians deny anthropogenic climate change. And they&#x27;ve recently recommitted to nuclear energy expansion despite growing public fear after Fukushima and a subsequent rise in costs as Chinese regulatory policies became more strict.<p>Part of the reason for the gap in nuclear construction in recent years, separate from Fukushima, seems to have been growing trade tensions with the U.S. Now that construction and approvals have resumed, it seems like China has decided to ditch almost all foreign designs and only build their &quot;homegrown&quot; AP1000 derivative. Unlike American politicians, Chinese politicians haven&#x27;t forgotten the art of turning lemons into lemonade. Nuclear, solar, electric cars--they&#x27;re using the transition to bolster and develop their industrial sectors. As countries should be making many of these investments <i>anyhow</i> to hedge and supplement the often myopic and short-sighted pursuits of the free market, the net costs to abandoning the fossil fuel economy can be significantly reduced. (In retrospect the contracts for American nuclear plants were probably handouts, anyhow, intended to mitigate balance of trade tensions. But with all goodwill having been burned to ash by the current administration, not to mention the collapse of the American nuclear construction industry, it became a pointless gesture.)')
