It&#x27;s the &quot;authoritative&quot; source for the Google search on US book royalty rates. See further down:<p>&quot;Under standard royalties, an author gets roughly 20 to 30% of the publisherâ€™s revenue for a hardcover, 15% for a trade paperback, and 25% for an eBook. So, very roughly, every hardcover release that earns out brings the author something like 25% of all revenue earned by the publisher. This percentage would drop once the paperback comes out, if it sells in significant numbers.&quot;<p>10% of cover price is usually the same as 20-30% of the publisher&#x27;s revenue. You only drop down to 1.5% territory if your books are being discounted, meaning, if they aren&#x27;t selling at cover price and they&#x27;ve been put into the bargain bin.')
