I imagine the definition of the 100 year old computer probably targets more than &quot;survivors&quot;.<p>The definition of the &quot;100 year old computer&quot; as described in the article is fuzzy and kind of a moving target. In the loosest interpretation anything can be a 100 year computer just as long as you care to maintain it for 100 years. If upgrading parts and building adapters for future technology fits that definition then you can do this with any machine, and the rest of the constraints are just artificial (like &quot;must be offline first&quot;). If you actually want to have as much of the original computer as possible for that century then it&#x27;s no longer feasible.<p>As I mentioned in my original comment, they simply become the ship of Theseus. Heck, my own desktop is that, starting 20 years ago with one hardware config and a Windows XP and reaching now with completely different hardware and Windows 10 with no &quot;full reset&quot; in between, just upgrades and updates.')
