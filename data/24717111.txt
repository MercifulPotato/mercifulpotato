Rather, I felt like no one else could hold a conversation.<p>If you believe the problem is with &quot;everyone else&quot;, the problem really is with <i>you</i>. Nerds generally struggle with holding conversations without constantly sending &quot;out-group&quot; signals while failing to send &quot;in-group&quot; signals.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=6yN2H3--1aw" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=6yN2H3--1aw</a><p>Unlike in this satirical clip, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to fake being &quot;a normal guy&quot;. However, in my experience, it&#x27;s possible to build rapport by being respectful and signaling that you get where the other person is coming from. Avoid being intellectually dominating. That way, you&#x27;ll be perceived as &quot;that okay smart guy&quot; instead of &quot;that fucking nerd&quot;.<p>Even if you don&#x27;t care about being popular, learning how to read people is an extremely important skill, especially if you&#x27;re somewhere on the autism spectrum. Just approach it as another nerd subject (human psychology).')
