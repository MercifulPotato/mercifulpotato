Everybody liked him, but he was too high in the technical chain.<p>We had a long conversation because I simply couldn&#x27;t take the time to teach him--it was a startup in which we simply didn&#x27;t have time (we died about 6 months later).  Either he had to go down a level (including salary) or he had to start looking for a new job.  I was even happy to give him a decent referral ... but for a lower level.<p>He left for a new company--I think he managed to keep most of his salary, but I know he had a downleveled title.  He did quite well.<p>Had I been in a big company with runway, I could have taken the time to teach him.  And it would have likely been better than trying to hire someone new since everybody actually liked him.<p>Managing is about balancing conflicting goals.  If you think managing is easy, please stay away from it--your team will be better for it.')
