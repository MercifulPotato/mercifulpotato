I&#x27;ve had so many misadventures with JavaScript (and I&#x27;m part of the team that writes the Firefox JavaScript VM, so I&#x27;m supposed to know better) or Python, for instance, that the simple idea of maintaining an application written in either language brings me down.<p>I fully realize that some people love these languages. I&#x27;ve written pretty sophisticated applications in these languages myself (including video games), and they&#x27;re definitely great for exploring ideas. But at this stage of my career, for applications that matter to me, I value the time spent maintaining code more than the time spent writing it, and I find that the balance that works best for me is to use a strongly, statically-typed language such as Rust.<p>YMMV')
