No compiler support to help you through that.<p>- Similarly, when the magic blob GC starts acting up, how do you solve that?<p>- What about memory usage being orders of magnitude higher in a GC&#x27;d system?<p>It&#x27;s just <i>different</i> problems. To an extent the line where you have to care is much closer in Rust than Java, but in Java, when you cross the line, good luck. Rust forcing you to be expressive from the get-go pays dividends down the line, allowing you to be relatively more productive, later.<p>I guess it&#x27;s like skiing vs. snowboarding. Skiing is easy to get going, but really difficult to get good at. Snowboarding is really hard to get started, but once you do, it&#x27;s relatively much easier to be great at it.')
