But, what they can&#x27;t do is call up their friends and ask them for some favoritism.<p>In DeFi, we say that smart contracts that can&#x27;t betray users are &quot;credibly neutral&quot;. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nakamoto.com&#x2F;credible-neutrality&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nakamoto.com&#x2F;credible-neutrality&#x2F;</a> (by Vitalik Buterin)<p>As an example, one important DeFi app that is credibly neutral is Uniswap, a decentralized trading exchange that did $700M in volume yesterday. The main Uniswap app is here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.uniswap.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.uniswap.org&#x2F;</a>. Financial stats for Uniswap are available here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;info.uniswap.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;info.uniswap.org&#x2F;</a>. Yesterday, Uniswap made $2M in fees for its liquidity partners (anyone can provide liquidity). Fee data can been seen here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptofees.info&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cryptofees.info&#x2F;</a>.<p>Many tokens on Uniswap are pump-and-dumps or projects that won&#x27;t succeed. Anyone can list any token. Yet, users seem to love the control and reliability given to them by Uniswap and other DeFi apps.')
