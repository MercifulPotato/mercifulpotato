The beaches were packed when I was there (August).  I meant downtown exclusively which could have been better communicated.  I&#x27;m just not used to seeing a downtown look like that.  Chicago was kind of the opposite.  The beaches were closed but the streets were open.  Probably enough to explain why my experience was so jarring.')
