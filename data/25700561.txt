Item(by='marcusverus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610201972, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25698554, text='I certainly agree that there is some substance to the section on obstruction, but let&#x27;s take a step back and follow the thread here.<p>1) OP says Democrats haven&#x27;t undermined democracy since the civil war.<p>2). I observe that Democrat leadership actively pushed the unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that Trump colluded with the Russians to gain power.<p>3) I provide evidence that half of the country believes that the President of the United States conspired with Russia to gain power.<p>The fact that Trump may have obstructed the investigation matters--of course it does. And if he did, he should have been punished for it.<p>But even if he did attempt to obstruct the investigation, that does not change the basic fact that the Democrats actively undermined our Democratic institutions by convincing the American people, with out evidence, that the President was in cahoots with the Russians.<p>I have not intended to assert that Trump is as clean as a whistle, or that the Mueller report found nothing <i>at all</i>. (My &#x27;zero evidence&#x27; claim above was vague and lazy--it was intended to refer to the question of collusion alone) My intent was to convey that there is no evidence of collusion, and that the fact that the American people were intentionally mislead on this point was the result of a concerted effort by the Democrats to mislead the American people and undermining faith in the President (and, necessarily, the presidency and our republic as a whole.<p>It is <i>also</i> true that charges were brought due the the Mueller probe, though none led to any charges related to colluding with the Russians to affect the outcome of the Election.<p>It is <i>also</i> true that Trump may have obstructed the investigation.<p>All three are true. The fact that folks are refusing to address the first fact by merely observing the second and third facts should indicate how masterfully those other issues--which are related to the Mueller investigation but have no bearing on the question of collusion--have been used to muddy the waters and cover for the Democrats&#x27; role in spreading the collusion conspiracy theory, at great cost to the country.')
