Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=[25909489], score=None, time=1611606964, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25907947, text='&gt; Not to mention that in an honest world, why would you even need something like this?<p>The world is what we make it - we are the masters of our own destiny.  This is <i>literally true</i> (subject to boundaries imposed on us by nature:  the laws of physics, the physical resources available to us, the nature of the evolved human mind and the societies we have built for ourselves to operate in, and other things I may overlook).<p>If a variable in the world is not to our liking, and it is fixable, we can choose to fix it (as a collective species), or not.  Mother Nature imposes some restrictions on this, but not many.<p>From the article:<p>&gt; To date, we have conducted more than 100 qualitative interviews with individuals across the political spectrum who use Twitter, and we received broad general support for Birdwatch. In particular, people valued notes being in the community’s voice (rather than that of Twitter or a central authority) and appreciated that notes provided useful context to help them better understand and evaluate a Tweet (rather than focusing on labeling content as  “true” or “false”). Our <i>goal(!)</i> is to build Birdwatch in the open, and have it <i>shaped(!)</i> by the Twitter community.<p>&gt; To that end, we’re also taking significant steps to make Birdwatch transparent:<p>- <i>All(!???)</i> data contributed to Birdwatch will be publicly available and downloadable in TSV files<p>- As we develop algorithms that power Birdwatch — such as reputation and consensus systems — we <i>aim to</i>(!) publish <i>that code</i>(!) publicly in the Birdwatch Guide. The initial ranking system for Birdwatch is already available here.<p>&gt; We hope this will enable experts, researchers, and the public to analyze or audit Birdwatch, identifying opportunities or flaws that can <i>help us</i>(!) more quickly build an <i>effective</i>(!) <i>community-driven</i>(!) solution.<p>If what they are saying is 100% true (and not <i>at all</i> misleading, and remains true going forward through time), this would be an <i>extremely big deal</i>.  Modifications to the fundamental systems we use for collective communication and sense making is the obvious place a benevolent dictator would start to improve the current state of affairs.<p>However, history strongly suggests that this is not only not true, but most likely <i>knowingly untrue</i> (aka: a lie).  I am obviously speculating, but I think this is a reasonable speculation.<p>Speculating sucks though.  I think we are forced to do it far more often than is necessary (under the limitations imposed upon us by nature).<p>So how about this idea:<p>Let&#x27;s say, in the spirit of uniting the country (USA), we make a bi-partisan decision to create a new role for the government: an as-honest-as-possible, process of constant audit of all &quot;major&quot; public communication platforms.  Carefully selected, <i>proven to be honest and trustworthy</i> bi-partisan technical people (from the &quot;grassroots&quot; community) would be <i>forcibly</i> embedded within all major corporations, with 100% visibility into all source code, processes, and meetings (where &quot;necessary&quot;).  They would carefully monitor <i>the nature of</i> all of this software that is exerting such a powerful force on our society, and that of the world.  Where possible (which should be most of the time), their findings would be published for the public to see (and &quot;sniff for imperfections or corruption&quot;).<p>These would be positions of extreme power and insight, and would offer genuine risks to intellectual property and confidential strategy of the companies subject to this treatment.  As <i>a first pass</i> at managing this, these people could be paid <i>extremely well</i>, but they would also be subject to extremely punitive measures if they were to ever behave in a compromising manner.<p>Of course, the flaws in such a plan <i>are numerous</i>.  Reality is complex - we can face that head on and manage it, or bury our heads in the sand with <i>speculative</i> claims like &quot;this wouldn&#x27;t work&quot;.<p>The general goal of this is to <i>force(!) truthfulness (as opposed to honesty) into society</i>.  The world is what we make of it, and we can make this little corner of it <i>how we want it to be</i>.  And if we happen to disagree with the specifics of &quot;how we want it to be&quot;, then deal with it head on: <i>figure it out, and ship to production</i>.<p>As I understand it, all politicians desire what is best for the entire country (and the world - they only differ on how to achieve this), as well as desire to govern based on The Truth - so I wouldn&#x27;t expect we would get any pushback from them (and if we did, journalists would be <i>on it, publishing salacious exposes on the obvious corruption</i>) - that leaves the decision up to &quot;we the people&quot;.<p>On a scale of 1 to 10, how good&#x2F;bad is this general idea?  Is it a complete non-starter due to something I have overlooked (that <i>cannot be changed</i>)?  Are there even better approaches than this?  I have no idea, I am just trying to put some ideas out there for consideration.  At some point, I think we have to do something to alter the trajectory we are on.')
