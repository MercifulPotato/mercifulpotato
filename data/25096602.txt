Then when bob shares files with sue over their respective torrent clients all their packets travel overseas before reaching each other.<p>These tools aren&#x27;t harder for end users to use than netflix or Hulu. VPN services tend to provide a gui app with a big ol button that says connect and a tray icon that turns from red to green.<p>They pretty much have to be content with trying to keep the bus from going there because its all they have. The smarter plan is still continuing to make Netflix and Steam awesome so people don&#x27;t want to bother to pirate.')
