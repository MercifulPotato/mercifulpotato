They aren&#x27;t storing or sending everything they hear throughout the day.<p>This is the intended behavior.<p>But - there is a non-zero rate of false positives (when the device detects something that it thinks is the wake word, but is not), in which case, the audio is streamed to the cloud. This audio could (should?) be used for model training to improve the future precision of wake word detection. But, it could also potentially end up being subpoenaed by a law enforcement agency.')
