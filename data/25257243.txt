Pip old resolver is borked[0]:<p>&gt; [The new resolver] will reduce inconsistency: it will no longer install a combination of packages that is mutually inconsistent. At the moment, it is possible for pip to install a package which does not satisfy the declared requirements of another installed package. For example, right now, pip install &quot;six&lt;1.12&quot; &quot;virtualenv==20.0.2&quot; does the wrong thing, “successfully” installing six==1.11, even though virtualenv==20.0.2 requires six&gt;=1.12.0,&lt;2 (defined here). The new resolver would, instead, outright reject installing anything if it got that input.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pyfound.blogspot.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;new-pip-resolver-to-roll-out-this-year.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pyfound.blogspot.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;new-pip-resolver-to-rol...</a>')
