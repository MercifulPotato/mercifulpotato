One of the major strengths of FOSS&#x2F;Linux is the fact that there are multiple authorities checking the code for bugs and security issues. You usually have at least three stages: contributor -&gt; release manager -&gt; package maintainer. On some distribution you even have a dedicated security team. And on top of that, since it is FOSS you have full <i>synergy</i> across the whole ecosystem. Which means e.g. if the Debian security team finds a bug the Arch team can correct the problem within hours.<p>FOSS needs to play it&#x27;s strengths and the fact that the general case is running trusted software whereas the exception is running untrusted software is one of those major strengths. Which means additional complexity and user annoyances stemming from overarching access control measures only apply selectively to a small set of programs.')
