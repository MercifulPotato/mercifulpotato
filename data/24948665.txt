This process is actually the work of a bunch of folks, and the result of quite a bit of iteration at Oxide. The difference between ideation and prediscussion is both the maturity of the idea and its ownership:  an RFD in ideation will be very loose (and, to my earlier comment, the kind of thing that one might find historically on a Wiki) and without an owner per se.  It&#x27;s essentially a way of trying to create a yet-lighter kind of document for things that are very primordial.  We haven&#x27;t used it too much, but all of this is still pretty young, and over time I would expect more ideation RFDs.<p>As for the typos: thank you! Fixed them in both the RFD and in our blog post!')
