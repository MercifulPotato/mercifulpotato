Item(by='ryandrake', descendants=None, kids=[25574708], score=None, time=1609268846, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25572693, text='&gt; These people were never taught to save away money when times were good, to live within their means, to invest, to do the math before buying a car and making modest decisions, heck, even to have the common sense to know that a daily coffee at Starbucks is a terrible financial decision.<p>I agree with your overall point, but the Starbucks (see also Avocado Toast) argument is a pretty silly trope. By and large, people aren&#x27;t broke <i>because</i> they buy coffee at Starbucks, or have a smartphone or game console, and they&#x27;re not going to suddenly be on the path to riches by giving these things up. These things are small. People are broke because of the big expenses: Health care costs, housing costs, education costs.<p>If someone gives up a $5&#x2F;workday coffee habit, we&#x27;re talking around $1200 per year. That&#x27;s chump change in the grand scheme of things--it&#x27;s a single trip to the hospital in an ambulance. It would take 40 years of giving up that coffee in order to merely save for a down payment on a $250K starter home.')
