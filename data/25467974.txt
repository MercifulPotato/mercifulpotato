That is the advice not because it&#x27;s impossible to roll your own secure crypto, but because it is just much more likely that you will repeat bugs that other people have already figured out, so it is better if everyone is using one library so that when an issue is found and resolved, it applies to everyone. It is still good advice even though that 3rd party crypto lib is probably going to have a lot of unneeded functionality that actually increases the overall attack surface area than if you made your own for whatever your specific purpose is. I think the same logic applies here.')
