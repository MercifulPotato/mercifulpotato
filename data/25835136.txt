But a Graviton ARM is just a bog-standard Neoverse N1 core. Which means the core is going to show similar characteristics as the Ampere Altra (also a bog-standard Neoverse N1 core).<p>There&#x27;s more to a chip than its core. But... from a performance-portability and ISA perspective... you&#x27;d expect performance-portability between Graviton ARM and Ampere Altra.<p>Now Ampere Altra is like 2x80 core, while Graviton ARM is... a bunch of different configurations. So its still not perfect compatibility. But a single-threaded program probably couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between the two platforms.<p>I&#x27;d expect that migrating between Graviton and Ampere Altra is going to be easier than Intel Skylake -&gt; AMD Zen.')
