It&#x27;s like building two houses: the construction of the second house isn&#x27;t dependent on the construction of the first. Likewise, the development of 7 nm isn&#x27;t dependent on the perfection of 10 nm.<p>This perhaps suggests that there is a deep institutional problem at Intel, impacting multiple manufacturing processes. That is something more significant that a big manufacturing problem holding up the development of one node.')
