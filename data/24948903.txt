The size of your team, budget, where you&#x27;re located, etc. all make a big difference.<p>Part of being an entrepreneur is figuring these things out, and I&#x27;ll admit that choosing the &quot;default&quot; options was actually a negative for my last startup because it didn&#x27;t provide what we needed. Doing the research is a good test for how well you&#x27;ll be able to handle the rest of the details of running a business.<p>If you don&#x27;t know where to look for this info, I recommend reading how similar companies (same sector, size, region) started and using what they use. Plenty of startup profiles out there on HN, techcrunch, angelist, producthunt, indiehacker and more. That&#x27;s usually a good compromise to provide choices without too much research.')
