On the other hand, in my small city in the midwest during my adult life parking has gone from $.50&#x2F;hour to $1.60&#x2F;hour, and people have been outraged by each incremental increase.<p>Edit: noted that $20+ is often for multiple hours, but you regularly can&#x27;t buy a single hour for $7, you&#x27;re stuck paying a min of $20 upfront.')
