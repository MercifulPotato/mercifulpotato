These are more amenable to scale-up and machine learning<p>Any particular problems there, that you think can be tackled well by machine learning? I just recently started my first ML project in a fluorescence microscopy lab (biochem undergrad with previous software engineering experience), and while I see a lot of things that could benefit from ML for incremental improvements (which often need to be really tailored for each project), as is the case with most disciplines, I haven&#x27;t really seen anything where I thought that there was potential for something groundbreaking.')
