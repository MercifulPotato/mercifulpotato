The reality is that the rest of the country can only show a preference for one candidate as first choice. Maine submitting a vote for Jo Jorgenson when she can not win the whole election really goes against the principals of RCV.<p>For now it&#x27;d be really good if they specified their delegates to vote in a way to best preserve the total ordering, not just to vote for whatever candidate &#x27;wins&#x27; the RCV for maine alone.')
