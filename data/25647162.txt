With FPGA, the vendor can&#x27;t really know where a particular register is located, or where incoming packets are processed, as it is highly dependent on the synthesised CPU design and can even be non-deterministic.<p>This does not mean that there is no way vendor can backdoor the chip you are getting, but it does narrow the possibilities significantly.')
