Currently I want to spend time on my stuff and my partner&#x27;s stuff. I do not want to pause that and spend all the time on my children. I&#x27;m enjoying life so much, the traveling, personal hobbies, that I do not want to ruin it with children.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to spend months travelling every year, or a week cutoff from the rest of the world, every couple of months, if I had children.<p>I&#x27;m also sure the rabbi has a massive support circle. I, on the other hand, am alone with my partner.')
