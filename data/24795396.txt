That used to be the test in the United States, but since the 1960s it is “imminent lawless action.”<p>&gt; I think nearly everyone finds this reasonable.<p>I don’t know about that. From what I can tell, the US legal system is extremely accepting of speech that incites violence relative to many other democratic governments. I think the current test is unreasonably lenient and likely allows a lot of speech that directly advocates and incites violence.')
