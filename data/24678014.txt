I think it makes sense to have the number parsing owned by the thing which cares about the number format.<p>One example you provide is decimals for currency values but I claim you would want such values to look like $1234 in config files so that when they are reviewed or written, the person reading the file knows they are looking at a dollar value and can be concerned if it is too large.<p>I’m not suggesting that applications write their own number parsing. Just do uint64::parse or parseInt or Double.of_string, or whatever else you need to access your language’s number parsing routines.')
