This is related to some difficulties Amazon Web Services is experiencing today. As of right now, our engineering team is all hands on deck working to restore service. We&#x27;re confident these issues will be resolved soon, but in the meantime I&#x27;m so sorry for any problems or inconvenience this has caused. I know this is not ideal as everyone returns from break, and we&#x27;ll be thoroughly investigating how to prevent outages like this in the future.')
