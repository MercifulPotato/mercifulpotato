Cloudflare and many other platforms like it are closed source and you&#x27;re mostly locked in to a very custom development model, there&#x27;s also no escape hatch. For what you get, it&#x27;s great, I love cloudflare but I also think we&#x27;re in a world where being open source first matters. Micro is open source (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;micro&#x2F;micro" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;micro&#x2F;micro</a>) and that&#x27;s how it started life. It&#x27;s now &quot;source available&quot; in the sense that we use a license that stops AWS from picking up and hosting it for profit without contributing back, but it&#x27;s otherwise completely usable for any purpose.<p>Micro as an open source platform enables the ability to self host, develop locally and move beyond our offering m3o.com. I think it also creates trust and thats something we&#x27;re going to really be thinking about a lot in the next 5-10 years.<p>We&#x27;re also looking beyond the core primitives themselves towards these value add services in the category of &quot;backend&quot;, &quot;logistics&quot;, etc. I think providing a generic platform as a service isn&#x27;t good enough anymore, we really have to push a lot further.')
