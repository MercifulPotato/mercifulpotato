This is the hole in the Wall Street vs. the Rebels argument the media seems to be trying to pigeonhole this into.<p>The first-order losers are the hedge funds who, for some stupid reason, expressed their short view through actual shorting versus through puts and the retail investors who bought at inflated prices.
