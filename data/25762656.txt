Whether that happens in free market&#x2F;social democratic&#x2F;neoliberal&#x2F;ordoliberal societies is irrelevant, when the result is a consolidation of the power of private capital and state mandated power. (We used to call this corruption, but the term feels irrelevant.)<p>I believe a healthy society (under our current paradigms) deeply requires an antagonistic relationship between state power and private capital.<p>(Just to be clear, I believe these are emergent issues, and I absolutely do not claim to possess any complete truth)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ordoliberalism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ordoliberalism</a>')
