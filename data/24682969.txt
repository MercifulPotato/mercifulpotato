Unlike with stocks.<p>&gt; Public checks are at the voting booth, private (publicly traded) companies checks are at the stock exchange.<p>There&#x27;s a huge difference. To change things in government requires a 51% majority vote once every several years. But if you don&#x27;t like a stock, you can sell it in a millisecond (literally). You don&#x27;t have to convince <i>anyone</i> else. A vote is <i>not</i> the same thing as a choice.')
