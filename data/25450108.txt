As someone mentioned, some use numeric symbols that I&#x27;d expect not to be unique, and while I assume most are unique because everyone uses a different format, you will probably have collisions.<p>Even worse is that there seem to be variants (or is it the same stock simply traded on different marketplaces), which may be denominated in the same or a different currency.<p>And getting from one of the symbols to an ISIN and from an ISIN to the symbol is rarely easy. And I&#x27;m not sure if an exchange:ticker tuple always maps to exactly one ISIN (and one ISIN can definitely map to multiple exchange:ticket pairs).')
