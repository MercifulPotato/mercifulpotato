The “Teams” plan costs $150&#x2F;month for 25 people and that works out to $6&#x2F;user&#x2F;month.<p>Using GitHub it’s between $4-21&#x2F;user&#x2F;month.<p>So this means that insight from my source costs sometimes more than actually managing my source.<p>I’ve never worked at Google but it seems like one benefit is that they’ve figured out how to scale the costs of this kind of functionality so you don’t have to run into conundrums like this.')
