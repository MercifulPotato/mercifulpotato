Their special Report on 1.5C AKA SR15 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ipcc.ch&#x2F;sr15&#x2F;chapter&#x2F;spm&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ipcc.ch&#x2F;sr15&#x2F;chapter&#x2F;spm&#x2F;</a>) says:<p>&gt; In 1.5°C pathways with no or limited overshoot, renewables are projected to supply 70–85% (interquartile range) of electricity in 2050 (high confidence).<p>For the 3 scenarios where we achieve needed emissions reductions, renewables are 48-60% of electricity generation in 2030, and 63-77% in 2050.<p>&gt; Energy is sufficiently deregulated in enough of the US that they will sell to the areas that aren&#x27;t<p>In the US in 2020 the majority of new generating capacity being added is from solar or wind: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eia.gov&#x2F;todayinenergy&#x2F;detail.php?id=42495#" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eia.gov&#x2F;todayinenergy&#x2F;detail.php?id=42495#</a>  -- and if you do the math for capacity factors (around 40% for wind, 25%ish for solar, 60% is for natural gas) then you&#x27;ll find that solar and wind capacity generates more electricity than the gas.<p>If the US grid operators and utilities are building all this renewable energy capacity, perhaps they know something...??<p>&gt; in places like TX the power costs frequently go to zero when the wind is blowing and spike at other times.<p>Isn&#x27;t that what a free market is supposed to do -- respond to supply and demand?  Last I checked, we don&#x27;t say that the stock market is broken because it goes up and down.<p>&gt;  that does little but create an oversupply problem<p>Are you saying free excess power is a BAD thing?  I can think of a TON of ways to take advantage of a temporary oversupply; capturing it in storage is only one of them.<p>&gt;  If big battery plants are economically workable then we would also see a lot of companies arbitraging the free wind energy into $ when the price spikes but we don&#x27;t see that either<p>Hold your horses -- they&#x27;re literally starting to do this in Australia.  Batteries were pretty expensive up until a couple years ago: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;us-grid-battery-costs-dropped-70-over-3-years&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arstechnica.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;us-grid-battery-cost...</a><p>Now we&#x27;re seeing a race to install batteries.  Energy arbitrage is only one of the possible income streams -- grid services such as frequency regulation are an even bigger source of funds.  The &quot;Big Battery&quot; in Australia has already paid for itself after just a couple year and they&#x27;ve already increased capacity by 50% and are installing a second one in Victoria.<p>&gt; balancing with gas<p>In the US, gas capacity is mostly replacing dirtier, more expensive coal powerplants.  I don&#x27;t see a problem with using spare gas capacity to help balance the grid while storage gets ramped up -- the renewable generation is directly replacing fossil fuels except when they need an extra boost.')
