AWS will constantly point to their uptime guarantee, except it isn&#x27;t a guarantee. It&#x27;s just a sales tactic that misrepresents the historical uptime of AWS.<p>The larger point is that if 99.5% is the real expected uptime, it&#x27;s vastly cheaper to have a solution that is not AWS, even before you factor in the cost savings of learning their security model and completely opaque billing system.<p>Advertising a product with features it does not have is the classic definition of a scam.')
