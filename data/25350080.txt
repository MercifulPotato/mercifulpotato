After looking at some half-working solutions, the problem changed to being able to find the cause of the broken half, where they came up with the &quot;mechanical technique&quot; for debugging.<p>I&#x27;m not familiar with the method, but the second step, &quot;Think real hard&quot;, is quite broad which allows the technique to be applied to anything as long as there is a problem and solution (steps 1 and 3).<p>1.
