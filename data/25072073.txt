Item(by='soylentcola', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605201722, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25066832, text='My 2011 Honda Fit is in a similar boat.  I have no need or desire to deal with the hassle of replacing the integrated stereo system (god, I miss being able to just unclip the crappy stock tape deck and plug&#x2F;slide in a slightly better one with a CD player), much less replace the car.<p>When phone makers all decided to ditch the headphone jack, I wanted to still be able to charge the phone while also streaming music&#x2F;podcasts and hearing nav over the speakers.  Picked up a cheap Bluetooth receiver that plugs into the aux-in and went back to playing my personal music library from Google Music while on the road.<p>I&#x27;m not a &quot;millenial&quot; as I&#x27;m rapidly approaching my mid-40s.  I don&#x27;t want more subscriptions to streaming services, but I did love the convenience of easy access to my backed up music.<p>On one hand, I try to be realistic with things like this and with Google Photos.  It&#x27;s shitty when you find something that really works well and doesn&#x27;t cost extra.  But I also understand that by virtue of not having an easy drop-in replacement for free (or cheaper than similar offerings from Amazon, Apple, etc) there is certainly value in such services.  Value implies a cost and I&#x27;m not surprised when an eventual price tag shows up.<p>My gripe is partly (admittedly) that I&#x27;d become spoiled by the free service, and partly that these things are only free for as long as they serve some other purpose--whether that is training photo algorithms, rapidly growing a userbase, or just having a product to compete in a market.  When they go away, it makes me feel like I fell for something, even though I was already getting something for (nominally) nothing.  It&#x27;s not logical and I&#x27;m still working out my opinion on these sorts of things.')
