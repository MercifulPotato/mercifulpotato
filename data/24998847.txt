Some claim the latter.<p>Generally speaking, film is a powerful medium through which things are normalized. Think of the shows and film that helped normalize homosexuality or promiscuity and shaped attitudes toward sex and sexuality (often through humor; levity is a powerful tool). They worked. There doesn&#x27;t need to be a conspiracy to make this happen, just a cultural trajectory. The backing of powerful and moneyed industry figures helps grease the wheels and deliver the same message very cheaply to millions, or billions, of people. The education system also plays a role, of course.<p>It&#x27;s just a shame that people aren&#x27;t aware of how their attitudes are shaped by their environment, for good or for ill. Things we grow up with are merely taken for granted.')
