At interview time, no prospective employee should care very much about your company; if they do, it&#x27;s either insincere or pathological. If you&#x27;re asking them for loyalty at interview time, that&#x27;s a big blinking sign that you don&#x27;t know what loyalty is.<p>But by all means, do hire people who give a shit: people who give a shit about their professional skills, about their self-respect, about the quality of their work and about being good people. Eventually, if your company is good, they will give a shit about that, too. You&#x27;ll know it&#x27;s working when they try to change a decision because they care more about doing the job right than they do about your feelings.')
