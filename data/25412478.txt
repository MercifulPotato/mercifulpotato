Sold a good chunk of the shares and watched them double again. I owned Tesla previously at around $200&#x2F; share and regrettably sold those shares.<p>Tesla is tough to value, but I hang onto my shares for a few reasons.<p>#1 I&#x27;ve profited enough that I&#x27;ve been able to cash out my original stake. Right now any investment in Tesla is house money.<p>#2 Tesla is in a fairly unique position to gain from a lot of strong trends right now. Electric cars are just part of it. Tesla has their hands in a lot of the technology required for green power. Energy storage, solar, Tesla has their hands in it all. We&#x27;re at the beginning of the curve on almost all of these technologies and Tesla has a pretty strong competitive advantage.<p>#3 Elon Musk. I&#x27;m not a fan of many of the things he says and does, but he seems to have a talent for coming out on top and being ahead of the technology curve. I would honestly prefer owning SpaceX to Tesla, but since Tesla is the only Musk company which is public, I&#x27;m content with a piece of it.<p>#4 Cars. The idea that VW&#x2F; GM&#x2F; Ford would leap frog Tesla once they started competing hasn&#x27;t happened. Almost all the Tesla competitors either have far lower ranges, higher prices, or sometimes both.<p>I have no idea if Tesla is worth 1&#x2F;3 of what the rest of the auto industry is worth. But a giant chunk of auto industry infrastructure is going to be obsolete within the next 30 years even as Tesla is perched to continue growing so perhaps this isn&#x27;t too odd.')
