That is where we are right now; a small number of big tech companies are acting as a ministry of truth.<p>Due process is a mechanism to check the power of large organizations. It does not create a ministry of truth, it restrains it.<p>In fairness to big tech; they have been restrained thus far (at least as far as the current political issues are concerned), but the lack of due process is concerning because if the ministry of truth decides to become more aggressive, there is no mechanism to restrain it.')
