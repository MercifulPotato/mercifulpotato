Always turned it off on all windows machines - it might be just me but it&#x27;s harder to find what I&#x27;m looking for 80% of the time.<p>What&#x27;s worse is that windows seems to find some sneaky way to turn it back on for some folders. Have multiple registry tweaks to show every folder in &quot;details&quot; mode that I have to run every couple of months for some reason to keep it that way!')
