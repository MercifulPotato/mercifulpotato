Yes, that&#x27;s a tiny subset of those available on proprietary platforms.<p>&quot;Popular VSTs&quot; feels like a wierd thing to say. I would doubt there is enough overlap in people&#x27;s plugin use to every really create particularly popular ones. There are thousands of plugins available on Linux, both libre, gratis and proprietary. And even if I do not recommend the approach, many (not all) Windows VST plugins can be used on Linux. Yes, you cannot use plugins from companies that choose not support Linux without some hurdle hopping, and yes, that means that &quot;well known&quot; and not-easily replaceable plugins like those from Izotope and Native Instruments are generally out of reach.')
