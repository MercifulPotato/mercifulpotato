Item(by='gumby', descendants=None, kids=[25435731], score=None, time=1608053340, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25431766, text='Thanks, yes: Tolkein was quite a catholic (a bit oddly, given his upbringing  -- perhaps due to his deep conservatism?).  I had not known he had converted Lewis!  That might explain Lewis&#x27; desire to write his explicitly catholic books.<p>That being said, apart from one letter in which he talked about christian influence, Tolkein was enamored, and his philological work concentrated on, Northern European pre-christian languages and cultures.  Remember the Inklings recited the Sagas in old Icelandic at his encouragement.  There are no popes, even by metaphor, in Middle Earth; no transubstantiation nor rebirth.  In fact the destruction of the ring restores nothing.<p>It was in the intent and structure of their work that there was a gulf.  I certainly didn&#x27;t intend to imply that they were in any way personally estranged (though Carpenter wrote that T was a miffed at Lewis&#x27; success with his much less complex books).<p>Lewis&#x27;s fiction (the Narnia books, Hideous strength etc) may not have risen to the level of &quot;propaganda&quot; in its modern sense, but they were explicitly intended to be at least &quot;persuasive writing&quot;.  I don&#x27;t see Tolkein&#x27;s as that at all.')
