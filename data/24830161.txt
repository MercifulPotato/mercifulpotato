All of these arguments are things that people have been talking about when I was there 20 years ago.<p>There&#x27;s no crankery about it.  It&#x27;s just now--all of a sudden the effete sensibilities of San Franciscans are affected by these problems.  <i>Oh we care now.</i><p>What is remarkable, and I know you won&#x27;t listen, but is to consider that perhaps a certain worldview got this wrong.  When information goes one way, from privileged to unprivileged, the unprivileged know more than the privileged.  They know both the situation of the privileged (because the privileged are sure to tell them) as well as their own.  People in the Central are directly affected by this stuff constantly.  It&#x27;s the reason they&#x27;d leave and make a new state if the Bay Area wasn&#x27;t holding them hostage.')
