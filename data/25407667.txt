Because the ecosystem has less money, and therefore developers to polish it.<p>P.S. Linux, by it&#x27;s open nature, encourages users to tweak many things on the OS. This also helps to surface edge case bugs that were not encountered earlier. I doubt most users would encounter even 20% of the bugs they hit if they bought a linux machine from a vendor that sells them with pre-installed linux, hence guaranteeing hardware compatibility, and then didn&#x27;t change key settings, meaning their user work-flows would be on paths tested by the developers. But where&#x27;s the fun in that? :p')
