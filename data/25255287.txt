But there is a &quot;correct&quot; solution imho, which is to write:<p><pre><code>    try { \n        ....\n    }\n    catch (IOException e) { throw new RuntimeException(e); }\n</code></pre>\nIt asserts &quot;I believe this error can never happen - so if it does, just re-raise it and it&#x27;ll get to the top level and the request or program will terminate - which isn&#x27;t a problem, as, as I&#x27;ve said, this can never happen&quot;.<p>As we all know here, sometimes things that can never happen do happen e.g., as you stated, you initially wrote the program knowing it took a stream based on a string, but later that got changed to something that reads from a network. Having that error raised and logged top-level is the ideal outcome if such a mistake is made.<p>This syntax is verbose and I do wish there were a better syntax (e.g. Lombok @SneakyThrows is a hack which improves the situation somewhat) but the approach is the correct one.<p>And it also shows that you&#x27;ve thought about the exception. I even often find myself putting a little comment, mainly meant for future developers reading the code to whom it might not be obvious why this could never happen:<p><pre><code>    &#x2F;&#x2F; Can never happen: Stream is always a string\n    catch (IOException e) { throw new RuntimeException(e); }</code></pre>')
