That figure was for the one vaccine in one country which appears to be the <i>only</i> example in most people&#x27;s living memory of a vaccine <i>possibly</i> causing long-term side effects (it&#x27;s not even proven the vaccine was the cause). There have been tens of billions of vaccines given during this time period and this is the only example where there <i>may</i> have been long term side effects.')
