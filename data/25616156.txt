Even if that were the case, my argument is that the three pieces bolster work together.<p>Just like if I named a game &quot;Alcohol&quot; and the logo was a glass with some liquid in it, and the tagline was &quot;Have a good time&quot;. Individually none of those would necessarily be promoting drinking alcohol. After all, alcohol has uses for cleaning, and the glass is just a glass, and &quot;Drink in the fun&quot; is just describing what it&#x27;s like playing the game. But if you put them together, they unequivocally do.<p>As for there being legitimate uses of amphetamines, I&#x27;m not saying there aren&#x27;t (I&#x27;m well aware of these uses, personally). That doesn&#x27;t mean the off-label uses are legal. AFAIK, at least in the US, using amphetamines solely to &quot;keep awake&quot; is an illegal usage, and the tagline is referring specifically to that.')
