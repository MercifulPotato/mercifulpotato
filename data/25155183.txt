Just look at Microsoft, they have long been the champions of anticompetitive behaviour and yet they didn&#x27;t really use advertising as a revenue model until recently.<p>&gt; Google will try to make you happy insofar as it helps them get more money from their paying customers, but the moment there’s a conflict between between the needs of their users and the needs of their customers, the paying customers will always win.<p>The needs of the users <i>are</i> the needs of the paying customers, that is what I am saying. Without the users there is no opportunity to have paying customers, period.<p>&gt; your relationship with Google has more in common with a cow’s relationship with Nike than a shoe owner’s relationship with Nike.<p>No, that is a totally misleading analogy and I think it perfectly demonstrates what is wrong with this argument. Users <i>choose</i> to use Google products in exchange for ad impressions.')
