In addition, there is logic to deter brute force attacks (e.g. after 10 guesses wipe my device)<p>nitpick: it&#x27;s not just a &quot;long salt&quot;, the &quot;salt&quot; is burned into the phone&#x27;s security processor (trustzone or secure enclave) and can&#x27;t be extracted so any attempts must be made using the exact phone. Using a gpu cracking cluster wouldn&#x27;t help, for instance. AFAIK the anti-guessing logic is also implemented like this, otherwise you can just extract the salt and make unlimited attempts since the phone can&#x27;t keep track of how many attempts you made.')
