The humidity in my bedroom has been dipping down to 20-30%, and I prefer it to be 40-50%.<p>I started with distilled water, and it worked great - the wick&#x2F;filter stayed in pristine shape for the 3 weeks I did so.  However, buying distilled water was about twice as expensive as changing the filter every two weeks: $0.99&#x2F;gal at 1-2 gal&#x2F;day vs a $6.99 Walmart-brand filter.  I haven&#x27;t looked around to see if I can find cheaper reverse-osmosis water.<p>I have not had to clean the fan yet, but that does seem difficult.<p>My biggest issue is the fan noise. The machine only works <i>well</i> when set to the highest speed, but the fan is quite loud at that setting.  I have the machine a few feet away from my bed, and High makes it hard to sleep.  Medium&#x2F;Low are no problem, so I just leave it on all the time on Medium.<p>Refills are only an issue if you carry the tank by the handle.  I only use the handle to take it out of&#x2F;put it into the unit, and carry it upside-down in my arm when taking it to the bathroom to refill.')
