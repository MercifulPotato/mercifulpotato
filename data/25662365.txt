Though if you&#x27;ve picked up computing from almost the ground up (soldering, hardware hacking, low-level programming, of which I did only a little however), there&#x27;s that experience when sitting in front of an overwhelming, notebook-melting IDE where you say to yourself &quot;I don&#x27;t need all those arbitrary abstractions; I&#x27;ve got a pretty good understanding of what I want to achieve, thank you very much&quot; and realize the cognitive overhead can become a net-negative compared to the perceived problems that modern IDEs are attempting to solve. Matter of taste, of course.<p>As to XML, matched end-element tags (if that&#x27;s what you mean) actually were a simplification compared to SGML from which XML was derived&#x2F;subset. In SGML, you can omit&#x2F;infer end-element tags or can type &quot;&lt;&#x2F;&gt;&quot; to make SGML auto-close the most recent element. I agree the verbose-ness of XML looks especially redundant since it&#x27;s always the most recent element you have to close anyway whereas SGML (in principle, at least) has overlapping (&quot;concurrent&quot;) markup. And I can assure you that around 1998 we had 32bit color monitors and IDEs didn&#x27;t look all that different from today ;)<p>But back to the topic, I believe a lot of material has simply vanished from the &#x27;net, or isn&#x27;t accessible through search engines anymore.')
