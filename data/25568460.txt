To me, it makes perfect sense, that somebody who wants to go to e.g. a music festival in 2022 without a face mask, should be able to prove that he is vaccinated (assuming vaccinated people are not infectious, which still needs to be shown, but this is quite likely).<p>Keeping a record of those who refused vaccination might not be necessary for this. In fact, somebody who refused vaccination is as much as a health risk as somebody who has not (yet) the possibility to get vaccinated.<p>But vaccinated people should have the possibility to prove that they are vaccinated and current social distancing rules should no longer apply to these people.')
