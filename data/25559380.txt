I believe CVs are like that whereas my resume is a 1 pager that only has my last decade of SUPER relevant experience listed; my last 3 SR Eng roles.<p>I could submit a 3 page resume with all of my sysadmin, etc jobs on it but then I would definitely be aging myself, even worse because my career actually started when I was 16 (I only mention this in casual interviews). If I started back then it&#x27;d probably look like I was 42+ on paper but at that point it&#x27;s kind of more of a &quot;why is this person listing irrelevant skills from 2005?&quot;<p>Unfortunately I think that&#x27;s the expectation with CVs? The ones I&#x27;ve seen look like they&#x27;re describing the persons entire life to me.')
