Being novel, smart, well performed etc are all naturally important considerations.<p>But when you listen to music for hours while working, studying, workout out, either alone or through headphones ... music is no longer art exactly. Music becomes a tool which helps us guide our own moods or quality of attention. Music becomes a cognitive aid.<p>My desk is bad as sculpture. My documentation is bad as literature. My thinking-music is generally bad as art-music.')
