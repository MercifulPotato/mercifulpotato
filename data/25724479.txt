Politics is going to be messy. There&#x27;s a lot of fait-accompli-as-fiat. But while there are two parties, there is no inherent need for the parties to be symmetrical. There is no equivalent person on the left to Giuliani, because he&#x27;s meaningfully facilitated illegal insurrection against a peaceful transition, while in power.<p>I hear things like this, and I think it would be great if corporate policy in general were appeal-able to the government the banned person resides in. People get put into corporate jails and excluded from service wrongly all the time. That&#x27;s a conversation I&#x27;m willing to have. But the like of Bannon and Giuliani have just been fleeing from platform to platform as their detestable ideas and statements finally catch up with the strong stomachs of advertisers. The government shouldn&#x27;t be overriding private corporations who make an ethical objection in the face of boycott, without a very clearly laid out due-process.')
