Kind of insulting. I&#x27;m commenting the way I see it.  Suppressing a story is kind of the very antithesis of open debate.  And its not just the Intercept, this is a pattern across like-minded partisan media.  I understand you don&#x27;t like the story - which is fine - but, please, just don&#x27;t say I&#x27;m operating in bad faith.')
