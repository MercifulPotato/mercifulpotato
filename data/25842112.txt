Item(by='monksy', descendants=None, kids=[25842359], score=None, time=1611111642, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25841962, text='&gt; If Sony prints and distributed TLOU2 for $5 and sells it at GameStop for $60 they make like $40 give or take.<p>Game dev company makes a sale.<p>&gt; GameStop for like $20. GameStop can resell it for $55 and pocket every penny.<p>Gamestop and previous customer engage in a private transaction. Gamestop accepts that the game may not sell at $55<p>Gamestop now lists it in their supply in _used_ condition and certifies it&#x27;s playablity.<p>&gt; Game developers respond with digital, micro transactions, tack-on half-assed multiplayer, etc.<p>That has nothing to do with the Gamestop&#x27;s business decisions after they sold the new copy. The studio is trying to milk it for more money post sale. (Also don&#x27;t forget season passes&#x2F;online fees etc)<p>&gt; GameStop is a middle-man that seeks to prevent as many dollars as possible from going to the actual content creators.<p>They performed that original sell. I&#x27;m not sure how this is preventing content creators from making money.<p>&gt; Sony can print an infinite number of TLOU2 copies for almost nothing. They could let you download the game for less than a nickel. Obviously you can not make a game like TLOU2 if you only charge a nickel to play it.<p>But they don&#x27;t. They&#x27;ll still charge you $60 (same as in store pricing) for the online download. (Even though it&#x27;s less valuable and more risky about how they feel about you that day)<p>I still don&#x27;t understand your point here. Once the content producer&#x2F;retailer makes a sale.. _you_ _do_ _not_ _own_ _that_ _copy_ _any_ _more_. That&#x27;s the entire sales transaction. You can&#x27;t dictate a private transaction after the fact.')
