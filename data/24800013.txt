I honestly don’t remember anything about any of them<p>Not surprising. What do you remember?  Probably mostly the stuff where your teacher knocked it out of the park and did their best work.<p>1984 is a cautionary tale about communism but it applies to authoritarianism in general. A very left leaning state is simply going to have less people equipped to teach this lesson well than a right leaning state.  It&#x27;s really, really hard to do a good job teaching something that is ideologically uncomfortable.<p>Say you have two english teachers, one grew up in the suburbs of NYC and one grew up in the Virginia panhandle.   Who do you think has better odds of being able to knock a lesson about authoritarianism out of the park?<p>Education systems are the average of the people that make them up.  If you grew up somewhere where the dangers of strong government was the local ideological blind spot you probably didn&#x27;t get a good education on the dangers of big government.  The kids growing up in the Virginia panhandle have blind spots in their education too, just different ones.  Don&#x27;t expect kids growing up in the plains state to get too good of an education on the Indian wars.  Don&#x27;t expect the kids in the bible belt to spend much time talking about evolution.  Obviously there&#x27;s always outliers but education is a product of the states that make the curriculum and the teachers who teach them.')
