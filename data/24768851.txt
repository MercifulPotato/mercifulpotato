The MagSafe (should make it just as nice to charge while using the phone) and dropping earpods in the packaging kind of confirms a suspicion I&#x27;ve had that they really, really want to get rid of the port all-together on iPhones. They&#x27;ve switched to USB-C on iPad.. there it makes sense, they&#x27;re making it more like a laptop. But phones will go all-wireless. Like, there&#x27;s no other logical explanation now considering they&#x27;re going all-in on USB-C on MacBooks and iPads.<p>They don&#x27;t want to do the switch now because they don&#x27;t want to send the wrong signal to accessory makers. They want them to focus on Bluetooth and wireless charging.<p>If they knew it&#x27;d take this long to get here, maybe they&#x27;d have switched to USB-C at an earlier stage. I know there were many blunders and delays with things like wireless charging and Bluetooth 5 audio. So the situation has become kind of awkward.')
