First, I don&#x27;t believe people can make choices in any kind of isolation. If you believe you are making a choice without your ego involved, you have simply deceived yourself. Congrats, you have a high functioning ego. Second, even if they could, audiences are not capable of concluding with any reasonable certainty which is motivating someone appearing on television. I don&#x27;t mean that derisively, like people are stupid, I mean it is essentially beyond humans to do this.<p>IMO, in the absence of actionable information, it is pointless to speculate. Basically, you cannot know it so it&#x27;s not worth thinking about.')
