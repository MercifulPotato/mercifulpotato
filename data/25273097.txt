Item(by='souprock', descendants=None, kids=[25273136], score=None, time=1606881491, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25272986, text='I don&#x27;t see it as &quot;looking for a bootcamp&quot;, and that sure sounds classist in a bad way. Bootcamps are highly non-standard and usually weak, with very little time spent on the fundamentals of computing. (building an OS or compiler, theory of computation, etc.) Wanting to avoid college nonsense isn&#x27;t the same as wanting a bootcamp. It is legitimate to want a 4-year degree that is 100% meat, no fluff. The desired degree would be like a BS plus MS, minus the AA that is built into every BS.<p>There are an awful lot of people wanting that. Schools don&#x27;t want to offer it because the instructors would be costly, because demand for BS&#x2F;MS combined degrees would go down, because administrators personally love non-technical subjects, and so on. Standardization and accreditation are additional barriers to giving students what students want, though conveniently both are under the influence of the schools.')
