I think of it more like borrowing from the functional programming paradigm to gain better control over state and corresponding UI behaviours and appearances, at least where it’s useful to do so, and otherwise it’s not very functional at all. It feels like a very borrowed term. There is heaps of non functional programming involved in React code bases.')
