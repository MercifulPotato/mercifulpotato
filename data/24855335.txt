Basically what you&#x27;re advocating is fighting misleading claims by politicians by creating your own, even more misleading (at least the politicians talk about unemployment when they say &quot;unemployment&quot;) metrics which makes even harder for the voter to understand what is going on because it mixes a half-dozen of different societal problems into one number.<p>&gt; if you look at the &quot;true&quot; unemployment, i.e., what that voter is thinking, which is how poor are Americans overall<p>Unemployment is not a measure how poor people are. While unemployment <i>can</i> lead to poverty, it&#x27;s not the same as poverty. It&#x27;s like saying &quot;we&#x27;ll add a number of sick people, obese people, people not working out, old people, people eating too much sugar, people not eating enough vegetables, people who smoke and people who drink alcohol - and call it &#x27;true health index&#x27; and will demand to treat this number as if all these people were actually sick&quot;. Somehow you think it&#x27;s more clear this way?<p>&gt; well you&#x27;d actually see a pretty glooming picture with a large number of Americans living below poverty<p>There already are statistical measures of poverty. You don&#x27;t need to call them &quot;true unemployment&quot;. Call them &quot;measures of poverty&quot;.')
