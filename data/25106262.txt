There&#x27;s an immediate procedural consequence that disadvantages the local area and may result in concentrated unrest.<p>If your count in the US doesn&#x27;t finish, the relevant [Congressional] term doesn&#x27;t start until January 3rd, 2021. As such, there&#x27;s no immediately comparable procedural consequence.<p>The Electoral College doesn&#x27;t cast its votes until December 14th.<p>The Supreme Court won&#x27;t get involved, to hurry you up, until December 8th.<p>Correctly postmarked ballots will (in some states) still be counted if they arrive late, up to November 23rd.<p>Today is still November 15th. \nIn theory, not all the votes have even arrived to be counted yet.')
