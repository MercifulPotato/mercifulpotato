There is no free lunch, the contaminate-for-profit entities and their enablers know full well. Someone else will pay the price, for example the health care system. I see many people blame the &quot;government&quot; here but that is the easy way out. There are local, federal governments and so forth. The first blame should go to the polluters who made sure to this day that there is no effective regulation worth its salt.')
