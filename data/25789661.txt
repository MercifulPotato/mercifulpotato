Tabs will not close, I couldn&#x27;t open any new tabs etc. So it was a non-starter for me, hopefully this is an isolated issue. A bit of a shame because purely from a browser frame UI perspective I found it refreshing (however I do dislike the left&#x2F;bottom bars). But one thing that irritated me is the right-click menu doesn&#x27;t appear until you release the mouse rather than just when pressed. I do however acknowledge that&#x27;s an entirely pedantic issue of personal preference.')
