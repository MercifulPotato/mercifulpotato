So it was never really the <i>hardware</i> that held back gaming on Mac, but the fact that from a game-development perspective it&#x27;s an esoteric platform that has limited or no support for the main industry standard APIs (DirectX, Vulkan, etc).<p>It was never worth the effort for most game developers to bother porting games to the Mac because writing a custom port for Metal was way too expensive to justify for such a niche market.<p>But now with Apple Silicon, that all changes. If you&#x27;re going to port your game to iOS (and that&#x27;s surely tempting - it&#x27;s a huge platform&#x2F;market with powerful GPUs and a &quot;spendy&quot; customer base) then you basically get Mac for free with close to zero additional effort.')
