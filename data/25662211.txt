We&#x27;ve got no reason to think they have changed their minds on this. The police were underprepared and overwhelmed by protesters (terrorist, coupists, whatever), they also chose not to fire on these protesters, so this happened. Let the police get it under control, let the election get certified (whenever and where that happens), and then we can begin to sort this mess out. That process may yet involve the National Guard, but their role and objective should be crystal clear.')
