And users? This seems like &quot;avoid success at all costs&quot;.<p>The way I see it there are two kinds of potential AGPL software users and contributors:<p>1. Those who have not read and&#x2F;or understood the license, and just go with it. They likely will be fine, because who&#x27;s going to sue John Doe who built his first website in PHP, but didn&#x27;t publish his AWS script for launching mongoDB?<p>2. People who nope the fuck out when they read the license, and don&#x27;t become contributors or users.<p>(1) are violating the license. (2) are not using it at all. So what an AGPL software author does is take the pool of potential users and contributors, and divides them into those who nope out, and those who violate the license.<p>And is that really good honest work you can be proud of? That reminds me more of the music industry of 15 years ago. They gave their customers two options: Have to deal with spinning plastic, or pirate. In this comparison the former is &quot;nope, guess I won&#x27;t listen to that band, then&quot;.<p>AGPL software authors often make the point you are: Well nobody is using plastic, and so what if they pirate the software? They&#x27;re not profiteering on it, and it was free anyway.<p>Just make a license that says it&#x27;s not allowed to be used by companies of size greater than X.')
