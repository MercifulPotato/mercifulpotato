Crazy is a subjective cultural term applied to people who exist on some margin of polite society. Crazy people aren&#x27;t bad, even if the term is intended to denigrate.<p>To me, all radical libertarians are crazy. But the fact that he <i>also</i> doesn&#x27;t have a grasp on what is acceptable social decorum (don&#x27;t simulate nasal sex at dinner, don&#x27;t make an apologist argument for pedophilia in public, etc) is probably what makes other people reach for &#x27;crazy&#x27;.')
