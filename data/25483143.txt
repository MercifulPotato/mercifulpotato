We should strive to make work more play-like by focusing on creativity, autonomy, and linking both to accountability for results and automating drudgery as much as we can. That&#x27;s how many parts of the tech industry function and it can be carried over into other sectors of the economy too. There&#x27;s no need to &quot;abolish&quot; work in order to do this.')
