Mazda MX5. Insurance is kinda pricy, but it&#x27;s a cost negative choice - when I sell it, I&#x27;ll get more than what I paid for it.<p>a rice cooker, no need for pots, pans, even plates - one rice cooker. I love it, so, so much. I can cook rice, potatoes, pasta, cakes, salmon, beef, everything in it. Everything.<p>lack of oil and small space also mean that I&#x27;m more aware of my food. I steam everything, and eat more wholesome and healthier. It&#x27;s fantastic. Pays for itself.<p>Proper shoes, boots, leather - gym shoes that I replace every other month.<p>ipad. I never knew I loved reading so much, I could read and read. I tried the kindle, and it just too much work to focus. On the ipad, it&#x27;s just right and when I go resell after 3 years of ownership it&#x27;s easily 50%+ of what I paid for it, great.<p>Macbook pro. All around good computers, I love parallels and running VM jails and when I resell them at 3 years&#x2F;36 month mark, I get back 60-80% of my original purchase price. It pays off the 0% financing I get (I don&#x27;t have too but I like the game&#x2F;tactic.)<p>Patagonia wear, overall great, and for some odd reason when I go to resell it I get 50% everytime.<p>So, it&#x27;s silly, I know but, these purchases improve my life, retain equity and I can continue buying newer versions on better cycles much quicker. By selling them they&#x27;re recycled and loved much more then just disposed off.<p>--<p>If only I could cut down on food and going out expenses. :(')
