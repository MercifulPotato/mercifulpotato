I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s retired yet, but they don&#x27;t support RHEL 8, so I&#x27;m forced to stay on RHEL 7.<p>I can see that iLO firmware is not latest, but it&#x27;s BIOS who&#x27;s responsible for fan speed control and I think that I&#x27;m running latest BIOS.<p>That&#x27;s not really about BIOS versions. When HDD runs under B120i fakeraid mode, server is aware about HDD temperature which is displayed in iLO. As long as this temperature is low, fans stay low. When HDD runs under AHCI mode, server is not aware about HDD temperature anymore, so it uses high fan speed to ensure that cooling is good enough even if drives are hot. That&#x27;s how I interpret this whole situation.')
