However, it&#x27;s been 95% full stack javascript &#x2F; web development.

I&#x27;m really enjoying the learning curve that exists with Rust and Haskell and I&#x27;d love to work on a system that uses these languages but I&#x27;m finding it hard to break through the interview process - let alone convince a recruiter to interview me when I have 5 years javascript experience.<p>I have enough runway (savings) to live without a job for maybe 9-10 months...<p>So far I&#x27;m considering<p>* Reverse engineering a product that already exists and use Rust&#x2F;Haskell to build it<p>* Port an open source tool from another language into Rust&#x2F;Haskell<p>* Pick a Rust&#x2F;Haskell open source project and start contributing (The trouble with this is finding one that is at the right maturity. It&#x27;s hard to find the right issues to work on?)<p>In essence, how the hell do I switch my career path at this stage in the game?<p>EDIT: Apologies for the duplicate post...I have idea how that happened.')
