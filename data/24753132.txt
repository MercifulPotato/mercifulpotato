More so than the book itself, in my opinion, because narration is excellent.<p>I was forced to read War and Peace when I was 15 (it&#x27;s required reading in Russian schools), and didn&#x27;t like it then because I wasn&#x27;t yet equipped to understand it. Nor did I understand any Dostoevsky we were required to read either. A 16 year old just can&#x27;t understand any of what&#x27;s going on in such works - it&#x27;s easy for me to see that now when I have a son that age.<p>After I listened to it some 25 years later, it became my favorite work of literature by quite a margin. I strongly suspect that as I get older, I might be due for another pass through it, and I will enjoy it even more then.<p>So there&#x27;s no shame in listening to an audiobook on your commute, once we have commutes again. I just don&#x27;t know if there are English language productions of it that are any good. Perhaps someone could chime in and recommend. But if you speak Russian, get the version from Audible and spend some quality time with it, you won&#x27;t regret it.')
