Its true that, similar to previous elections, people aren&#x27;t voting For. They&#x27;re voting against.<p>That said, the reason Biden, despite his substantive proposals, isn&#x27;t well-liked by Dems is because there seems to be broad disappointment with the Democratic party&#x27;s failure to nominate and elect someone who <i>is</i> representative of the future we all want. There&#x27;s a comment in this thread to the tune of &quot;why are only 70 year old men running and winning the presidency in the USA&quot; today.
