My first PI game was Stellaris which I quickly racked up hundreds of hours in and despite several major changes by the devs in mechanics it&#x27;s still easy to jump back in to. I feel like it&#x27;s a worthy successor to SMAC with its own uniqueness.<p>But EUIII, EUIV, CKII, HoI? Considerably steeper learning curve, IMO! I&#x27;ve spent over a hundred hours just trying to take over Ireland (the traditionally newb scenario) in CKII.<p>I would not suggest jumping from a Civ to any Paradox title except Stellaris. There&#x27;s enough of Paradox&#x27;s goofiness in the space combat (&quot;whaa... I slaughtered the enemy, how do I not get their planets... war exhaustion, wtf is that... oh that kind of makes sense&quot;) and lots of visual feedback to keep you interested without making you cry too much.')
