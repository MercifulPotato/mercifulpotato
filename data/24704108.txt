So $20 is $20.  If you set up a crummy low-traffic blog and that $20 lasts four months, then fine.  If it lasts two weeks and then there&#x27;s a surge in traffic, or the server hits some bug that causes it to spiral out of control, then your site gets killed when your balance hits $0.  You can set up alerts, but there&#x27;s a <i>hard</i> limit for how much you can be charged—it&#x27;s whatever funds you deposited into your account.  (Really, that&#x27;s not even the right way to put it, because you&#x27;re charged at the moment you deposit them.)<p>This isn&#x27;t acceptable for everybody—many businesses would prefer to stay up and be billed after-the-fact.  But that use cases is already well-served by the industry.  (Overserved, really.)  The market segment where the alternative situation is the best fit (pretty much every hobbiest who isn&#x27;t bringing in a single cent off their side project) is <i>extremely</i> underserved.  NFSN is the only provider I know of that even offers this.')
