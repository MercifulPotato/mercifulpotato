Its pretty much what the article says at the conclusion, it helps reducing, but I still view it as a hassle.<p>Browsers developed with vi-like modes built-in (vimprobable, vimb, qutebrowser) fared better for me, but then there&#x27;s other issues like incompatibility or lack of plugins which keeps me from fully using them.')
