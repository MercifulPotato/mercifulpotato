This is a legitimate contender here against Gatsby, Netlify, AWS Amplify and the like<p>One thing I like about this over all the others is they aren’t (to my knowledge) just reselling AWS features with added convenience (not that this is an issue or bad, but this a lot of what Netlify does with their lamdas for instance, if I recall correctly) and their CDN is top notch IMO as well. I’m very excited to see how this plays out especially when they add the full stack backend to the mix with durable object storage and broader more fully features edge workers with KV storage<p>I do wonder if they’ll add GraphQL support out of the box (for instance a ready to configure and use a GQL worker)<p>Also curious if they will solve for the ability for JAMstack sites to have more real time features via SSE or websockets through their worker platform<p>Genuinely excited! Sadly they aren’t hiring for WFH and their SF office didn’t have any postings related to working on this from what I can tell :(<p>I can only dream of working on such cool things')
