The 16 or 32 architectural registers of the ISA are pretty much irrelevant compared to the capabilities of the out-of-order engine on modern chips.<p>A 200, 300, or 600+ register ISA is unfathomable to those from 1995. Not only that, but the way we got our software to scale to such &quot;shadow register&quot; sets is due to an improvement in compiler technology over the last 20 years.<p>Modern compilers write code differently (aka: &quot;dependency cutting&quot;). Modern chips take advantage of those dependency cuts, and use them to &quot;malloc&quot; those reorder buffer registers, and as a basis for out-of-order execution.<p>While the tech existed back in the 90s for this... it wasn&#x27;t widespread yet. Even the best posts from back then would be unable to predict what technologies came out 25 years into the future.')
