Twelve years later (2017) I put the drive into an external USB enclosure. It spun up and transferred all of the data with (so far as I&#x27;ve <i>heard</i>) nothing lost. (No doubt some bits were ... but no files.)<p>The old drive itself failed within a year.<p>So I&#x27;d feel pretty safe copying one drive to another every 5 years.<p>When it comes to digital images (I don&#x27;t have enough to bother), archive-grade printing to <i>paper</i> seems like the obvious first-choice option -- IF it&#x27;s done properly.')
