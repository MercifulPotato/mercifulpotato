I just got my H1B approval after being on OPT for the last couple years. Apart from obvious covid restrictions, am I otherwise still limited for travel because of the recent executive orders? Do you know when it will be possible to leave and re-enter the US?<p>Also, now that remote work is common, I am curious if the H1B has requirements for time spent in the US, the way the green card does. I can&#x27;t seem to find definitive answers about any residency requirements online. Are there any for H1B?')
