Item(by='the_af', descendants=None, kids=[25617453, 25639162], score=None, time=1609621636, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25614098, text='I took a serious interest in IF once it reached its &quot;modern&quot; stage (which ironically happened more than a decade ago). It started subverting the tired tropes of &quot;you&#x27;re in this dungeon and have to find the treasure&quot; and playing with the conventions of the genre and even the UI itself.<p>In the spy game Spider and Web, instead of &quot;losing&quot;, for most of the game you get a &quot;that&#x27;s not what happened, please don&#x27;t lie to me&quot;.<p>There was this scifi game, whose name now escapes me, where you&#x27;re communicating by radio with the survivor of a spaceship, and every parser error gets reported appropriately: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, you&#x27;re breaking up, can you repeat please?&quot;.<p>In Rematch you have only one move, and then you either die or win (but what you can do in this move can be <i>very</i> complex).<p>In Adam Cadre&#x27;s Photopia the gameplay possibilities aren&#x27;t that many, but the story is heartwrenching. His 9:05 is hilarious in how it plays with common player expectations.<p>I love IF.')
