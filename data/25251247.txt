When you think about keeping your writing around decades--ie, longer than you might keep a site--there&#x27;s no solution I loved.<p>I also love Scrivener for actually writing. So I built a SSG that takes exports from Scrivener and turns that into webpages.<p>I get to use my writing tool of choice + I have full backups and the ability to recreate the site on demand.<p>Also, Scrivener has metadata as part of the UI, so no awkward front matter. Just some custom fields (as the software already expects).')
