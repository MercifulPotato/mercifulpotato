I learn sooo much when I change jobs.<p>Always being in situations where you&#x27;re learning is a great idea. You should be able to find learning situations as you move up in your career.<p>Always being in situations where you&#x27;re a total newbie&#x2F;beginner is not so great. You should ideally be able to build upon previous experience in some way with each new job. The problem is that your performance will be evaluated relative to some baseline, and constantly being too far on the &quot;total noob&quot; side of that baseline will start to send the wrong impression as you get older.<p>That&#x27;s not to say you shouldn&#x27;t avoid opportunities where you&#x27;ll need to learn a lot to begin, but you should be evaluating new opportunities with an eye toward career progression at each step. It&#x27;s easy to hit the reset button multiple times when you&#x27;re young, but people will have different expectations about baseline competency when you&#x27;ve had a decade of career experience under your belt.')
