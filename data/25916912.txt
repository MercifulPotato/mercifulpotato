If they were, you would be right to identify them and call them racist.<p>The way these terms are <i>actually</i> used in 2021 has nothing to do with the classical definitions. Rather, Twitter warriors describe anyone who votes for Trump as a racist Nazi. The terms have become unmoored from their original definitions. And as a German I am sure you&#x27;re aware that this problem of redefinition happens there too.<p><i>Here in Germany that&#x27;s not the most sacred thing, do you know what the article 1 of the german basic law is? &quot;Human dignity shall be inviolable.&quot;</i><p>German law is crap then. That statement is vacuous, means nothing and can be interpreted in whatever way the government wishes to whatever end the government wants. The US First Amendment is vastly superior and I&#x27;m not even American: it is crisp, fairly specific and applies to a very small group of people (Congress).<p>As for not a dystopian racist hellhole, no, Germany isn&#x27;t. Neither is the USA, so using Germany to try and make a point about free speech doesn&#x27;t seem very relevant. China <i>is</i> such a place, if the reports of concentration camps for Muslims in the west are true, and they also have no free speech. So the correlation between free speech and being non racist seems pretty good.')
