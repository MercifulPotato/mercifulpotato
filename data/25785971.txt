I recently thought of another approach for song recommendation due to necessity i.e.: based on how a song sounds. There are genres but they&#x27;re way too generic. Other methods like similar artists, what else people who&#x27;ve likes a song love etc doesn&#x27;t always work. Not sure how streaming services recommend but I don&#x27;t think they do what I want.<p>I know, how something _sounds_ is subjective but I was thinking something along the lines of how Shazam app does. If they can compute a song signature and compare it against a library, it should be possible(?) to find top 10 closest neighbors.<p>BTW, I&#x27;d love to test your app if that&#x27;s possible.')
