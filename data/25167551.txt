But that&#x27;s in part because I usually have the windows down, so constant adjustment is needed to compensate for speed, outside temp, wind speed&#x2F;direction, etc. - at this point, changing it is second nature. With a touchscreen, even if I could get used to the lack of tactile feedback, it&#x27;s impossible to know if the right screen is up without looking away from the road (the same issue arises with radio settings).')
