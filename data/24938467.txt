For simple crud-ish apps (ecommerce, online auctions, etc) I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t need to write even a single line of custom SQL, and performance is generally good (lots of N+1s, but these are easy to avoid with things like bullet). I also love being able to let Rails render most HTML, and the few things that need to be very dynamic you can just throw a single react component in without worrying about the usual SPA problems.<p>If you&#x27;re just prototyping stuff, I don&#x27;t think you can beat Rails for productivity. But if you&#x27;re targeting something more enterprise or large scale, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good choice. Go&#x2F;Rust are so much faster (not that that matters a lot), and even things like C#&#x2F;Java pretty nice to use nowadays.')
