I’m sorry I have an 11 year old who has an iPod touch the real problem here is lax parenting. My son cannot use his phone alone in his room alone, he doesn’t have TikTok or any social media apps. He cannot take it to school (not that there’s a school to go to at the moment)  or take it out of the house unless he asks first and 95% of the time we don’t let him. Kids test—that’s like an iron law of childhood. It’s your job as a parent to set boundaries. Set the rules and set the consequences and then FOLLOW THROUGH on the consequences. This is the equivalent of lazy parents in the 80s blaming “death metal” for their children’s problems, or lazy parents in the 90s blaming video games, or 2000s parents blaming the internet. It’s you—all these problems are your fault.')
