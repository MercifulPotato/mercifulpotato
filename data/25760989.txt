Anti virtual dom advocacy turns me away. The way they sell Svelte is thoroughly antagonistic.<p>I tried to read the documentation but I&#x27;m suspicious about HTML that is not HTML, and JavaScript that is not JavaScript and CSS that&#x27;s not CSS. &quot;It&#x27;s reactive.&quot; doesn&#x27;t instill any confidence in me that state manegent won&#x27;t end up in tangled mess in my app.<p>I was checking out benchmarks to see if Svelte is actually as fast as they claim and it is faster but not faster then some of their more low key competition.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freecodecamp.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;a-realworld-comparison-of-front-end-frameworks-with-benchmarks-2019-update-4be0d3c78075&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freecodecamp.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;a-realworld-comparison-of-...</a><p>While checking out benchmarks I noticed some framework called AppRun.<p>I started looking at their docs. Reading through that was a breeze. Very simple model of operation, state =&gt; view. Everything (also state modifications) goes through events. You can use it as SPA or just enhace your existing webpage with few AppRun components. You can use JSX if you like it or not. Languages don&#x27;t have any custom extensions. It&#x27;s just JS, CSS, HTML (JSX) (with single exception of optional custom directives).<p>You can use TypeScript, inspect state with Redux dev tools. And everything is faster and requires less code than Svelte.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apprun.js.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;#&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apprun.js.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;#&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@yiyisun&#x2F;i-also-created-the-exact-same-app-using-apprun-dd1860cb8112" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@yiyisun&#x2F;i-also-created-the-exact-same-ap...</a>')
