I recently had to replace my web browser because it reduced the time to load a ticket from 4 minutes to 10 seconds due to some caching issue. Entering a date&#x2F;time on a non-English locale never works. Whenever I try to leave a comment with technical details, I probably spam the whole team with lots of &quot;Ticket was edited&quot; notifications because there is no logic to Atlassian&#x27;s markup systems.<p>I feel that Jira&#x27;s configurability makes it like desktop Linux 20 years ago. Everybody swears it&#x27;s rock-solid, beautiful, and easy to configure. Then when you ask anyone to have a look at their specific setup, they&#x27;ll cover the screen with their bodies and panic, &quot;ah no, I kind of messed everything up recently, haha, but you can&#x27;t really blame the software for that, can you? Everyone else&#x27;s installation is super clean though&quot;. After working with ~10 different Jira installations, I&#x27;m still looking for one where that&#x27;s true.<p>&lt;&#x2F;rant&gt;<p>And as someone who enjoys documenting their own work for fellow developers and other roles, I don&#x27;t even think Jira helps. Most discussions will still happen offline and without documentation, especially from non-technical roles who hate typing.')
