In most states, the governor appoints a replacement when there&#x27;s an unexpected Senate vacancy, and in only six of those states is the governor required fill the vacancy with someone of the same political party as the prior senator. In the other states, governors can and do appoint someone from their own party, so a Democratic senator from most states with a Republican governor would be replaced by a Republican. That&#x27;s the case in Georgia, Ohio, New Hampshire, etc.<p>It&#x27;s a real concern; given the current atmosphere and the 50-50 Senate split, it would not surprise me at all to see someone murder a senator in order to tip the balance of control.')
