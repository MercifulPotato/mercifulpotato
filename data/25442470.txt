If we can have small .emacs files for each of the popular use cases that one can read and understand completely in 10-20 minutes, it would make the journey for new Emacs users easier.<p>Emacs is a great piece of software. It is highly extensible. Whenever I see someone starting off directly with Spacemacs or Portacle, I feel that an important opportunity to appreciate the extensibility of Emacs is being missed. I have a similar gripe towards the current state of Java programming when I see young engineers starting off with Eclipse or IntelliJ without appreciating how to compile and run programs using the javac and java command line programs. It often bites them back when they have to troubleshoot the program on a production system where there is no IDE and they can only see very long arguments to &quot;java -cp&quot;. But I digress here.<p>My hope with a project like this is that it will help in reducing the allure of readymade fully customized Emacs distributions to some extent and encourage hacking on Emacs itself to customize it to one&#x27;s own needs, taste, and preferences.')
