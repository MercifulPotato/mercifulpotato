As you say, it&#x27;s bumpy. On top of that, it has nonuniform density, which means the gravitational field on its surface isn&#x27;t that of a perfect sphere (or an oblate spheroid). If we imagine how water would settle if nothing except Earth&#x27;s gravity and rotation were acting on it, the complex surface that water creates is called a <i>geoid</i>. That surface reflects the nonuniform density of our planet.<p>Here is a pretty heatmap showing the diffrence between geoid heights and oblate spheroid model:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Geoid#Undulation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Geoid#Undulation</a><p>All of that seems like it doesn&#x27;t matter, and then (like me over the past month) you want to do something in the GIS space, and then suddenly <i>it does</i>. It is important for accurate mapping and measurement.<p>Of course, nobody has time dealing with this crap (and the shape of the geoid wasn&#x27;t known until recently anyway), so we cheat - we standardized on a large bunch of region-specific coordinate systems, where one or more points are carefully referenced to geoid or ellipsoid (oblate spheroid) models, and everything else is measured in this local coordinate system.')
