Item(by='julianmarq', descendants=None, kids=[25738283], score=None, time=1610389151, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25733062, text='<i>&gt; But pretty much no one wants preapproval of every utterance either, so everyone is also “anti-censorship”.</i><p>I&#x27;ve seen people arguing that the concept of free speech is &quot;outdated&quot; and that societies that hold it are &quot;doomed to collapse&quot;, just as an example of what I meant in my first comment.<p><i>&gt; so pretty much everyone is “pro-censorship” to some degree</i><p>Please, don&#x27;t. You&#x27;re arguing against an extreme of my comment instead of what I actually meant[1] (which, of course, you&#x27;re free to do, but I would also be just as free to dismiss it as a bad faith argument), but also you&#x27;re extending something <i>you</i> might believe onto others. You&#x27;re of course free to be &quot;pro-censorship&quot;, but you don&#x27;t know what everyone else thinks, and certainly not what I think.<p><i>&gt; The use of the term “censorship” is itself a negative signal, as it preempts useful discussion by imposing a false dichotomy.</i><p>I completely disagree with this. The example I gave is absolutely an argument in favor of censorship.<p><i>&gt; If you see someone talking about “damping positive disinformation feedback loops” or something like that, rather than “censorship”, that’s one signal there’s a substantive discussion taking place.</i><p>Excusing it by saying &quot;dampening positive disinformation feedback loops&quot; <i>is</i> excusing censorship. You might refuse to call it such, but I don&#x27;t have a reason not to.<p>[1]: For starters, I&#x27;m aware that there&#x27;s unprotected speech for a reason, and I <i>never</i> called condemnation of such speech &quot;censorship&quot;.')
