When it&#x27;s come up, everyone I&#x27;ve heard from acknowledges the role that their parents, schools, community and even luck play.<p>A lot of the political dialog is also about how more people can have access to quality education. In my own state, we spend around $20k per student per year in the poorest school districts, so I don&#x27;t think the story that the US just ignores poor communities and tells them to work harder is quite so simple.')
