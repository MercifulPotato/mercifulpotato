The example that comes to mind is &quot;Courier 12pt is the only font ever for screenplays&quot;. It&#x27;s required to convey a screenplay, to my mind, like using Fraktur is required in the math space.<p>The screenplay is still being written in letters. Mathematical ℝ is more accurately thought of as an ideogram than a letter. If you were to write &quot;let <i>r</i> be a member of ℝ&quot;, the &quot;ℝ&quot; would be structurally parallel to the full word &quot;member&quot;, not to the &quot;r&quot; within it.<p>Courier for screenplays is a choice you make at the document level; blackboard bold for mathematical entities is not. ℝ is always ℝ no matter what styles apply to your document.')
