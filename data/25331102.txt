It’s a 650 page document, and I must say I admire you for having read through the quite wordy prose therein.<p>I can’t commit to reading it all through to understand how to model whether human action warms earth, and how to understand the accuracy of any such model.<p>The document appears to be aimed primarily at rulers of states, and to be in a big part about how rulers could create “global equality” and the like. In which of these chapters can I read to learn how to model whether mans industry is warming the earth up or not?<p>1: Framing and Context<p>2: Mitigation Pathways Compatible with 1.5°C in the Context of Sustainable Development<p>3: Impacts of 1.5oC Global Warming on Natural and Human Systems<p>4: Strengthening and Implementing the Global Response<p>5: Sustainable Development, Poverty Eradication and Reducing Inequalities')
