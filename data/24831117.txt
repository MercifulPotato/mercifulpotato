Providing a simple email address would prevent this, but expecting the common user to have the wisdom on account recovery strategies is too optimistic. That&#x27;s why many apps ask for email during registration.<p>That can be tolerable for Discord, because your loss is just your friends list and access to some servers, which can be recovered easily through social means. That&#x27;s not possible or feasible for every kind of app.')
