Stallman is a 1960s lefty, and puts personal freedom at the center of his philosophy. Today&#x27;s left is... different, and more concerned with score settling, specifically, paying for privileged groups&#x27; historical privilege with a purgatory of additional restrictions going forward. Personal freedom for all is not the goal, matter of fact it&#x27;s inimical to the goal.')
