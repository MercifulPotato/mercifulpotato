Don&#x27;t watch the video which clearly shows the true anger and sentiment behind the speech.<p>I suggested watching the video as a primary option with reading the transcript as the fallback.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not what you say, it&#x27;s how you say it.<p>No it’s what you say. Because how you say it is so open to interpretation that anything could be construed as anything.<p>Twitter’s final ban of Trump’s account said that him suggesting he’s not attending the inauguration was an invitation for violence. That’s ridiculous.<p>&gt; &quot;Hey guys, there&#x27;s a fire&quot;, said in a dull sarcastic tone is not the same as screaming it at the top of your lungs with a frightened look on your face.<p>You’re describing how the majority of the media covers anything about Trump. Just because they’re screaming and jumping up and down does not mean they’re correct.<p>&gt; But yes, encourage people to read the transcript and not watch the video with their own eyes.<p>Again, your Trump rage is literally blinding you from seeing that I suggested people watch the video.')
