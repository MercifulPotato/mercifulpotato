It&#x27;s a physical process implemented by humans, subject to design flaws. So how can we detect whether or not the random number generator we&#x27;ve built has any flaws? By using sound Bayesian reasoning and experiment. If we run the process and it gives us the same number 100 times in a row in the first 100 results, we should adjust our priors and assume what we&#x27;ve built is not in fact a random number generator.')
