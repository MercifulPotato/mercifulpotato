I mean, there is nothing here that can&#x27;t be ignored or negated by the incoming administration when any proposed regs are eventually drafted, so someone lobbied for this EO, but I don&#x27;t see who this benefits enough to have been worth expending financial or political capital just to get draft legislation that they will have to expend more capital on to actually get enacted, and perhaps then a bit more to have enforced (it is a characteristic of such efforts to enact legislation or regulation that if you are clever enough, enforcement is something that the lobbying entity largely gets &quot;for free&quot; when their pet legislation is enacted).<p>Although it does seem plain that the amount of capital expended right now is likely smaller than if trying to get the incoming administration to get the ball rolling, but that just answers &quot;why today&quot; rather than &quot;why&quot;.<p>Cui bono?')
