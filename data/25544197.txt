It mostly works if you stick to the default settings and use it for nothing but passive device-backup and photo-backup for a single iPhone. Anything outside of that is a mine-field of login errors, sync issues, totally unconsidered use-cases, functionality that&#x27;s simply broken (not just under special conditions; flatly broken), etc.')
