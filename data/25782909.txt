A transistor is neither a car, nor a banana. You have to have a new kind of understanding, one that transcends such mundane, familiar concepts.<p>Get it?<p>Feynman explained <i>nothing</i> by saying that particles are &quot;not like&quot; two other familiar concepts. That&#x27;s flipping two bits in an infinite set of to &quot;false&quot;. You can&#x27;t gain understanding by flipping all but one remaining bit in that infinite set to false! Particles aren&#x27;t like tiny springs either, or tiny metronomes, or tiny bolts of lightning, or... an infinite list of things they aren&#x27;t!<p>Similarly, Feynman&#x27;s Path Integral method is trotted out as  a mental model of how particles &quot;work&quot; at the Quantum Level, but this is literally just a mathematical trick for solving a class of problems efficiently. This is not my opinion, Feynman <i>said so</i>. It&#x27;s not a &quot;model of the world&quot;, it is literally just a specific case of Monte Carlo Integration!')
