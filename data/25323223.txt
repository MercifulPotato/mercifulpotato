And then you&#x27;ll have to engage a collections company and&#x2F;or a bailiff. And if they seize goods to the value of because they can&#x27;t extract a payment, you won&#x27;t be paid until the goods are auctioned off.<p>To a company turning over millions, a one-off claim for a few hundred is barely worth noticing. From their POV you&#x27;re barely a flea bite, and of course most people will give up on a claim without much of a fight. So naturally they&#x27;re going to try that first.<p>The other point is that most people you deal with don&#x27;t care either way. They&#x27;ll follow the company script, because the outcome - and your inconvenience - mean nothing to them.')
