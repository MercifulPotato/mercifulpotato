Putting something like auction for H1B means another competitive advantage to big tech over me.<p>&gt;&gt; Business model is broken<p>For startups, yes you’re working with constraints that seem impossible - you should encourage people to do hard things and build businesses, not give up - this is still US.<p>And yes I hired 10 engineers in India, and they’re paying taxes there. I’d rather hire them here and have them pay taxes here. In next few years, the founding engineers will start their own startups in India and not here, I want them to do startups here.<p>We’re screwing up by reducing supply of engineers, reducing supply of housing in US, and starving startup ecosystem.')
