In this case, terms like &#x27;state killing&#x27; and &#x27;execution&#x27; are supposed to create emotional discomfort when read.<p>The association with the horrible imagery needs to be created or else people will not understand what they&#x27;re reading with the appropriate degree of emphasis when the term comes up in the future. We will be a nation of apathetic, sedated cowards.<p>In the old days, people actually saw these horrors with their own eyes, not merely seen pictures; so they understood very well what &#x27;war&#x27; meant. Probably why we haven&#x27;t had a major war for so long.')
