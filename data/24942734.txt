Item(by='privong', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604069037, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24942142, text='&gt; That graph looks like a hockey stick. Is it really accelerating or are we just getting better at detecting it (this makes more sense)?<p>I suspect it is a piecewise combination of two linear functions. There was probably a ~fixed sensitivity across Runs 1-2, with some upgrades before Run 3[0], which resulted in an improved sensitivity for that run. So in effect the slope of detections&#x2F;time is steeper with the improved sensitivity.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;indico.cern.ch&#x2F;event&#x2F;577856&#x2F;contributions&#x2F;3422625&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;indico.cern.ch&#x2F;event&#x2F;577856&#x2F;contributions&#x2F;3422625&#x2F;</a>')
