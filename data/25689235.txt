People who didn&#x27;t lose their jobs (or have their hours curtailed), are doing significantly better because they aren&#x27;t spending as much money <i>and</i> got stimulus checks.<p>Meanwhile those who did lose their jobs are screwed.  These people were probably also poorer before COVID hit, so fewer of them would have bought a <i>new</i> car absent COVID anyways.<p>This is also why the stock market can&#x27;t seem to crash; bond yields are super low, and there is more money being saved (and thus looking for investments) than ever.<p>That&#x27;s been the problem in the US for the past 45 years or so.  We have a lot of wealth, it&#x27;s just not particularly evenly distributed.  Every single financial shock in my lifetime has made the problem worse.')
