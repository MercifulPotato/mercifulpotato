We&#x27;re talking the difference between 5-10 seconds of buffering and beginning playback immediately. Video game updates also accelerate dramatically, allowing more efficient use of free time.<p>Incidentally, here&#x27;s anecdotal data from a family of two adults and two children from today&#x27;s Comcast thread (where I assume you&#x27;re participating, given the comment), that shows that they have stayed below the 1.2TB Comcast threshold for over a year, even through the pandemic, while not making any effort to stay under that threshold since they aren&#x27;t on Comcast: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25200882" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25200882</a><p>Just because there are data caps on some providers is no reason to tolerate unnecessarily slow internet connections. The speed of the connection is an effective and measurable stand-in for the modernity and capacity of the infrastructure delivering internet to that area.<p>Sadly, latency isn&#x27;t a popular measure for Internet connectivity, and as my year of testing uncovered, 50mbit down and 5mbit up is more than sufficient for downloading + 4k streaming + zoom all at the same time, as long as your router has smart shaping&#x2F;queueing capabilities and your connection has stable latency in that scenario.')
