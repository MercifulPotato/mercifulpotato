I&#x27;ve been on group projects where I&#x27;m the only one of my gender. Based on the conversations I&#x27;ve heard on some of the teams I&#x27;ve been on, I have a minority political view and culture&#x2F;lifestyle as well. It&#x27;s almost never a problem <i>unless you believe or think it is a problem</i>. There can be rare cases where you get someone who is actively trying to make it a problem, but that tends to be rare. So I don&#x27;t see it as a chicken or egg issue, I see it as mindset problem.')
