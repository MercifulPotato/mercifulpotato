PH was hosting a ton of videos which showed exposed minors (likely most of it was &quot;revenge porn&quot;) and other unsavory content. It wasn&#x27;t until Visa&#x2F;MC decided to halt processing of all PH transactions that PH decided to haphazardly delete ALL non-partnered content on the platform.<p>This all happened in less than a week of Visa announcing it.<p>I think the outcome was &quot;good&quot; but the damage had already been done as these videos are likely residing on servers that are not owned or controlled by PH. Additionally, there&#x27;s probably a shit ton of non-partnered content that was innocuous.<p>timeline:<p>* nyt publishes scathing article about PH and other sites on 2020-12-04 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;04&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;sunday&#x2F;pornhub-rape-trafficking.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;04&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;sunday&#x2F;pornhub-ra...</a>)<p>* MC and Visa announce to cut ties with PH on 2020-12-11 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.in&#x2F;tech&#x2F;news&#x2F;mastercard-and-visa-have-cut-off-pornhub-from-their-payment-services&#x2F;articleshow&#x2F;79678966.cms" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.in&#x2F;tech&#x2F;news&#x2F;mastercard-and-visa...</a>)<p>* On 2020-12-14 (~3 days later), PH then purges all unverified content (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;jgqjjy&#x2F;pornhub-suspended-all-unverified-videos-content" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;jgqjjy&#x2F;pornhub-suspended-all...</a>)<p>In just a matter of 10 days, a billion dollar corporation deleted a significant amount of their content without even having to step into a court room.<p>To be honest, it&#x27;s kind of scary. What if you are just on the wrong side of a person at XYZ company? Maybe a cloud executive wants Y company to succeed because he or she has significant capital investment in it, and X competing company is about to roll out their product to the masses. Executive then writes up a scathing internal report by X company to ban them from using their products, or even worse &quot;leaks&quot; false information about X company to get them tied up in a public opinion battle.')
