This type of censorship is intolerance.<p>Our legal system has processes* to deal with people who abuse their freedom of speech.  If those processes need to be improved upon to take into account the global megaphone of social media, then let&#x27;s do so.  Censorship however is not the answer.<p>* e.g. crying fire in a movie theatre can mean you are guilty of a crime like disorderly conduct or disturbing the peace.  More extreme words (see Brandenburg versus Ohio) could mean you are found guilty of advocating “crime, sabotage, or unlawful methods of terrorism” for political purposes.  All of that depends on context, intent, etc...variables which should be determined in a court of law.')
