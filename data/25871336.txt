Copper melts at 1084 C, so you&#x27;re good there for springs, conductors and contacts. You&#x27;d need insulation for wires and circuit boards: something like fiberglass weave would be good up to 537C. No solder, wire wrap, steel posts.<p>Resistors and capacitors for RC circuits should be similar, carbon is good and capacitors are insulator&#x2F;conductor layers.<p>I suspect making a temperature controlled oscillator will be very hard. This means power supply AC current might be hard to make.<p>Anyway rebuilding OP&#x27;s computer that can run in your kitchen oven would be a nice hobby goal.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mcmaster.com&#x2F;high-temperature-insulation&#x2F;fiberglass-high-temperature-sleeving&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mcmaster.com&#x2F;high-temperature-insulation&#x2F;fibergl...</a>')
