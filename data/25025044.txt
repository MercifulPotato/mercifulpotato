This was a side effect of a different policy. The policy was zero tolerance on criminal immigration law. That means, if an adult crosses the border illegally, they committed a crime and must be arrested for said crime. That part isn’t actually new, Trump just directed them to enforce the law. That’s where the issue comes in. When an adult male goes to jail, such as if I were to get a DUI with my kid in the car, I’m not allowed to take a kid in with me to jail. It doesn’t matter if they’ll be left alone with no one to care for them. No matter what, arrestees can not bring their kids to jail, ever.<p>So in this situation, the parent is arrested and charged with a crime, and the kids are held until a guardian can be located. And guess what? Many from Mexico or El Salvador actually don’t want to come up to the US and get their kids, if such a person even exists. The Obama admin built these “cages” for that reason. But, they didn’t enforce the law as much, so they were not used so often. They did build them and they did put kids in them though.')
