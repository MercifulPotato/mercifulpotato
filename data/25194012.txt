Unless the remote system (where the video is being received) is untrustworthy. In my scenario I was describing network traffic encryption, for a theoretical where the entire network between the video-sending and video-receiving linux systems could be &#x27;hostile&#x27;, but not encryption of the video itself, I was assuming that the location where the video is being sent to is trustworthy.<p>If the video needs to go to a remote storage location where you want files to be written to disk, but nobody else to be able to read them, that&#x27;s a somewhat more rare problem to solve. Possibly something involving a virtual machine with a dm-crypt&#x2F;LUKS implementation for FDE.')
