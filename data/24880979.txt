JSON strings are also encoded (but they can&#x27;t represent byte strings).<p>There are probably people who never use JSON, and that&#x27;s fine, but there are a lot more who do!  The goal is absolutely for tools like grep to adopt QSN support. [1]<p>Another argument is that in networking framing, you have a few choices:<p>(1) delimiter-based (NUL bytes)<p>(2) escaping (QSN with \\)<p>(3) length prefixed (netstrings)<p>So Oil supports #1 and #2 now.  Oil doesn&#x27;t support netstrings but it actually does make sense, and avoids encoding&#x2F;decoding.  Though QSN encoding can be made extremely fast, just like it&#x27;s been done with JSON [2].<p>[1] GNU grep actually has the ASCII&#x2F;binary detection problem that was brought up on HN awhlie ago.  Honestly it would be worth making a &quot;slow correct utf-8&#x2F;QSN grep&quot; that avoids this.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unix.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;19907&#x2F;what-makes-grep-consider-a-file-to-be-binary" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;unix.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;19907&#x2F;what-makes-gr...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;simdjson&#x2F;simdjson" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;simdjson&#x2F;simdjson</a>')
