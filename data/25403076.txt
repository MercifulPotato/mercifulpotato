In a very large lisp project, I had an astonishing number of lines of shell code--none more than 10 lines long. (Today I would do production automation with cl-readline and inferior-shell and uiop:launch-program.<p>Also, given that I use emacs, I do lots with dired, and on odd occasions eshell. And I have gathered a bit of emacs lisp code as well.')
