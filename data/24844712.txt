You&#x27;re taking a public statement from a political appointee whose boss very badly needs an attack angle and generalizing it without cause. We know that the non-partisan staff have been telling Congress and the public that there are Russian attempts to influence the election[1,2] involving some of the people in this story[3].<p>This matters because you&#x27;re taking a single very specific claim as proof an entire story. The DNI made a very specific denial that Hunter Biden&#x27;s laptop is not part of a Russian disinformation campaign — we don&#x27;t know what level of certainty the analysts have that this was actually Biden&#x27;s laptop, that the data on it wasn&#x27;t modified after it left Biden&#x27;s control, that he wasn&#x27;t fine parsing this being a disinformation campaign run by anyone other than the Russian government, or that the emails presented in the NY Post story are authentic and complete.<p>Continuing the trend, there&#x27;s a conservative media figure citing unnamed officials with uncorroborated claims. We don&#x27;t know how well informed they are, what conflicts of interest they have, etc. but we do know that their chain of command has a number of people who have significant personal investment in a particular election result. This is why anything involving politically sensitive claims really needs to be done as openly as possible since history is full of examples of various ways officials have mislead the public.<p>Similarly, you are presenting as proof a JPEG on a conservative blog showing two signatures which aren&#x27;t close matches and have none of the provenance you&#x27;d need to demonstrate that similarities aren&#x27;t due to one of them being a forgery based on the public record. Even if the receipt was authentic, that tells you he dropped a Mac off, which could be part of but is not on its own sufficient to say that the data came from that Mac.<p>I mention all of this because it&#x27;s how the process works: you&#x27;re convinced that Biden is corrupt because the sources you read presented some nice juicy headlines and just enough plausible details to underpin all of those conclusions. If you remember Guccifer 2.0, one of the best ways to make a forgery seem more realistic is to put it in with legitimate but innocuous documents. The decision to sit on this story until close before an election but not release the data or an independent forensic report is exactly what you&#x27;d do in this case.<p>My suggestion that you look for the evidence is to put an upper bound on how confidently you should present that narrative as fact — for example, doesn&#x27;t it seem interesting that this conversation about laptops is still missing any evidence that a meeting or conversation happened or that it involved anything more than a businessman wangling a handshake with a prominent global figure? It&#x27;s certainly possible that Hunter Biden did something dodgy but I personally would wait to call his father corrupt without strong or, really, any evidence of that. Similarly, the NY Post story repeated the long-debunked claim about VP Biden having tried to get a prosecutor fired for investigating Burisma — that certainly doesn&#x27;t mean that the rest of the story is completely wrong but it does call into question how much a wise reader should trust the story without further corroboration.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dni.gov&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;item&#x2F;2139-statement-by-ncsc-director-william-evanina-election-threat-update-for-the-american-public" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dni.gov&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;newsroom&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;item&#x2F;2...</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;07&#x2F;politics&#x2F;us-intelligence-russia-election-interference-biden&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;07&#x2F;politics&#x2F;us-intelligence-russ...</a><p>3. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;giuliani-russian-disinformation.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;giuliani-russ...</a>')
