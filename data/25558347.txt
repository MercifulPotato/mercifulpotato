Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=[25558721], score=None, time=1609154454, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25558151, text='&gt; a Which region of Croatia if you don&#x27;t mind me asking?<p>Bok, dobro dan:<p>Umag professionally, and then the countryside in Zagreb to help a friend and her village harvest later that year and begin the wine and olive oil pressing.<p>It took a whole village of maybe 25 rotating of various ages people to do both orchards and it was rather small, maybe 2 heactres each? But we were casual and stopped to eat and dink, chat and nap.<p>Whereas the one in Umag was back breaking slave labour as it was way larger ~20 hectares broken up into various fields depending on cultivar, as they mainly focused on white wine based grapes we sold by the bottle at the nearby campsite and at bio markets&#x2F;stores, they had some other fruit for rakija. But it was me and an another guy who were the only apprentices in a staff of 4 plus the 3 owners who mainly focused on sales and very light field work in the mornings so me and the other guy each worked 13-16 hour days back then 6 days a week and a lot of that was just pruning leaves and unripened grapes and adjusting the vineyards to the trellis which is what made that farm most of its money. I&#x27;m glad I made the pivot to Italy when I did as I preferred to work in gardens and develop a menu and then run the kitchen for an Agrotourism in Maranello! Those 16-18 hour days were much more better spent in my opinion.<p>One day in Croatia the other guy in Umag was out taking care of the tomato fields and I was actually spraying the copper and Organic&#x2F;Bio fungicide mixture with the blower machine in the red field and making my way to the white when I saw the plume of a bomb go off that contained sulfide in a neighbors much larger field nearby, which typically was used for low-end wines that give you headaches or were used for gemi≈°t, and I had to run like hell to avoid getting sprayed on as that stuff hurts when you inhale it. I actually left the blower behind until the sky air cleared.<p>&gt; As you probably know, a lot of what a winemaker does is adaption of the vineyard to seasonal conditions by adjusting variety and quantity of spraying with (usually) fungicides, reducing the leaves and reducing the grapes (in order to increase overall sugar and quality).<p>I know the farm-hands (like me back then) do that, the winemaker is usually the owner who seldom does much of the labour in my experience besides occasionally walk the fields and prepare the barrels and bottles in my experience during harvest. And he usually has an apprentice(s) do much of that as they&#x27;re usually much older.<p>&gt; This variation would be something that would be reduced using greenhouse&#x2F;indoor growing.<p>How so? The vines are permanent once planted and are dormant in the Fall-late Spring in most wine making regions, so that is money you&#x27;re losing because you cannot grow other crops, moreover from my limited experience on those farms the roots underneath need to have be really established before you&#x27;re able to get any reasonable yield as the first years&#x2F;decade is always going to be so-so vintages as the soil and microbiology underneath creates the taste you&#x27;re looking for and is altered with time--different types of compost, more sand-soil ratios etc...  These are all losses if greenhouse spaces is built for that end alone instead of fast-growing, low input things like salads and herbs in the winter and early planted nightshades in the early Spring to capture the higher premium on being first to Market.<p>Again, I don&#x27;t know how the lack of restaurants is going to alter all of this, to be honest.')
