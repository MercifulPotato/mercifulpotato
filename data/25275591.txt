I&#x27;m not advocating having large functions over smaller functions. What I&#x27;m advocating is <i>instead</i> of breaking functions based purely on a visual criteria or by grouping functionality, it&#x27;s <i>better</i> to use proper abstractions when breaking the function.<p><i>&gt; You can just skip over it</i><p>The point is that if I blindly break a larger functions by functionality, I still have to understand the deeper functionality. So, I can&#x27;t just skip when I&#x27;m debugging or deeply reviewing&#x2F;inspecting the code, or doing a rewrite or trying to understand it.<p><i>&gt; I can&#x27;t help but think people who complain about this, are just bad at creating functions at the correct level of abstraction.</i><p>My point was <i>exactly</i> that you should create functions at the correct level of abstraction, rather than just splitting large functions purely by functionality, like you would with a cooking recipe.<p><i>&gt; If your function does an unexpected side effect, thats a problem with the code</i><p>But this is <i>exactly</i> what I&#x27;m trying to avoid. If you need side effects, keep them visible, by keeping them in the main function, instead of just blindly putting them into smaller functions.')
