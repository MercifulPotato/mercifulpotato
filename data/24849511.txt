I helped him with feedback on some parts of the book. And I haven&#x27;t read the whole thing yet.<p>Nonetheless, I&#x27;m confident that for newer engineers, this book will save you years of learning about the &quot;real world&quot; the hard way. Even if our technical education is top notch, there&#x27;s so much more to being a great engineer who can thrive in any environment - from BigCo, where there are a thousand unwritten rules - to startup, where you have to figure everything out yourself.<p>And even for experienced engineers, it may help you reflect on what you&#x27;ve learned and consolidate your ideas more clearly.<p>The best book I found in this area was The Clean Coder, but it was mostly for the main thesis - that we should strive to be <i>professionals</i>, just like a &quot;real things&quot; engineer or doctor - the details were not terribly memorable. DH&#x27;s book takes it to the next level with concrete and immediately applicable advice like &quot;unblock yourself&quot;, &quot;improve your writing&quot;, and &quot;maintenance is for suckers&quot;.')
