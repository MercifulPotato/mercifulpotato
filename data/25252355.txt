Authentication via fingerprint readers or IR-cameras on Linux? Good luck with that.<p>Granted, that&#x27;s not linux&#x27;s fault that driver support from hardware vendors is absolute dog shit, but as a user&#x2F;employee&#x2F;consumer I&#x27;m gonna use whatever just-worksâ„¢ to get my work&#x2F;entertainment needs fulfilled with minimal friction, and at this point, outside the Apple ecosystem, Windows 10 has the best driver support by hardware vendors by a long shot with linux sadly still relying on reverse engineered drivers by the community or binary blobs which are ignored by the FLOSS community, which turns linux into this dumpster fire on the more &quot;fancy&quot; laptops that use anything more than an intel chip with integrated graphics that are nothing more than ssh terminals.')
