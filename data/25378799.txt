Shutting off payments processing to possibly-illegal clients is a way to prevent potential litigation, which may result in high penalties. This is the corporate legal framework at work.<p>If you want a company to not have this option, you need to 1) absolve them of the responsibility to know their clients 2) prevent them from arbitrarily cutting off access. If you don&#x27;t absolve them, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to prevent them from cutting off access - how else can they comply with their legal responsibilities?')
