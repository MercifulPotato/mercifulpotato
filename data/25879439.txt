Most parking lots have at least one street light... start by connecting the existing grid&#x2F;infrastructure that already is there powering the streetlight, upgrading if necessary, to a handful of nearby parking spots. Go from there.<p>Take a step back and think about the ridiculous infrastructure build to support gas powered cars. Imagine a time before gas stations; someone doing a back of the napkin math about a future of cars would have also been met with disbelief - developers will have to invest millions&#x2F;billions of dollars and build hundreds of thousand of stores across the entire country to sell gas?  And how will those stores get the gas to sell? Truck it in?? That&#x27;s just ridiculous.')
