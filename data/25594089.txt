James Madison:<p>&gt; <i>I have observed, that gentlemen suppose, that the general legislature will</i> do every mischief they possibly can, <i>and that they will</i> omit to do every thing good <i>which they are authorised to do. If this were a reasonable supposition, their objections would be good. I consider it reasonable to conclude, that they will</i> as readily do their duty, as deviate from it: <i>Nor do I go on the grounds mentioned by gentlemen on the other side--that we are to place unlimited confidence in them, and expect nothing but the most exalted integrity and sublime virtue. But I go on this great republican principle, that the people will have virtue and intelligence to select men of virtue and wisdom.</i> Is there no virtue among us? <i>If there be not, we are in a wretched situation.</i> No theoretical checks--no form of government can render us secure. <i>To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people, is a chimerical idea. If there be sufficient virtue and intelligence in the community, it will be exercised in the selection of these men. So that we do not depend on their virtue, or put confidence in our rulers, but in the people who are to choose them.</i><p>* 20 June 1788; Papers 11:163. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;press-pubs.uchicago.edu&#x2F;founders&#x2F;documents&#x2F;v1ch13s36.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;press-pubs.uchicago.edu&#x2F;founders&#x2F;documents&#x2F;v1ch13s36...</a><p>Key line:<p>&gt; <i>Is there no virtue among us?
