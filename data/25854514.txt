If a contributor was given a choice - 1. Spend several years using up your free time, sacrificing contact with family, other hobbies to build this software and then have a multi billion company grab your software, badge it with their logo and make billions of off your hard work without giving you anything back, maybe a footnote and pat on the back. You spent your best hours on writing every single line, but you will never get to sip champagne. Or forget about open source and focus your mind on achieving something meaningful for yourself. I feel that many big companies spread this propaganda how great open source is and what an achievement is to contribute, where the main goal is to exploit people and obtain free IP without paying salaries and taxes.
