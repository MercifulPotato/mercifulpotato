All of the data required for an EUA is still required. Some timelines have been permitted to be shortened in exchange for dramatically increasing the number of people involved in trials, but they haven&#x27;t been allowed to be shortened beyond what we know about biological response times. People at press conferences may use general terms like &quot;in a few days,&quot; but that&#x27;s not because they&#x27;re treating this casually, it&#x27;s because humans communicate in human ways when talking to other humans. If you&#x27;re on the FDA, you know the timeline to a T, but if you&#x27;re part of the general public, &quot;December&quot; and &quot;April&quot; are all you really need.<p>The FDA has been heavily involved in every step of the trials, which is how things have moved as quickly as they have.<p>These are the fastest any vaccine has ever been created or approved, by more than four years!')
