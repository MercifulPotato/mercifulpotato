Since I got used to working from home I feel like this is the perfect work environment for me. And I do not have a dedicated room for it. I work usually in my sleeping room. I have no children though.<p>I love how I can enforce no distractions by putting on my ANCs. No obnoxious colleagues who pathologically crave attention. No forcing of smiles and laughter when somebody tells a joke that isn&#x27;t funny but obviously a subtle attempt to gauge power dynamics. I just put a smily in the chat if I feel like it and that&#x27;s it. Every now and then I do 10 minutes of breathing exercises. I can talk while thinking - which is an important tool I never could use since university.<p>After work I switch to my personal laptop and just ignore my work phone. Done.<p>I can say with certainty I have never feeled so productive and relaxed at work.')
