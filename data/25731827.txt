The issue in my eyes is <i>agreeing</i> to do business with someone and then arbitrarily[1] deciding to <i>not</i> do business with someone, with no recourse to the customer because the provider is a massive conglomerate with unlimited resources.<p>AWS didn&#x27;t refuse to do business with Parler, they did business with them for years.  Then one day, based on ambiguous and discriminantly applied rules that may or may not apply to Parler&#x27;s competitors on the same hosting platform, decided to <i>not</i> do business with them.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s right.<p>Look at Apple&#x27;s letter to the Parler CEO regarding being pulled from the App Store:  Apple says Parler is responsible for all the content on their site.  And yet, Apple doesn&#x27;t live by the same rules, in fact they actively lobby against them.<p>[1]  Arbitrary because AWS, as far as I&#x27;ve seen, doesn&#x27;t say &quot;here are the rules you agreed to, here&#x27;s where you broke them. Goodbye&quot;.  There&#x27;s a lot of ambiguity.  Was Parler filled with hate and bullshit?  From what I&#x27;ve seen, absolutely.  But so is Twitter, and they&#x27;re incoming, not outgoing.')
