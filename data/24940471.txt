I thought bounded loops meant every loop has to have a bound (hence while (true) wouldn&#x27;t work). If it can handle more complicated situations then that answers my question. The second example is identical to a do-while loop though, so it&#x27;s not clear to me if it can actually handle more complicated situations that don&#x27;t directly map to for&#x2F;while&#x2F;do-while loops.<p>For example, can it handle something like the following, where there&#x27;s no bound, but the loop necessarily always terminates? (I assumed this loop would be called &quot;unbounded&quot;, but maybe I&#x27;m confused by the terminology?)<p><pre><code>  int test(unsigned i, unsigned j) {\n    while (true) {\n      i ^= j; j ^= i; i ^= j;\n      if (i &lt;= j) { return 0; }\n      i ^= j; j ^= i; i ^= j;\n      if (j &lt;= i) { return 1; }\n      i ^= j; j ^= i; i ^= j;\n    }\n    return 2;\n  }</code></pre>')
