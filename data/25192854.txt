Think black-hearted as a cruel&#x2F;wicked person for a familiar reference. Most literary authors mid 20th century and back use these terms usually to describe a persons character. So he is most definitely referring to the latter example. That being said Ian Fleming being from the British upper class and in his time period I don&#x27;t think he was particularly enlightened in how various races were treated and portraying them only as side characters who usually died off or disappeared into the background.')
