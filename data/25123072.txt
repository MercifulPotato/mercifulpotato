It sounds like how stash already works.<p>&gt; If switching branches wouldn&#x27;t conflict with my current change, why do I have to stash&#x2F;checkout&#x2F;unstash instead of just doing it?<p>This is how git has worked for years: you can checkout a non-conflicting branch without stashing.<p>&gt; Why can&#x27;t I pull without fetching?<p>Have you customized Git to not support this?<p>&gt; Why do I have to detach from a branch before deleting it?<p>When does it make sense to do this? I can understand deleting a remote branch (which doesn’t require this) but deleting the current local branch doesn’t seem to make sense in any normal workflow.')
