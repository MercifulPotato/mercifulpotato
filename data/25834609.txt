It is not big, but consulting fees cover my living.<p>Some time ago I changed development model. Public facing version is still Apache 2 licensed. But now there are no unit tests and no integration tests, those are proprietary now. And I extensively use code generator which is also not public.<p>It is still possible to fork&#x2F;modify code. Merging pull request is bit more difficult for me (backport stuff to code generator). But it works great and nobody noticed anything.<p>Practically any serious use of my library has to go through me now. And I am the hero because my code is virtually without bugs. Magic!!! :)<p>I become disillusioned long time ago. Also people told me several times unit tests do not matter... but in reality they are most valuable part of know how.')
