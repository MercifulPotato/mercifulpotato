I don&#x27;t think that would even cover the marginal cost of making another rocket.  The fixed costs will be substantial (what, you thought all those Shelby-voting engineers in Alabama would be laid off once development was done?)<p>Any real effort to go to the moon will involve propellant stockpiles and transfer in space.  These could use LH2, which could be sent up on F9&#x2F;F9H.  There is no reason to do the injection to the moon using the F9&#x2F;F9H upper stages.<p>I will add that even ignoring F9&#x2F;F9H, there is no sustainable lunar or Mars program using SLS.   The plans to go to Mars would be a flags-and-footprints dead end like Apollo.   For space, it should either be go big or don&#x27;t bother.')
