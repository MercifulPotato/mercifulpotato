It&#x27;s stupid, it&#x27;s counterproductive, but hey, humans...<p>When group A sees another instance of group B being treated (again) better than how group A would have been treated in those circumstances, I think it&#x27;s not surprising how people can get a tad angry and when you&#x27;re angry, your thoughts wonder a little bit more on the dark side, right?<p>When some people from abroad kill people in your soil, it&#x27;s quite understandable that people get angry and talk about bringing pain to people in the countries where these attackers come from.\nIt&#x27;s that &quot;right&quot;? Will that create a better world? Clearly if you just found a way for that never happening again, that would be enough right? The sense of &quot;punishment&quot; is so deeply ingrained in our nature; it&#x27;s not a prerogative of part of the political spectrum.')
