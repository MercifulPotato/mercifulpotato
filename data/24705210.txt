It has gotten worse.<p>It used to be if you are a graduate or have experience working in a Canadian company you would score points. Which was much less prone to abuse.<p>Now they still have point based system, but the above don&#x27;t get any extra point, and if you have those said qualifications anywhere, as long as you can prove (through documentations) you get the same points.<p>Result is rampant abuse with overseas companies that &quot;vet&quot; candidates&#x27; degrees and experience providing certificates and such things. And it takes longer for graduates from Canadian universities or someone with experience working at a company here since they compete in the same lottery pool. \nIt is still far better than US, but it could take you a while before your points start closer to the draw.')
