Other dentists told me that it was not necessary, and could be done later if the teeth ended up decaying too much.<p>Now the teeth are completely decayed, I&#x27;ve started to feel severe pain, and since I&#x27;ve developed severe thrombopenia (&lt;20 G&#x2F;L), I can&#x27;t get them extracted easily (couldn&#x27;t find any dentist willing to take that risk), so since six months, I have to take anti inflammatory drugs for the pain and antiobiotics to limit the infections, as well as the folic acid and corticosteroids needed for ITP, and I have no idea when will this end.<p>It&#x27;s very difficult to differentiate important advice from &quot;easy money&quot; advices, especially when this advice stems for a principle of precaution. Most peoples don&#x27;t develop severe ITP, but if they do, getting wisdom teeth removed before they can cause problems can be very important.')
