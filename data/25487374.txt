This has the same effect as when you click &#x27;Tools&#x27; and select a date restriction, but automatically applies it to default searches.<p>You can add this to Chrome by going to Settings -&gt; Manage search engines -&gt; Add. Name it &#x27;Google (Within Last Year)&#x27; and make the Query URL &#x27;<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=%s&amp;tbs=qdr:y&amp;tbo=1" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=%s&amp;tbs=qdr:y&amp;tbo=1</a>&#x27;. Then set it as the default.<p>This filters out of date and usually irrelevant search results across the web. You can override it manually from the &#x27;Past year&#x27; dropdown if the results are not extensive enough, which I do maybe 5% of the time.')
