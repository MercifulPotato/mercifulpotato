I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is, maybe there&#x27;s something special about the platform you&#x27;re on that doesn&#x27;t show up on my desktop computer. In either case, adjust the bottom margin by -1 pixel and move on with your life.<p>&gt; the assumption is the developer is uninformed about accessibility.<p>The assumption that the developer is uninformed about accessibility is the <i>kind</i> assumption, not the mean one. The alternative implication, that they knew about accessibility but chose to use inaccessible markup instead, is a much worse reading of the situation.<p>The kind reading of this comment is that 20 years after we started having this conversation, we still have failed to educate developers on how to use a button. That is something that&#x27;s valid to be sad about, it reflects nothing on the developer in question. It&#x27;s a failure of web education.<p>&gt; None of these is something reasonable to expect from a project like this simply because it was shared for free.<p>There&#x27;s a fundamental difference here between us then. I&#x27;m not shaming the developer, I&#x27;m not mad that they didn&#x27;t know in advance how to be accessible. I&#x27;m not mad that they released a project early without thinking about accessibility. But I am completely unapologetic about the idea that most developers on the web should be thinking about accessibility, and that it is reasonable to mention accessibility on public projects submitted into public spaces.<p>The web as a platform and a community cares about accessibility. So if you come onto the web and start making stuff, we will look at the accessibility and we will comment on it. We do that because, from the perspective of accessibility advocates, there are three options:<p>1. The technology gets restricted in some way so that you&#x27;re forced to be accessible (maybe click handlers can&#x27;t be attached to divs or something).<p>2. The law steps in and requires that anything beyond a hobby project be accessible, and we just kind of accept that blind people are excluded from the hobby web (not really acceptable to us).<p>3. We educate people and promote a value system that encourages developers to care about accessibility when possible.<p>We prefer the third option.<p>I want to encourage people to think that very basic accessibility accommodations are the standard normal thing that developers should think about. In my mind, this is the kinder option, because the alternative is stricter laws and more restrictive technology and frameworks that make it harder to do creative things.<p>Of course people can release whatever they want whenever they want. Of course, people can show off public projects that are unfinished or that have problems. Of course nobody can require anyone to release anything for free. But similarly, of course people in the public can point out that those projects aren&#x27;t fitting into the web ethos. The only way we are going to make progress on accessibility in the web is by encouraging a culture of people who care about accessibility.<p>The tech changes can only go so far. We can make HTML more semantic, but we can&#x27;t auto-caption images. At some point, people have to be convinced that this is worth caring about. Open Source does not mean we need to throw away any values about what good software should look like. We can be grateful that the author made a cool IDE while still openly acknowledging that it doesn&#x27;t in its current state conform to shared web values.')
