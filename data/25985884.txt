Sounds like a waste of time when what we really want is for people to own the means of production.<p>Dump 100% of federal tax revenue into index funds and let it grow faster than the interest on T-bills issued for expenditures.  Churn for ~50 years and start paying UBI from the massive profits.  Would the government even need to pay interest on the T-bills in USD?  Why not just issue more T-bills as interest because after all the long term pretty much guarantees the government would be swimming in cash in 50 years and have no trouble repaying it all.  Incidentally the federal government would also become the majority shareholder of every company in the world.<p>If the market can magically let everyone with enough money invested in their youth retire happily then it follows that letting the government own all the stocks and issue UBI would result in roughly the same outcome.')
