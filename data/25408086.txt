However, having had conversations with friends and family outside of Germany, they usually hear the costs and then imagine the system in the USA or their home country just with much lower costs. And this is just not the case. Our German system is a very different system from the USA at all levels which complicates direct comparisons.<p>Regardless, I think initiatives like this one which in general provide more opportunites to more people to better their lives is something I would like to see more of, not just in Germany but all over the world.')
