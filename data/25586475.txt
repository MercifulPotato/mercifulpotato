Either because I lost interest or I found another project that did what I aimed to do better than I imagined.<p>Only a couple went live but didn&#x27;t get traction:\n- A site for ip geolocation lookup\n- A curated index of conference talks and meetups<p>Last year I decided that I&#x27;d do much more market research before writing any code, and that I&#x27;d see it through all the way. So I&#x27;m working on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nslookup.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nslookup.io</a> for about half a year now, which isn&#x27;t profitable yet (â‚¬50 monthly cost). I&#x27;m still confident I can get it profitable. There&#x27;s enough search traffic, other tools have horrible UX, and I&#x27;ve committed to spending time on it at least weekly next year.')
