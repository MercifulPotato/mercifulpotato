But the constraints on position from GW aren&#x27;t always good and so you can&#x27;t always find it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemag.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;gravitational-waves-reveal-lightest-black-hole-ever-observed" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemag.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;gravitational-waves-...</a>')
