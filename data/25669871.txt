There is no significant difference to me in terms of privacy.<p>Usability is slightly different, yes, and you might also trust Signal more because they do better PR (they say outright that they&#x27;re from the USA and get money from Facebook, while Wire has devs in Berlin and claims to be a German company, while taking money from USA investors... which imo comes down to the same thing), or you might trust Wire more because they were actually audited at all.')
