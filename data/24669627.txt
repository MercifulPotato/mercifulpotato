I studied a Bachelors of Applied Science in a mix of mechanical, electrical, and software engineering, and I had lots of sleepless nights, feeling as if though I was running some sort of daily mathematical gauntlet. I had my parents to help with the cooking and the (rent-free) living, but the daily commute, the 8 hour days of class, the 2AM study sessions, projects, and homework assignments, really threw me into what I perceived to be adult hood. To each their own, though. If one doesn&#x27;t feel challenged in higher education, then I can see how one could perceive University to just be an extension of high school. The real kicker is, much doesn&#x27;t change after University. A day job can be easier, and less stress, and learning how to toss a couple chicken breasts on the pan after work is pretty simple')
