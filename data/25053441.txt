In unoptimized games, they&#x27;re projecting a 5% performance boost between their stock overclock and SMA (rumors put the overclock at only around 1%).<p>The bigger issue here is bandwidth. AMD hasn&#x27;t increased their APU graphics much because the slow DDR4 128-bit bus isn&#x27;t sufficient (let alone when the CPU and GPU are both needing to use that bandwidth).<p>I also didn&#x27;t mention PCIe lanes. They are notoriously power hungry and that higher TDP chip not only has way more, but also has PCIe 4 lanes which have twice the bandwidth and a big increase in power consumption (why they stuck with PCIe 3 on mobile).<p>It&#x27;s also notable that even equal cache sizes are not created equal. Lowering the latency requires more sophisticated designs which also use more power.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amd.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;technologies&#x2F;smart-access-memory" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amd.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;technologies&#x2F;smart-access-memory</a>')
