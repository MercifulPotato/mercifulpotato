It is a sign of the slowness of the process that it&#x27;s only recently become required, and reflects  15-years ago thinking, but it&#x27;s fine.<p>You are right that a lot of modern development processes need a fair bit of tweaking, but it&#x27;s mostly because they aren&#x27;t nearly careful enough for device use.  This may be a bit of a burden on pure software devices, but it&#x27;s probably the right trade off overall.<p>This is why the big shift in thinking for most developers will be the 14971 (risk management) adoption, not 62304 itself (IEC 62304 punts to ISO 14971 for this part, but it&#x27;s common with hardware dev)')
