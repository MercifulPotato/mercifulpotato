It&#x27;s an axiom that says that all proofs of x = y (that two terms are propositionally equal) are the same.<p>Now, UIP is valid if the only way of proving an equality is to show that the two terms are definitionally equal. However, there are various type theories, such as Homotopy Type Theory, in which this axiom does not hold because propositional equality can have other proofs.')
