You don’t need to know that history to build on what they made. In technology, all that matters is tomorrow.&quot;<p>To me this is a mind-numbing display of ignorance. Once you understand that you&#x27;re not the first human being to ever have existed and that the people that came before you (even way before) are not dumber than you, you will immediately realize that there&#x27;s a lot to learn from what has happened before.<p>This should be very obvious when it comes to political&#x2F;social endeavors (e.g. how to push for substantial social change without having things degenerate into some form of totalitarianism), but it&#x27;s equally as important for scientific and technological ones. For a simple and increasingly popular example just look at Sabine Hossenfelder&#x27;s line of criticism of contemporary theoretical physics. A lot of it draws on the sociological and historical study of the scientific process.')
