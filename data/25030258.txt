But I don&#x27;t understand why you consider it significant. Of course, secrecy is (and always has been) a way to lessen the impact of human rights problems. But where was it suggested that it would <i>solve</i> human rights problems?<p>&gt; But let’s see if there are any uses of encryption — as opposed to signing and securing data - that are truly indispensable to society and are the right and best solution to solve the problem.<p>I may be missing the point, but if I want to send a private electronic communication to someone (be it an email containing corporate secrets, a chat message discussing a sensitive topic, or a copy of my bank statements)... What do you propose instead of encrypting the communication channel?<p>&gt; checks and balances among the most powerful entities in the system [...] make sure it’s super hard to maintain a collusion for long<p>Isn&#x27;t a collusion exactly the way to break these rules founded on checks and balances?<p>&gt; you need to focus on architecting the governmen’t technology to be more benign in its rules<p>This sounds great in principle. But - while I haven&#x27;t exactly looked - I&#x27;m unaware of any government that&#x27;s looking to be re-architected, or a concrete proposal for how that would look like. Can you point me to an example of at least the latter?')
