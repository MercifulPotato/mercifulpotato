My approach was two-pronged: 1) eat better, 2) exercise.<p>For eating, I cut out as much sugar as I reasonably could. For exercise, I made sure I &quot;moved vigorously&quot; for 30 minutes per day, every day.<p>I was never a runner. And in my early shape, that 30 minutes was just me walking. Eventually, though, I stopped sweating and being out of breath, so I started walking more briskly. Then eventually I moved to a treadmill and started jogging for bits of it.<p>And then I could jog the whole time.  \nAnd then I could run while taking jog breaks.\nAbout 7 months in, I was able to run 5 miles in about 35 minutes. I did it every day.<p>The point was that I went every day. It wasn&#x27;t about how much I did, but that I was sweating and moving for 30 minutes. Lost 75 pounds in about 9 months.<p>I took the winter off last year and fell into sugar again, so I restarted this past summer. A 5k every day, as many days as I can. I have to run outside instead of at the gym, so weather controls a lot.<p>All of this is to say I agree, mostly. 30 minutes per day every day can fix a lot of problems. It did for me. :)')
