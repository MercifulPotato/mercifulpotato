Instead of being fed with eli5 explanations as I was in my childhood, these people and articles uncovered an entire world of <i>hard, real</i> physics to my layman curiosity that I still try to grasp. It was not what turned me off physics, it was what drove me into it. If someone cannot stand pedantry, chances are they’ll be fine with explanations that are simply wrong and nobody will point that out. See a root comment on light speed in medium itt, for example.')
