It’s terrible. Even adults struggle with SharePoint. Let alone an 8 year old kid. Let alone kids with different abilities and challenges.<p>Remote learning is terrible and I doubt it will ever be good enough to replace a classroom for you kids.<p>What could alleviate it is a device like a reMarkable. I gave mine to my daughter. With cloud sync and some scripts I wrote she has her work sheet handouts from her teacher on the device. It’s e-ink and she can write with a pen. It’s a thousand times easier than navigating SharePoint and trying to use MS Word.<p>But it’s still not enough. The video calls are terrible. Being at home around her parents all day is not great for her.<p>Best thing has been spending time together to be honest. Playing board games. Running around outside, hikes, etc.<p>But without the support of a community of educators trained to help kids develop, especially kids with special needs, it is very hard.')
