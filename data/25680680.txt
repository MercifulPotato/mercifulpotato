What criteria are you using to differentiate? Storming government buildings other than the Capital is OK?<p>I said nothing of the sort and I don&#x27;t know how you would interpret my words that way.<p>From the poster I responded to:<p>&gt; The other kind of insurrectionists seem to also have little to fear from the law<p>My response was about the notion that <i>protesters</i> and <i>rioters</i> this summer were &quot;insurrectionists&quot;, they were not. At least not as a general rule. Some of them, maybe, probably always are in political protests. But most of them were there to either create havoc (rioters) or protest for change to the way policing is conducted in the US (the protestors).<p>The people who went into the US Capitol Building on 6 January, 2021 were intending to prevent the carrying out of a legal process to certify the results of a democratic election and, in their minds, prevent the succession of the presidency. That makes them insurrectionists, not just protestors anymore, at least as regards the US Constitution and democratic process.<p>Besides, protestors and rioters in 2020 <i>were</i> prosecuted. And it&#x27;s moronic or ignorant to say they weren&#x27;t.')
