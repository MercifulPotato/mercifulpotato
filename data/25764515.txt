The problem with Spectre&#x2F;Meltdown is they might have been exploited for years, leading to wars&#x2F;economic harm that the general public will never be able to tie back to Intel.<p>On the balance of probabilities I think the Max debacle ended up doing more harm, but IMO Intel (and AMD&#x2F;ARM to a lesser extent) did get off easy because of the extremely technical nature of the issue.<p>Edit: I also agree that the max issue has a much more direct Executive Directive -&gt; Harm line to draw. I don&#x27;t think the Intel CEO went down to engineering and said anything comparable to &quot;create a new version of a plane that needs no new training while having completely new larger more efficient engines, even if that&#x27;s physically impossible&quot;')
