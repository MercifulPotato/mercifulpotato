Googling for &quot;&quot;need for intellectual stimulation&quot; iq&quot; shows some authoritative people saying that they tend to coincide; I don&#x27;t immediately see studies about it.<p>Now, I agree that school tends to squelch natural curiosity and such.  I really can&#x27;t say enough bad things about school.<p>Still, I can&#x27;t shake the hypothesis that a decent amount of observational data connected to schooling and unschooling is done by smart people, looking at their social group (likely to also be smart) and at the kids of those in their social group (likely to have inherited smartness).  John Holt formed some of his hypotheses teaching at a school with a minimum IQ cutoff (IIRC around 110-120) (researching, I think it was the Shady Hill school, the second one he taught at).<p>But at the very least, it seems to me that unschooling <i>will</i> work well with smart kids—the smarter, the better—and, furthermore, the smarter the kid is, the <i>worse</i> school will be adapted to them, so it seems pretty clear that, above some intelligence level, unschooling should be placed above school in the list of default recommendations (the specifics of the individual kid and the available schools would, of course, be used to tailor the default into the correct, but I am talking about the default).  I don&#x27;t know what level that should be, but I suspect it&#x27;s something like 120-130 IQ.')
