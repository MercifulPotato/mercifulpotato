It&#x27;s taken me to all kinds of interesting places I would have never seen, and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it.  Now as with anything there are different types of hunting that you can do. I use a pack and hike for miles at a time, I know other more successful hunters who use an ATV or dirt bike to cover a lot more ground than I do, but I&#x27;m happy putting in the work.')
