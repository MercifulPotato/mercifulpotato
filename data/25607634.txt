There is also a risk I get hit by a car on the way to work.<p>&gt;You will probably be much happier at a small to mid-size company. The “dream job” megacorps have sold you on is just good marketing.<p>Actually I&#x27;ve worked on interesting, highly used stuff at megacorps in mature work environments, and was paid much more than most random small companies would. The concept of a &quot;dream job&quot; doesn&#x27;t exist, neither in big companies or small companies, IMO.<p>&gt;They could hurt you, and they could make you hurt others.<p>I could just leave and get another job at any time. I don&#x27;t understand why this author is so paranoid.')
