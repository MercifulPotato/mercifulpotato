If one is going to contribute a debian directory, maybe it&#x27;s more efficient to contribute it to Debian directly.<p>Note also that making &quot;a&quot; .deb package is not the same as making an official Debian package that satisfies the Debian Policy and passes the automated linters (lintian, piuparts, autopkgtest, etc). The second will have the minimum quality that Debian expects.')
