We don&#x27;t really have an old money &#x2F; new money divide in NZ, unless you take members of the First Four Ships Association seriously (pro-tip, only members of the FFSA take them seriously).<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medbury.school.nz" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medbury.school.nz</a>')
