Realize that emotions have a physical aspect in your body that you can&#x27;t overcome with pure will any more than you could overcome, say, a broken arm with pure will. At least, not unless maybe you&#x27;re some sort of meditation master, but I&#x27;m not and I&#x27;d guess most of us aren&#x27;t either. Once the emotions are there in your body, it takes time for them to subside. Treat yourself well. Realize that it might not be possible for your work to not be affected. If you got a severe cold, you maybe would want to work but no matter how much you wanted your work to be unaffected, it would still be affected. I&#x27;m not comparing heartbreak to disease to imply that I think heartbreak is pathological - I don&#x27;t think that it is, although I also don&#x27;t necessarily think that it isn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m bringing up disease and damage to the body to try to emphasize that strong emotions have a similar effect on and in the body once they start up, and sometimes they only subside with time and good self-care.')
