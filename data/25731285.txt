Association is protected as free speech, so that&#x27;s government-compelled speech.  And the First Amendment prohibits the government from &quot;abridging the freedom of speech,&quot; which means no compelled speech or association.<p>Still, we do have some laws compelling speech (tobacco warning labels) and association (restaurants can&#x27;t refuse to serve Muslims).  But there has to be a good justification.  Warning labels express facts and prevent harm.  Protected classes are all things considered &quot;inherent&quot; to a person (gender, religion, ethnicity).  But there&#x27;s a high bar for these kind of laws.  And preventing people from choosing relationships based on politics is clearly against the First Amendment.<p>&gt;built off of public infrastructure<p>This describes almost every business.')
