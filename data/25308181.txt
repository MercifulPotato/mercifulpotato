I probably didn&#x27;t use the word &quot;resign&quot; as such but there was a time in my career when I went to my manager&#x27;s manager or maybe another level up the chain and basically said I could not work for my direct manager. I got my way even though it involved working in a bit of a backwater for a time. But I was prepared to leave if I didn&#x27;t get my way. (Didn&#x27;t hurt that I knew said manager was a bit on the outs with the exec who I knew quite well.)')
