You&#x27;re missing out on a few performance optimisations and stuff like iMessage and Facetime don&#x27;t work, but it&#x27;s definitely good enough to just run and debug builds, possibly even with hardware acceleration inside the necessary emulators (not VMs).<p>If you want to go the VM route, you&#x27;ll probably run into trouble because Apple&#x27;s OS assumes that the processor is made by Intel (not strange, because all of their x64 processors are bought from Intel). There&#x27;s a few patches you can download and install to make the OS boot on macOS though, and with those the VM should work in VirtualBox, VMWare, KVM, this snap, and that Docker image running qemu that someone posted at some point. Details about what to patches you may need can be found somewhere in [1], as well as a list of limitations. For example, running virtual machines on an AMD Hackintosh is practically impossible.<p>If you want to get the bare basics working in a virtual machine, running through the opencore install guide inside the VM will most definitely work, though the GUI will be slow as molasses because of the lack of GPU acceleration. That&#x27;s still fine for running a build task over something like SSH though. There&#x27;s options!<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dortania.github.io&#x2F;OpenCore-Install-Guide&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dortania.github.io&#x2F;OpenCore-Install-Guide&#x2F;</a>')
