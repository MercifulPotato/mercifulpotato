What I really want is a traditional email account but headless (a frontend UI that works would be great, but there are plenty of those around already).  I have a bunch of other projects I&#x27;m working on at the moment so I haven&#x27;t built that myself, but I&#x27;ve gotten close a number of times.  I would pay $3&#x2F;month for a small account like that, going up to $10&#x2F;month for lots of storage (but I won&#x27;t need much personally).<p>I&#x27;ve heard that Gmail actually has a pretty good API, but I haven&#x27;t looked into it.  Has anyone tried using gmail from the API?')
