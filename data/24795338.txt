If I buy a sandwich with a card I found on the ground and get away with it who&#x27;s paying for that sandwich? The card owner? The store owner? The card provider?<p>In the UK it&#x27;s the store... unless they made you use chip and a PIN. Which is why they all use the chip and a PIN. Then it&#x27;s the card provider, but it&#x27;s not because the chip and PIN prevents fraud before that point. I think the card provider eats contactless payments because they encourage more of them so it adds up in the end.')
