Then compare those with used products well past their warranty period that <i>haven&#x27;t</i> broken, and look at why they haven&#x27;t.<p>Repairability also comes to mind. Everything breaks eventually -- can&#x27;t cheat entropy -- but when it does, can you easily repair it? Right-to-repair movement would get in on the action.')
