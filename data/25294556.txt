Item(by='iandanforth', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607028290, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25292386, text='Title is contentious. The article&#x27;s title says she was fired. The sequence of events was that she was said she would resign if her conditions were not met, Google did not meet those conditions and terminated her.<p>Neither &quot;fired&quot; nor &quot;resigns&quot; seems correct. I feel that she was &quot;forced out&quot; or &quot;let go&quot; (ironically this euphemism is more accurate here). She threatened to leave and they kicked her out.')
