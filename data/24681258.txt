No connecting&#x2F;disconnecting bluetooth, no walking out of range and the sound getting choppy, I can select which speaker I want to play directly from spotify or open the app and play multiple rooms at once. Not sure how well it works (or if it even can) as a direct bluetooth speaker. I think it’s more like a little music server and your phone is just the remote.')
