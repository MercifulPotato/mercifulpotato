Once you factor video calls AND videos (this is doubly true for homeschool, you should know that presentations are usually transmitted as video in real time even though it is silly as it is), you start to eat that 40GB allocation for each day. Add two people working at home and two schoolchildren definitely surpass 40GB per day even when they sacrificed entertainment.')
