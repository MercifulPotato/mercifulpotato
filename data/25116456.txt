The exponential functions are still the simultaneous eigenvectors of time shifts.<p>The Laplace transform seems to be just using the fact that &lt;f,g&gt; = integrate(f(x) g(x), x from 0 to infinity) is an inner product for the space of square integrable functions (probably better would be &lt;f,g&gt; = integrate(f(x) conj(g(x)), x from 0 to infinity) as a Hermitian product).  The various e^(ax) functions are linearly independent, so the functions g |-&gt; &lt;e^(ax), g&gt; are linearly independent functionals.  If the exponential functions are actually enough, then this means you can study a function by studying the vector consisting of its value through all the functionals, which is the Laplace transform.<p>The Laplace transform has a pretty bad inverse formula, partly because the exponential functions are not orthogonal with respect to the inner product.')
