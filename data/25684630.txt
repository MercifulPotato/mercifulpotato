This &quot;privacy&quot; PR push is all about forcing developers to advertise with Apple instead of Facebook. What Apple is doing is closing the tab for everyone else while they can look pure as snow because iMessage doesn&#x27;t need those permissions since Apple already get the data elsewhere in the apple ecosystem. Like opt-out unique advertisement ID on all iPhones, Apple login, iCloud, etc. So iMessage is also bringing in advertisement money, it&#x27;s just harder to spot.')
