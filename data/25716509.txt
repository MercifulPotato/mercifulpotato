I just cook with it.<p>I sorta wonder if there&#x27;s a kind of placebo effect. When you really think about your tools, you notice lots of little things to do better (or I did anyway).<p>Getting the pan hot enough, and being aware of what parts are hotter, like the ring where the burner heats the skillet, had a huge impact on stuff &quot;sticking&quot; I don&#x27;t know if the heat helps seal up little micro holes and cracks, so food doesn&#x27;t grab onto those edges. Or perhaps The moisture turns to steam and creates a little gap, letting food sort of float above the pan, never really making contact. Maybe both.<p>Just a tiny bit of lubrication helps so much as well. A spray of pam or a few drops of oil work wonders.<p>With a good understanding of heat and lubrication, I feel sorta like I could cook eggs on a pie pan over a burner, and they won&#x27;t stick.<p>I wonder how much is seasoning, and how much is understanding how the tools work, inside and out, to get desired outcomes.')
