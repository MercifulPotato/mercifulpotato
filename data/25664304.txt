Level 1 is having one side present their case—basically the status quo.  Level 2 is having some group of people with a strong incentive to find flaws and what&#x27;s missing, and with a platform on which to present their criticisms.  Level 3 is to have people (possibly from the first group, possibly other members of the second group) critique the criticisms, and possibly iterate that.  Level 4 might include live debates, although that has pros and cons relative to written arguments.<p>A tactic that I suspect would be useful is the ability to call out specific things—&quot;Yeah, a bunch of this stuff is arguable and murky, but that thing you said right there is <i>wrong</i> and I can <i>prove it</i>; I will stake a chunk of my reputation on this, and we will litigate the issue, and if I&#x27;m successful, it should damage your reputation and boost mine&quot;—combined with people expecting to be in the system for long enough that reputations are worthwhile.  (&quot;Wrong&quot; will include &quot;factually wrong&quot; and might also include &quot;against the rules of this system&quot;—it might be sensible to have rules about claims needing to be backed up by certain kinds of evidence.)<p>I think at least some parts of academia were supposed to work something like this, and maybe a few parts of it actually do.')
