Item(by='OldHand2018', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610506613, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25755083, text='&gt; It&#x27;s not real worth it to have an excess of equipment that really only sees a few days of use a year (or decade!)<p>That’s just silly.  Almost every garbage truck in Chicago has the equipment to allow a plow to be attached to it.  They can  nearly double their fleet of plows for big storms, which are pretty rare.<p>There was a unexpected blizzard in 1979 right before the mayoral election and the mayor lost because the city didn’t plow the streets fast enough.  Ever since then, Chicago has always had more snow plows than needed.  Even political cronies go out and shovel sidewalks because they are so afraid of losing due to snow.')
