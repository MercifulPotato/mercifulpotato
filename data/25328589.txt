I&#x27;ve been putting random magenta drum and melody generations through this free synth Vital ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vital.audio&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vital.audio&#x2F;</a> )<p>Second step is choose a lead preset based on random letter generation (whatever is closest). (I believe this is the hard part as far as generation goes ... but there are patterns to oscillator presets)<p>Third step is import the generated MIDI into your DAW like Logic or Ableton.\nFourth, pick a key and quantize the notes.\nFinally pick a pad and match the bass notes.<p>I&#x27;ll generate one right now ... all AI&#x2F;randomized except for the design of the preset.
