If you&#x27;re not familiar with Manufacturing Consent I recommend watching the movie, it&#x27;s very eye opening.<p>As for a solution to the epistemic divide that you&#x27;re talking about, that&#x27;s very difficult. Each side has a fundamentally different basis of understanding the current situation. I&#x27;d say there are actually at least three sides, not two.<p>From my perspective:<p>1) &quot;The Trumpers&quot; - they believe that they are fighting a corrupt establishment that is destroying their way of life.<p>2) &quot;The Left&quot; - they believe that Trump is a proto-dictator who is destroying democracy.<p>3) &quot;The Centrists&quot; - they believe Trump is a conman, and that the establishment is corrupt.<p>Maybe the only way to get everyone on the same page is to find a common root belief, and work up from there. That&#x27;s nearly impossible when you have echo chambers, propaganda, and lack of access to information. That and most people aren&#x27;t even trying to come to an understanding.<p>The way I see it, the only thing that would fix this is to actually solve the underlying problem creating the division. I believe that the underlying problem is the centralization of power and wealth going to the oligarchs.')
