That&#x27;s usually the case when you are early in a big task, churning out code with rapid results showing up. Closer to the end, it&#x27;s the opposite with perhhaps 1,2,3 hours of effective work in a 7-8 hour day. \nOn average It&#x27;s going to be somewhere in between.<p>This is how I <i>want</i> it to be though. Obviouslt I enjoy my work most the days when I&#x27;m in the zone producing a lot. But I also don&#x27;t want any expectation of my productivity to require that. I&#x27;m in a position where I can do 2-3h of effective work per day and exceed the expectations I have on me. I like that.')
