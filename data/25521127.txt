I was actually pretty impressed with the setup and didn’t feel at all out of place. Having magit there was a welcome surprise. If there was an org-mode replacement I might even make the switch permanent, as much as I love spacemacs sometimes I just don’t want to fiddle with my configs so much.<p>So yes, thanks for making this, it saved me just the other week!<p>[1] I generally spend my time with Go&#x2F;Rust, it was likely user error.')
