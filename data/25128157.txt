I’m using Ansible specifically because I can push directly from my personal machine.<p>I strongly prefer NOT to have passwordless sudo. Disabling root login and then enabling passwordless sudo seems like a pointless exercise in ticking the boxes—any benefit from disabling root login is undone by enabling passwordless sudo.')
