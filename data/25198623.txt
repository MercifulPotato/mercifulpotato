Just as an excellent physician can espouse wildly unscientific beliefs, so too can someone become quite good at the craft of engineering without actually doing much science at all.<p>&gt; I can&#x27;t come to science and ask it, &quot;How long should we quarantine to minimize health impact, and maximize economic recovery?&quot; Ultimately, that question does not have a scientific answer. It can be informed by statistics -- to the best that we understand the numbers, and scientists can present models of what they think the future will look like... but results not guaranteed.<p>Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but you consider &quot;hard&quot; disciplines like orbital mechanics and structural engineering to be science, and anything with less certainty in it to be <i>not</i> science, but statistics. This is inaccurate. Find me a scientific field that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> involve uncertainty and statistical analysis. Your examples of orbital mechanics and structural engineering certainly do. Conclusions made in both of these disciplines will always need to account for various sources of irreducible error (e.g., uncertainty in mass, temperature, altitude, fuel load; simplifying assumptions about atmosphere structure, gravity anomaly, solar wind, etc.). The importance of safety factors is the ultimate proof that uncertainty is core to engineering: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Factor_of_safety" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Factor_of_safety</a><p>Science is the modeling of reality by formulating and testing hypotheses through observation and&#x2F;or experiment. Does epidemiology not fall squarely within this definition? What do you propose as an alternative approach to inform governments and individuals what to do in the face of a natural phenomenon (a pandemic) which, although inherently uncertain, exhibits behaviors that are decidedly <i>not</i> random and inherently unpredictable?')
