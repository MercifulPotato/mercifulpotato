Will definitely be interesting to keep track of this.<p>Isn&#x27;t is a bit misleading (incorrect) to talk of &quot;the&quot; vaccine, when there are a few different ones in use already (and more planned to be used)? It would be nice to drill down and separate the different vaccines but a quick correction would be to at least change the title and description.<p>Also, it makes it sound like the data is more or less complete, but it is missing countries like China, Russia and India, for example, all of which have started vaccinations already according to $media? And probably some others?')
