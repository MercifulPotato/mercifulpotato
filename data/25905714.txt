There&#x27;s a lot to unpack in your post but let&#x27;s just focus on a couple of things. Firstly, borrowing _does_ create money - it&#x27;s how most money comes into existence. Straight from the horse&#x27;s mouth:<p>&gt; Most of the money in the economy is created, not by printing presses at the central bank, but by banks when they provide loans. [0]<p>You said:<p>&gt; Borrowing does not create money in FRB, since all loans are deposits<p>Loans are not deposits. Loans sit on the asset side of the balance sheet and represent an IOU from the borrower to the bank. Deposits sit on the liability side of the balance sheet and represent an IOU from the bank to the deposit holder - the borrower in this case. Banks are literally in the business of swapping IOUs... Our IOUs which are not widely accepted for their IOUs which are widely accepted.<p>Furthermore, commercial banks make absolutely zero promises to redeem their IOUs for base money or central bank issued money, or anything else for that matter. Read the terms and conditions of your bank account to see for yourself! If the bank creates too many bad loans, then the value of their IOUs fall to take this into account.<p>Lastly, Central banks were not created to bail out commercial banks. The first central bank (the Bank of England) was created by the Government at the time to fund the on-going war with France. The government gave the Bank of England monopoly rights over currency issue in return for financing the war - i.e. giving them a whole bunch of IOUs on the Bank of England to pay soldiers and factories because the credit risk of the government at the time was considered quite poor.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bankofengland.co.uk&#x2F;knowledgebank&#x2F;how-is-money-created" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bankofengland.co.uk&#x2F;knowledgebank&#x2F;how-is-money-c...</a>')
