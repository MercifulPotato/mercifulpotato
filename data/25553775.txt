It’s the best tool for managing development tasks imo. Takes the best features of JIRA without the horrible UI&#x2F;UX (linear has workflows, boards, lists, assignments, tags, cycles, projects, etc).<p>It’s also just incredibly simple to start using. They have a free version, so I’d say it’s worth checking out. It has integration with GitHub and Slack, which is about all I need as far as integrating goes.<p>I’ve used both Monday and Asana. I’ve not used Zenhub. Comparing linear to Monday and Asana, I’d say linear is much faster. It’s a native Mac app. It’s also nicer looking than both imo, which is a big deal for me.')
