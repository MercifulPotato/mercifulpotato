AM radio can be received using a crystal radio, 100+ year old technology, if the signal is strong enough. You need 6 parts, antenna, ground lead, coil, capacitor, diode, headphones.<p>To receive FM mono, you <i>could</i> use a diode radio, tuning off to the side of the carrier.<p>To receive FM stereo, you need a fair bit of electronics, including a phase locked loop.<p>Receiving FM stereo with RDS, etc. is a quite challenging thing to do in terms of signal processing. It is the only time my laptop really just can&#x27;t keep up in terms of all the experimenting with Gnu Radio. It has the combination of high complexity, and high bandwidth that multiply out to a large compute load.<p>That is why the warning was included.<p>--- And now, for more info than you asked ---<p>I&#x27;ve had an SDR dongle for years, and got back into it when the plague hit.  I&#x27;ve received AM, FM, Single Sideband, all are fairly narrow bandwidth, so I have plenty of compute power to spare for making complex graphs.<p>One of the &quot;radios&quot; I&#x27;ve built can receive all 5 NOAA weather radio channels at the same time.<p>Another receives the local VOR (VHF Omni Range) station, and plots the direction to the transmitter.<p>I can record an arbitrary 2 Mhz wide swath of bandwidth to disk (SSD, actually) in real time until I run out of disk space, and then post-process it later in any manner of my choosing.<p>GNU radio is free software, and so much fun to play with.<p>If you&#x27;re a reddit user, I recommend checking out<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;GNURadio&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;GNURadio&#x2F;</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;RTLSDR&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;RTLSDR&#x2F;</a><p>You can listen to SDR on the net at\n<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.websdr.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.websdr.org&#x2F;</a>')
