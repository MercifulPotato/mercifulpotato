No need to require DNS or DNSSEC at all.<p>The registrar generates a unique token for whatever the domain owner wants to manage a cert for that&#x27;s based on their domain. <i>&quot;oj3942hur9h239rh9hr4394834r domain.com&quot;</i> or <i>&quot;92839ub9f93hh9hsjdksjd</i> <i></i>* <i>.foo.domain.com&quot;</i>, doesn&#x27;t matter. CA makes a request with the token and the CSR, registrar looks at the CSR, finds the record matching the token, finds that the CSR matches the record, signs its reply &quot;yes, this is valid&quot; with its own key, and the CA obliges the user. You don&#x27;t even need DNS to make the request if it&#x27;s hosted on some static IPs.<p>If anyone&#x27;s seriously waiting on DANE in order to resolve a handful of security vulnerabilities that affect the entire Internet (because at this point the entire Internet&#x27;s security hinges on TLS), we might as well also wait for Jesus to come down from his bachelor pad in the sky and solve our national debt.')
