In every company I’ve worked at, ML is a team or teams that partners with product managers and other engineering teams to learn about problems they need solved. It’s very systematic, boring, and tied heavily to those other teams as the leaders and decision makers.<p>First you look for high level value propositions, like automating a decision process, removing a customer friction point, creating key metrics where simple metrics are intractable, or various multi-modal information retrieval goals.<p>You identify opportunities in these kinds of high level areas in lock-step with product managers and other engineering leaders. Then you move on to identify sources of data that can be leveraged, and eventually (much later) you get to the smaller set of work training a model, validating with acceptance tests and hardening the implementation for safe production deployment.<p>If people are spouting “mumbo jumbo” and making big ML model decisions without lock-step synchronization with other stakeholders, that sounds like <i>organizational</i> dysfunction, not any type of issue with ML.<p>I also find it odd that you bring up “cost[ing] a lot of money” .. that’s very out of place among everything else mentioned. That seems more like insecurity or jealousy over the market demand for ML talent, and wanting to cut other people down rather than work with them or acknowledge the level of effort it required to get that level of expertise in ML.')
