There would be details, but there are always details, and they don&#x27;t stop two hundred page EULAs from existing and being (mostly) binding.<p>But we don&#x27;t have this because Stallman is a zealot and he wanted to Make A Point about purity. So instead of creating a market where devs could actually get paid for original work and corporations would be the ones paying, corporations get millions of hours of development effort for free - because he thought he could somehow magically strong-arm them into playing to his rules.')
