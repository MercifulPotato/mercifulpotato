Those sources which I have seen mostly or totally debunked it so it would be interesting to see what made your sources come to a different conclusion.<p>[edit] <i>I must say it is both amazing as well as abhorring to see a post asking for sources to a statement which goes counter the current narrative to be downvoted (currently at -4) as if the question is somehow offensive.
