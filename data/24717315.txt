Fail a project in Haskell, and you have a Haskell failure.<p>* Management has a large veto power, and management usually favors technologies they are used to, or used to use themselves.<p>* Management also favors their ease of work with the tech. In practice, they often hold the belief that it&#x27;s much easier to find java developers than it is to find haskell developers.<p>* Haskell suffers from a reputation of being &quot;academic&quot; and &quot;hard to do real things with&quot;.<p>In practice, I&#x27;ve done great commercial projects in Haskell, and the technology was worth using. When done right, recruiting for haskell projects was much faster than recruiting for any mainstream language. On the flipside, it was sometimes hard to get adequate corporate stewardship for the language (for instance, managers&#x2F;HR insisting they found no one for the job after publishing through the usual channels when you know half a dozen people at the local meetup that would jump ship if offered a position).')
