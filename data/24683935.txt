The lenses are actually kind of orange, it isn&#x27;t just a coating.<p>I can&#x27;t say I really feel any difference day to day, but I do like them and feel they&#x27;re more comfortable for a long day in front of the screen. If I could do it again I&#x27;d probably opt for a less noticeable coating. I get a lot of comments saying they look like &quot;gunner&quot; glasses.')
