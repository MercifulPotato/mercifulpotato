The real solution, with no need to magic as you say, is to disallow spaces at the filesystem level (just like slashes and the null character are forbidden).  For users typing filenames, this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem, as those can be encoded e.g., as unicode&#x27;s non-breaking space.  Using space as a separator is a very important power, that other programming languages share.  In what other programming language can you put spaces in variable names?  In the shell, filenames <i>are</i> variable names!  It is only natural that a space cannot appear inside a filename (but of course, most other unicode characters can).')
