For some, &quot;terrorism&quot; is a label assigned to your opposing groups, for others it&#x27;s about violence for political or religious purposes. If it&#x27;s from another nation-state, it&#x27;s usually not labeled terrorism, even if it&#x27;s against civilians for political&#x2F;religious purposes. Some groups are labeled &quot;terrorists&quot; even without any recorded history of violence, and so on.<p>I&#x27;m not disagreeing with you, just adding that what &quot;terrorism&quot; is, is not as black-and-white as you put it.')
