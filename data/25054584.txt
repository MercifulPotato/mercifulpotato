Nvidia labels their Tegra AGX Xavier part as 5.5 TFLOP&#x2F;s (FP16) and AMD&#x27;s APUs say 1.8 TFLOP&#x2F;s (FP32).<p>They also say &quot;up to&quot; 3.5x CPU performance (total performance) of previous generation macs, then make references to a Mac with a 1.2 GHz quad core Core i7 (MacBook Air) and a quad core 3.6 GHz Core-i3 (Mac Mini).<p>I would like to see some independent benchmarks personally...')
