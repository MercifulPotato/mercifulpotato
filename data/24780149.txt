It just the common model family using Niobium-Tin wires you see in hospitals or media. There are permanent magnet MRI machines.<p>What do you mean by &quot;fast batteries&quot;? For regenerative breaking one can already use supercapacitors. Will room temp SMES cheaper than that?<p>Electric motors are pretty efficient and small already, there is 0.6mm motor from Namiki. Sure they can get smaller. How does room temp superconductor help that? Smaller motors have better cooling than big motors so ohmic heating is not a problem.')
