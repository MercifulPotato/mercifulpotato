Also, if they&#x27;re unaware of the negative effects of lead (or even unaware that their gasoline HAS lead) then there would be no incentive for them to choose what they&#x27;re told is a worse product. This was before the internet, so it was difficult and time-consuming to do research on something like this. Gas companies said leaded gasoline was safe so everyone went with it.<p>The government&#x27;s job here is to <i>do</i> that tedious research and ban&#x2F;regulate anything that&#x27;s hazardous to health and safety. The alternative would be a grassroots campaign by citizen experts who decide to go against the advice of what <i>should be</i> trusted sources, which is how you end up with stuff like the anti-vax movement.')
