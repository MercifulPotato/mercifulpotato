They don&#x27;t require any CLA signing etc, and their only defense seems to be &quot;you should have read our policy&quot;, which isn&#x27;t obvious to a casual contributor, or easy to discover (it&#x27;s mentioned in a policy regarding archival of emails [1]).<p><pre><code>  &gt; Additionally, source code submissions to mailing lists such as pgsql-hackers are considered submissions to the PostgreSQL project, falling under the project&#x27;s PostgreSQL licence. Please make sure you have permission to share information with these lists before sending your message.\n\n</code></pre>\nNot requiring CLA signing greatly lowers the barrier to contributing. As a conscientious employee I had to get my company&#x27;s lawyers&#x27; permission when one project asked me to sign their CLA-like document. I can only imagine how hard it can get for a prolific contributor, if they also happen to start care about legal issues.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;policies&#x2F;archives&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;about&#x2F;policies&#x2F;archives&#x2F;</a>')
