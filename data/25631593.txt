The editor needs to be aware of python&#x27;s indenting rules so it can do this, but once again if you&#x27;ve worked out a nice way to do this please say. Minimal keystrokes required would be great =)...<p>...I call this &quot;copy&#x2F;paste&quot;.  And since I use X clipboard and a tiled window manager, it&#x27;s only a couple keystrokes and no mouse.  Highlight the code in the editor, &quot;super+&lt;direction&gt;&quot; to switch windows, &quot;shift+insert&quot; to paste.')
