But a huge amount of the bag holding is going to be done by retail investors.<p>Yup, people are buying into a misconception here that because of high short interest there must be more to squeeze and the shorts will be the bag holders, while completely ignoring that the further this goes from the actual value of GME the more attractive it is to short, so who is short may change, but short interest won&#x27;t go down much. The mob for some reason sees the short interest not going down as &quot;they&#x27;ll have to buy it at a higher price!&quot; Once the smart longs start taking their profits the whole idea will fall apart, some shorts are going to make much more than people who bought early in the run and held thinking it would keep running up.')
