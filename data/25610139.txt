WTF is that about?<p>I think it&#x27;s because there are a lot of them proportionally, as responses to the pandemic have been rather divided even within close social groups.<p>Try shaming party-goers in your friendship circle on, say, social media, and you might find the blowback hard going as &quot;they&quot; in sufficient numbers shame you back for being too cautious or controlling, and you become the pariah.  Even if you&#x27;re confident you&#x27;re right, you can feel the loss of social capital.  And who wants to be known as the sourpuss who tries to ruin other people&#x27;s happy times?<p>Maybe feeling like losing social capital is even an illusion, amplified by the way social media distorts social group feelings.  It only takes a few people to point the shame back at you to induce a feeling that the larger group sees you that way, whether they do or not, because your other social connections tend not to speak up in your defence.')
