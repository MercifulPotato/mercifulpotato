There used to be a rule not to bring up religion or politics up at work, and this rule was good. Just because the left or what is more commonly known as liberal side of people are increasingly comfortable ignoring that rule doesn&#x27;t make it any less of a proper rule. Keep the personal feelings aside and do what you&#x27;re paid to do to the best of your ability, eventually the pendulum will swing in the other direction and the loud people now will be punished for being loud, and then the people on the right will begin to be loud and obnoxious. At that point, even if you agree with things being said, still keep your mouth shut and do your work to your best of your ability. Everybody who is paying attention and values hard work sees who is showing restraint and that restraint gets rewarded in the long term. It&#x27;s not as fun in the short term to have discipline when very few people around you have discipline, but long term it is much more fun and worthwhile.')
