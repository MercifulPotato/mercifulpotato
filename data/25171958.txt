Item(by='khendron', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605986000, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25148260, text='I would reword &quot;Vote with you feet&quot; to be &quot;It&#x27;s OK to change jobs&quot;, so as to give it a broader meaning.<p>There is no obligation for you to stay in a job you don&#x27;t like, or to pursue a different opportunity. You don&#x27;t have to explain your reasons for leaving. Your employer and your team will probably be fine without you, and if they are not it is not your problem. To often I&#x27;ve stayed in a job I didn&#x27;t like because &quot;I&#x27;d be letting my team down&quot; or &quot;we&#x27;re too busy, now is not a good time.&quot; Screw that. If you are not liking it, find something else and leave.<p>I&#x27;d also add one more: &quot;Take your vacation&quot;. You are no good to anybody (you, your friends, your family, or your employer) if you work self to burn out. It&#x27;s not worth it, and the world won&#x27;t end while you are away.')
