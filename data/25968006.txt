You can call it nostalgia, but hey, that&#x27;s coding for fun, pushing the machine to the limit, taking time to optimize for speed or memory instead of customer&#x27;s satisfaction. Plus you get to meet other passionnated people, like before.<p>So yeah, it&#x27;s somewhat &quot;going back&quot;, but at least, I can express creativity in some unbounded ways. Plus, I code <i>my</i> dream, not the dream of the company which is paying me :-)')
