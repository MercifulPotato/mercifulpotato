We know that being female with a degree correlates quite well with being left wing, as does being young. In contrast being an older white male correlates somewhat with being conservative.<p>If the actual discrimination here is against &quot;people likely to be conservative&quot; - which is absolutely likely to be happening given what&#x27;s going on in these firms - then setting quotas for gender and age wouldn&#x27;t be addressing the underlying problems, only symptoms.')
