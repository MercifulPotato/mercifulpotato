Item(by='thiht', descendants=None, kids=[25319112, 25319206], score=None, time=1607207617, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25318977, text='&gt; I used to like Reddit a lot, but I feel their push to reach a broader audience has pushed down the quality of the front-page subs. It is dominated by a sense of moral superiority: &quot;Am I the Asshole&quot;, &quot;Justice Served&quot;, Leopards ate my Face&quot; are very common now.<p>...don&#x27;t subscribe to these subreddits then? Reddit allows to curate what you see, so do the curation. Viewing my frontpage when I&#x27;m logged in vs when I&#x27;m not is a completely different experience. It&#x27;s a bit like viewing the Youtube trending videos.')
