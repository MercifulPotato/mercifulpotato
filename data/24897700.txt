Gaming. Just about nobody games on Linux with nVidia. Most people I know who game (from Linux) with nVidia GPUs use PCI passthrough to a guest VM running Windows. Very few use nVidia GPUs on their host system. My primary setup is a 2950x&#x2F;128GB DDR4&#x2F;Vega 56&#x2F;2080 Super -- the latter goes to kvm exclusively.<p>2. &quot;Research&quot; such as machine learning. You don&#x27;t need Wayland or X11 for this, and the proprietary drivers work the best. To be honest, this is a space where Ubuntu Server performs best. I keep one of these around in a VM (see above) for this purpose. (Mining also goes in this category)<p>Everything else can probably be done with an Intel or AMD GPU tbh.')
