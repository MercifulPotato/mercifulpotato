Everyone who uses it vs the xbone agrees its 100% a better experience. I don&#x27;t have to log into an account to play, it doesn&#x27;t take 10 mins to update a game, etc. Two people grab controllers and within a few seconds are shooting&#x2F;fighting&#x2F;whatever each other. Plus the variety is much larger.<p>I think a lot of the problem is the commoditization and merging of genre&#x27;s along with the overwhelming dominance of a small number of game engines.<p>This means that a modern RPG pretty much plays the same as a strategy or shooter. Which makes everything feel like a remake of something you have already played. Particularly as the games don&#x27;t really have differing artistic styles anymore either because that is more a function of how the game engine works than what texture selection or lighting effects are used.<p>Maybe the best way to describe it, is that modern games are &quot;cold&quot;.')
