There is no way it&#x27;s hardened against the last ten years of USENIX papers that have never been used in practice<p>I don&#x27;t have much hope for his twitter byline:<p>&gt; Trustworthy tech at the Stanford Internet Observatory<p>Obviously not trustworthy if he&#x27;s deleting tweets which show him in a negative light - i.e. talking authoritatively out of his arse on subjects which more informed people call him out on.
