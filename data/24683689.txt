I have done so for many years.  The web might be &quot;big&quot; but the portion of it you as a personal user are accessing is comparatively small.  If you tally up all the domains you are currently visiting (excluding nonsense like ad servers), chances are, a zone file that contains the RRs for every domain you will ever need to visit in your entire lifetime would fit on a small-sized USB stick from 10 years ago.  You can effectively avoid recursion.  100% authoritative DNS, all served from your computer.<p>Today&#x27;s USB sticks can accomodate the largest zones like .com  several times over.  That is more web than you could possibly surf in your lifetime.')
