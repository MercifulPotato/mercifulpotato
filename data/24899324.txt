There are many, many Asian students there. In fact, nearly one in five students at Harvard are of Asian descent. The idea that elite schools are purposely excluding Asians is absurd on its face. The people pushing the idea have an axe to grind and it usually isn’t actually in the interest of Asian-Americans.<p>Looks like the courts found that Harvard&#x27;s admissions system did not qualify as <i>legally</i> discriminatory, but did nonetheless somewhat disadvantage Asian-American applicants. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;01&#x2F;us&#x2F;harvard-admissions-lawsuit.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;01&#x2F;us&#x2F;harvard-admissions-law...</a>')
