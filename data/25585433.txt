Almost all children play games, and certainly more than half of all games (weighted by popularity) are violent.<p>&gt; very high, say 1 out of 1,000<p>That seems the opposite of high. High would be 1 in 2 or 1 in 5.<p>If the effect of everyone playing video games is 1 additional crime per 100 000 people I don&#x27;t see the problem TBH.')
