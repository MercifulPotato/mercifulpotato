Was the account of seeing him rise to heaven a later addition?<p>Likewise I&#x27;d also like to see what the real Christ had to say (if he did in fact exist - that&#x27;s still disputed AFAIK). I&#x27;ve always liked to imagine he was much less spiritual and more political. I imagine there were a few other would-be messiahs doing the rounds, I wonder what they were up to, and how similar they were (I think we can be confident they were about because the New Testament does mention them - albeit very unfavourably).<p>Another time &#x2F; place to go would be when the first books of the Old Testament were written. There&#x27;s a theory doing the rounds that the first book written was Leviticus, which acted as a kind of early legal code. Then the theology was added later as a means of justifying the law and marrying it to a religion rather than just a city state. There are also arguments that early Judaism was polytheistic and Yehova was a god of a city rather than &quot;the god&quot; in the original conception.<p>I&#x27;ve always been curious about the origins of those belief systems and how close our Bible reflects the actual beliefs and cosmology of Iron Age proto-Israelite society.')
