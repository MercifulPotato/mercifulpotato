Item(by='mhink', descendants=None, kids=[25441441, 25439270], score=None, time=1608094496, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25438929, text='I am far from an HVAC expert, but I <i>think</i> these lines from the article help clarify the issue:<p>&gt; The temperature dial doesnâ€™t work, the building controls whether its heating or cooling time.<p>&gt; The fluid temperature is out of our control since the building adjusts it based on the outside temperature.<p>It doesn&#x27;t sound like the device they have available is actually a proper thermostat- rather, it&#x27;s just a control device for a water heater + radiator + fan. The switch adjusts how fast air is blowing over the radiator, and the dial is <i>supposed</i> to adjust the temperature of the fluid in the radiator.<p>But if I understand correctly, the building sets their radiator fluid temperature for the whole building, and it sounds like the fan speed is apparently useless, so the only control the author has over their <i>unit&#x27;s</i> temperature is whether or not the fan is on or off.<p>So, what they built is the actual thermostat, which mechanically actuates the on&#x2F;off switch based on a temperature measurement.')
