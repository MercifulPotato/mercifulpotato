What makes it special is that it uses RN&#x27;s JSI to avoid the JSON (de)serialization that&#x27;s usually required when going over the bridge.<p>In my tests our library performed 2x (iPhone XS) to 7x faster (Samsung J5) than either AsyncStorage or react-native-sqlite-storage, as both depend on the RN&#x27;s bridge.<p>We are going to be using this in production long term. Looking forward to your comments and happy to help if you are planning to use this.')
