Item(by='SECProto', descendants=None, kids=[25775695, 25772569], score=None, time=1610602257, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25772245, text='&gt; Most driving interactions in a Tesla are through the stalk or knob rollers on the steering wheel (that adjust based on situation). It is very well thought out.<p>Does the tesla know that I&#x27;ve changed heading and the sun is now providing some radiative heating and the thermostat can be turned down? Does it know that I got a chip off my windshield that affects the cameras, and I need to manually turn the windshield wipers (or brights, or etc) on and off every time a vehicle passes and sprays me? Maybe I just want a big ol&#x27; power&#x2F;volume knob to turn it off and on easily without looking - most cars have those on the steering wheel and I hate them.<p>(To be clear, I love Tesla and I truly hope they continue to succeed - but even more, I hope Toyota et al get it through their thick heads that BEVs are the future and gain ground in a hurry. Competition should make everyone better...)')
