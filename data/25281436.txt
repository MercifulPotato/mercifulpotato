I have been on the other side of the equation too, having to impliment and admin MDM, and every time it made me feel dirty knowing the power it really gave me over an employees personal phone. The worst part about it, especially the more I have adventured into SV land, is how often the culture pretends &quot;we dont do that sort of thing&quot; but being the kind of person who knows lots of lawyers, I read the legal docs and yep, sure enough, the handbooks and vast array of other docs all talk about it in the fine print. So there are employees that balk when I tell them why I don&#x27;t use company email on my personal phone... and I get a bit frustrated that these are the people who ought to understand this sort of thing!<p>I will always want separate phones for employers that want to use MDM on the device, or else I just won&#x27;t do any work on the phone... which unfortunately in some companies is looked down on. Glad I&#x27;m in a better environment these days (mdm exists on the sly, but I am not pressured to use email outside work hours) That said, this is also why I don&#x27;t want to shift into the management path either, because that changes once you are in mgmt.')
