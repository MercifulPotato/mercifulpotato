Software encoding is superior quality and latency to NVENC, and I&#x27;ve been using 8-thread encoding for Steam streaming since then (April &#x27;17) never to look back.<p>If you don&#x27;t have or want to use the CPU grunt for that, Intel Quick Sync isn&#x27;t bad and a good pair with a Radeon like the 6000 series. If you want hardware encoding, Intel CPU + AMD GPU is a great pair, as is AMD CPU + Nvidia GPU. Otherwise anything works well with sufficient core count, can go AMD&#x2F;Intel CPU + AMD GPU.')
