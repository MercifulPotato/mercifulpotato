A few options:<p>- Make a PR to a project that changes e.g. one of the dependencies to typosquatted alternatives. Disguise the commit message as something trivial. Post it to HN with a GH link to the upstream project&#x27;s repo at your commit.<p>- Make a PR to a project that adds malicious code, suggest a change to a distro package&#x27;s source repo to use your commit. Unless the maintainers know about this GitHub behavior, that&#x27;ll look much more trivial than it actually is.')
