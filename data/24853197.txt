A recent experiment in Australia went bad, this really saddened me because the underlying model clearly works (Iceland, NZ) but something about the combination of drill, frack, extract and process to energy just didn&#x27;t work out, nor did the post experiment remediation (IIRC)<p>I also believe, that we actually deplete both deep heat, and deep coolth. Deep heat, you have to keep expanding the deep heat extraction zone or create pumped states in a wider area somehow, Coolth: London underground was lovely and airconditioner cool, it now has 100+ years of soaked in heat and is significantly hotter than it used to be.')
