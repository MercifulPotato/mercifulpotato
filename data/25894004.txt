You call that “not being kind”. I call it “<i>You don&#x27;t own the English language any more than I do.</i>”<p>You may speak as you will, I do not deny that the current usage of the word “man” has acquired a secondary meaning of “adult male human” opposed to it&#x27;s historical meaning of “human&quot; and if you wish to use it as such, then I&#x27;m confident I can usually discriminate by context. I merely ask that I be allowed the same and speak as I will and use the word in it&#x27;s original meaning, that obviously still sees current use.')
