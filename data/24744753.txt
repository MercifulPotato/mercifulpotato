Item(by='tsimionescu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602410277, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24743672, text='&gt; What if we replace atoms with electromagnetic balls exhibiting similar bouncing properties, would it be good enough to count waves in this medium &quot;sound&quot;?<p>What do you mean by &quot;electromagnetic balls&quot;?<p>&gt; My point is that if we can substitute the medium carrying the waves, than we may as well remove the medium from the definition of sound.<p>Again, sound, simply by definition, is a compressive wave. Compressive waves can only happen in media that can be compressed, which rules out fundamental fields like the EM field or space-time. Atoms may not be entirely fundamental to sound, but matter is - you may be able to have sound waves in a neutron star for example.<p>I wonder if it&#x27;s possible to talk about sound waves inside the radius of a black hole - that I&#x27;m not sure about.')
