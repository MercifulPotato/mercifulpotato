People who don&#x27;t feel heard radicalize and do things like commit street violence or mass killings.<p>&gt;Like, I don&#x27;t see you moving to the ghetto and putting your kids in shitty schools so that you can even things out.<p>I don&#x27;t know about your schools, but around here the &quot;magnet&quot; schools with the high level law&#x2F;math&#x2F;science&#x2F;etc programs are ALL in the bad schools.
