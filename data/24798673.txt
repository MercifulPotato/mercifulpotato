Sure, there&#x27;s an underground where technology and media are passed around, but as far as I&#x27;m aware, there&#x27;s no signs of collapse.<p>I mean I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s particularly stable, in that if the great leader is deposed there will be a power vacuum. I was kinda expecting that when Kim Jong-il died though.')
