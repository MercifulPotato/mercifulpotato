Harvest Moon is a single player sim game. Farmville is an async multiplayer invest&#x2F;express. Zynga popularized the genre.<p>The closest &quot;rip off&quot; to Harvest Moon would be Stardew Valley, but no one ever refers to it that way because rip off is not a useful term for conveying taxonomy. Rip off is only useful for displaying derision towards genres the writer doesn&#x27;t enjoy.')
