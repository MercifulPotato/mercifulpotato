If people continue to &quot;wake up&quot; globally, becoming increasingly empowered by technology and democratizing philosophies, they will come to the logical conclusion that they can &quot;vote&quot; with their currency. Companies will definitely fucking pay attention if people stop buying their shit.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve taken the &quot;buy local as possible&quot; ethic to its logical extreme, realizing for example that I have to make compromises for things like consumer electronics. &quot;The real world&quot;, as you say. But I think it&#x27;s defeatist to just buy the cheapest junk you can afford in complete disregard of its means and origin of manufacture unless that&#x27;s the only solution.<p>Just today, I was shopping around where to buy Sid Meier&#x27;s Memoirs book since I just learned about it today on HN. I could elect the easy, lazy, one-world-ruled-by-Bezos path and click Amazon to save a few cents and get it delivered a day less, or I could go the slightly less convenient but more positive route of Indiebound.')
