What I&#x27;m trying to say is bad things <i>used</i> to happen, too, quite frequently and on very simple systems, and that his points about gradually diminishing robustness and productivity are easy to refute. I&#x27;m of the opinion that computers today - despite layers of abstraction and growing complexity - are more robust and lets us be more productive than ever.<p>Abstraction fosters ignorance and complexity is fragile, I agree with him on those points. But I also think he makes very sweeping, erroneous statements about software and development.')
