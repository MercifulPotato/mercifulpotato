If this is an internal API then it&#x27;s akin to the farming equipment that a tomato farmer might use to supply the chef with high quality tomatoes.<p>A farmer using high quality, efficient equipment will have an easier and more productive time farming tomatoes and therefore will have an easier time fulfilling the needs of chefs who want the tomatoes.<p>It&#x27;s still very much a user interface. The users are your developers. I think people are confusing graphical user interfaces with user interfaces. A keyboard&#x2F;mouse is a user interface into a PC.<p>If it&#x27;s a public API then the API is your product. And it&#x27;s very much a UI because that is the user interface, the users use your product in that way. That&#x27;s why companies like Stripe are so loved by developers, they have a good API.')
