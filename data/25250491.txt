You would not believe how many people, though they may be mentally ill, are smart, honest, good people, who just got <i>fucked</i> by the system. They&#x27;re out here scrounging for food and getting Hepatitis A and dying in the canyons and not getting any medical or dental care, and their lives are incredibly hopeless.<p>To take the Steven Pinker-ish approach, and talk about about how great everything is, comes off as ignorant&#x2F;dismissive of these real problems. I&#x27;m not saying what you&#x27;re saying <i>isn&#x27;t</i> true, but the average person is (relatively) not better off than 50 years ago.
