You can even give a filename to a tool that represents the <i>editor selection</i> in the file. Which was all awesome, and I have also thought of trying to figure out how to do it in newer MacOS or Linux.<p>I always figured this was inspired by Smalltalk, with its “DoIt” command, but never asked the MPW folks.')
