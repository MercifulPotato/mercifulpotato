Nobody who&#x27;s actually contributing content of any value is going to stick around somewhere they have to take shit from a bunch of internet riff-raff that isn&#x27;t contributing anything.<p>There&#x27;s calling out stuff that&#x27;s actually unlikely to last and there&#x27;s pandering to the safety crowd for virtue points and the publicly accessible internet is rife with the former while actual constructive criticism is proportionally rare.  For every comment to the tune of &quot;you should consider fastener X because your application is Y and that plays to X&#x27;s strength Z&quot; there are ten teenagers (or adults acting like teenagers) making some low effort jab about something in the building code, or some written list of best practices, they don&#x27;t understand the reasons behind.<p>It takes time and effort to build something.  It doesn&#x27;t take any time and effort to make some quip about PPE so that a bunch of teenagers can click on an up arrow and you can get your fix.  The people actually building things got sick of being used like that.')
