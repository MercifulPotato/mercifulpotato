Because I think implicit in your view is that you have a better usage for that ram.  If so, what?<p>Because I really struggle coming up with more than about 5 electron apps I might ever run at any given time (Slack, VSCode, Discord, maaaybe Etcher..., and I&#x27;m basically out of ideas).  Even then, two of those apps are both chat apps and I probably shouldn&#x27;t have Discord open for work, and I don&#x27;t use slack for any personal reason.<p>Basically - Electron apps are all applications that are UI heavy.  I don&#x27;t have the mental power to manage more than about 5 open and active UI apps before <i>I&#x27;m</i> the bottleneck, not the computer.<p>So at 5, you&#x27;re spending 15-18% of your RAM on 5, 5! apps that you want to be interacting with rich GUIs at any given time.  I just don&#x27;t see it.<p>At least for my use cases, electron apps almost always make up a trivial amount of my total ram usage.  Docker&#x2F;Development Env&#x2F;Vms DOMINATE in comparison.<p>So while I get that it could be faster, the reality of the situation is that without electron, none of the apps I listed would work on Linux at all.  Instead they all do by default.<p>So right now on amazon, 16gb of ram is 53 bucks for a decent module.  150&#x2F;16000 = .009.  So basically - I paid 49 cents, and got apps that work by default on my platform of choice.  That&#x27;s pretty fucking amazing compared to old platform specific apps.')
