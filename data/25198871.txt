Nowadays people can get that with WordPress and a $60 Themeforest template or something like Wix or Shopify. So you will have to compete with that (or layer value added serves on top). One interesting way I generated a lot of business back in the day was redesigning websites on spec. Basically I found businesses with websites that needed refreshing and I just redesigned them without asking. Then I emailed them a link to a fully functional version of the site. You can recycle the design for multiple prospects and just update the content. I stuck to single verticals like restaurants to make it easy. Here is an example of businesses I would target: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thechinagarden.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thechinagarden.com&#x2F;</a> or <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blujamcafe.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.blujamcafe.com&#x2F;</a> since they are in my neighborhood (I can work the &quot;we are both local small businesses&quot; angle and maybe get some free food out of the deal.')
