Long before the current &quot;user generated content&quot; fact-level problem, I remember (some) traditional internet forums offering the same problem as we have today - inane parroting of plausible sounding content, almost as mantras, to anyone who asked a question.<p>I learned from those days that you had to be careful as what you read on a forum was highly likely (at least in some circles where expertise is limited, the topic is complicated, and questions are plentiful) to be plain nonsense, or pseudo science.<p>On the other hand though, the increase in friction arguably reduces the scale of the problem you cite - making it financially based is far from ideal, but it at least reduced the breadth of the problem space to some extent.')
