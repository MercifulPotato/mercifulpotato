For context, I&#x27;ve been working with GraphQL since June 2015, so I&#x27;m pretty intimate with the topic.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that those slogans you quoted are from graphql.com rather than graphql.org. The latter is the official site, the former (.com) is owned by Apollo and isn&#x27;t official in any capacity -- something I personally find to be an extremely questionable situation.
