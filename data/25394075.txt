The web has indeed lost it&#x27;s charm when the results only show Facebook, Twitter and 10 or so other huge sites.<p>As for tagline, I&#x27;d suggest something along the lines of &quot;Rediscover the web and escape your filter bubble!&quot;.<p>Wish you all the best and happy coding!<p>P.S. I&#x27;d be very curious to get insight into if you have considered open sourcing the search engine? This would tie into transparency and trust, and would also enable contributions! I&#x27;d love to contribute to my day-to-day search engine, especially if it is privacy respecting!<p>Also, I second a subscription model for sustainability. I do not want to be the product.<p>Kind regards,\nRobin')
