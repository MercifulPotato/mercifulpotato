Even if a Justice were to feel like copywriting APIs would have terrible knock-on effects, she would be compelled to rule in favor of granting them if she believed that the laws passed by Congress required it.<p>So much of the arguments were specific to the Google&#x2F;Oracle incident and not as much about the implications except for the thing about QWERTY and perhaps some vague analogies. I thought at the SC level it should always consider &#x27;terrible knock-on effects&#x27; and act accordingly considering but not strictly bound to what came before.')
