Some days are ok, others are not; I suspect there are times she could express exactly what she wants or is wondering about but the words crash into each other like a train derailment.<p>I’ve got pages of ideas but little code so far because I keep getting overwhelmed about UI ideas. This is as big a challenge as you could hope for simplicity. The little code I do have is me playing with an endpoint that can do text to speech so I can relay arbitrary info to her via speech as needed (weather, memos, etc) but there’s a git repo and some notes if anyone wants to sign up to kick me in the ass every week or so.')
