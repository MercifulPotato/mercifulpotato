The API is buggy as hell and very limited (if at all available) and the review process is arbitrary and can cause updates to be rejected. You can never know if your workarounds will be accepted or rejected. Sometimes they can even get rejected in future app updates.<p>The EteSync experience is subpar on Apple devices, and there&#x27;s almost nothing we can do about it. We already spent countless of hours trying to fix things, but Apple just make it impossible. We have more ideas on how to fix things, and we will keep on trying, but it&#x27;s beyond me why would anyone willingly use an Apple product.<p>Edit (adding one more point): that&#x27;s one of the more annoying parts about Apple being the gatekeeper to 40% of the US population and in effect, to 100% of businesses (because one bad Apple in the org is enough to spoil the whole bunch). As a developer, you are just stuck with no way out.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etesync.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.etesync.com</a>')
