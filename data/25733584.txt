Once lets you visit each distracting website only once per hour.<p>The timer starts when you close the tab of one of these websites and only applies it to the homepages. It works with websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, 9gag, and many others.<p>It&#x27;s free and available on the Chrome Web Store.<p>Let me know what you think!<p>Thank you :)')
