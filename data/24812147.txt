Not to mention the emails and physical mail I get from them, which I don&#x27;t even consider until my mortgage agent confirms they&#x27;re legit.<p>Hilariously, the best online credit payment I&#x27;ve used has been Synchrony. I got their card when my wife had laser eye surgery because it came with a nice deal.  Then I got another card for a deal at the auto mechanic&#x27;s.  It was so simple to go to their website, log in, make payments or change autopay, see my balance, anything.  It took barely any time to tweak uMatrix so it worked.  And I&#x27;ve never been surprised by them.<p>I swear I&#x27;m not being paid for saying this.')
