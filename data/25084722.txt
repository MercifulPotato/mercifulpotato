Looking at it strictly from an age perspective you&#x27;re correct, but there are a lot of other factors that flip that around for us.<p>My wife has a pre-existing condition and we&#x27;ve been taking sheltering-in-place pretty seriously since the Bay Area shut down in mid-March. We&#x27;ve both been working from home and have only ventured out for walks, to sit in corners of parks away from everyone, or to go to a doctor. Groceries&#x2F;food get delivered (I haven&#x27;t even been into a grocery store since March, which feels weird) and we haven&#x27;t hung out with friends in person or anything like that.<p>On the flip side, both of my parents are going into work and my mother works at a nursing home (which - so far - has not had a single case of the virus), so they come into contact with far more people during the day than we do. In addition, we have an eight month old which makes us doing a day-long road trip without stopping at a hotel next to impossible.<p>So since our contact with others remains next to 0, and my parents are totally cool with using the extra PTO to quarantine, get tested, then quarantine a bit more before driving down, we feel comfortable with it. Obviously I&#x27;m not going to view it through rose-colored glasses and act as though there&#x27;s no risk, but there&#x27;s a much, much smaller risk through this route than if they were to hop on a plane and come straight over sans negative test.')
