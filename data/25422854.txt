An appliance can have a default mode where it only accepts firmware signed by the manufacturer. But then if a user wants to install their own key and load their own firmware (because the manufacturer has stopped supporting the device, has gone out of business, writes shitty firmware, or just to use hardware that they own in a different way), <i>most</i> devices should make this possible, and it would be interesting to think about what a legal requirement would look like here. A manufacturer could gate access via a configuration menu, or by cutting a trace&#x2F;jumper or with a write protect screw like on Chromebooks. And you could have entire classes of devices where open access is explicitly not allowed, like medical devices.<p>But smart speakers? Manufacturers should not be allowed to cryptographically guarantee that they become trash after two years.')
