You need some structure.<p>For <i>most</i> kids you probably need some structure. For some, unschooling certainly works well; for others it&#x27;s another term for &quot;school dropout&quot;. I personally was both homeschooled <i>and</i> unschooled, for different topics, and a high % of the smartest people I know were unschooled.<p>I really struggled to learn to read and write, even by grade five. So my parents took me out and my mom worked with me one-on-one intensively to learn phonics, which finally fixed that problem. Meanwhile, prior to that the biggest challenge I had in learning programming on my own is that I struggled to actually read the books I had on it. I think that unschooling taught me how to learn on my own, in a way that was very beneficial later in life.<p>Yet again, I&#x27;d say based on my experience taking relatively high-level, proof-based, math classes in university many years later, that <i>for me</i> the structured experience of university math worked much better than trying to learn those subjects on my own (which I had also tried!). Yet, for high school math, there hadn&#x27;t been much difference (I did attend highschool).<p>Learning isn&#x27;t one-size-fits-all.')
