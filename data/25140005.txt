There haven&#x27;t been &quot;master and slave&quot; IDE hard drives for about 15 years now. FWIW, I would give someone a funny look if they purposely used the word &quot;slave&quot; in their codebase or as part of technical jargon, but the word master isn&#x27;t automatically about slave ownership. That&#x27;s just incorrect.')
