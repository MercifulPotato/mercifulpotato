The best were altavista, and fast.<p>One thing that was noticeable back then was that bad search engines (and search engines that &#x27;jumped the shark&#x27; and became bad) generally did so in similar ways:<p>a) they included paid results, or devoted too much real-estate to advertising<p>b) when they failed to find results, they tried to trick the user by showing related results (eg: omitting or substituting terms)<p>c) they avoided &#x27;logical and&#x27; for search terms, in favor of &#x27;logical or&#x27;, making it difficult for users to search with precision.<p>The people at Google surely  believe their recent changes have nothing to do with all that. Far as I&#x27;m concerned, aside from the extra millions of dollars they&#x27;ve spent on AI research, it&#x27;s the same old story. Nobody needs a somewhat smarter version of AskJeeves.')
