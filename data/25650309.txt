It&#x27;s unfortunate that Apple is not embracing the webRequest API, since it&#x27;s so much more than a tool for content blocking. Requests are a core feature of any browser, and not allowing extensions to control and edit requests hinders innovation among browser extensions.<p>I&#x27;m porting some of my own extensions to Safari, and for example in Search by Image I had to make compromises because of the missing API. This issue coupled with the lack of support for the DataTransfer constructor has made porting the extension to Safari a considerable effort compared to Samsung Internet, which is an Android browser that supports both APIs.<p>The notifications API is also missing in Safari, so extensions must use the native messaging API to show notifications from the native app extension.')
