If market has formed, book more revenue in the future from selling into liquidity. If market hasn’t formed, hire some entertainers to babysit a chat room and move on.<p>Some parent companies are monetizing repeat issuances, those are worth investing into because all the shareholders make money. The companies dont need capital and would only offer shares to provide some exposure to the market. I’m not aware of any broadly offered dealflow of a token issuing factory, which is probably why people don&#x27;t understand or notice this business model.')
