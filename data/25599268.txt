Deflation inhibits economic activity because money saved is worth more tomorrow than today even when not invested in productive enterprise. Deflation enriches existing asset holders at the expense of new entrants, even if those asset holders are just stuffing their money in the proverbial mattress. Economists consider deflation a terrible outcome for an economy; Japan has experienced it for thirty years now.')
