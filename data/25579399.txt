It is hard to describe just how much <i>better</i> candy bars are in Canada.  Even bars that have the same <i>names</i> as their U.S. counterparts are clearly better made in Canada.<p>I think it’s probably the type of chocolate that is used; whatever “chocolate” is in the U.S., bars taste like 80% wax or something.  That just isn’t what chocolate is like elsewhere.<p>Also, the variety.  In the U.S., you go to a vending machine and you see like 5 slots that are just different kinds of M&amp;Ms, 3 kinds of Milky Ways, etc.  In Canada, there are so many options that vending machine slots are usually <i>entirely</i> different things and you have to go to a 7-Eleven or something to see the extra types of M&amp;Ms and stuff.')
