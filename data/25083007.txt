Most people don&#x27;t notice simply because most people learn and use a tiny subset what is there.  Beyond that, there is an entire industry to support Windows (which is part of the reason why people like it).  Apple isn&#x27;t much better.  They tend to paper things over by simply dropping support.  An example was brought up by another commenter when they mentioned that some <i>ix programs use raster fonts.  Strictly speaking that can happen under Linux yet not macOS since Apple dropped support for legacy software while some </i>ix software is decades old.  Linux will have its own issues, but I&#x27;m not the best judge of that since it is my operating system of choice.<p>At the end of the day, any operating system will be a compromise of some form or another.  Which you choose will depend upon what your wants and needs are.')
