But you need a kind of fancy interpolation, I forget the name, used for rational functions. Polynomials won&#x27;t do.<p>Edit: I think this is either Restrictive Pade&#x27;s approximation or barycentric rational interpolation. Or both combined.<p>Normally instead division is approximated with Newton-Raphson iteration. I think 6 steps is enough for 16 bit.')
