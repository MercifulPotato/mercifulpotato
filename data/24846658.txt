Item(by='zikzak', descendants=None, kids=[24847190], score=None, time=1603279105, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24846578, text='I have a screwed up neck. WHen I had surgery for a different part of my body I had to be awake while they &quot;put the tube in&quot;. You are on an operating table with an anesthetic in your throat, your arms are restrained, then these masked (which would seem more normal now, I guess) and gowned figures start forcing  tube down your throat while you try to &quot;swallow it&quot; and breath through your nose... there&#x27;s a point where you can&#x27;t breath. As soon as it is in place and you feel like you are going to suffocate they hit you with the general anesthetic and it&#x27;s light out. You wake up (no time has passed for you) and your throat is sore. I had nightmares about it for months after (initially, whenever I closed my eyes). The drugs they give you in the hospital help somewhat but once home, look out. I can&#x27;t imagine what it would be like to wake up in an ICU with that tube still in. I know eventually I will need another operation and I sometimes realize this will all happen again. I am trying to learn to live with this and realizing without the operations I will die, etc. Also, that so many people are dealing with so many worse things.')
