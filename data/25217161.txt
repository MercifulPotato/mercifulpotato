The crowing makes me happy. But our polish started mounting the most developed hens at 19 weeks, and the other two (silkies, believe it or not) wanted in on the action less than a month later. Too many roosters for the number of hens, and the girls were getting frazzled.<p>The thing I&#x27;m hoping for out of this &quot;no kill&quot; technology is the ability to buy sexed fertile eggs at the ag store. I don&#x27;t have a problem culling roosters from unsexed breeds, but it would be nice to bypass raising them from chicks and guessing which ones will turn out to be keepers.')
