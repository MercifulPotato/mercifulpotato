I&#x27;m sure foreign governments will have their own opinions.<p>You&#x27;re right, you can be HIPAA compliant and not be E2E encrypted - if you have the right paperwork and auditing process. Zoom didn&#x27;t because they claimed to be E2E encrypted.<p>There are some things you can lie about and it&#x27;s crappy but not a big deal. &quot;Lag free video streaming!&quot; - Sure, whatever. &quot;The best quality!&quot; Again, don&#x27;t care. When it comes to information security claims though, lying has very serious penalties because the damage you cause is extremely serious. This wasn&#x27;t them telling a white lie about how awesome they are, this is them intentionally and knowingly engaging in fraudulant behavior to make profit at the expense and security of users - and we should absolutely punish the hell out of people who do that to line their own pockets with a few extra dollars.')
