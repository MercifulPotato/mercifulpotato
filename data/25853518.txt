Item(by='sampo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611186975, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25853410, text='&gt; Why does this situation invite pejorative terms and scorn from people who have no skin in the game?<p>Cities have been growing for hundreds of years. People want to move to cities for better economic opportunities. They very much have a skin in the game. Blocking the growth of the economically most important cities hurts the economy of the whole state&#x2F;country, so in this way every citizen who wants economic growth has a skin in the game. Cities are not independent city states, but they should serve what&#x27;s best for the whole country. In case of globally important economic hubs, even foreigners want to move to those cities for better opportunities, so even people outside of the country have a skin in the game.<p>Also, in a growing city, majority of people are first or second generation immigrants to the city themselves. They or their parents had the opportunity to move to the city, but now they want to prevent others having the same opportunity they themselves have enjoyed.')
