Item(by='studius', descendants=None, kids=[25821935], score=None, time=1610977227, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25818412, text='Touting as 100 LOC using only stdlib:<p>* may show that Ruby can do a lot on its own.<p>* may show that a developer doesn&#x27;t have to depend on another gem just to get the job done.<p>The Ruby stdlib is powerful, and depending on another gem could bite you if it were to become unmaintained at some point.<p>However, low LOC and use of stdlib isn&#x27;t always the goal for development in-general.<p>I want to develop solutions quickly that work well and are easy to maintain. If it&#x27;s easy to learn also, even better.<p>In terms of the size of the code, even in text form, there&#x27;s a lot I could do. I could reduce lines by replacing EOL with semicolon. I could remove unnecessary spaces. I could use shortest variable names. I could store a compressed version of the code in the file and then do eval of the decompressed version. Those don&#x27;t make it a better solution, unless the goal is to obfuscate and&#x2F;or minify it.<p>I know that&#x27;s not the point, though, and I&#x27;m mentioning it only so that people will think about LOC as what it is- just a metric.')
