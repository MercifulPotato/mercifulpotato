For example, if you want &quot;kitchen knife&quot; that&#x27;s a no go. if you want &quot;robert welch kitchen knife&quot; there&#x27;s a chance that it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon, but not by much, if at all. In other words, as a search platform to find items it doesn&#x27;t work anymore, as a place to buy, sometimes. That&#x27;s just my experience lately.')
