Since the pandemic started, hospitals added more capacity. This additional capacity, together with cancellation of procedures that can&#x27;t be postponed, allowed to still have some capacity left. However the standard of care is expected to be lower.\nAdditionally, it is sometimes necessary to move patients to a different hospital, so they are asking for understanding.<p>Last, there is some weird language towards the end, asking at-risk people to clarify whether they &quot;don&#x27;t need life-extending care&quot;. I assume they want to know whom they should ignore?')
