Item(by='CapricornNoble', descendants=None, kids=[25189533], score=None, time=1606153195, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25188759, text='&gt;&gt;&gt;What the Germans and Japanese did was of a scale and brutality that had not been inflicted in &#x27;civilized&#x27; warfare for centuries.<p>Doesn&#x27;t that boil down to skewed perceptions re: the nature of war as much as anything? That&#x27;s a question for HN writ large, not you specifically, as I think you capture understanding of that with your quotation marks. WW2&#x27;s death toll was in the same order of magnitude as WW1&#x27;s, which should have already shattered misconceptions of clean wars. However, I think WW1 had a higher ratio of combatant casualties vis-a-vis noncombatants. WW2 being a &quot;regression to the mean&quot; so to speak with regards to brutalizing civilians, combined with the growth of media dissemination, may be why it&#x27;s made such a socio-psychological mark.<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;And neo-nazis are a thing now, and they&#x27;re not nice.<p>Communists are a thing, and they&#x27;re not nice. There&#x27;s a lot of reasons we never had mass-market video games singing the praises of Konstantin Rokossovsky (the only Soviet war hero I can think of as photogenic as Rommel), and the virtuousness of the ideology and&#x2F;or its adherents isn&#x27;t the deciding factor IMO. We also don&#x27;t spend anywhere near as much time and energy, as a society, highlighting the sole modern ideology with the dubious distinction of a larger 8-figure excess death count than national socialism&#x2F;fascism. But I digress...<p>Agreed that the time scale of Romans vs Germans is an issue. I don&#x27;t know how we can consistently get people to &quot;zoom out&quot; and look at things with a larger, multi-generational timescale in mind and see that the things they are taking exception to are closer to &quot;business as usual&quot; than they realize.')
