The reason for murdering Gogh was to oppose the controversial film which criticised Islam: “Submission”. Bouyeri shot and stabbed van Gogh, then cut his throat. Finally the killer attached a 5 letter page to van Gogh&#x27;s chest with a knife.“<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;2&#x2F;hi&#x2F;europe&#x2F;4716909.stm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;2&#x2F;hi&#x2F;europe&#x2F;4716909.stm</a><p>“Bouyeri had told the court he had acted out of religious conviction.
