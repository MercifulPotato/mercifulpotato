Would you mind expanding on that a little?<p>I.e., suppose that 3 of the questions were meant to test some theory that the researchers have, and the 21 other questions were thrown in for the reasons stated above.<p>Now suppose that the answers to the 3 seriously-chosen questions weren&#x27;t predictive of long life, but 5 of the <i>other</i> 21 questions <i>were</i> predictive of long life.<p>It sounds like you&#x27;re saying that somehow that 5-question correlation is bogus, but the 3-intentional-question correlation would be legitimate. But the only difference I see between the two groups is subjective: <i>whether or not the researchers anticipated the questions being meaningful</i>. I don&#x27;t see how&#x2F;why that would be relevant to making inferences about the wider population.')
