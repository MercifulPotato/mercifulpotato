Item(by='christefano', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602782072, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24772155, text='&gt; Touch ID (combined with a home button) is a lot faster. You can reach into your pocket or handbag, put the finger on the button and press it while you&#x27;re taking it out. By the time your phone is out it&#x27;s unlocked and on the home screen. I don&#x27;t recall seeing people failing to unlock their phones while paying with Apple Pay before but now it&#x27;s a reasonably common occurrence if they didn&#x27;t &quot;prime&quot; it ahead of time.<p>I was excited when I discovered this, but I now consider this “feature” to be a security issue. I used to “prime” my Touch ID-equipped iPhones until I accidental authorized an in-app purchase because my thumb was pre-placed on the sensor.<p>Never again.<p>I had modified the Accessibility settings so that resting a finger on the sensor would unlock the device, and when reverting that setting I still ran into the same issue.')
