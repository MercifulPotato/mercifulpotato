I made a full switch to Linux from Windows in no small part because of issues just like this, I got tired of OneNote completely breaking on my Surface. Even on much more polished operating systems -- Mac&#x27;s window snapping is still inexplicably awful for, as far as I can tell, no reason at all except that Apple refuses to copy the simple model that both Windows and Gnome adopted. We tolerate it. I purchased a 3rd-party program to replicate the functionality, and it sometimes works.<p>A more drastic example, my proprietary router won&#x27;t let me set a custom DNS server at the router level. It has an option to do so, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything, and this is an open bug that people complained about for years that was just... ignored. And eventually they pushed a fix for it that <i>broke everyone&#x27;s routers</i> and required manual rollback.<p>If something isn&#x27;t a showstopper, sometimes it just gets ignored in general. Has nothing to do with whether or not it&#x27;s free software, and everything to do with whether or not somebody somewhere cares enough to fix it.')
