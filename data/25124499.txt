Same as how your trusted root CA certificates don&#x27;t come from a network policy for example. I don&#x27;t think we should be making a convention of inspecting users&#x27; private traffic, regardless of whether it is by default or by opt-in, under the guise of protecting them from malware.<p>DNS has historically been set by network policy so that it&#x27;s easy for network operators to map hostnames to their local network resources.
