The west is weird, the more privileged people get the more &quot;problems&quot; they have. I wish there was more understanding about this, like when people start making up new things they are suffering there should be a serious way to address it as a first world problem that can safely be ignored. But then of course you get &quot;in trouble&quot; for not being sensitive enough.<p>When my wife and I started to have enough money, free time, a big house, THAT is when she started complaining about her &quot;needs&quot; not being met. When we were both broke college students she couldn&#x27;t have been happier.')
