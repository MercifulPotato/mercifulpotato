Its their right to free speech and the US constitution guarantees it.&quot;<p>This isn&#x27;t right.<p>1) This is not about people disputing the election results. That happens in plain day on new News and other places and it&#x27;s uncensored. The current concern is about inciting violence, talking about kidnapping people on capitol hill etc..<p>2) There is really no &#x27;1st Amendment&#x27; argument on any of these platforms, it literally doesn&#x27;t apply. You don&#x27;t have any right whatsoever to say anything via Apple&#x27;s App Store, or on Parler. It&#x27;s entirely up to them and the 1st Amendment has nothing to do with it. Those platforms deal in content, so they can do as they please - for better or for worse.<p>&quot;The whole reason you had a bunch of desperate crazies storming congress is an extreme effort to silence speech&quot;<p>Again - this is completely upside down.<p>The President using the legitimate authority of his office to spread outright lies in the face of all evidence is what is &#x27;causing the problem&#x27;.<p>The fact we have 1000 different ways to communicate with each other and amplify misinformation is enabling much of this to take place in the commons - not the other way around.<p>It&#x27;s completely disingenuous to suggest that the &#x27;lack of information on Facebook and Twitter&#x27; is somehow &#x27;the problem&#x27; when it&#x27;s Trump&#x27;s usage of said platforms to spread absolutely false information that is driving people to anger.<p>FYI - you can say anything you want about &#x27;election fraud&#x27; on Twitter, FB, in the news, on so many platforms and nobody will bother with you.<p>We need integrity in all of our systems.<p>That said it&#x27;d be better if large corporations were not having to wade in with policy.')
