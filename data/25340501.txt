By all accounts Timnit was an extremely toxic person to work with. Sure, perhaps she shouldn&#x27;t have been fired for this paper, Google probably saw an opportunity to remove her that wouldn&#x27;t be a PR nightmare for them. But regardless, it&#x27;s hard for me personally to see them as being in the wrong given Timnit&#x27;s history.')
