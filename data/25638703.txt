It&#x27;s an appeal to authority, sure, but sometimes, you need the right person to tell you the truth. It was at the price they bought and it very well may be today.<p>- The current narrative is it&#x27;s digital gold (but easier to transfer, verify, hide, no inflation, etc). It&#x27;s very easy to fall for arguments that it&#x27;s useless because it&#x27;s hard to transact, too public, that it&#x27;s going to get replaced by something better, but as of today, there is product-market fit, regardless of whether it only works for the rich.<p>- This fall saw a lot of financial adoption, Druckenmiller, Guggenheim, Mass Mutual, off the top of my head. In May, it was Paul Tudor Jones. Everytime these people come, they bring hundreds of millions. These sometimes start with financial disclosures that prevent them from buying before announcing it. Microstrategy publicly asked the bond market $400M to buy BTC, got $650M within a week when price was $18k but got to buy at $23k IIRC. This frontrunning is a recipe to pump the price.<p>- There are 19M BTC in circulation, the next 2M are already somewhat owned by mining companies and their investors, past buyers were either flushed out by past crashes or are battle-hardened and convinced it can go a lot higher.<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say is that Bitcoin could go to $100k with today&#x27;s fundamentals alone. I missed out much of it because of endless ideological, semantic and technological debates, but financially, it&#x27;s makes complete sense and honestly I&#x27;m also in it for the money.<p>This is not financial advice but I feel compeled to end with a few disclaimers: Bitcoin is here to fight inflation, but if deflation occurs, it could hurt; Tether may collapse (this is a shady company selling blockchain dollars which may or may not hold billions of dollars worth of BTC on one side and $20B of liabilities on the other side); investing too much may cloud one&#x27;s judgement, the market is out to get your money.')
