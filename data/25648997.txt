You don&#x27;t have to write on FB. You don&#x27;t have to write on Twitter (and please don&#x27;t try to actually <i>write</i> on Twitter). Dozens of companies will offer you essentially one-click wordpress installations for you, with 10 more clicks to customize it to match your aesthetic inclinations. Write your stuff there .... oh wait, just like Stratechery does.<p>Nobody is coming for your blog. And, in the foreseeable future, nobody will come for your blog. You can write whatever you want. Getting people to read it might be <i>slightly</i> harder than if you use some corporatist social media platform, but arguing along those lines merely cements those platforms in their pseudo-monopolist places, which is hardly desirable for all manner of reasons.<p>Is it a good thing that FB&#x2F;Twitter et al. can make wrong-headed decisions about the content they allow on their platforms? It&#x27;s not great. But compared to the information overload issues mentioned here by other commenters, it&#x27;s not obviously bad either. And it does <i>nothing</i> to reduce your freedom of speech.<p>Ben Thompson could post articles on Stratechery that make non-libellous false claims about anything he wants, and nobody will stop him. He could this every day for the rest of his life and nobody will stop him. He doesn&#x27;t like the monopolistic aspects of current social media giants, but continues to insist that they are so important that any &quot;censorship&quot; on these platforms is a significant social issue. I find this contradictory, and naive, and in almost every sense, simply wrong.')
