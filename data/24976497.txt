You cannot condense both your expectation value and uncertainty in a single percentage (it is not correct to say that the probability of an outcome is 50% if 80% of likely outcomes result in one candidate winning). Otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with every 5-week weather forecast saying there&#x27;s a 50% chance of rain.')
