It compiles in the blink of an eye, has one of the best possible 2 way GUI builders in the open source world, and I can reach back 30 years into the libraries I wrote in the days of Turbo Pascal 7&#x2F;MS-DOS and pretty much use them intact.<p>It amazes me how many people went with the .NET bloatware and all that follows it.
