One of the (implicit?) rules here is no tl;dr. The idea is that the site will get a better technical discussion if everyone reads the complete article before commenting. (Strangely, another rule is that you can&#x27;t write RTFA.)<p>Nobody is sure which are the best rules to get a nice discussion, but this are the rules here. Other communities like tl;dr.<p>There are some exceptions, like very very long articles or very very technical articles. Also, sometimes the tl;dr are ignored, nobody is so angry to downvote a tl;dr until it has -100 points. So assume that if you write or ask for a tl;dr, there is a high chance that it will be downvoted.')
