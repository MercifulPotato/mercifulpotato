Trump pulled out of the Paris climate accord which, if you peruse the Constitution [1], you might notice Obama entered the U.S. into seemingly illegally, without consent of Congress in the first place [2]. How did that happen? The Kyoto agreement was also never submitted to Congress for ratification [3]. And let me show my cards and say <i>thank God</i> we never ratified these documents, as that would be tantamount to allowing a world government control over our economy. Treaties you see are the supreme law of the land around here [4].<p>I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;d consider Trump&#x27;s action on this particular treaty to be part of the shit he &quot;got away with&quot; but I find it to be a fitting example of something your average Republican president would probably just go along with, knowing it&#x27;s a toothless treaty that would never be ratified. But Trump, for political or whatever reasons, felt like reversing Obama&#x27;s policy in the same way he implemented it. And Congress having no part in the whole affair.<p>In fact the vast majority of what Trump did was in the form of executive order, most of which had very little impact on state&#x27;s or individual rights.<p>So yeah what are these things that Trump did that Congress was either remiss or enabling him to do? If it&#x27;s stuff related to the border, immigration policy, foreign policy, or the like, that&#x27;s mostly outside Congress&#x27;s purview, except the aforementioned treaty power.<p>Just trying to figure out what&#x27;s the ethically sketchy stuff that should have been checked by Congress or perhaps the courts. That way we can narrow down a set of principles that could possibly apply to Biden (assuming he&#x27;s elected).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;constitution-conan&#x2F;article-2&#x2F;section-2&#x2F;clause-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;constitution-conan&#x2F;article-2&#x2F;sec...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;volokh-conspiracy&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2017&#x2F;06&#x2F;01&#x2F;the-u-s-cant-quit-the-paris-climate-agreement-because-it-never-actually-joined&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;volokh-conspiracy&#x2F;wp&#x2F;201...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kyoto_Protocol#Non-ratification_by_the_US" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kyoto_Protocol#Non-ratificatio...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;constitution.congress.gov&#x2F;browse&#x2F;article-6&#x2F;clause-2&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;constitution.congress.gov&#x2F;browse&#x2F;article-6&#x2F;clause-2&#x2F;</a>')
