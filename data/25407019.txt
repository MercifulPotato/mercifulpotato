There clearly only needs to be one way to identify things, so commonly larger systems just incorporate the smaller ones wholesale. The 13-digit system just incorporates the prior 10-digit system for International Standard Book Numbers with a 978 prefix called &quot;bookland&quot; (most prefixes in this system are geographic, but of course books aren&#x27;t really from one single geographic region, so they&#x27;re from &quot;bookland&quot;) and adds a new set of possible codes. It also incorporates the entire 12-digit American &quot;UPC&quot; system.<p>Several other (less well known) systems were gobbled up the same way as &quot;bookland&quot;, just allocating them imaginary geographic regions in the 13-digit system.<p>There&#x27;s actually a fourteen digit system, but the lead digit tells you about how many of something are bundled e.g. so a distributor can distinguish a truck full of Pepsi cans from just one case or a single can in terms of things you can order. Lead digit 0 means &quot;single&quot; so if you know the 10 digit ISBN you can not only make a 13-digit EAN for that, you can make the 14-digit GTIN that means &quot;just one of this book&quot; which in most cases would be what you want.')
