Nobody bats an eye when they&#x27;re the ones profiting off of it.<p>&quot;You say you&#x27;re in favor of free speech, yet when I run into your house screaming obscenities you try to kick me out. Interesting.&quot;<p>HN isn&#x27;t the only discussion site. Reddit isn&#x27;t the only discussion site. The big social media companies don&#x27;t own the Internet, and iHeartMedia doesn&#x27;t own radio. It&#x27;s vital we have alternatives, and laws to ensure those alternatives exist can be discussed, but saying that people don&#x27;t really value free speech when they prefer moderated discussion spaces doesn&#x27;t track. It&#x27;s trying to equate unlike things, and create a contradiction where there is none.')
