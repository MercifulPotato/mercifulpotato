It&#x27;s not even about opinions. It&#x27;s about combating weaponized misinformation.<p>It&#x27;s strange for Americans to be on the business side of a propaganda weapon, as we&#x27;re more used to using against our enemies. Technology has finally made it feasible for malicious actors to cheaply and effectively manipulate people with lies, here in the US.<p>If you don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s a weapon, you&#x27;re wrong. If you don&#x27;t believe weaponized misinformation is dangerous, look at the regimes it&#x27;s toppled. And if you think the &quot;American spirit,&quot; or somesuch nonsense, makes us immune, I hope we won&#x27;t have to find out.')
