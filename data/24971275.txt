Viewing a paper as a whole I tend to think that the abstract and intro more or less map to (1) and (2) from your quotation.<p>Abstract: Briefly describe why the audience cares, what you did, and what the results were so that they know whether they should read more or move on to something else.<p>Intro: Same as abstract but in more depth and with an emphasis on helping the reader decide if the meat of the paper is worthwhile for them.<p>Nearly every other section: Specifics vary by field, but there will generally be an argument from foundations as you describe, and elements which don&#x27;t fit naturally in the flow of that argument are given their own headers (certain experimental details, foundational algorithmic appendices, ...)')
