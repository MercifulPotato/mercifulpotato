Even community colleges have these things. Though, like Lambda School, they can be of questionable quality.<p>Additionally, Lambda School is specifically to focus on getting a job. Getting a job can be one outcome of college, but it&#x27;s not necessarily the specific focus. For that, a comparison to a trade school might be more on point, where the specific focus is to learn a trade and then get people a job in that trade afterwards. Perhaps a more apt comparison would be Lambda School to Barbers College.')
