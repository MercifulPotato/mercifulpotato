We use machine learning to automatically optimize each buyer’s path to drive more web conversions.<p>Our unique solution enables experimentation and personalization at an unparalleled scale, and it replaces traditional approaches to optimization such as A&#x2F;B testing and rules-based personalization. These methods are too slow, require daily attention, and don’t automatically adapt to changes in behavior over time.<p>This role: senior level, back-end and some ML engineering. The exact blend is flexible, and we&#x27;d be happy to have a great back-end engineer join us even without any ML background.<p>Primary technologies: Java, Python, Tensorflow, Spark, Airflow, AWS.<p>Our team is positive, low ego, and customer focused. Strong communication skills are a must.<p>We plan to re-open our San Mateo office once it is safe to do so, and the company will continue embrace remote work (it&#x27;s going great for us!). This team in particular is remote-first.<p>You can apply via email to careers@, or to alex@ if you want to contact me directly. I&#x27;m the hiring manager for this position.')
