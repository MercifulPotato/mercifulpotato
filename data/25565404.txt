What if you launched a company or conjured up a community that could give birth to two helpful features per year, wouldn&#x27;t that company or community catch up and eventually surpass them in functionality?<p>This company wouldn&#x27;t have to come up with a new paradigm for information access. Instead, they would have to come up with a way to launch helpful search features that wasn&#x27;t dependent on PII. To me that doesn&#x27;t sound as scary as having to come up with a new paradigm for information retrieval. To me it sounds fully doable.')
