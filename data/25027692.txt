Not to get political but it also felt as though that separation was along the blue &#x2F; red divide. Back in the day when I would watch jeopardy at 7, I always had this compulsion to change the channel before wheel started. Again no evidence, just a feeling. I don’t know why, Pat and Vanna seem like nice people, I just can’t stand wheel, maybe because I suck at wheel whereas I could hold my own when watching Jeopardy. RIP Alex.')
