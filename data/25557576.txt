And when the timing chains goes, that wipes out the engine — to the tune of $10k or more.<p>So, whatever value you think your Nissan vehicle has, subtract at least $10k from that, due to the fact that you’re driving a rolling time bomb. It’s going to blow up on you, it’s just a matter of when and where.<p>Ask me and my former Nissan Juke how we found out this lesson, the hard way.')
