IRC helped a lot to find clients, and sometimes I fix local people&#x27;s computer after they realized I am a software engineer[1]. The latter is rare though. Regardless, I have ups and downs still due to expenses but hoping to change that and become financially stable, it is about time, I think. :) COVID-19 is really making it much more difficult though. Not infeasible, but extremely difficult to attain what I want[2] thanks to it. :(<p>[1] This helps me build connections as well. For example, I fixed a doctor&#x27;s laptop, and she has helped me with various things because of it.<p>[2] I want to move to another nearby country. Cheaper and nicer apartments, and the pay is the same because I work remotely.')
