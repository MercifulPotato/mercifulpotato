This is why you should generally be skeptical of media narrative of crisis. yes, in 2007-2008 the media was wright about a housing crisis, but they tend ot get it wrong more often than not. Even when there is crisis ,it tends to be short lived and many underestimate the v-shaped nature of recoveries. If you sell your stocks, waiting a few months may mean having to buy back at a higher price even if the crisis has not subsided. Covid is gonna be with us for years and many jobs and businesses will never returns, yet the market made new highs by July 2020.')
