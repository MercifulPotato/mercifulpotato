We&#x27;ve already reached a point of massively diminishing returns on fuel efficiency with commercial airliners. Boeing spent billions of dollars and a decade designing the 787 to achieve a fuel efficiency gain of &lt;10% over the 30 year old 777 [0]. The reality is that airliners are just extremely carbon intensive by their nature. And there is almost zero possibility that jet fuel will be replaced by battery or fuel cell technology for a long long time to come.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theicct.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;publications&#x2F;Transatlantic_Fuel_Efficiency_Ranking_20180912.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theicct.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;publications&#x2F;Transat...</a>')
