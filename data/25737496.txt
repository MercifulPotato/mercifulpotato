Item(by='ChrisLomont', descendants=None, kids=[25740359], score=None, time=1610400759, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25734671, text='&gt;With no court hearing the evidence,<p>60+ courts heard the &quot;evidence,&quot; which was in each case lacking, or in more cases, no evidence was given because the actual court cases were not about what Trump and co were claiming in the news.<p>&gt;I remember seeing a Reuters poll saying that 40% of the voting population thought the election was rigged<p>You must be confused; Reuters ran this poll [1], where nearly 80% of Americans say Biden won the White House, incuding more than half of Republicans.<p>You must be thinking of the 40% of Republican voters (about 20% of voters, hence the 80% above) who thought the election was rigged, after hearing Trump claim this for months before and after the election, in every forum he could, and the right wing media fed those voters a months long diet of such nonsense. Of course those voters would believe that.<p>&gt;I think the votes need to be checked, just in case the election was rigged.<p>They have been, they will be inspected even more, and they will find the same results. Who voted is public record in nearly every state, and those where it&#x27;s not public make records available to researchers. The way to show fraud is statistical sampling, which Trump and co did, and found nothing, hence the ignorance feeding smoke and mirrors game.<p>How do you know Trump and co looked at voter records? Because right after the election they started floating a handful of names of specific fraud, in each case they were shown wrong by the press that found why Trump and co though there was a discrepancy.<p>And out of all that, Trump and co had only a handful of names. There is no doubt they&#x27;d feed all that to computers to help them scour millions of votes.<p>And, as in every election, election researchers will look through records, will do random polls of voters, and can gather statistical evidence for lack of fraud.<p>Now, instead of pushing all the &quot;we don&#x27;t know!&quot; narratives, spend your effort educating people that we do know, and this is the process by which we can, and do, check the details.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-election-poll&#x2F;nearly-80-of-americans-say-biden-won-white-house-ignoring-trumps-refusal-to-concede-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKBN27Q3ED" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-usa-election-poll&#x2F;nearly-...</a>')
