Both gold and bitcoin are ultimately just fungible representations of wasted energy. The question is whether bitcoin can rise to the level of thousands of years of tradition with gold, or if we&#x27;ll have forgotten about it in a few decades. I&#x27;m guessing the latter because without the key property of <i>untraceability</i>, bitcoin isn&#x27;t actually fungible.')
