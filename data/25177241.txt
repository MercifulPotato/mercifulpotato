One for my employer, and one sent by the company I am contracted to work for.<p>Contract-mac is hugely locked down, requires all traffic to go through the VPN, and only allows non-VPN connections to the VPN.<p>Work-mac is fairly ordinary, not locked down except for anti-virus.<p>To get Magnet and a couple of other Apple store apps on the contract-mac, I signed in to the Apple store. Immediately, copy and paste started working across both macs. I&#x27;m not sure of the mechanism by which the clipboard was being &quot;shared&quot;, but it felt like I&#x27;d get chewed out by contract-mac&#x27;s security folks if I continued using it.<p>It&#x27;s convenient, for sure, but could very easily be against security policy in larger enterprises.')
