Typically served round; thicker, more sour crust; a very generous cheddar&#x2F;jack&#x2F;mozzarella blend; and modest amounts of sauce, compared to Chicago-style anyway.  The crust is often dusted with cornmeal.  Round Table (founded in Menlo Park!) epitomized this pizza, though I haven’t eaten there in years so I can’t say if they’ve kept any semblance of quality.<p>You’ll find it throughout the Southwest at many smaller chains.  Dion’s is one regional I can vouch for. Two Boots in New York is probably the closest I ever found on the East Coast, but I didn’t look hard outside of the City.<p>It’s distinct to me from New York style because of the amount of cheese and the rise of the crust. The more topping-laden variants (“combo”) can require a knife and fork to eat, whereas a classic New York slice is designed to be eaten standing up and toppings are portioned accordingly.')
