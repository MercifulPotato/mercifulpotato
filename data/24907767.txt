That mental model of self-sacrifice made me unable to breakup with my (now) wife after some major red flags.<p>If you want to re-connect with your wife, absolutely tell her that and acknowledge to yourself and her that you do have emotional&#x2F;romantic needs, and that your child absolutely is a reason in your willingness to give your relationship another go, but you will not be forever happy or stay in this arrangement.')
