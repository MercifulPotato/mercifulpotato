ATLA (Avatar: the last airbender) is a great example for something that needs a contract for multiple seasons from the start: they knew they&#x27;ll have 3 seasons, and that was one big arc and storyline. Same for Trollhunters; it was unfortunate to only have 1 season for the third installation, Wizards: it was way to fast.<p>Other series, however... are dead slow. It was delightful to recently watch a 1998 film, `Ronin`: 2 hours, and more story happened, than in 2 seasons of most series.<p>There is no simple answer to this.')
