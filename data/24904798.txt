(<i>I</i> think the characters draw the wrong conclusion about which part of its eccentric orbit was the interesting one and we&#x27;re meant to read it as horribly ironic that they&#x27;re planning on going entirely the wrong way. But someone else concluded from <i>Fire</i> that the galactic core also had interesting activity.)')
