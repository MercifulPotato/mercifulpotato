To those reading this, the US absolutely considers blocking Iranian IPs a required action under the sanctions. The person posting this could get you in serious legal trouble.<p>With that said, most companies do not start blocking these IPs until they are either contacted by US authorities and asked to comply or via the recommendations of an audit by an outside private company.<p>Please do not trust what this person is saying. Remember, violating sanctions can get you a prison sentence, not just a fine.')
