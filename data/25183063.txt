They&#x27;re as emotional and biased as the rest of us mortals, proof of that for example is characterizing the comment as irrational just because it doesn&#x27;t &quot;feel&quot; rational to you, other comments talking about feminist re-educations camps or how climate change isn&#x27;t that big of a deal.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to be antagonistic but one should be careful of thinking that they are inherently a more rational person.')
