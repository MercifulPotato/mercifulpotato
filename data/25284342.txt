It&#x27;s contradictory and self-defeating to encourage developers to adopt Urbit while simultaneously  purposely designing it just so developers won&#x27;t adopt it. Urbit makes many weird and contrarian design choices without explanation. It&#x27;s fine to explore ideas and try different different methodologies but you should at least be able to explain why you&#x27;re choosing to do it and how it would be beneficial. Here&#x27;s a good example from the documentation:<p><i>A loobean is a Nock boolean - Nock, for mysterious reasons, uses 0 as true (always say &quot;yes&quot;) and 1 as false (always say &quot;no&quot;).</i><p>So they create an alternative to booleans that&#x27;s just a backwards boolean? And their explanation for this? &#x27;mysterious reasons&#x27; What?!? The only thing mysterious here is why any developer would use this.')
