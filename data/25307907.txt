Those little kids you observed were not the next Messi, they were just a little better than average. I can see how playing with older siblings makes an ok athlete slightly better, but I think this advantage washes out by the time you get to the top level of a sport, and you&#x27;ve reached your genetic ceiling.<p>As long as we&#x27;re throwing around anecdata, Vincenzo Nibali and Peter Sagan are both far, far better cyclists than their younger brothers.')
