They&#x27;ve mostly given up on the idea of a clever person finding a new money-hose. They just focus on the one they have now.</i><p>Isn&#x27;t that how they&#x27;ve always operated? Gmail was launched in 2004 and that sure wasn&#x27;t a money-hose. But it did serve as yet another platform to support their money-hose since they could scan your emails and serve you ads.<p>It&#x27;s really only a recent change to actually monetise Gmail beyond ads. They sell it as part of G Suite and as part of Google One. Not sure if Google One brings in the dough but surely G Suite makes enough to justify its existence.')
