If you spend enough  on a circular saw, they still make them in Japan. They also make a 6&quot; and 12&quot;(!) handheld power planer (not the stationary &quot;lunchbox&quot; style) that are AIUI made in Japan. That 12&quot; planer goes for a couple grand US. That&#x27;s the KP312 if you&#x27;re curious.<p>Japan, incidentally, has a long timber framing tradition that&#x27;s still relatively common in modern construction. This is part of the reason you&#x27;ll see Makita and Hitachi tools in your US timberframer&#x27;s kit; they still make the tools in Japan for the active local market.')
