And we can agree to disagree on this one, but I am a big fan of urban areas not having mandatory minimum parking. Space spent on cars means space <i>not</i> spent on housing, which most urban areas need much more.<p>&gt; This is a solved problem in private residential apartments and office buildings.<p>It&#x27;s not a solved problem - offices do not have enough parking for everyone to drive in, and most residential towers spend a huge amount of space housing cars rather than people.<p>&gt; pollution is always produced. Do you think trains and busses do not produce large amount of pollution?<p>Per person&#x2F;cargo transported? Much, much less pollution. Like an order of magnitude less.<p>&gt; We have flexibility of time, space, luggage, comfort, temperature, health, music, speed, privacy, basically everything.<p>You&#x27;ve never lived in a place with good public transport? Speed, time, and comfort are pretty normal for well funded transport. Yes, you lose some privacy.<p>But also, I&#x27;m not advocating for you to get rid of all your cars. There are plenty of models where a family does well with zero or one cars, relying on transit for most trips, and borrowing&#x2F;renting a car or taxi when they can&#x27;t make transit work.')
