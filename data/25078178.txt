It&#x27;s been illegal there since 1981. The article simply says it&#x27;s been extended to include new groups.<p>Yes, I absolutely think hate speech should be restricted, and the laws of most countries agree with that, with the USA being a notable exception:<p>&gt; A majority of developed democracies have laws that restrict hate speech, including Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, India, South Africa, Sweden, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom<p>Do I think hate speech in private should be restricted? I think _probably_ not, but I think this is for the elected legislature to decide, not an idea that is edict from several hundred years ago.')
