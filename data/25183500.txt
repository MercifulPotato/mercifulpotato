The strcpy(s, t) they present is around 2 lines code looking something like this expression: `<i>s++=</i>t++`. (please don&#x27;t code review here.. haha).<p>At that time I was writing verbose loops in class assignments to write similar functions. Looking their code made a strong positive impact. Their codes are poetic.<p>And the way they unfold topics in the book is so good. Structures and pointers often confusing many people I knew were natural in their book.')
