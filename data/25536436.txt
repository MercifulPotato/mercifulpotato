Besides normal people, three groups descended upon it: spammers, squatters and hackers. 6 years later and the entire .xyz space is blocked in Enterprise firewalls (source: my workplace) due to that behaviour, preventing me from getting to <i>valid</i> tech sites on the TLD. The XYZ image is still tarnished from cheap domain fire sales at the beginning of it&#x27;s life - I&#x27;d never pay $50 for anything in .xyz today.<p>To contrast, the .io space entered at what, $50 USD? and continues to be expensive to maintain year over year, providing a natural monetary resistance barrier to the same three groups of people (spammers, squatters and hackers) and seems to enjoy a healthy respect amongst internet users; most consider it a tech-type domain space with tech worker dollars buying the domains for real sites, I even owned one for a brief period when they came out.')
