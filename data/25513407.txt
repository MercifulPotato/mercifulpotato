That bacteria changes dietary preferences is well established and we don&#x27;t need to invoke depression to explain it. What about the other? &quot;The forced swim test led to conflicting outcomes; the study in mice found an increased immobility time, associated with depressive-like behavior, whereas the rat study found no difference.&quot; Flimsy, flimsy, flimsy.<p>Until stronger evidence merge, I agree the most likely explanation is that depressed people eat junk food to comfort themselves, or because they are too depressed to give a shit what they do to their bodies.')
