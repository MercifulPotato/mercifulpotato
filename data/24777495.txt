I think they&#x27;re just badly planned. I prefer the approach you see in anime were a show is usually contained in a single season. If the show does really well they make another show that is effectively the next season. If it does poorly any fans it did get aren&#x27;t left with an unfinished product.<p>For a planned multi season story arc Babylon 5 is the best example I can think of. The story arc was planned from the beginning and they stuck to the plan. The temptation to keep piling on more content to a successful show is huge.<p>For multi season story arcs I think it&#x27;s important for Netflix or whoever is making the show to commit to the whole thing regardless of early ratings. I&#x27;m far more likely to take a chance on a new show if I know the story line will be completed. I don&#x27;t want to start watching a show only to find out they cancelled it in the middle of the story.')
