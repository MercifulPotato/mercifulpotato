Item(by='kingdomcome50', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610398053, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25735566, text='&gt; If you don&#x27;t like it, build your own competitor<p>That is fundamental axiom of free-market capitalism. How do you think it is supposed to work? I&#x27;m trying to imagine a system where competition doesn&#x27;t exist... oh wait. It&#x27;s called &quot;Communism&quot;.<p>&gt; People shouldn&#x27;t be able to put you out of business because they have more power and don&#x27;t like you.<p>You must be young. &quot;I have a bridge to sell you&quot;. In 15 years you&#x27;ll better-understand how the world works and your idealism now will feel rather foolish in retrospect. I&#x27;ll leave it at that.<p>&gt; some of which are monopolists<p>I think <i>this</i> is actually what you are meaning to argue against. Just poorly. There is nothing wrong with a company deciding that the profit they derive from selling me widgets eclipses the losses they realize elsewhere, and to therefore end the relationship. This <i>literally</i> happens constantly. I could give you an example <i>last month</i> where we had to end a relationship with a client because they are a competitor to a bigger (more profitable) client who didn&#x27;t like us serving both. It happens. I promise.<p>What it seems like you are actually railing against is anti-competitive behavior which <i>is</i> protected against in antitrust law. Monopolies <i>are not</i> against the law so long as they don&#x27;t engage in certain market-making behaviors[0]. That is, behaviors that make &quot;building your own competitor&quot; impossible (i.e. undermining the fundamental axiom of FMC). This isn&#x27;t a case of anti-competitive behavior. This is the market deciding that the financial&#x2F;political cost of associating their business with an entity is greater than the profits they gain. It&#x27;s business. Parler, in this moment, simply doesn&#x27;t have a sustainable business model. The best thing they could do is to turn the narrative, lean in, and <i>applaud</i> AWS for exercising its freedom. But they are young too...<p>And for what it&#x27;s worth I wasn&#x27;t &quot;poking holes&quot; in your analogy. I was tearing it down entirely. It doesn&#x27;t hold at all - even a little bit. To believe otherwise is to misunderstand the very foundations on which the civil rights movement was based, and some respects, liberal democracy altogether.<p>[0] Amazon is currently in court fighting the government in this respect. So is Facebook.')
