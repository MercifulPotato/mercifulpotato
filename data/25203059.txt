If someone said they respected a person more for choosing medicine as a career, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d disagree. But for some reason, most people seem to model doctors as incorruptible angels, incapable of making decisions that are suboptimal for others or for society. This makes it uniquely difficult to have a conversation about the problems of the devilishly complex healthcare system, since it&#x27;s impossible to talk about one of the most important groups of stakeholders and their role in healthcare economics.<p>I remember talking to my sister shortly after her med school graduation about a topic that involved influences , and she said with a straight face &quot;doctors don&#x27;t do things that aren&#x27;t in the patient&#x27;s best interest&quot;. My (Ivy-League educated, MD-holding) sister isn&#x27;t the sharpest tool in the shed, but even for her, the idea that an entire industry full of people are immune to incentives is an especially pants-on-head stupid model of the world. She&#x27;s since unlearned much of the creepy indoctrination that med school drilled into her (and that her much-smarter doctor husband was never fully taken by), but the same messages have trickled down to many of the friends and family I have that are unconnected with the medical field, without any of the ego-protective incentives that my doctor acquaintances have.<p>[0] And most countries; if anything, it&#x27;s way worse in the other countries I&#x27;m familiar with, as the US tends to be (on average) more dynamic and less worshiping of formal credentials than the average country<p>[1] Though I do think it&#x27;s irrational; I distinctly remember my mom trying to communicate this feeling to me when trying to get me to be a doctor, and my high-decoupling teenage self telling her that she should also be appreciating the engineers whose work powers the hospital and the economists whose work was critical to building the hospital and paying doctor&#x27;s salaries.')
