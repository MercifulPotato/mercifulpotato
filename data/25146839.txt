(I see this is now supported, great to see that.)<p>To be fair, I didn’t report any of these issues, so I may have done something wrong or there may have been solutions that I missed. This was also 6+ months ago.<p>I also think that with all the major cloud providers now supporting Kubernetes as a first-class primitive, and with there being an abundance of CI&#x2F;CD tools that can trivially deploy to Kubernetes, the PaaS concept is no longer as attractive as it once was.')
