But this is mitigated by several factors. First, they are semi-audited and most educated guesses suggest they are collateralized one-to-one with $ at 70% or more. Second, tethers have become less systemically important over time, as other, better audited (or collateralized) stables have taken market share â€” this trend will likely continue. Third, tether brr doesn&#x27;t compare to Fed brr and never will be able to, so ultimately, this won&#x27;t matter in the long run.')
