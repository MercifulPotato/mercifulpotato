It&#x27;s also not something to YOLO out into production during an extreme volatility event when people are already mad at you.<p>Adding a static check of holding was likely much more straight forward.<p>In traditional Robinhood-style, this decision prioritized growth (allowing new users to still sign up and buy)<p>I guess a different alternative would have been just selling as much GME until they reach the maximum they could make the obligations for, but then it probably would have been considered less &quot;fair&quot; (if one person could buy 1000 shares, and then no one else can buy any).<p>You may not agree with Robinhood leadership, or Robinhood as a company (I know that I don&#x27;t), but this can really be thought of as a #hugops moment where they had to figure out how to track down and address the root of these (multiple) issues in real-time. They most definitely did not come out with the &quot;best&quot; solution.')
