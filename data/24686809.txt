Many would rather see the actual change &quot;Update X to use Y instead of Z&quot; in the history, and minor details like &quot;Fix mock in XTestCase&quot; or &quot;Perform renames from code review&quot; within that single commit.<p>I&#x27;m sort of agnostic on this issue, but I do feel the article&#x27;s author kind of overstated it here. Say 5 to 10 commits of this size were squashed together. Git bisect would&#x27;ve taken him 90+% as far and he&#x27;d have to read code or manually trial and error changes just slightly more. The binary searchable problem space would be slightly smaller, and the linear manual effort space slightly bigger. Less good, but really not that big of a deal.')
