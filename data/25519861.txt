A scientist is the perfect &quot;expert&quot;, as he appears, for most, as intrinsically expert and objective&#x2F;neutral.<p>Hence some scientists happen to recommend things (ways to solve a practical problem) and are used by some politicians (through mass-media) who promote those things (far various reasons), and silent counter-arguments from other scientists.  Note: consultants also often act as such &quot;excuses&quot;, forking a &quot;report&quot; recommending actions which were secretly planned before their mission began.<p>Those scientists may shoot themselves in the foot by doing so if, as I believe, their job is to explain how things work (nothing more).')
