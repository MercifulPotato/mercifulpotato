I’m no physicist, but my understanding is that some variants and parameters of the theory have been excluded as a result of LHC experiments.<p>More to the point, what is the alternative strategy that’s more likely to produce useful data? “Don’t do experiments to validate or invalidate theory” doesn’t obviously seem like it’s going to produce better results.')
