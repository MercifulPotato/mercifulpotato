If the world collapses, debts will all be wiped clean, you&#x27;re going to feel like an idiot if you just paid off your loans and now we&#x27;re all back to bartering. It would be much preferable to have a new and expensive car to barter away than nothing but the printout of a bank statement before the bank was liquidated by aliens.<p>I think this person just has a philosophy of debt and justifies it as &quot;prepping&quot; even though it&#x27;s not prepping related at all.')
