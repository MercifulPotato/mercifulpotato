I live in a small condo and having to turn my also small dinner table into a cluttered office (USB mic cable, laptop power cable, notepad, external mouse) just makes me feel like I am never really not at work. Even when sitting by the TV, the &#x27;work&#x27; is but a mere 6 feet away.<p>Ironically, my productivity has also been getting measurably worse.<p>I&#x27;ve realized that I need IRL interaction with my co-workers that&#x27;s outside of scheduled Zoom calls. I like running into them in the break room and making small talk while making a coffee. I am in a large organization, and having that interaction also gets me talking to people who aren&#x27;t my direct co-workers.')
