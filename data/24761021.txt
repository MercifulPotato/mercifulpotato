I bet increasing either would improve results. If you look at Greg Kogan’s website[1] since he’s a consultant too there’s nothing about any impressive educational background. It’s all research and case studies. Blowing your own trumpet more, whether by speaking at meetups and conferences or creating digital artifacts that anyone can find on your website and then telling ten people who might be interested and might share might help. Both of these help more as they are performed more consistently, obviously.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gkogan.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gkogan.co&#x2F;</a>')
