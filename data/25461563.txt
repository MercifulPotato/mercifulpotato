Item(by='lock-free', descendants=None, kids=[25462313], score=None, time=1608245381, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25460587, text='&gt; This is a regulatory problem<p>This is a consumer problem - &quot;you get what you pay for.&quot;<p>If you want to buy something from a retailer that gives a shit about their wholesalers, shop at a local superstore for whatever items your looking for and eat the difference in cost.<p>&gt; If Amazon was a corner hardware store it would have been fined multiple times and the owner might well have been jailed by now.<p>If Amazon was a corner hardware store and not a marketplace, they would have been run out of business by all the customers returning garbage and counterfeits they bought from them. But that&#x27;s not what Amazon is, they&#x27;re ostensibly connecting buyers to sellers and providing logistics - not behaving as a retailer that selects their wholesalers and manages their supply chain besides getting shit from point A to point B.<p>What Amazon shouldn&#x27;t do is have it both ways, either they&#x27;re an Ebay-esque digital flea market where everything is buyer-beware, or they&#x27;re a retailer who is responsible for the garbage on their shelves. They don&#x27;t want to be either, and if there&#x27;s regulation to be had, it should focus on that difference (as well as regarding their own products - you don&#x27;t see flea markets driving their merchants out of business by stealing their products and undercutting their prices, while stores can stock generics alongside their curated shelves).')
