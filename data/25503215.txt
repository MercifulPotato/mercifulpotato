I always find monitors too low, and I bend my head forward too much, especially when standing at a desk. This ends up causing me shoulder tension, or I end up slouching on the chair so the monitor is at eye level.<p>Now I don&#x27;t have any problems! I thought given it was relatively cheap (last time I looked half a decade or more ago they were closer to €100), it would not be very good and wobble, but it&#x27;s rock solid. 10&#x2F;10 would buy again.')
