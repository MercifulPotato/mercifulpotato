All of the US media is accepting the results. Even Fox News accepted the results. Most of the GOP is accepting the results.<p>One man-child&#x27;s tantrum does not a country make. The few in power that are sticking with Trump right now are absolutely deluded. His voters are simply misinformed, but will accept the truth soon enough.<p>The results of the election are already certain. They&#x27;ve been certain for <i>days</i>, DDHQ (non-partisan) called them a long time ago and they were slow to do so. It is through an abundance of caution that news outlets waited to get past .5% margin in PA to call the results.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter that Trump is contesting the results. He has lost all semblance of support (a miracle he had any in the first place). He was golfing when the results were being announced, I don&#x27;t think even he cares that much; he&#x27;s just scared and trying to cling to power.<p>So no, we should not treat Trump differently: We should treat him as we would anyone throwing a tantrum like he does: Dismiss it and ignore it. The courts are dismissing it (8 cases lost&#x2F;dismissed out of 8 filed), and the media is ignoring it. As long as the election is fair (which it was), and the results are correct (which they are), Biden is President. Let it be.')
