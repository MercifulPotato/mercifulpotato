Many people enjoy their work immensely. To take a HN hero I&#x27;ll bet Steve Jobs enjoyed changing the world via his work and through that loved his work. I&#x27;ll be Steven Spielberg loves (loved?) his work.<p>Further, short of AGI, there will always be work. Let&#x27;s imagine no one had to work anymore. What would we all do? We certainly wouldn&#x27;t make TV shows and movies because those require work to make but we just said we live in a world without work. We could all have twitch channels talking to our fans but their&#x27;d be no games to play on them because making a game is seriously hard work. Maybe some hobbiest would make some 1 person indie game and not call it work but there are few TV shows, movies, and games that don&#x27;t require a small army of people, most of which have to do &quot;work&quot;.<p>Not sure how we&#x27;re going to take the work out of nursing, cooking, cleaning (clothing, buildings, kitchens, hospitals, parks, streets) etc...<p>Replicators, if they ever exist, won&#x27;t remove the need for work. Even in Star Trek (post scarcity) what do think the 1000+ crew members each ship do? They do work.')
