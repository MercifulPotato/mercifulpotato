Briefly googling suggests optical polishing compound grains are almost all 1+ um.[1] But maybe that &lt;1 um tail is key?  This[2] shows larger grains, with a tail growing over hours.  But lens roughness is already at ~1 nm without the tail, and the growing tail only slightly improves that.  On the other hand, perhaps sub-um fragments from the hydrated damaged surface are being entrained by the lap pitch or wax or slurry?  Don&#x27;t know.  But it seems a half-lambda grain-size story has difficulties.<p>Oh well. :)  Thank you for this.  I wish I could find an online community interested in crafting improved stories for teaching science and engineering.
