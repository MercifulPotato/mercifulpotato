Every tether (their currency denomination) issued is theoretically backed by 1 USD. In 2017, Bitcoin prices soared in large part to the fact that so many people were trading tether for Bitcoin. It turns out that Tether may have arbitrarily issued more USDT than USD they have on hand. Therefore, the buys of bitcoin were essentially fake - trading $0.75 USD worth of tether for $1 of Bitcoin (a Tether lawyer said that Tether only had 75% of the cash necessary to back their supply of USDT).<p>I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;s supposed to affect current prices, however. Tethers are still around, and as far as I know, they have not submitted to an audit, but 1 USDT is still trading for 1 USD.')
