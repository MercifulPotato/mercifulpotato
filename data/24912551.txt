But I don&#x27;t really agree with the claim that the environmental arguments are ridiculous. If everyone only buys the accessories they want, and assuming some customers previously received accessories in the box that they didn&#x27;t need, then presumably this will actually reduce waste. There is still periodic &quot;waste&quot; when cable and charger standards change, which is happening right now, but that should happen far less often than the iPhone release cycle.')
