Therefore GDP growth should always be higher than individual income if the size of the labor population is growing.<p>However, the article is more-so comparing how this number has changed over time, which should be even <i>more</i> accentuated if you make the population adjustment, since the population was growing faster in the baby boomer period.<p>The article is just presenting data, but if you&#x27;re interested in why this phenomenon exists, research Bretton Woods and US inflation figures over the 20th century to the present.<p>Surprise: when you make your currency inflationary and wealth management becomes more complex than saving money in a mattress, those at the top will fare exponentially better than those at the bottom.
