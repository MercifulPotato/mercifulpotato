Item(by='bawolff', descendants=None, kids=[25446857], score=None, time=1608099716, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25439354, text='&gt; This idea that only the courts should limit or punish crimes pops up here once in a while and I&#x27;ve always found it bizarre.<p>Isn&#x27;t that the entire point of a court? to have a monopoly on punishing crimes so that people aren&#x27;t unfairly punished on the basis of gossip or false allegation and so that society doesn&#x27;t sink into a cycle of vengence where one group punishes the other group for their punishment, and so forth.<p>That said, punishing a crime is different from refusing to do business with someone because you don&#x27;t like them. I think the objection is that payment processors are an oligopoly which gives them too much power to behave arbitrarily. If you live in a city and one grocery store doesn&#x27;t do business with you, that&#x27;s fine go somewhere else. If there is only one grocery store, then that&#x27;s akin to starving someone and it should require the evidentiary standard of wrong doing a court would have.')
