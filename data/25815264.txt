Item(by='themgt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610919714, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25809870, text='In &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot;, Michael Chrichton&#x27;s fictionally-historicized retelling of Beowulf, it&#x27;s speculated the monsters are a relic Neandertal tribe. It&#x27;s a minor point in the novel, but it stuck with me (and has become much more scientifically plausible since the 1970s when he was writing), so I always think of Beowulf as being about Neandertals.')
