That&#x27;d be way too obvious. It&#x27;s not that odd that several people picked that sequence, people pick non-random sequences all the time.<p>But what I imagine it COULD be, is that they have some kind of system that can deterministically generate a specific sequence of numbers. So once in a while they can generate a sequence that&#x27;ll reward someone they know (or every time, but that&#x27;d probably be discovered quickly). Someone left that system in a test mode which generates the &quot;5...10&quot; sequence to demonstrate that the system works.<p>But I think it&#x27;s still more likely that the odds of a lottery somewhere in the world has some kind of interesting sequence is surpisingly high, as others here have said.')
