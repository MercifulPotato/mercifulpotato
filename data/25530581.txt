(e.g. we had site-specific fun events in lieu of the annual holiday party)<p>But a cash bonus? That&#x27;s the epitome of something that 1) should go through payroll and 2) should just get direct-deposited into your bank account as is the case with your regular paycheck. There&#x27;s no reason why you&#x27;d need to provide any additional info.')
