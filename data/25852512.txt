It was not uncommon for the British lords to kick Irish off their lands. I have a hard time believing that was a unique circumstance throughout the history of various forms of feudalism.<p>See also the practice of &quot;Enclosure&quot; for an additional example.<p>In addition, being a peasant often had some properties of slavery: no freedom of mobility or choice and sometimes lack of pay, with the express approval of the local lord required for many things. See the Revolt of 1381.<p>The Lord-Peasant relationship is really not a positive example of preventing homelessness, but either way, let&#x27;s face it: It was the Government supporting those people. Arguing from the historic example of feudalism as a method that prevented homelessness would mean you&#x27;re arguing that the government should be directly supporting the homeless.')
