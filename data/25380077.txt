Pandora and other services stream audio at something like 256kbps. And for most people who aren&#x27;t audiophiles, that&#x27;s a high-quality stream. Uncompressed CD Audio is something like 1.5mbps.<p>Netflix serves up 1080p video at around 4-6mbps. Just for fun, lets round that up to 10mbps per stream, you&#x27;re talking about being able to handle 50 simultaneous streams at 500mbps.<p>And really, you&#x27;re only serving one stream outbound to your video chat service, assuming something like Twitch or whatever. And that always gets compressed to hell. Not to mention, most webcams aren&#x27;t going to serve up Netflix-quality video, so there&#x27;s not even a point to trying to use that much bandwidth from the incoming feeds.')
