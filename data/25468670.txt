My advice to folks is to make moves well before you get into a headspace where quitting an entire industry is your last option. Once you&#x27;ve burnt out, you might not be able to stomach even the best possible job for you.<p>I&#x27;ve been there before. I burnt out as a teacher and almost burnt out on software development, too. What has worked for me is to spend a lot of time introspecting my own motivations and needs, and then working hard to identify places that are good candidates. This took longer than it sounds like it should. But it&#x27;s hard to break out of the impressions I built from my lived experience of what it seemed like work had to be like.<p>I&#x27;m really happy with work now. I don&#x27;t have the Thank God It&#x27;s Friday or the Sunday Scaries, which characterize a job I have to endure, rather than one I mostly enjoy.')
