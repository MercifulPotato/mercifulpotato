The example given of the process was the Mega Neko page.<p>All of that has been removed, along with the notion that it might be OK to just create a page and see what happens. But although the official process was already in place when I made my page, the direct process hadn&#x27;t been shut down. I didn&#x27;t even realize I wasn&#x27;t supposed to.<p>Coming back to something of a point, TvTropes, like Wikipedia, seems to have come around to the conclusion that user-generated content was valuable in the past, but they don&#x27;t want more of it than they already have.')
