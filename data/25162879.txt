I know it&#x27;s petty, but it&#x27;s literally the only reason that&#x27;s always made me not use it for more than just a few days at a time.<p>Is anyone working on improving the UI? Or are there alternative &quot;frontends&quot; out there? Does anyone know how hard it would be do it? (I assume it might not be trivial since Anki has a plugin system, but I don&#x27;t know to what extent they can modify the UI)')
