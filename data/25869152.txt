It happened just as they were negotiating a substantial rate increase with state regulators, saying without a 40% price hike they wouldn&#x27;t be able to stay in business. The rate increase passed shortly after the accident, and our local Facebook groups exploded with accusations that the shipping company (or some of its deckhands) had essentially extorted the state. The conspiracy theory was that someone must have had a bunch of insurance on those containers.  (I must note again that these were unfounded conspiracy theories with no supporting evidence other than &#x27;convenient timing&#x27;). I&#x27;m highly skeptical of those claims, but it would be interesting to know if insurance fraud could be contributing to the increase in container losses.')
