The issue here is that there&#x27;s a fundamental disagreement about what constitutes a fact. Objectivity in reporting is also subjective, funnily enough. If I consider NPR to be very objective because the dead-pan monotonic voice of the announcer simply says a direct quote from a member of congress, I can talk to a relative who will tell me that same NPR story is biased because they reported on something they don&#x27;t agree with.<p>&gt; It was because the media respected its role in society and at least tried to be objective.<p>There are _plenty_ of news outlets that still respect their role in society. The difference is that 20-30 years ago, there wasn&#x27;t a deluge of information or misinformation readily available to get those dopamine hits from confirming biases.')
