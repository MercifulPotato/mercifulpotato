Seriously?<p>Most of the time in human history people were struggling to even stay alive. You had to work until you got enough food to feed your family, or you&#x27;d die. Live was not great, it was very stressful and inefficient (but people were used to it). This is still the case in most of the world, although overall not as bad as it once was, it is improving constantly.<p>We&#x27;re the lucky ones who can sustain ourselve with 8 hours of work, food is cheap and abundant, we can afford luxury items like iphones even if a 300$ android smartphone would do the same job.<p>No, at average, people are not working harder now, because we don&#x27;t have to. We managed to improve efficiency so much already and quality of life continues to rise.')
