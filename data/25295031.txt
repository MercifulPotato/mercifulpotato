But you&#x27;ll soon be able to get a Zen 3 CPU that&#x27;s just as good.&quot;</i><p>It feels worse than that to me. Those people are actually saying &quot;But Zen 4 in 2 years will be just as good!&quot; because their claims depend on combining IPC improvements from Zen 3 _and_ a 5nm process that AMD has no plans to switch to for Zen 3. It&#x27;s a weird bit of gymnastics in order to reach emotional parity with the M1 widely available right now today.')
