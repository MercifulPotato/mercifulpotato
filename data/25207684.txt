The price of a nvidia quadro is always higher than a Geforce gpu with the same specs.<p>You can see a spec&#x2F;price comparison I did when having the discussion with my friend here : <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mega.nz&#x2F;file&#x2F;Nj4UnSJR#fBdZfn3zoZ8boxap35-GWEgDlicH3RmWm5nNGhKPvW4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mega.nz&#x2F;file&#x2F;Nj4UnSJR#fBdZfn3zoZ8boxap35-GWEgDlicH3R...</a>')
