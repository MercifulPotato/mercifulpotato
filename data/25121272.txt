I tried logrus. But it is missing file name and line number by default. I could not find a good 3rd party plugin for this either.<p>I just want to show the correct file name(need to pop out a few call stacks) and line number in a customizable format, not as key-value pair for each line.<p>Please let me know the one you actually use.')
