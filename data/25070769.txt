Software. This was also very obvious during the recent presentation, very few companies highlighted and of those how many did you recognize?<p>For current Mac users we still have no means by which to look at our installed software and know if Rosetta will handle it or in many cases if the developer is even planning on supporting it in the future. Catalina did a good job of punting a lot of old software to the side and decimated gaming on the Mac.<p>I know I am in a minority here but for me I want only one desktop&#x2F;laptop type machine for both productivity and games. As above, Catalina decimated the gaming environment on Mac and frankly the iOS game environment isn&#x27;t comparable.<p>So, yes in some limited cases Intel sounds a bit like Palm but the difference is in phones it was a wide open environment to exploit and the current desktop&#x2F;laptop market is heavily entrenched with established 3rd party software that must go along for the ride and that condition did not exist for phones, though now it does.<p>Now if Apple could find inroads into the server market.')
