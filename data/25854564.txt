Interestingly enough, a lot of physicists and other scientists actively participate in music, the arts, and so forth. I&#x27;m a musician. I read literature. I visit art galleries and attend the opera.<p>I think some people have a sort of tribal sense for what ideas they&#x27;re receptive to. Others don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any kind of predictor or pattern.<p>There are engineers who think that physics is bunk -- that the precision implied by theory is not believable.')
