When a hedge fund is getting its face ripped off because its shorts are up 50 - 200%, it will liquidate its longs to cover. The rotational dynamics of many funds doing that at once can drive the price down on traditionally stable stocks that everyone owns. In a worst case scenario that could trigger a massive selloff which would crash the market.<p>This is compounded by the fact that funds will defensively sell off (or sell short) stable stocks owned by other funds that look like they&#x27;re about to blow up. If a fund seems like it&#x27;s circling the drain and it owns 5% of a ticker, other firms are not going to wait for it to implode and move the price down before they liquidate their own positions in that stock.<p>This market is terrifying.')
