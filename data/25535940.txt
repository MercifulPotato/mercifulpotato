I can assure you that I communicated directly and clearly what my emotional state was, why I was behaving the way I was behaving, and actively tried to avoid inflicting my feelings on other people by being non-expressive.<p>An example of an action I took that one person considered &quot;aggressive&quot; and &quot;abusive&quot;: There were three couches, shaped in a U configuration. Ex and friends were sitting on one couch. Someone else invited me over to sit on another couch. I came over, sat quietly for about 60 seocnds, decided, you know, I&#x27;d rather be somewhere else, and walked away.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say I bear no responsibility in how things played out, but the bits I&#x27;m disclosing here, even in context, are wild misunderstandings, and when I explained myself I was met with distrust and suspicion. We were in a rental cabin; physical proximity was unavoidable. It wasn&#x27;t even clearly distressing to my ex, just her white knight friend.')
