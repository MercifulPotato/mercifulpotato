I had to learn a lot of CSS (for selectors), regex (still hate it), what&#x27;s OLAP and how to take advantage of it (DuckDB) and a lot of stuff I&#x27;m not even aware now.<p>But I remember taking courses in my Uni, and later on, with R and Python. It was interesting, but no matter how deep into the rabbit hole of weird models I learnt, it felt... IDK, shallow?<p>Imagine yourself pulling data out of a company ERP, with human filled data. It won&#x27;t be a walk in the park, just make some logit models and call it a day. You&#x27;ll spend a lot of time trying to understand what&#x27;s going on. And then you perform the models or make a dashboard.')
