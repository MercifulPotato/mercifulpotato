My comment looks dull with your explanation. Of course, I also don&#x27;t advocate doing something without any hypothesis. Though, I think hands-on practice on a subject can help you learn things better. For example, I find it very useful for linear algebra (maybe this is not applicable to other subjects). I can analyze my flawed intuitions.<p>When I first heard about the Monty Hall problem, I didn&#x27;t understand it and tried it myself. It was way easier for me to understand the flawed intuition by analyzing each line as opposed to, say, for example, the explanation of Judea Pearl (which is also good).<p>What I wanted to emphasize is that it is not bad guessing your way through a problem you don&#x27;t understand. But yeah, of course, you should have some knowledge.')
