It’s a speculative security. If I am holding cash and expecting some inflation hedge then I’m probably not an investor, or maybe I’m a stupid investor who won’t have much cash for long.<p>It’s this funny quasi status that I see lots of statements around. We need a digital currency. But currencies shouldn’t fluctuate or be primarily an investment since that makes it sucky as a currency.<p>For example, I had a friend who grew up in post-communist Yugoslavia. Their grandmother would send them to the grocery store with a thousand dinar (or whatever) to buy vegetables for dinner and the price would go up during the time to walk to the store. That sucked.<p>If I want to get a salary of 1 Bitcoin a year, and that varies in value from buying a month’s rent to six month’s rent that is not useful.<p>No currency is guaranteed to lose or gain value over a mid to long term. Venezuela will go away and change their currency, few are holding Venezuelan currency except people who live there and must use it to live. People there don’t want to switch to Bitcoin for many reasons like it’s volatile, shitty for transactions, and not as widely used. Last I heard they are trying to use dollars and maybe euros unless their government bans.<p>There are more countries that just use the dollar [0] and don’t think it would be wise for any to switch to Bitcoin. For all it’s weaknesses at least the US$ is fairly stable and tied to the USG that has some accountability. A country tied to a currency as manipulated as Bitcoin will be in a bad space.<p>The first stable government that comes out with a digital currency will be in a good macro place. But it won’t be a good speculative investment.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;International_use_of_the_U.S._dollar" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;International_use_of_the_U.S._...</a>')
