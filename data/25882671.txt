This money could have been used in unaccountably more productive enterprises, but the incentive structures and feedback loops are so broken in government, it can&#x27;t even build a rocket ship, in an era where every two bit backyard company is building their own.<p>The taxes raised to pay for SLS actually are screwing over the rocket industry because companies actually getting things accomplished have to compete for the highly trained engineers and scientists being wasted on SLS. There&#x27;s no amount of &quot;trickle down theory&quot; that makes the SLS a net gain for society.')
