You&#x27;ll find most of them simply don&#x27;t apply to cats. Maybe a couple of them slightly do, but none of them work like humans. Humans have a unique capacity to be affected by drugs due to our superb executive functioning. Non-humans are all but incapable of bending their entire life around drug-seeking behavior the way we are partially because we&#x27;re really good at making them, and also because we&#x27;re uniquely good at <i>refining</i> them. (It&#x27;s a long cognitive distance from &quot;let the fruit sit a while to taste fun&quot; to &quot;let&#x27;s build a still!&quot;.)')
