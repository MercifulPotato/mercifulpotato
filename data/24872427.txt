That would move the entire tilemap like a flat sheet of paper.<p>However, if you changed the scroll register during the <i>horizontal blanking interval</i> - the time between individual horizontal lines were drawn on the screen - you could achieve fancier effects like the row scrolling effect described in the linked article.')
