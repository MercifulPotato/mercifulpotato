I don&#x27;t own any Google (AlphaBet) stocks, but if I was a shareholder, and someone would have told me that &quot;we have a line item that is -50m on our statement, but hey, it is good for the competitors&quot;, I would like that line item gone.<p>I have faith in Google that they will try their best to make money. They may lose 1 here and make 50 there, but that -1 will be gone after a certain time. And this is a good business decision. Otherwise they would have one cash cow and 100 losers and they would be a break-even business, which is not a Business because Business = profit.')
