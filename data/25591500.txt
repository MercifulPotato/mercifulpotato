They just annoy end users by making them do some funny dance to get the app on their home page, which then barely works and doesn’t support all the features a native app can handle anyway.<p>So you end up in a world where developers say “we have a mobile app, it’s a PWA, just install that” and then no one installs it because they don’t know how, and the marketeers get frustrated that the current web app isn’t sticky enough on mobile and so they add banners in to make people download the “real” app and you’re back to square one.<p>The only real solution is cross platform development toolchains (like electron) as they reduce the development overhead but allow for native apps.')
