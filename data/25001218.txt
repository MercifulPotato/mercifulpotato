It&#x27;s still a very unpleasant experience. If you&#x27;re interested in a particular concept, but you&#x27;re not sure what your program calls it, good luck. Even if you&#x27;re looking for a particular flag (e.g., `-c`) you can have hundreds of search results to parse through depending on the size of the man page. I personally don&#x27;t enjoy this experience.')
