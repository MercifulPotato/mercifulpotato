Like psychosomatic itching - you are genuinely feeling the irritation, it&#x27;s not imaginary, but you can retrain yourself not to indulge to fix it. The same thing is true with other psychosomatic illness.<p>Many people act like psychosomatic illness is in the same category as malingering, delusion, or antisocial behavior. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s a real thing that you&#x27;re really experiencing, not some kind of moral failing, it just happens to have a root in neurology and psychology instead of a different causative origin. Is a headache any less real or painful just because it&#x27;s caused by stress instead of a hangover? I would say no, if anything, the opposite.<p>Same goes for psychosomatic nausea, high blood pressure, eczema, psoriasis, pain, dizziness, any of at least a dozen things. They&#x27;re real things you&#x27;re experiencing, that might have more to do with mental health than physical health, depending on the exact situation. But they&#x27;re still all real - nobody with high blood pressure from somatic issues is imagining their numbers higher.<p>So, trust yourself. What you&#x27;re feeling is genuine, regardless of the source - the fact that that source might be on one or the other side of the extremely fuzzy line of &quot;mind versus body&quot; is no reason to question your own experience.')
