All content areas are predefined, so you won&#x27;t have things change or your scroll position modified because some advertisement loaded 5 seconds in and suddenly you&#x27;re scrolled up from where you were.<p>2 is also a bit of an oversimplification. It&#x27;ll load images if they&#x27;re likely to be scrolled to, which I expect is some heuristic based on distance below the fold, and it may cause above the fold content to load faster since it doesn&#x27;t need to compete with below the fold content (on very fast connections this may not matter, on slower connections it probably does).')
