They just need to be able to make enough to have a healthy business, and so far they&#x27;ve achieved that. $500MM yearly revenue with 40+% growth is nothing to scoff at.<p>It really seems like Elastic&#x27;s motivation here is jealousy more than anything else. Which I understand from an emotional perspective, but from a logical perspective it&#x27;s a big business blunder they&#x27;ve made IMO.')
