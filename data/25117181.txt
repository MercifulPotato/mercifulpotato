The number of people using a 500mm f&#x2F;4 is vanishingly small, and wondering about their price is a bit like asking why Ferraris still cost a lot.<p>For comparison, let&#x27;s look at the most popular lens in the world, the 50mm. I&#x27;ll focus on Canon&#x27;s f&#x2F;1.8 series of the nifty-fifty, just to keep consistent.<p>1975: $79.95 ($386.95 today)<p>1978: $67.95 ($271.37 today)<p>1986: $102   ($242.33 today)<p>1992: $44.95 ($83.42 today)<p>2014: $125 ($137.49 today)<p>Today: $94.00 (discontinued) or $125 (new model)<p>While the list price of the 50mm tends to sit in the $50-125 range, the inflation adjusted cost of this lens has dropped fairly consistently over the years. And remember that this is covering a pretty massive range of lens technology; a modern 50mm f&#x2F;1.8 is lighter, focuses closer (0.35m vs 0.6m), has an extra diaphram blade in it (7 vs 6), contains several multi-coated glass elements, <i>and has an auto focus motor built into the body of the lens</i>. The value per dollar of a modern photo lens is genuinely massive compared to what was available in the past.')
