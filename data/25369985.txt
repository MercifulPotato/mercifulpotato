This is a view that goes back thousands of years back at least to Plato and Hinduisim before that, but even in contemporary society there are people who believe that these substances get one in touch with really existing spirits, or ancestors, or god.<p>It also demeans the experience as being valueless in itself.  It&#x27;s far from clear that it is, and many people consider the &quot;hallucinations&quot; by far the most valuable thing about the experience, and argue that it is by the revelations that they have on these substances that the beneficial effects come about.  This is, as the existence of this paper shows, still an area of research, but this paper shouldn&#x27;t be trying to close off that possibility by choosing to use terminology whose very definition presumes the contents of the experience is valueless.<p>Another reason it&#x27;s pejorative is that there are people who consider these substances to be sacred or teachers, so to call them substances that merely induce hallucinations is disrespectful to these views as well.')
