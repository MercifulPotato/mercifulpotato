Cygnus used to specialize in porting gcc to these architectures.  Now, pretty much everybody has converged on gcc so you don&#x27;t have to support weird, obscure things.<p>It&#x27;s only been recently that so much embedded development has converged on 32-bit ARM Cortex.  That&#x27;s a lot fewer architectures you have to support and 32 bits instead of 8 bits means that you have a unified memory space rather than weird I&#x2F;O accessors and chunked memory and far pointers and ...  Now your tools can specialize in one debugging format&#x2F;protocol and get better with time rather than having to be rewritten and rewritten and rewritten.<p>Embedded folks <i>are</i> starting to move.  A lot of chip vendors support an Eclipse-based toolchain.  Microchip threw in behind Netbeans (not a good move, but they realized they simply couldn&#x27;t spend enough money on their proprietary IDE to keep it going).  Microsoft is throwing stupid amounts of resource behind VSCode so it&#x27;s going to be hard to match.  The Rust embedded folks are getting really good with Visual Studio Code integration and the Visual Studio Code architecture is <i>much</i> better than most other IDEs.  Other people are starting to realize that they can use &quot;standard&quot; tools as well.<p>However, the critical mass required has just coalesced and embedded development changes <i>really</i> slowly.')
