You&#x27;ll still be able to buy tires and toothpaste (though the economics of something like asphalt, which is almost a waste product unless you&#x27;re doing cracking, might result in alternative materials trials for road surfacing treatments, particularly in urban areas. Interlock pavers are particularly suitable for low-strength situations where asphalt is currently used due to artificially low prices)')
