The problem that was introduced by the compiler they used to build the print driver. To compute the paper size, margins, etc., floating point operations were used... but by then the driver had allowed the libraries that emulated the floating point processor to be unloaded, to save memory. (Due to the optimizing compiler)<p>Any operation that involved computing the page size would crash, only if the floating point library had idled out of memory.<p>I ended up forcing the library to be loaded at boot on all machines, and then things were stable.')
