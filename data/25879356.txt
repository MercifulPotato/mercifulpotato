I also explained you are not doing anything sinister, that your actions are entirely explicable through well intentioned and reasonable motivations.  Yet, this does not preclude censorship and a set of topics which are considered Things You Cannot Say.  I don&#x27;t believe any of this is controversial, and in fact is entirely consistent with Paul Graham&#x27;s essay.  There are taboo subjects, and he says the best thing is to not talk about them openly.  And I would imagine if he ran a forum the same would go for the forum: go ahead and censor all the distracting controversial subjects.')
