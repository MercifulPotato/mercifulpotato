The problem is RH is just a shitty platform that is susceptible to these kinds of problems due to high volatility which forces them into a regulatory corner every once in a blue moon.<p>I <i>was</i> a user when they had that suicide situation and RH did do a better job of explaining your actual balance when you entered a somewhat complex trade that caused you to have a negative balance. Still a user, who didn&#x27;t know what he was doing, entered a complex trade, saw something he didn&#x27;t understand and ended his life. In response Robinhood could have:<p>1. Made the UI &quot;easier&quot; to understand (i.e. lie) for 99% of situations<p>2. Raise the entry requirements to ensure people knew what they were doing (Gatekeep)<p>They chose (and continue to choose) 1, and I don&#x27;t envy them - how would ever explain all the ways a margin account can put you in trouble on a 4 inch screen? Most users only care about &quot;instant deposits&quot; and will never get into trouble 99% of time. It took 2 &quot;black swan&quot; events (IIRC, the first suicide issue was during the first COVID market crash) for these issues to come to light.')
