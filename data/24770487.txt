Especially today, when polygon counts and texture resolution are so high.  Squeezing 10% more polygons in when you already had enough doesn&#x27;t matter.  But if you go for some stylistic choice that people just don&#x27;t like, then it might be perceived as looking bad.<p>Like in the latest Warzone game, the weird blur they do when you start driving around, to me that is un-watchable. It makes everything look like miniatures to me.  But I suppose some people like it. While pubg is very very simple by comparison but I like it fine.')
