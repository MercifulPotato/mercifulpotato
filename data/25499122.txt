Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=[25499316], score=None, time=1608582113, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25499013, text='<i>&gt; If jaywalking was legal, the sacrifice is that we&#x27;d have to drive slower to watch for pedestrians.</i><p>There is a middle ground: the law could say that, while you can&#x27;t get a ticket just for crossing a street outside the marked crosswalks, if you <i>do</i> cross that way and get hit by a car, the presumption is that you were at fault--whereas, if you get hit by a car while you are <i>in</i> the marked crosswalks, the presumption is that the driver of the car was at fault. That would basically reflect the same presumption that is in our current laws, but it would remove the excuse for cops to mess with people when they haven&#x27;t caused any harm.<p>Note that &quot;presumption&quot; does not mean an automatic finding of fault; it just means that whoever is presumed to be at fault has the burden of establishing that they weren&#x27;t, if they believe they weren&#x27;t. That&#x27;s a common situation in law.<p>In short, making jaywalking itself--crossing a street outside the marked crosswalks--illegal is not about safety at all; it&#x27;s about local municipalities finding ways to shake down people for money. Just like most traffic laws.')
