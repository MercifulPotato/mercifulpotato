But video is also so much easier than a live lecture to stop, rewind, repeat, or play 50% slower&#x2F;faster that I can&#x27;t conclude either is clearly superior.<p>I&#x27;d say superiority mostly comes down to the quality of the instruction â€” clarity, good organization of fundamentals, then broad and deep enumeration of concepts that build meaningfully on those fundamentals.  In my experience, few professors value teaching enough to master it.  When one does, I&#x27;d very much like to be able to attend such a lecture.<p>Maybe the best of both worlds is to deliberately supplement primary content with outstanding reference material like Kahn Academy or Three Blue One Brown.  Being able to drill down on difficult concepts from multiple perspectives is often a great way to resolve obstructions in any kind of teaching method.')
