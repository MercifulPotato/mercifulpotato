It probably won’t help with performance but the M1 has a lot of power to keep even that code running fast.<p>But more importantly video&#x2F;audio apps aren’t going to be using Rosetta2 for very long. 99% of code written for x86 MacOS is going to be a simple recompile to native, if not more. Not going native when your competitors did and got 2-5x faster is corporate suicide.')
