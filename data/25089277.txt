Item(by='aw1621107', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605314868, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25088567, text='&gt; Yes, but it&#x27;s only known to the voter.<p>One of the more common complaints I&#x27;ve seen with similar schemes is that it opens the door to vote selling and&#x2F;or voter intimidation.<p>&gt; As a voter, I should be able to verify that my vote was recorded correctly.<p>I agree that this can be a desirable property for a voting system to have. Unfortunately, it has to coexist with other desirable properties (e.g., a secret ballot), and at least from what I can tell it appears that some of those properties can be mutually exclusive [0, 1, 2 with 1 being the PDF of 0].<p>(Fair warning, the literature is well over my head for the most part, so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if I misinterpreted something.)<p>&gt; What other option do you have?<p>I honestly don&#x27;t know, off the top of my head. Presumably there&#x27;s continuing research into different voting systems, but in the end it&#x27;ll come down to what combination of desirable properties and ease of implementation people will be willing to live with.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;chapter&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;978-3-642-12980-3_11" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;link.springer.com&#x2F;chapter&#x2F;10.1007&#x2F;978-3-642-12980-3_...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lsv.fr&#x2F;Projects&#x2F;anr-avote&#x2F;PUBLIS&#x2F;CFPST-08.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lsv.fr&#x2F;Projects&#x2F;anr-avote&#x2F;PUBLIS&#x2F;CFPST-08.pdf</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ecommons.cornell.edu&#x2F;handle&#x2F;1813&#x2F;40575" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ecommons.cornell.edu&#x2F;handle&#x2F;1813&#x2F;40575</a>')
