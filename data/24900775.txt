I find their PR kinda sketchy because it makes a lot of emphasis on laser and optical things, which they use, but rarely mentions that the fact that they rely on an ultrasound beacon makes their best-case temporal and spatial resolution not as exciting.<p>The tech is really cool, as in a portable MRI-like device is really cool even if it&#x27;s resolution is way worse than a big MRI machine. But it&#x27;s nowhere near &quot;brain scanning for brain upload&quot; territory because of fundamental physical laws that they actually choose to work withing the constraints of.<p>I would really like to see something like OpenWater but used to help with de-scattering LiDAR on rainy&#x2F;foggy days. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s possible but from my limited understanding I think it&#x27;s worth the try.')
