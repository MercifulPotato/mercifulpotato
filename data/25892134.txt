Funny how slightly different distilled water behaves, ie tea leaves take much longer to release its content.<p>Potentially beneficial minerals in the water can be easily substituted with a food supplement tablets if one feels food intake is inadequate.<p>Minimizing PFOS to practically 0 on top of god knows what other pollution could be in it still sounds like a great idea. I wouldn&#x27;t care about this if I was 60+, but we are far from it and our kid(s) deserve a bit less pollution in their most fragile stage of life. Heck, all kids do.')
