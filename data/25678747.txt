Or you want to quit your full time and get a part time job so you can survive while you build?<p>Option A is almost certain failure as you&#x27;ll never have time, Option B is not uncommon but still can be hard and not work out as well as you think.  I&#x27;d suggest Option C, keep your full time gig until you get some traction with the project and get it to a point where jumping off the cliff is manageable. Then take on some consulting every so often to help pay your bills but devote almost all of your time to your project.')
