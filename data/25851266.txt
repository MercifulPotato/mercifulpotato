The conventional thinking, as far as I am aware, has always been that JavaScript increases your attack vector and diminishes your security coverage.<p>&gt; Last year, we announced that we would require JavaScript to be enabled in your browser when you sign in so that we can run a risk assessment whenever credentials are entered on a sign-in page and block the sign-in if we suspect an attack.
