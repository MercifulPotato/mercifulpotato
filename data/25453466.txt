And it wasn&#x27;t just the federal agents entrapping him, there were 2 other agreements to kill 5 other people with another entity that was not a federal agent, but was scamming him out of money and the people did not exist.<p>But that&#x27;s not what he was charged with and that&#x27;s not what he was convicted of, so he shouldn&#x27;t be serving time for it. If you want him on those charges charge him with those crimes.')
