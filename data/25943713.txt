This is misguided effort.<p>The issue is with the way multiple browser windows are managed. When I have many tabs I must have a way to manage many windows as well. Visually!<p>Whether these can and should be improved on a browser level I can’t say.<p>MacOS is already very very good at this and much better than anything else<p>I extensively use app expose and spaces to visually and spatially find what I need and structure my environment by projects and topics. I have everything I need exactly where I left it, together with all other applications and information that was related to it<p>Adding more management features should not be the  responsibility of the browser. That’s why I‘ve never been a fan of any of the popular tab management extensions or browser features')
