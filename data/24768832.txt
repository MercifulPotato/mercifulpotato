As far as rate of return goes, a stock at a P&#x2F;E of 10 is about the same as a bond paying 10% interest.  (Yes, the stock can go up in price.  It can also go down.  And so can the bond - when interest rates change, bond prices change.  But stock prices factor in expectations of future earnings changes, which bond prices usually don&#x27;t.)<p>Now bonds are only paying 4%.  That stock P&#x2F;E of 10 looks <i>really</i> good - so good that people keep buying it, and the price keeps going up, until the P&#x2F;E is more like 25, which puts it back at approximately the same yield as bonds.')
