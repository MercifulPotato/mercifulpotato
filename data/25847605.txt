The Federalist Papers are full of warnings about mob rule, and the goal of the Constitutional framework was explicitly to insulate government from populist and direct democratic influence, while setting up structures that were supposed to mold the government into the form of an aristocracy (in the sense of Plato&#x27;s Republic).<p>The Republic is actually quite prescient in its analysis of forms of government and how they decay from one form to another.  The USA today very much resembles an oligarchy (class-based rule by the rich) being pushed rapidly into social media-driven democratic mob rule.<p>Were we already farther down that path, Trump might have been enough to push us down the hill even farther, from democracy to true tyranny.')
