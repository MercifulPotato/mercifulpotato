It&#x27;s the type of thing that sounds good to a lot of people before they find themselves in a situation where it actually makes a difference. When it suddenly kicks in and people say, &quot;wait, what?&quot;, I can see there being legal action or something. But I think it would also be too late, if it&#x27;s already been accepted as law. It might prompt people to want to start undoing it, but there may be an instance of it applying first.')
