Item(by='mehrdadn', descendants=None, kids=[24892405], score=None, time=1603666357, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24889496, text='&gt; Ainslieâ€™s research showed that a substantial number of subjects reported that they would prefer $50 immediately rather than $100 in six months<p>I&#x27;d probably choose the same thing, but is this because they really prefer the $50 today, or is it because of uncertainty about the $100 in 6 months? I feel like this could be either due to uncertainty about it even materializing, or uncertainty about its value at that point.<p>Another experiment to consider, to rule out the latter possibility: what happens if you replace dollars with gold? Offer me 1g of gold today vs. 2g of gold in 6 months and I would almost certainly choose 6 months, despite choosing the payment to be made today if in dollars.')
