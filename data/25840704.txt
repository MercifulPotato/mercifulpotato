That&#x27;s literally ancient technology, and commodity stuff. Ok, it is a bit fancier than what the Romans had, but these are still just glass bottles.<p>The glass vial part is expected, things get complicated when multiplied by a billion, but it gives a sense of how much vaccine is being produced and how fast it is done.')
