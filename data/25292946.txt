There&#x27;s a small but real chance that Bitcoin (or another crypto) essentially replaces the US dollar as the world&#x27;s reserves currency.<p>Bitcoin&#x27;s total capitalization today is $200 billion. The total value of the dollar is harder to measure and depends on what you count as money or just money-like. But M3 is $20 trillion, and add in short-term T-bills and money markets and it&#x27;s substantially higher. So in this scenario, it&#x27;s possible for BTC to rise from $20,000 to $1,000,000+ or higher.<p>Given that, I think it&#x27;s prudent to allocate 1-2% of your overall net worth to crypto exposure. Especially because we expect it to out-perform in high-inflation&#x2F;low-growth environments, which is the worst environment for traditional 60&#x2F;40 portfolios.')
