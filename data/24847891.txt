Both for general operation and of course for safety.<p>I got to drive a forklift during my first job right after high school in a shipping depot - I had no training but eventually they just let me do it!<p>One of the forklifts had longer forks and I didn&#x27;t realize I was driving it.  I tried to raise the forks and it got stuck on an edge of the shelf, eventually making a loud BANG and bending the shelf!  Luckily the other workers just gave me a hard time but I didn&#x27;t get in trouble.. because the boss made the same mistake all the time :D')
