Item(by='webmaven', descendants=None, kids=[25507321], score=None, time=1608651435, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25505795, text='<i>&gt; A horcrux is a plot device where the protagonists need 2fa to send a HUP or TERM to the misbehaving process.</i><p>Okay, I didn&#x27;t literally LOL, but you did earn a really big grin and even a chortle. Well done.<p>BTW, I would totally read &quot;Harry Potter and the Protocols of Security&quot;. Some of the &quot;Methods of Rationality&quot; fan fiction by Eliezer Yudkowsky nods in that direction (eg. the Death Eaters&#x27; opsec).')
