IDK if he was too concerned about being labeled a far left socialist in governance and risking his re-election prospects.<p>But in his 2nd term, he was a far better president. He eased off on drone strikes (still too much, imo), pardoned non-violent drug offences like crazy, he commuted Manning&#x27;s sentence, and there were talks of him considering pardoning Snowden too (when he was a lame duck).<p>I don&#x27;t think Biden will venture into territory that Obama considered to be too controversial, but given that Biden&#x27;s pretty much running as a 1 term President, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s impossible.')
