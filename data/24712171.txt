The easiest workaround for this issue was to require HTTPS, so that&#x27;s what was done.<p>Also when HTTPS is being used the server can say during TLS handshake that it supports HTTP&#x2F;2 avoiding the cost in having to figure out whether the server supports HTTP&#x2F;2 - this cannot be done with HTTP as there is no handshake. If a web browser were to assume the server supports HTTP&#x2F;2 it would make initial HTTP&#x2F;1 requests slower as it would have to try HTTP&#x2F;2 first (and then you would have people complaining about Google making HTTP&#x2F;1 slower to make HTTP&#x2F;2 look more attractive). If a web browser would say that it supports HTTP&#x2F;2 it would make HTTP&#x2F;2 requests slower as it would have to try HTTP&#x2F;1 first (which would slow down HTTP&#x2F;2 when it was supposed to be fast).')
