Does that matter for some special application, or not at all?  What happens when they want to increment the speed for next generation, does it become just M2?<p>And, in the manufacturing process, what happens to the chips with lower yield&#x2F;performance?  Do those get sold somehow and we don&#x27;t know about it?')
