Item(by='Someone1234', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601577515, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24653357, text='&gt; Most seats on the market are wide because they include cupholders and other extras.<p>Nope. They&#x27;re always too wide at the head, and it is due to side impact protection&#x2F;cushioning. It has nothing to do with &quot;extras&quot; (unless you consider safety above mandatory regulations an &quot;extra&quot;), since the seats are narrower at the feet.<p>I&#x27;ve been in the buybuy BABY parking lot playing with store car seats, including the Radian, for up to an hour before (which is as fun as you can imagine).<p>The Radian is specifically designed to go three across, that&#x27;s essentially their niche, and they accomplish it to a certain degree. The build quality of the Radian is frankly excellent, but the kid was uncomfortable after five minutes let alone if it was a multiple hour car trip (and I can see why, very firm&#x2F;minimum padding). Plus it is unpleasant to install&#x2F;uninstall (particularly in rear facing).<p>I think you&#x27;ve tried to prove one thing, but really proved the opposite. You&#x27;ve listed one car seat at the very bottom (that fits due to poor construction) and one specialty car seat that trades a lot for only 3x across. Which is essentially an admission of the reality: Most car seats don&#x27;t work 3x across, it is rare, and it is problematic.<p>Rear seats in even large SUVs have very little wall-to-wall room, you pull your average Britax or Graco car seat off the shelf, it isn&#x27;t going to work 3x across. A lot of people wind up changing cars, or replacing their 1st and 2nd kid&#x27;s $200 car seats to spend $600 more on three Radians (because even with one Radian and two non-Radians it doesn&#x27;t work).')
