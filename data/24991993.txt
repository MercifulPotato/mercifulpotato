Lots of pigs getting culled (in many cases burned and&#x2F;or buried alive on a grand scale) because they are infected with diseases that are dangerous to humans. Corona included.<p>I just keep being surprised that there is consensus forming around mink but the hog issue, which is very similar and actually a bigger problem by numbers, is not really part of the mainstream debate. For some reason being against mink farming is much more acceptable than being against hog farming and this is reflected in policy.<p>It could be because the interests of hog farmers and consumers of hog are a much bigger part of society. But the harm is also that much bigger.')
