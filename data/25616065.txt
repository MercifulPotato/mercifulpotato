Every single page load and transition is slow and terrible.<p>Asking &quot;which one is the highest priority&quot; is like asking which body part I&#x27;d least prefer you amputate. The answer is: please don&#x27;t amputate any of them.<p>It&#x27;s as if I asked you to dig out a hole for pouring foundation for a house. The answer to &quot;which shovelfull of dirt has the highest priority&quot; is all of them. Just start shoveling. It&#x27;s not done until you&#x27;ve dug the entire hole.<p>It&#x27;s like the exterminator asking which specific cockroach is bothering me the most. (It&#x27;s Andy. Andy the cockroach is the most annoying one, so please deal with her first).<p>What I, and many many other commenters, are trying to tell you is that the entire product is slow and terrible (not your fault. I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re new and just trying to improve things, and I hope you succeed!). If it were a building, I&#x27;d call it a teardown. If it were a car, I&#x27;d call it totaled.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter what page or interaction you start with. Just start shoveling.')
