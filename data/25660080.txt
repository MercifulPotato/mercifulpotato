I occasionally post some of my photography projects so my grandparents can see them. FB Marketplace is leagues better than Craigslist and I have sold several items on it. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I <i>hate</i> facebook, but if used moderately&#x2F;correctly, it isn&#x27;t terrible. It&#x27;s definitely not my preferred social network, nor is it by any of my peers the same age as me.')
