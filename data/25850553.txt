Good closed back over-hear headphones will offer around 10db of attenuation, and IEMs will isolate to 25db or greater (on par with earplugs).<p>And with good tips, IEMs are indeed all day comfortable.<p>On a more anecdotal note, I (and others who have spoken up on HN) get fatigued by ANR, similar to as if Iâ€™m listening to too-loud music. That, and the frequency issues with ANR, have pushed me more towards IEMs.')
