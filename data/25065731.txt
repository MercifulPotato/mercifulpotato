That&#x27;s so old that it even pre-dates the true atomics instructions (which are intro&#x27;d in 8.1-A). So it&#x27;ll have to be a pretty heavyweight JIT to adapt ARMv8.3 code to that baseline.<p>For Apple A11 though, going from 8.3 -&gt; 8.2 is much easier... and doable through a patch on fault method.')
