As you say, doctors would be sued.  I would say that suing, etc relates to the culture that has grown up around the system.  And perhaps the medical system was always this way - ie system-centric, rather than patient-centric.  With the onset of the &#x27;IT age&#x27;, we get to see that system-centric fruit fully &#x27;ripen&#x27; such that everyone&#x27;s data can be seen by anyone.<p>You might say - as I do - that it is for the person who is being treated to be the collector of their information.  A different culture would have grown had we had the patient at the center of our considerations.<p>I&#x27;m sure people have been warning all the way down the line, about the issues over privacy.  It is frustrating that at every turn the expediency over the system overrides all other concerns.  After, what 100 years(?) we find ourselves where we are no, with the patient having no control (and often no knowledge) of the issues that relate to them, while the system has it all.  I would go further and say that this outcome is by design, as those running the system - those who govern us - would prefer that we were ignorant while they are informed.  Its pretty dystopian anyway.')
