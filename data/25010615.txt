Would someone please found a company to make it unnecessary for individuals to own printers? Even in a pandemic?<p>Kinkos exists, but they do it really shittily.  You have to go into a ginormous store filled with surly employees (and these days, covid probably), their prices per page are outrageous, oh, and to print you end up using their scary doubtless malware-laden windows machines in store.  Screw that.  Why not, like, Amazon locker for printing?  Send a print job or several print jobs somewhere from home, have it land in a locked mail slot, go to the place and enter a code to pick it up.')
