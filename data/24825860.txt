That&#x27;s unspeakably cheap for something that could have fucked over many of your users.<p>I work at a very small company, so small that a security researcher would never accidentally stumble on our products to test them and if my boss asked me what would be an appropriate pay out for this, I&#x27;d say easily $25k, but more likely 30-35k if we can afford it.<p>What you guys have accomplished here is set a precedence that you pay so little that researchers should either a) not bother with discord or b) should sell on the darknet.<p>As a discord app user, I&#x27;m very concerned about both of those cases.')
