This was a bunch of spooky concepts all mashed together without any clear theme. What was the main theme or central concept of season 2? Season 1 was clearly about the movements &amp; what they did, whether they&#x27;re supernatural or what. Season 2 was like &quot;Silicon valley! Rhizomes! Time travel! Talking sea creatures!&quot; just sort of a throw everything at the wall approach. Anyway it didn&#x27;t work for me especially with how fantastic and cohesive the season 1 story was.<p>Check out the notes here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_OA#Production" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_OA#Production</a> which make clear that the season 1 story was a cohesive, beginning to end story that the creators refined over a series of years (and it shows). Then &quot;hey lets add a season 2.&quot;')
