You&#x27;ve set up a false dichotomy between everyone out of poverty vs most farther out of poverty, but some still in poverty.<p>There&#x27;s literally nowhere in the US where a single minimum wage job can rent and &quot;affordable&quot; (defined as &lt;-30% income) two bedroom apartment [1]. And it&#x27;s not even a close thing like two incomes could afford that. The calculation is that you&#x27;d need to work 127 hours per week at minimum wage for an affordable two bedroom apartment.<p>And it gets even worse in expensive metro areas. The poverty line in san francisco is $117,000 for a family of 4 and $82,000 for an individual. Meanwhile minimum wage in SF is $33,425.6 per year (16.07 * 40 * 52).<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;26&#x2F;minimum-wage-workers-cannot-afford-2-bedroom-rental-anywhere-in-the-us.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnbc.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;06&#x2F;26&#x2F;minimum-wage-workers-cannot-...</a>')
