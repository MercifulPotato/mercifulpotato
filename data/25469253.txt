You lost me at &#x27;selling cocaine to his friends&#x27;<p>I personally support legalizing and&#x2F;or decriminalizing a significant array of drugs; but I do not think we should ever accept the distribution of drugs by non-regulated entities. Possession&#x2F;consumption, fine. Distribution: Not fine. Drugs sold on the street are not tested for purity or manufacturing standards. There is no accountability, no regulated employee rights, no taxes levied, etc. Selling drugs should remain a felony.<p>Personally, I think the gov&#x27;t should grant licenses for the manufacture and distribution of these substances with rigorous controls, and adult citizens should be legally allowed to purchase an amount that is fit for personal consumption, on a schedule that would make it exceedingly difficult to resell&#x2F;stash (e.g. You may purchase 1-2gs of cocaine or 2 tabs of acid every 6 months)<p>Obviously, we have seen problems with this, as this scheme is essentially just prescription drugs combined with Canada&#x27;s &#x27;beer stores&#x27;.')
