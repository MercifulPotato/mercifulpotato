Orloff, Apollo by the Numbers: A Statistical Reference, NASA SP-2000-4029 (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, updated September 27, 2005), available at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;history.nasa.gov&#x2F;SP-4029&#x2F;SP-4029.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;history.nasa.gov&#x2F;SP-4029&#x2F;SP-4029.htm</a>. In that reference, 140 mt is the weight of the Apollo 17 command-and-service modules, the lunar module, the spacecraft&#x2F;lunar module adapter, the instrument unit, and the S-IVB stage (the third stage of the Saturn V), including the fuel remaining in that stage needed to propel the Apollo command-and-service modules and lunar module from low earth orbit to the moon.&quot;<p>So this number includes the S-IVB stage and unspent fuel. Which ought to raise the question of the definition of the payload - we don&#x27;t usually consider launcher&#x27;s parts among payload mass.<p>&gt; Mass of the payload to LEO is just how much mass is brought to LEO.<p>No, it&#x27;s usually not that simple - Space Shuttle here doesn&#x27;t include Orbiter&#x27;s mass (I think it&#x27;s a mistake), Sputnik payload didn&#x27;t include R-7 second stage (I think it&#x27;s right), Energia doesn&#x27;t have 0 LEO payload even though it releases the payload below LEO (I think this definition is also more meaningful).')
