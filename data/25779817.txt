Throughout one&#x27;s life the composition of the cohort changes as you begin to specialize starting with college&#x2F;first job and continuing if you focus on a particular area (for me it has been systems analysis).<p>This effect can drive people to over-pay to go to &quot;good schools&quot; or work for less than they think they should be paid at the &quot;good places to work&quot; because it lets them join a cohort with members who are statistically more likely to be &quot;successful&quot; (for some arbitrary definition of success). I personally never paid much attention to it but thought about it when talking with this person.<p>I know from experience that it happens in Silicon Valley that someone will say, &quot;Oh I know someone at some previous company who is really good at that, let me see if they would be willing to change jobs.&quot; That is why companies pay people bonuses for &quot;referrals.&quot;<p>I suspect it happens in LA in the entertainment industry as well. If you watch the old American television series &quot;ER&quot;[1]. Produced by Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Amblin Entertainment production company, it is amazing to see people who were on that show first as guest actors and then show up later in series.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;title&#x2F;tt0108757&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.imdb.com&#x2F;title&#x2F;tt0108757&#x2F;</a>')
