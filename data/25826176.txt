Item(by='bonoboTP', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611001441, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25825458, text='Yes, in practice this interview style now achieves exactly the opposite goal that it was created for. That is, originally people wanted to base hiring on general problem solving skill, mapping out a problem domain with relevant questions, proposing solutions, identifying tradeoffs, reacting to a change in problem statement, etc. based on a pure computer science foundation, independent of ever changing software frameworks, libraries, APIs etc. Precisely because memorizing the specific steps of creating a CRUD mobile app in today&#x27;s workflow is not useful later on. The problem is, Goodhart&#x27;s law kicked in and performance in such puzzles became the target to optimize for, so it stopped being a good measure, because now people have to explicitly study for it from books and online courses and practice sites and so now it measures more of the effort you&#x27;re willing to put in to jump hoops instead of actual problem solving aptitude.<p>An alternative could be to ask about a recent real-world project of the applicant, but that&#x27;s also easier to rehearse.')
