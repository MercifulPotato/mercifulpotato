Lord no. Does the MSM make mistakes? Absolutely. Is one side actively engaged in a war on truth? Yeah, kinda.<p>&gt; However I don&#x27;t think mistrust in the MSM is &quot;ideology&quot; associated with one party. Fox News is the MSM for many people and they&#x27;ve given us many reasons to distrust them.<p>I watch an awful lot of Fox, and let me assure you, they positioned themselves very much outside the mainstream media. They railed against the MSM non-stop for 4+ years by name. Unfortunately, they were hoisted by their own petard when they called Arizona for Biden. I was watching it live, and I nearly spat out my whiskey. They got hucked into the MSM bin by Trump supporters and left for dead on November 3, 2020, around 6PM PST.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;03&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;qanon-candidates-marjorie-taylor-greene.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;03&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;qanon-candida...</a>')
