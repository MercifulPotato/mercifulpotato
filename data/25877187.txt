There used to be a concept of &quot;scaling&quot; where you could roughly estimate that going from a 40nm process to a 28nm process, for example, would save you (28&#x2F;40)^2 percent power. Finfet disrupted that to some extent, but it partly held true as physical lengths actually continued to decrease with node names. By now, though, it is generally understood that state-of-the-art process node numbers doesn&#x27;t mean much in that regard.<p>I also just checked a handful of processes I have access to, and at least in these cases, the fin width doesn&#x27;t scale with the technology name (e.g. 5nm and 7nm has 8nm fin width drawn in layout, and model indicates 27nm &quot;width&quot; per fin). This isn&#x27;t much of a surprise to me, because foundries are just decreasing the number with newer generations of the tech, even if the lithography (the method by which features are etched into the silicon) hasn&#x27;t significantly changed. For example, 3 generations of a single process were called 7***, then 5***, then 4***.')
