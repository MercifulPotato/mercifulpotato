In particular, why the former (belief) would influence the latter (behavior)?<p>It&#x27;s not universally the case, to be sure. If you voice your belief that women are intellectually inferior, you will likely make them feel excluded. In general, there is a relationship between a person&#x27;s beliefs and behaviors which I regard as self-evident.<p>&gt; Edit: answer to your second question: I try to be inclusive, I don&#x27;t believe in drawing lines, at least not when it comes to belief (only behavior).<p>People tend to act in accordance with their beliefs. I don&#x27;t think I track your perspective. Do you really believe that, say, a person with white supremecist beliefs, again, as an extreme example, will generally act welcoming toward minorities? You seem to believe, well, as long as they don&#x27;t explicitly disrespect someone, it&#x27;s fine. But social behavior is a lot more subtle. People can tell if you hate them.')
