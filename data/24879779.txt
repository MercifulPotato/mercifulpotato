They barely understand the subjects themselves.<p>I cannot drop-out as it is close to impossible to get a job without a degree here. Reportedly, thousands of people apply for single job postings. Being without a degree among those applicants will mean Iâ€™m shooting myself in the foot.<p>Constantly having to attend these poor-quality classes and memorizing for exams takes away a lot from the time I could&#x27;ve spent learning programming and other paradigms of CS. I feel helpless and hopeless in this system and don&#x27;t see a way out.<p>I would like to hear advice from people who might have faced similar situations or work in the industry.<p>Also, thanks to the HN community. I have a learnt a lot from you people.')
