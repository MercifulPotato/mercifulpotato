It states that secular schools closed and the church &quot;filled the void&quot;. It states that infrastructure crumbled and wasn&#x27;t replaced like aqueducts. It states that documentation and writing decreased to the point that scholars can&#x27;t get a good view of what was happening.<p>“The idea that’s completely out of fashion these days is that it was dark because it was morally worse,” Ward-Perkins says. But these days, he notes with a touch of dark humor, “everybody pretty much accepts that humans are pretty horrid all the time.”')
