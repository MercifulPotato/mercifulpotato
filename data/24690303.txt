The downside is that sitting at stop lights made me sleepier, hence the alarms.<p>Avoiding highways was what saved me I think; a mistake at 20mph is far less expensive than a mistake at 80mph. But certainly you&#x27;re right; the obvious answer is to avoid driving or as another commenter said, carpool!')
