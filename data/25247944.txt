Some cities don&#x27;t have them, some do.  When I was last in the industry (over a decade ago) research had tended to show that after introduction of meters (usually with price rises) there was a reduction in per-household demand. But over the course of a few years this reduction vanished: households were back on their old water consumption trend.  Water wasn&#x27;t a big enough cost to matter either way.<p>(Commercial consumers have always been metered, so there isn&#x27;t a lot of evidence there. Those I looked at had good reasons for using as much water as they did.)<p>If producers have to absorb the tax, things will probably work out as you say. If they can pass it along without losing much demand, maybe not.')
