Mostly because a) I was concerned about how ready M1 would be for software development b) it had all the high-level features I wanted in a desktop c) I needed Windows&#x2F;Boot Camp support for various games&#x2F;software I wanted to run on it d) I needed a shiny new toy for quarantine coping.<p>I don&#x27;t regret it at all and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how these new iMacs perform, especially since they may or may not have dGPUs which would compare with AMD&#x27;s Navi.')
