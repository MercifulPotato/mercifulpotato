Since that is not the case, I can&#x27;t see how they can justify &#x27;cost of living&#x27; adjustments.<p>Quite apart from the fact that the cost-of-living indices are often wildly incomparable.  For example, sending your kids to a state school in Norway, vs for example Equatorial Guinea.<p>Obviously in the latter case, you actually need to send the kids to an often ludicrously expensive expat school to obtain even the same ball-park level of education, and so even though the cost of <i>just</i> living may be much lower, it is actually <i>more</i> expensive to maintain a comparable lifestyle.')
