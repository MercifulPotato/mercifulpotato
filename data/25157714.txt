Our SVP came to my boss and said basically “We bought Futurewave, we’re announcing it today, and we’re renaming FutureSplash to Shockwave Flash.  I need somebody to throw a quick animation together for the press gathering, and none of the creative services people are in the building yet.”<p>So I downloaded the tool and made this weird little animation with the Shockwave logo falling onto the FutureSplash name and crushing the “utureSp” letters.<p>After that, we shared a floor with the Flash team. Good people. Jonathan Gay is very smart.')
