But if you are settling down with kids, and don’t intend to move for 5 or more years, then having a stable home with a mortgage payment you can afford is a completely rational decision. There are significant tax benefits to owning a home, and after 5 years you don’t have to pay capital gains taxes on your first $200K (?) in gains from a sale, which is pretty huge.<p>If your primary goal is just to realize some ROI there’s plenty of other asset classes that are much more liquid than residential real estate.')
