A man is testifying in front of the Senate about the veracity of some of the claims under penalty of perjury...<p>EDIT: honestly, as a conservative who was supportive of the investigation surrounding impeachment, this kind of obvious media double treatment makes me want to double down -- as other conservatives have done -- in simply not supporting conservatives being investigated. It seems obvious that the allegations, the narrative, etc, is tightly controlled by the media, and conservatives are not given a fair shake, while even the most minute details of conservatives are examined in agonous detail (remember the Steele dossier, which is now confirmed Russian disinformation?). If the Hunter Biden allegations are true around the Ukraine prosecutor, then the impeachment was clearly punishing a sitting president for investigating corruption. That is shocking.')
