An industrialized genocide took place because my ancestors were diligent and hard-working. And I&#x27;d wager that a significant portion of modern-day hard workers is complicit in committing ecocide.<p>3) Besides, the way that you fetishize your ancestors&#x27; way of life I surely hope you&#x27;re not vaccinated against polio and tetanus. And heaven forbid, I hope you are not wearing contact lenses or glasses. Disregard the current levels of automation and manifold other advances, putting in the hard work in a competitive society and eventually dying of typhus is most definitely the way.')
