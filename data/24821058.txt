The implementation in the OP uses a more functional style, but that&#x27;s not the only way Rust is commonly written. I also did an implementation[0] (because I have nothing better to do) using more of an imperative style, which you may be more familiar with. Admittedly I did go a bit overkill on string normalization and avoiding allocations while doing so.<p>It also includes a test case which the OP&#x27;s implementation will get wrong because the order of the combining diacritics is different in both words. If you don&#x27;t normalize them you&#x27;ll get two different words.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;Measter&#x2F;e2e287ee21311d34ea8eb8cd9d5783be" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;Measter&#x2F;e2e287ee21311d34ea8eb8cd9d57...</a>')
