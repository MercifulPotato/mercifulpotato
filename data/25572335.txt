I have the same feelings, but restricted to depictions in my native language of people hurting each other in psychologically realistic ways.<p>I&#x27;m not bothered with any physical violence especially voiced with English dialogues. They somehow seem cartoonish to me.<p>But I pretty much have to avoid all Polish movies because they often use those really unpleasant themes.<p>They are made because they have audience. I have friends who love those movies and themes.<p>I tried to find out, what exactly appeals to them in those themes and best I could get out of them was that those brutal themes are somehow more &#x27;real&#x27;, that they expose how people &#x27;truly&#x27; are. And that somehow has a value for them.<p>Probably morbid fascination pays a part in this too.')
