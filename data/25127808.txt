Item(by='GordonS', descendants=None, kids=[25128120], score=None, time=1605638635, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25126597, text='&gt; Can we call it education though or is it an anti-intellectual spirit or a disdain for elitism and the idea of experts? Or perhaps mistrust of authority and experts?<p>I&#x27;m sure poor education accounts for a lot of it, but it can&#x27;t be the only factor - even here on HN (where I&#x27;d <i>assume</i> most posters are well educated) there are people claiming COVID is a non issue and&#x2F;or claiming masks are dangerous.<p>Another example are countries other than the US, such as the UK. In the beginning there were plenty  doubters (hardly surprising when you&#x27;ve got arguably the most powerful idiot in the world claiming it&#x27;s a <i>hoax</i>), but I see&#x2F;hear very little of that these days.<p>It could be a mistrust of authority, but a lot of people in the US seem quite happy to trust authority - as long as it&#x27;s the &quot;right&quot; authority.<p>For example, in the USA, you have Trump telling the most outrageous lies on a near-hourly basis, and <i>millions</i> believe him. On a similar vein you have ludicrous conspiracy theories like qanon, and even just plain conspiracies (without the &quot;theory&quot;!) about the Clinton&#x27;s eating babies! As I European, I might suppose that a lot of people in the US are batshit-insane, but there has to be a <i>reason</i> for all that lunacy.')
