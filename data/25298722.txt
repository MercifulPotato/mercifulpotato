Herd immunity is absolutely real, and can occur if a virus infects enough people (or enough people are vaccinated). When more people are immune, it will be harder for the virus to spread to a new host. When enough are immune, the virus dies out.<p>But since the death rate of COVID is so high, encouraging people to go outside and get infected in the name of achieving herd immunity (an approach often spread by the right wing) would likely cause millions of deaths, especially because the US has limited hospital capacity. This isn&#x27;t even mentioning that we don&#x27;t know the long-term effects of the hundreds of millions of others who would have recovered from COVID.<p>Herd immunity through vaccination will kill or harm very few people in comparison, given that only 1 in a million suffer side effects from vaccines on average.')
