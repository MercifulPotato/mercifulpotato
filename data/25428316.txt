Normally managers should listen very good when somebody explains how to save €0.5M.<p>But for this particular organization can’t be helped. We ship products assembled with duct tape and that’s ok. Every piece of the electronics looks to be done by a child during first ham radio course and that’s also ok. I am glad having job during these times and don’t take it seriously anymore after my burnout.')
