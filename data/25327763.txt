Middle management pushed some real bullshit with the max.&quot;<p>So how are these two things squared? I&#x27;d say clearly Boeing has other interests which compete with safety, like profit. The difference between &quot;appears safe&quot; and &quot;is safe&quot; can be profitably &quot;arbitraged&quot;, until you mess up and get caught.<p>It doesn&#x27;t seem their very very very vested interest in making sure aviation is safe was sufficient to replace outside supervision after all.')
