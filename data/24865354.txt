He sought to restrict someone else&#x27;s freedom and dealt with the social consequences of that action. He didn&#x27;t just express an opinion, he sought to force that opinion on others. Your argument that I&#x27;m anti democratic is disingenuous at best.<p>While I agree with the <i>sentiment</i> that all humans should be allowed to love whom and in the way they see fit and vehemently disagree with Eich&#x27;s personal views, I can&#x27;t agree with your assessment that he &quot;forced&quot; anyone to do anything.<p>He took part in a political process.  That he was on the side that you (and I, for that matter) disagree with, doesn&#x27;t invalidate his right to do so.<p>His side was (and rightly so, in my view) smacked down.<p>However, I take serious umbrage to your characterization that I&#x27;m wrapping anything in the flag, or that claiming that <i>everyone</i> should be allowed to exercise their political franchise (which you <i>appear</i> to reject) is disingenuous.<p>I believe that individuals voting their conscience in free and fair elections is the heart of democracy.<p>Unless I misunderstand your position (which is certainly possible), you appear to claim that other citizens (in this case, Eich) should not have the <i>right</i> to vote their conscience if you (or I, for that matter) disagree with their position.<p>What, exactly, is disingenuous about that?')
