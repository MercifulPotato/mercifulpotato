Why shouldn&#x27;t it? Foreigners are also at an advantage when it comes to finding a not necessarily long-term partner. I am slightly bitter about it though. I moved into a flat as a non-Erasmus person that later turned out to be the local Erasmus party destination during a period when I was much less into partying and more into studying. No partners were found from that pool.<p>I do remember having a lot of political discussions with them, though.')
