No one will baby-sit your saving, you are responsible for what you put your money into to. The people who lose big were just making the market less efficient, and so will be removed from the market.<p>EDIT: To be clear, I&#x27;m not a &quot;free market fundamentalist&quot;. I don&#x27;t think that efficient markets are or should be an end in itself. But if the idea that the market is hard to beat because the weak participants get eliminated has any truth to it at all, this is it.')
