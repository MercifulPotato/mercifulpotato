Years worth of important documents, records, photos, etc... could be gone, because the user&#x27;s finger slipped and pressed CTRL+X, rather than CTRL+C.<p>Whether or not the operating system should be protecting users in this manner is fully debatable and a matter of opinion, but Apple&#x27;s approach here is definitely safer (at the cost of being a bit more annoying)')
