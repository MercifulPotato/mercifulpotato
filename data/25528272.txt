That &quot;No Time for Caution&quot; sequence is the exact point in time that I granted Christopher Nolan apotheosis. Doesn&#x27;t hurt that I&#x27;m a bit of a space geek too. It&#x27;s as if Interstellar was made with marketing crosshairs aimed at me.<p>However, I think it&#x27;s still in that &quot;only time will tell&quot; phase. Like Cameron&#x27;s Avatar---mindblowing during it&#x27;s time and for a few years after but now just mostly remembered for the implications of Na&#x27;vi anatomy and the lazily named unobtanium---Interstellar might yet be remembered more for the cheesy bits than its storytelling.<p>I still have very high hopes for it though! But I&#x27;m giving it maybe five more years, at least a decade. Fingers crossed!')
