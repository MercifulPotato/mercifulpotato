Item(by='watermelon59', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608443454, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25483007, text='I think it&#x27;s sad that the vast majority of people in our field (at least in my experience) is <i>so</i> damn excited about building new stuff all the time. There&#x27;s no appreciation for maintaining, optimizing, and improving existing systems. There&#x27;s only talk of &quot;adding value&quot; but very little of &quot;keeping value.&quot;<p>So people keep moving on to the next project, leaving the old ones running live but to rot, and at best every once in a while someone will be assigned the dreadful task of having to figure out why the &quot;legacy&quot; (even though it&#x27;s still fully in operation and servicing customers) system had an outage and can&#x27;t recover.<p>Our field suffers from a serious lack of focus. People don&#x27;t learn to work under constraints. Instead, they prefer to build a whole new thing, full of complexity and hidden issues, just to get around a few nuisances that, with the right mindset, actually force one to be creative (which should make work fun).<p>I&#x27;ve recently commented here on HN about how I feel like I&#x27;m outside the norm on these things [0]. I was happy to learn I&#x27;m not alone. I do think those of us who don&#x27;t mind working on &quot;legacy&quot; systems and perhaps with limited tools are the minority though.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s not even about working on old systems. You work with current tech, build something, and as soon as it&#x27;s barely deployable, you&#x27;re expected to move on to the next thing. &quot;It&#x27;s a great opportunity for your career,&quot; they say, &quot;you&#x27;re gonna get to build something new and make key decisions.&quot;<p>Why does it have to be decided for me? It&#x27;s my current predicament. I&#x27;m working on a project that took me two months to get in the right mindset for and get all the context I needed. I had to try things out, sort out ideas, until I got a clear picture of what to build. Now I&#x27;ve built the first iteration of it. It works, and I&#x27;m super excited about it. But it&#x27;s not done by any means. It needs more features. It needs to be polished so it doesn&#x27;t make operations miserable running the thing. And yet... I have to move on, and hand it over to someone who doesn&#x27;t have the same excitement for it that I have, and has maybe 10% of the context.<p>All because building new things (and adopting The New Hotness, as you say) is what &quot;everyone&quot; wants.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25404039" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25404039</a>')
