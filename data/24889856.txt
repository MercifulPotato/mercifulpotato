And if in fact this was a forum to discuss ideas, with pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s, I might agree. But this is simply giving a platform to a terrorist, there is no intellectual discussion going on here.<p>The way you wrote &quot;discussing Mein Kampf&quot;, you are implying they would actually be discussing it. But that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s going on here.<p>It&#x27;s kind of like a reverse strawman - you changed the event into a much less controversial one, and then told people they should criticize zoom for blocking it. But zoom didn&#x27;t block your strawman, they blocked an actual terrorist.')
