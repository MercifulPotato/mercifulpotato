(Their statistics for China are from 2014. The paper was published in 2015.)<p>Chinese orthography is just as standardized as Japanese and hanzi&#x2F;pinyin dictionaries are not harder to maintain than kanji&#x2F;hiragana ones. Some people have trouble with sound distinctions in Standard Mandarin that don&#x27;t exist in their speech and enter incorrect pinyin (e.g. z instead of j or zh), but that can be treated as a typo, the same as phonetic misspellings in other languages.<p>Support for dialectal variations is essentially nonexistent in mainstream IMEs. People who want to use varieties other than Standard Mandarin would have to use shape-based input (including methods that decompose each character into smaller parts, like Cangjie) or send a voice message. (There are projects to create IMEs for other Sinitic languages, like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hanhngiox.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hanhngiox.net&#x2F;</a> but almost nobody uses them.)<p>(Do any Japanese IMEs support non-standard dialects or even other Japonic languages?)')
