Item(by='DeRock', descendants=None, kids=[25297240], score=None, time=1607030962, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25294766, text='&gt; Putting a pet in the luggage compartment is not acceptable, and airlines basically don&#x27;t give you any other option<p>Well, whats your suggestion then? If there was a better option, it feels like the airlines would have taken advantage of that opportunity. My guess is that the alternatives are too logistically&#x2F;operationally expensive, and the pet owners aren&#x27;t willing to bear that cost.<p>&gt; Airlines have options to support people traveling with infants and small children<p>I see a lot of this sentiment in the comments, comparing infants and pets. One is essential to the continuation of our species. The other is a comfort, choice and privilege. It makes sense that our willingness to accept and subsidize is completely different between the two. You don&#x27;t get a dependent tax deduction either, just because you have a dog.')
