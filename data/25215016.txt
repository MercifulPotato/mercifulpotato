It really isn’t unreasonable that you wouldn’t have heard of this guy if you are some combination of an American, not a sports fan, and in your thirties or younger.  However in his day he was considered one of the two best players all time in the most popular sport in the world.  That resulted in a fame that far exceeded the world of sport.  He also basked in the life of celebrity that ended up compounding his renown even further. He was probably at one point one of the 10 most famous people on the planet.
