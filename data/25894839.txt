The sad reality is a lot of small-scale local retail just wasn&#x27;t very good. High prices, lousy selection.<p>It will be interesting to see what shopping patterns stay in place post-pandemic. On the one hand, even I who already shopped a lot online, have switched even more to Amazon rather than taking a run to the store for something I don&#x27;t actually need <i>right now</i>. On the other hand, I was picking something up at an Apple Store a few days ago (for reasons) and it was a little bit surprising to me that the shopping mall was actually pretty busy.')
