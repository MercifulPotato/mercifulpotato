To compare, the typical tests measure the presence of virus RNA starting with many millions in the sample and the tests do detect asymptomatic persons -- those who don&#x27;t get sick now.<p>&gt; superficial infections in the vaccinated don&#x27;t recur often<p>From the studies of other coronaviruses it is known that infections do recur.<p>And finally, we even know that even some percentage of people who get the vaccine become the disease later and are observably sick -- that&#x27;s the difference to 100 to efficacy percentage (e.g. 5 of 100 who received the vaccine, or every 20th, if the efficacy is 95%).<p>And we can also expect <i>effectiveness</i> (protection of the vaccine in the real world) to be lower than efficacy (reported from trials).<p>In short, for all we know at the moment, the life will continue to be hard for those who don&#x27;t get the vaccine and those whose immune system can&#x27;t respond to the vaccine.')
