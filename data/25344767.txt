If only this happened: the gov says &quot;We choose to do no lockdowns, and just have a list of suggestions.  No need to follow them. Do your normal activities&quot; and the response: &quot;You can&#x27;t tell me what to do!  Screw you!  I&#x27;m going to wear masks AND distance, esp among vulnerable populations! Do my normal activities my foot! So there, suck it!&quot;.<p>Reverse psychology always seems to work better in marketing, and low budget movies and sitcoms.')
