That&#x27;s not the hard part. The hard part is getting people to trust it, exchanges to carry it, and most importantly figuring out a way to distribute it fairly after creation.  All these things together make it extremely difficult to create a new coin that people will jump to. Case in point - zillions of altcoins have existed for years while most value is still stored in the top 10 coins.')
