Why is this a revelation? I would think that this is business 101. It seems to me that all of the best companies have leaders that know their products inside out and are personally invested in said product (Jobs, Musk, Chesky, Mckinnon, Collisons).<p>I&#x27;m still shocked to hear of tech CEO&#x27;s of massive companies who have never used or installed the products they sell.')
