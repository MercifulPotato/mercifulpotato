Now we can write whatever is on our mind in the search box, even with typos, and 95% of the time, we get exactly what we are looking for. We like to complain about the remaining 5%, but in the late 90s it was the norm.<p>- The web was simply smaller, there was less information. Wikipedia didn&#x27;t exist for instance.<p>- Ads, terrible design and annoyances have always been a thing.
