This means:<p>1. Consent must be separate from other terms being agreed to. So consent in the EULA would not be valid.<p>2. Consent must be an affirmative, unambiguous action. Pre-ticked boxes or bundled consent are not valid.<p>3. Consent can be revoked at any time. Revoking consent must be as easy as giving it.<p>So yes, you can ask for it from a user when you&#x27;re having them agree to the EULA. However you can&#x27;t have it as <i>part</i> of the EULA, it has to be an optional add-on. And you still need to let people turn it off afterwards.')
