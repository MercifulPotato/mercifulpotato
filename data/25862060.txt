DNA is many orders of magnitude more finely adapted and complex than computers, and to boot does much more with 6GB than our best coders.  It is just inconceivable that random mutation and natural selection can do this.  Just try your hand at a genetic algorithm to see just how incapable they are.<p>Anyways, just because we don&#x27;t have a good explanation is no reason to substitute an obviously false explanation.  That would be just as bad as creationists saying God did it, since both shut down looking for better ideas.')
