It amazes me how Israel still manages to play the victim card in the western world.<p>Of course there were fewer Israeli casualties. Israel took the fight to Hamas for the express purpose of protecting Israeli lives. Safeguarding their own citizenry is the primary objective of any nationâ€™s military, and Israel did that by fighting Hamas on their home turf (as opposed to inviting Hamas to fight inside Israel).')
