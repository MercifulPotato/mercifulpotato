Is it possible? Sure, lots of things are possible... I wouldn&#x27;t bet on them<p>Another good reason to assume this wouldn&#x27;t happen: the existing system will not let it.<p>You may argue that that is &quot;changing the rules&quot; or &quot;cheating&quot; or &quot;being on the institutions side!&quot;, and you&#x27;re right, but I would assume that the government forces all GME positions to be liquidated and halts all trading, no matter no many retail and&#x2F;or institutional traders get upset by it, before allowing <i>the collapse of the global financial system</i> (again).<p>No matter what game you&#x27;re playing, there are always &quot;superior&quot; rules, that are not written down. No matter what game you&#x27;re playing, one of the over-arching rules is &quot;no crippling the global financial system&quot;.')
