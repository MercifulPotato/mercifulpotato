If we stopped all mutation, we would stop evolution too. We would be stuck in local optima, never trying to find a better global optimum.<p>Not every new practice will work out. The bad ones will be weeded out by natural selection. But if we try to stop evolution by discouraging mutation, we will stagnate.')
