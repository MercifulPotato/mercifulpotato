Item(by='apta', descendants=None, kids=[24897022], score=None, time=1603723869, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24894856, text='&gt; That&#x27;s one of the major recognized selling points of Go.<p>It&#x27;s exactly just that, marketing fluff and hype made up by the golang team that is not backed up by actual evidence. Look up several other comments in this thread that mention exactly that. I&#x27;m not the only one challenging their false claim.<p>There were never any specific language features that make golang good for large projects. Quick compilation was touted at the beginning, but that went out the window when the golang compiler was rewritten in go. For large projects, it&#x27;s in the same ballpark as Java and C#, and in my experiences, even slower especially for incremental compilation due to the bottleneck of the linker. Secondly, its features work against scaling for large programs and teams (no generics, verbose and error-prone error handling, interfaces are poorly thought out and optimized for minority use cases at the cost of usability and correctness, etc.)')
