I’m surprised they are struggling as much as they are. Many don’t seem to be drawing on any departmental prior experience, or even taking simple training on stuff like how to run a Webex meeting. Some professors clearly know how to do it better and it makes a HUGE difference. So that’s a big issue with the current situation. Some profs are doing a stellar job this semester, others are doing a  completely awful job.\n- for me, face time with fellow students is really helpful for learning, more so than face time with coworkers being helpful to work. However, in lectures you don’t get that much time to interact with other students anyway, so to me it’s not worth the time of getting to campus')
