If there is no personal accountability then some people won&#x27;t learn their lesson. I saw one only one name of the people responsible for this, Samuel Rotrosen, Montrose&#x27;s president at the time.<p>And Samuel Rotrosen was only mentioned once, buried deep down many paragraphs in.<p>So much so that in all the comments here, I am the only one to mention the name of the person who seems ultimately responsible for this, Samuel Rotrosen.')
