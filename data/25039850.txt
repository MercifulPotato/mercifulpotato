When I report a bug or file a feature request, it seems to me that you would say I am asking the author to do some unpaid labor. That is, I am asking them to fix the bug or to add my feature. A bug report is requesting a fix to previous changes, yes, but isn&#x27;t it still, in your view, a request for something in exchange for nothing?  If you fix a bug for me, &quot;you pay a hefty cost in time while my cost remains 0&quot;, no?')
