The delta between the average US salary and the average EU salary is gigantic, and if invested in a conservative investment portfolio consisting of index funds means by choosing to live in the EU you&#x27;re willingly giving up many millions of dollars by time you&#x27;re in retirement.<p>When I&#x27;m retired, I don&#x27;t want to be broke and penniless and I certainly wouldn&#x27;t be thinking that the free healthcare I received was worth the amount I was scammed.<p>On what planet is healthcare worth many millions of dollars? It&#x27;s not worth it. You&#x27;re better off by any calculation in the US. Substantially so.<p>51k when you&#x27;re doing the same stuff that someone in the US is making 175k for? You&#x27;re being robbed in broad daylight.<p>To put it another way, consider that a senior level developer in Sweden makes substantially less than a fresh grad in the US.')
