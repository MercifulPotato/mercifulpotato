(Mapbox v1 and v2 are graphics card enhanced mapping libraries?).<p>The author of the article&#x27;s thesis is that this is &quot;an end of an era&quot; of Open Core business models (putting core technology under a free&#x2F;libre licensing and charging for extra proprietary features).<p>I&#x27;m very curious as to what other people here on HN have to say about it. Gitlab, a prominent company that follows an Open Core model, is a YCombinator alum, no?')
