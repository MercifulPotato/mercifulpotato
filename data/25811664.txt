I hear the &quot;bigger fish to fry&quot; sentiment often. The point about distributed data races is a good one.<p>At one point I did a comparison between a mono&#x2F;Nancy web service and the same web service, feature for feature, built in NodeJS, Rust&#x2F;rocket, and Go. I built a few different endpoints that did different types of work and load tested them, profiled memory usage, etc. I know mono and perhaps Nancy weren&#x27;t the best point of comparison, and it&#x27;s been some time since, but Rust&#x2F;rocket really impressed me then, including on axes like ease of development and code readability. The perf deltas I saw could matter quite a bit at scale, allowing for fewer&#x2F;cheaper servers.<p>I&#x27;ve enjoyed using Rust for a few things since, personally, and am so far pretty unbothered by its shortcomings.')
