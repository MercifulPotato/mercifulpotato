It takes <i>less time</i> to fix something yourself with a standard screw driver and inexpensive commodity parts than to travel to the manufacturer&#x27;s facility and prove to their satisfaction that it&#x27;s broken so they&#x27;ll replace the entire product.<p>What you really want is products that work like legos, so that no individual piece costs more than $25 and anybody can replace what&#x27;s broken in five seconds without expert knowledge or specialized tools. To minimize labor costs.')
