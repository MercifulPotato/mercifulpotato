Facebook’s registration and authentication does the same. You publish at their pleasure.<p>In marsh, the equivalent would be a velvet rope around the sidewalk where only approved and registered people could enter, view and express their opinions. Facebook is emphatically not the public sphere, as much as y’all want it to be: it is allowed exclusion of anyone according to its own choosing. That it can ban someone and delete their account makes Facebook not a public sphere.<p>Same as my blog: your comment stays up if I want it to, no implication on the right to free speech.')
