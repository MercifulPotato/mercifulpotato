I even remember Bezos bragging about this being a core part of the company culture. Why do you trust Azure when Microsoft&#x27;s graveyard of non-Azure graveyards has long since overflowed?<p>For me, it&#x27;s because Amazon killing their failed phone, their failed Yahoo Answers clone, their failed search engine, or their failed paypal clone says nothing about their commitment to their phenomenally successful $45 billion &#x2F; year business with high margins and 29% growth.<p>Google Cloud is a $14 billion &#x2F; year business growing at 45% &#x2F; year. It is a smaller business than AWS, sure. But not by an order of magnitude. It&#x27;s basically 3.5 years behind Amazon on the growth curve. Were you afraid in 2017 that AWS would be killed due to being too small a business?')
