That was many years ago and now whenever I see something on the Monty Hall problem it seems so obvious as if I can no longer even see why people think its unintuitive. The reason its unintuitive is that people don&#x27;t really have experience with anything that works this way. I&#x27;m not sure that the linked explanation will be that helpful to people because of that, although it does make it plainly obvious that Monty Hall knows which door has the prize and he&#x27;s telegraphing to you which door it might be by only opening doors which don&#x27;t have it in there.
