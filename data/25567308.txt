We understand that it is caused by androgens (maybe DHT?) and affects follicles on certain parts of the head differently.<p>It&#x27;s not simple to address something like this. Either you have to replace the follicles (e.g. transplant surgery), or mess around with people&#x27;s androgens (right now, we can only do that pharmacologically). Drugs that affect people&#x27;s hormones have a tendency of having longer-lasting effects than those that affect neurotransmitters, which makes treating a cosmetic condition with them somewhat iffy from a &quot;first do no harm&quot; perspective.<p>Minoxidil (topical) and Finasteride (oral) are the two most reliable pharmaceuticals for pattern hair loss.<p>- We don&#x27;t actually understand how minoxidil works, but it probably stimulates blood flow to hair follicles that are going dormant, buying a little more time. It&#x27;s fairly safe side effects wise, but only addresses some forms of balding (top of head, smaller areas).<p>- Finasteride affects the production of DHT in men, which can halt or even reverse male pattern hair loss - but a very small subset of patients experience loss of sexual function as a side effect, which can be permanent. This makes it iffy to recommend to everyone without reservation.<p>The worst thing about both of these medications is that they have to be taken regularly, or else the hair loss will resume.<p>Until we more fine-tuned ways of tinkering with people&#x27;s hormones or editing their genes, I don&#x27;t think that we&#x27;ll have a truly consequence-free cure for hair loss. Medical technology is just not there yet.<p>...That said, you&#x27;re absolutely right that there&#x27;s a lot of money in selling people cures for hair loss. In fact, if you just take the two drugs I mentioned above, explain them to men on the internet in clear language, and charge a small premium (3x the price of generic) to sell it to them... Boom! You got yerself a startup that just raised a $47M Round B! <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keeps.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.keeps.com&#x2F;</a>')
