CFAA<p>If you live in the US, the CFAA is a very poorly worded law that can be abused by a company with over-eager lawyers.<p>Effectively, the law states that it&#x27;s a crime to &quot;exceed authorized access&quot; of computer systems.<p>It&#x27;s borderline, but it&#x27;s possible nissan could take anyone who downloads this data to court claiming that they were not authorized to access the data on the git server, and knowingly downloading that data constitutes a CFAA violation.<p>I don&#x27;t think it would stand up in court (other than the original hacker who guessed &#x27;admin&#x2F;admin&#x27;, which was def a CFAA violation), but I also don&#x27;t think most of us have enough money to spend on lawyers to defend ourselves.')
