However, I&#x27;ve encountered a few people who&#x27;ve gone from working as a new college grad or &quot;SDE1&quot; level hire to technical PM in only 2-3 years.  I&#x27;d describe myself as adaptable and slightly above average.  I am by no means a rock star engineer - but when crunch comes to crunch I can deliver.  I also suck at interviewing, so I honestly see leveraging my time at this startup (increasing salary) or building a strong network as being more worth my time than leetcoding.<p>I work hard and fortunately at the current startup I&#x27;m employed by I; A) still have a job post pandemic and B) own a piece of our codebase that many others have limited understanding of (specifically a service built with elixir phoenix).  Quarantine &#x2F; WFH has decimated my productivity, however I&#x27;ve still gotten some small incentive bonuses and raises.  However, my boss keeps pushing me to &quot;take more ownership&quot; and really wants me to grow faster.  I look at past co-workers who took little time to go from dev grunt to essential management staff and honestly draw a blank.  I have no clue how they did this.<p>Do any of you have experience growing quickly at a startup?  Or tips to really take advantage of being at a growth stage startup?<p>Thanks and best of luck to everyone out there like me who dislikes WFH.')
