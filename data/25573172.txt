(Lockdowns certainly weren&#x27;t seen as the only feasible strategy if you consider that the government waited through 3 months of growing case numbers before finally locking down a second time.)<p>They&#x27;re just additional measures that TÃ¼bingen has implemented earlier than the rest of Germany, e.g. handing out free FFP2 masks to the elderly in November instead of December.<p>The reason this is a bigger story in American media than in Germany is that the US government blundered worse than almost everyone else, so they&#x27;re looking for role models elsewhere.')
