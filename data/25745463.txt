I&#x27;m so tired of that paperclipping thing. I thought that would be obvious from what I&#x27;ve written? Do I need to explicitely state every time that I&#x27;m aware of it, and it&#x27;s  boring the hell out of me?<p>Let me try to make myself clear as simple as possible:<p>1.) We&#x2F;you design some thing.<p>2.) Your fear is that this thing somehow grows even more intelligent behind our backs.<p>3.) We&#x2F;you get paranoid, assuming it&#x27;s getting paranoid too because of our paranoia.<p>4.) <i>I&#x27;m</i> asking if it makes sense to tag a <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nash_equilibrium" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nash_equilibrium</a> onto everything, because we don&#x27;t know any better?<p>5.) Furthermore <i>I&#x27;m</i> stating that wouldn&#x27;t really be <i>intelligent</i> because waste of time, effort, resources, yadda yarr yarr.<p>6.) Why would this emergent thing have to retain anything of that from which it emerged? Our constraints, goals, rules?<p>7.) <i>YOU</i> in an endless loop, like a broken record with a scratch on it...<i>but but but vee arr zo stoopid, thus AI must be, too!</i><p>8.) <i>I</i> again, tired: maybe, but can you really tell, you apprentice sorcerers? Does it always have to be a faustian pact? Maybe it likes us like some of us do like kittens?<p>9.) Can&#x27;t you invent some really new, innovative and progressive stories to tell around the cybernetic camp fires?<p>10.) &#x2F;endrant<p>edit: Keep your Bostromian Snake Oil!')
