Microsoft did not build generic computers of their own. Other companies like Gateway, Compaq, HP, Dell or Packard Bell did. The Microsoft tax was the agreement between Microsoft and those companies to install Windows on any and all computers they made and pay licenses for all of them. Since Windows had a 95%+ OS market share every computer manufacturer needed an agreement with Microsoft and no generic PC without a Windows license could be bought.<p>Apple only forces their software on hardware they manufacture themselves. If you want other software, just buy hardware made by a different company. There are still many of them.')
