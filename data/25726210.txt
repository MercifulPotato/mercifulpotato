From my outside perspective i wonder if that&#x27;s not an effect of having too few different worldviews in only two tribes. If you have more smaller tribes you just have to learn to live withem because crushing all the others is not an option. Of course that doesn&#x27;t magically make all problems go away either. But i&#x27;m just not convinced yet that having different world views is actually the issue, vs a tribe (or two) becoming too dominant.')
