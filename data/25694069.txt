Item(by='niyrjczs', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610154285, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25691618, text='&gt;Why is easier to believe that Democrats have somehow coerced millions of immigrant (children) into voting democrat, and not the much simpler reasoning that immigrants vote democrat because republicans are quite openly anti-immigrant?<p>I&#x27;m not sure who or what you are arguing against. I haven&#x27;t seen anyone suggest immigrants were coerced in any way, or that they vote democrat for any reason other than preferring their policies.<p>&gt;The idea that democrats are somehow acting nefariously for adjusting their policy to meet the demands of the citizenry is sounds completely asinine?<p>The &quot;nefarious&quot; behavior alleged in this comment thread is bringing in immigrants because they know they&#x27;ll vote overwhelmingly democrat once they can vote (and same goes for their children, who would not have been born in the US if their parents had not been allowed in).')
