Then by the end of the week I&#x27;d have enough detentions to roll them into a single saturday detention, so I&#x27;d show up to school then and bring my laptop and code which looked like work so they&#x27;d let me do it. Then I got a job at Google where they&#x27;d let me show up late and I&#x27;d talk in the cafeteria about all the coding I did while in saturday detention and people would be like, oh holy crap that was you?!')
