That seems like a pretty big oversight. Lazy at best, negligent at worst.   \nNot everyone in the world has constant internet access, and it seems ridiculous to design an _operating system_ with that assumption.   \nI like to take an eBook reader to the park, for example. Prior to owning that device, I took a laptop when learning a new programming language. If that laptop had been running BigSur, I&#x27;d see all these same issues based on Apple&#x27;s un-thought-out &quot;design decisions&quot;.')
