Manually installing drivers from Nvidia&#x27;s website is actually a user experience <i>downgrade</i>, since Windows Update won&#x27;t touch graphics drivers you pull in yourself.<p>For the record: I ended up biting the bullet with Geforce Experience regardless, because of the other features they had on offer that were tied to the app. It left a bad taste in my mouth and I ultimately dropped Nvidia cards entirely for AMD. Switching to AMD in turn made dropping Windows easier! (<i>arch user btw</i>)')
