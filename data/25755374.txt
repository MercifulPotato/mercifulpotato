What you see in the Expense account will then reflect how much money you spent on Gas no matter which checking account you used. You can then compare this to what you budgeted for.<p>EDIT: Here’s the appropriate PTA page on how you can use these tools for budgeting, but these are just tools. The General Ledger can reflect as much or as little data as you want it to, and the quality of the reports they generate will be based off that.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ledger-cli.org&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;doc&#x2F;ledger3.html#Budgeting" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ledger-cli.org&#x2F;3.0&#x2F;doc&#x2F;ledger3.html#Budgeting</a>')
