They are two of the biggest social networks in the world, with billions of users. They effectively control a gigantic chunk of the entire market, in a way that is nowhere even remotely analogous to local gas stations.</i><p>I agree that this is a problem, and I think we need to break up Facebook and Twitter and Google and Amazon and all other large companies, because by their sheer size they distort the free market. But it&#x27;s worth being precise about what the problem is, lest we make it worse. The problem is not that these particular companies did something unique, and if we let other companies grow in their place they&#x27;ll do better. The problem is that <i>any</i> market that has companies of this size is distorted and does not function as we want it to function. Today it&#x27;s this problem. Tomorrow it&#x27;s something else. Are you going to subpoena Jack Dorsey every time the oligopoly makes an individual business decision that the ruling party doesn&#x27;t like?<p>There&#x27;s nothing functionally distinct between what Facebook and Twitter did and what two gas stations do all the time - the problem is scope. If we start looking for evidence of &quot;collusion,&quot; and it turns out (which I hope you admit is at least <i>possible</i>) that there was none because they did the same thing at the same time because of standard market mechanisms, what do we do at that point?<p>One of the common proposals - making Twitter and Facebook obligated to carry certain content - not only is a <i>practical</i> mess because it cements their oligopoly role and puts the government in charge of determining each new abuse, it also really ought to be a <i>philosophical</i> mess, abandoning any pretense of valuing the free market and valuing liberty.<p>(Another way of putting this might be, a &quot;free&quot; market without aggressive regulation to prevent anyone from &quot;winning&quot; too strongly will quickly cease to be free, and the &quot;free&quot; market as a tool works well in cases where the barrier to entry is low and the barrier to becoming a giant is high, like gas stations, and less well in cases where the barrier to entry is high and gaining control of the market makes it easier to lock others out ... like Standard Oil. It would be far more liberty-minded to say, once you grow to a certain size, that you must split the companies into smaller independent companies than to say that the government tells you how to run yourself.)')
