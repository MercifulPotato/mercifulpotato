It doesn&#x27;t mean that everyone&#x27;s opinion is equally valid, that&#x27;s why we have representative government and not (except in Switzerland) a system that works purely by plebiscites.<p>Switzerland is a special case because the country is small and wealthy with a mostly well educated population and their democratic tradition is a very old one, but in many other cases, moving to a more direct form of democracy can have significant downsides, see e.g. the Brexit vote.<p>And I&#x27;m not talking about suppressing anyone&#x27;s opinion here, that would certainly not be right. It&#x27;s more about how we as a society shouldn&#x27;t overemphasise loud people on social media.')
