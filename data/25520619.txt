Once more memory is dereferenced than the system has capacity for, the OOM-killer is activated. There&#x27;s no defensive stance possible, aside from setting overcommit to &quot;Type2&quot; (disabling the overcommit behavior of the Kernel).<p>But that&#x27;s somewhat non-standard, and possibly non-helpful, since some applications depend on overcommit.')
