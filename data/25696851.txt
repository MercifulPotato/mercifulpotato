Hey, sometimes I even like the decisions they make!<p>But no longer can anyone legitimately respond to “XYZ got kicked off this platform” with “then XYZ should build their own platform” because obviously we’ve seen many times over now that doesn’t actually work.<p>They just come after the new platform too.<p>So we are left with either admitting we’re ok with corporations censoring political speech, even though it’s illegal for governments to do that, or trying to figure out what the limits should be of corporate censorship of political speech that we can live with.<p>For what it’s worth, I think the key metric here to consider is the level of competition in the specific market where the censorship is occurring.<p>The problem is most of these markets are more like duopolies if not monopolies, and the limits on corporate censorship of political speech probably should be higher the closer you get to a monopoly.<p>Some censorship is of course essential. But back to the point, when we see censorship  that is objectionable to a reasonable number of people... “just build your own” isn’t a valid response.')
