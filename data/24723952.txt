Such a weapon requires less training, and the greater amount of wood makes it lighter and cheaper to manufacture.<p>The additional swing weight allowed Halberd users to regularly break shields and punch through armor. Length and swing-weight are key.<p>-------<p>Swords almost universally were status symbols. It was expensive to make a sword no matter what culture you&#x27;re in, so carrying a fancy sword indicated nobility.<p>Smaller weapons (and smaller shields) like swords were for status and every day situations. Bucklers &#x2F; Rapiers don&#x27;t make any sense as a battlefield weapon. But when you consider the day-to-day life, walking around a city... the smaller blade and smaller shield suddenly make sense.')
