I was working on the Executive Compensation team at the time, but running a music blog called Indie Shuffle on the side. It&#x27;s a long time ago, but I seem to recall na√Øvly hoping they&#x27;d embrace me with arms wide open and invite me to join their team + revamp their strategy.<p>I met with a couple members of their team who were open to entertaining me given my background with a music blog. I remember being really excited about it - and I spent a <i>lot</i> of time preparing a deck about how exposure provided by the Google Music blog could be used as leverage to give the platform legitimacy in the eyes of independent artists (something that SoundCloud was doing really well at the time).<p>A few senior leaders agreed to let me pitch my ideas, and after a fair bit of head-nodding, nothing actually happened.<p>I ended up leaving Google about 3 months later to take my music blog full-time (still up and running at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indieshuffle.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indieshuffle.com</a>, and eventually started a much-more successful music venture called SubmitHub - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.submithub.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.submithub.com</a>). I count myself fortunate to say I have no regrets leaving Google.<p>Reflecting on the idea of 20% projects, I do appreciate that my managers gave me the opportunity to explore alternate opportunities within the company, and that the Google Music team was receptive to me poking my head into their affairs. I think it holds a lot of potential when it comes to retaining top talent that&#x27;s at risk of jumping ship for something different, and made me feel like I was part of the larger company rather than simply stuck in a silo.')
