Parler say they will look at the post that constitute actual threats but have a policy of not removing content like the post that&#x27;s just a long, content free screed of racial abuse. That alone can easily be considered violation of Amazon&#x27;s conveniently broad AUP.<p>Amazon appear not to have chosen to terminate or threaten to at the time, presumably on the basis they were getting plenty of money and relatively little grief for hosting them, but it puts a very different perspective on the idea that Parler was caught completely by surprise, and would have cleaned up everything they could if only they&#x27;d had more time and resources.')
