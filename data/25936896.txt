Absolutely.<p>Are there times where asking my roommate to do my homework would have been more efficient? Absolutely.<p>Now what about if you encounter a similar (but not exact) problem in the future? Do you have the skills to figure it out now or do you still need to ask?<p>In both cases, when you view the time to work through a problem as wasted, you&#x27;re failing to invest in your future. Take the 30 minutes to read the documentation and understand it, everything is not a sprint to &quot;make it work&quot;.<p>What if you don&#x27;t have a solution after 30 minutes? Take another 30 and write down your problem. If you can&#x27;t clearly explain your problem in plain language (including background, code snippets, links, screenshots as needed), you probably should - as a matter of courtesy prior to bringing anyone into a surprise debugging session.')
