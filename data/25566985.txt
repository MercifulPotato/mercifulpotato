At $1m saved, you can comfortably withdraw 3%&#x2F;year forever. $30,000&#x2F;year stipend on top of whatever passion thing makes you money is more than enough to live a modest life almost anywhere in the world. You won’t be eating at Michelin star places and you won’t have a palace, but you can comfortably live a decent quiet life in an out of the way place with a tiny rental, home cooked food, and maybe a cat. Want to be a tour guide in Iceland? All the other tour guides are surviving without that $30k stipend. Want to plant trees and sell homemade pots on Etsy? Same deal.<p>If you save to $2m, then that’s $60,000&#x2F;year, already you are beating the median American <i>family</i>. This is the point where, for me, I had to make peace with the fact that I wasn’t working like a dog to survive. I was doing it to have more stuff.<p>If you graduate college at 22 making $200k&#x2F;year and never get a raise; $1m by 30 should be no sweat.<p>So now that we’ve disposed of engineers, finance folks, and a few other white collar disciplines, what about everybody else?
