I value democracy, reason, liberty and equality above all else. I have good reasons to do so, one of which is that its proved itself historically to create some of the most peaceful and prosperous societies. But I also have phylosophical reasons for it, such as believing that individually we&#x27;re better off working collaboratively on equal footing with others, than in a constant battle of the fittest for supremacy. And as I brought up the individual, I believe that individual rights are very important to stability, and should be respected even against a majority, for the betterment of each individual and society as a whole.<p>I don&#x27;t believe anyone is of lesser worth and value than me, that would go against liberal values to do so. It&#x27;s quite the contrary in fact, I&#x27;m strongly against anyone who&#x27;d try to suggest A is lesser than B narratives, or A is more deserving than B narratives.<p>Now being against someone doesn&#x27;t mean I believe they are lesser, but simply that they are a liability to what I value, thus a risk towards democracy, reason, liberty and equality. And I am prepared to hope to change their minds, or go to war for it, if it came to that. It would be quite unamerican not too:<p>&quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness&quot; - United States Declaration of Independence<p>Edit: And just so there&#x27;s no misunderstanding, I&#x27;m not talking about democrats or republicans. I&#x27;m talking about liberalism and democracy. I don&#x27;t have any issue with any political party who&#x27;d simply disagree on how best to uphold liberalism and democracy in practice. But I will have issue with one who tries to destroy democracy, take away my liberty, increase inequality, and employ illogical and irrational justifications and strategies. And I&#x27;m not saying the republican party is trying to do so, but it&#x27;s never been less clear to me if they are or not then now.')
