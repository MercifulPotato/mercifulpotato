This is not a serious issue. I think it is unfortunate that you can&#x27;t use a built-in function to map over a Map, but this isn&#x27;t what the article is saying.<p>4.

TypeScript version 3 could outright ban this action and it would be totally &quot;fine&quot; (modulo migration pains in existing codebases). Fixing this wouldn&#x27;t affect backwards compatibility with the emitted Javascript at all.')
