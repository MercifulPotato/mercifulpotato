The outcome of a large number of cases can be predicted based upon the composition of the panel.<p>So where &quot;conservative&quot; judges make up 2&#x2F;3 or 3&#x2F;3 of the panel, you tend to see &quot;conservative&quot; (read: pro-business, pro-prosecution) outcomes and vice-versa with &quot;liberal&quot; judges.<p>It could be coincidence, but as someone who has followed circuit opinions for years, the panel composition has corresponded with the ultimate outcome a surprising number of times. (N.B. it would be interesting to statistically track the panel composition&#x2F;outcome metric to see how often the correlation actually exists).')
