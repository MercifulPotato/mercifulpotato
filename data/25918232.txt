Not to mention that driving infractions are basically a racket - it costs more to defend your innocence than to just pay the fine. In some states the magistrates hearing the cases aren&#x27;t even members of the bar and lack basic understanding of legal principles.<p>They&#x27;ve used library records to see if people have checked out books containing specific information when doing investigations, I think without a warrant. I think I&#x27;ve heard of people accumulating massive late fees multiple times the cost of a replacement book without adequate notification.<p>In both examples, you are paying for a privilege. Should people need to pay to exercise their rights, like freedom of speech? We do tax some rights already, so I guess we could tax people to express their ideas online too. I also think the control of people&#x27;s speech is more politically valuable than controlling access to libraries or drivers licenses.')
