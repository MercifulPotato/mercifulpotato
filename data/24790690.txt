But this article from the cbc with commentary from two legal experts isn’t completely reassuring:<p>&gt; Does the bill legislate the use of certain language? And could someone go to jail for using the wrong pronoun?<p>&gt;In the Criminal Code, which does not reference pronouns, Cossman says misusing pronouns alone would not constitute a criminal act.\n&gt;“The misuse of gender pronouns, without more, cannot rise to the level of a crime,” she says. “It cannot rise to the level of advocating genocide, inciting hatred, hate speech or hate crimes … (it) simply cannot meet the threshold.”<p>&gt;The Canadian Human Rights Act does not mention pronouns either. The act protects certain groups from discrimination.<p>&gt;“Would it cover the accidental misuse of a pronoun? I would say it’s very unlikely,” Cossman says. “Would it cover a situation where an individual repeatedly, consistently refuses to use a person’s chosen pronoun? It might.”<p>&gt;If someone refused to use a preferred pronoun — and it was determined to constitute discrimination or harassment — could that potentially result in jail time?<p>&gt;It is possible, Brown says, through a process that would start with a complaint and progress to a proceeding before a human rights tribunal. If the tribunal rules that harassment or discrimination took place, there would typically be an order for monetary and non-monetary remedies. A non-monetary remedy may include sensitivity training, issuing an apology, or even a publication ban, he says.<p>&gt;If the person refused to comply with the tribunal&#x27;s order, this would result in a contempt proceeding being sent to the Divisional or Federal Court, Brown says. The court could then potentially send a person to jail “until they purge the contempt,” he says.<p>&gt;“It could happen,” Brown says. “Is it likely to happen? I don’t think so. But, my opinion on whether or not that&#x27;s likely has a lot to do with the particular case that you&#x27;re looking at.”<p>&gt;“The path to prison is not straightforward. It’s not easy. But, it’s there. It’s been used before in breach of tribunal orders.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbc.ca&#x2F;cbcdocspov&#x2F;features&#x2F;canadas-gender-identity-rights-bill-c-16-explained" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbc.ca&#x2F;cbcdocspov&#x2F;features&#x2F;canadas-gender-identi...</a><p>[EDIT: added link]')
