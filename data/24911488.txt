Item(by='FlantasticSea', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603830496, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24910304, text='Ah, appreciate the response!<p>Another suggestion is to gray out the &#x27;Start Review&#x27; button if there&#x27;s nothing to review. I couldn&#x27;t figure out if my test cards were made correctly when it kept saying &#x27;Review Completed!&#x27;<p>I now assume the reason was that the algorithm (?) doesn&#x27;t have you review cards until a certain amount of time was passed so that screen just indicates there&#x27;s nothing left to review.<p>I&#x27;d also suggest a way to test the features before creating an account. Perhaps let someone upload and edit a document and only save it once they&#x27;ve created an account.')
