(and have a childhood dream of being a professor)<p>I met one person at my Master&#x27;s degree lab who went on to PhD, he said his childhood dream was to be a professor (and his father was a professor). I also have a father that is a professor (and have been very curious about PhD - although that window is getting narrower as I&#x27;m getting closer to 30:s) but he have multiple times told me that &quot;it&#x27;s not worth it&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s a waste of time, the opportunity cost lost is too high&quot;, yet in my field I often see job post that requires a PhD, so I get mixed signals.')
