My performance issues are almost never related to ruby. It&#x27;s nearly 100% of the time some complex database query that needs to get indexed&#x2F;cached.<p>If coders write their backend in rust for &quot;the ultimate performance&quot;, and it&#x27;s shipping 20MB of javascript to query a poorly designed, poorly indexed database with no caching, they&#x27;re going to get far worse performance than a ruby app querying a properly designed, cached database with indexing that doesn&#x27;t have to spend 5 seconds domming the user&#x27;s DOM first. Performance is a holistic problem, and anecdotally, web sites felt a lot faster during the rails era than they do right now during the JS era.')
