Unsexy details like language simplicity, what-you-read-is-what-runs, orders of magnitude faster compile times, effortless cross compilation and C interoperability.<p>I have never seen anyone focusing so ruthlessly, so early, on nitty-gritty details of how to go about engineering a compiler and language that is and will let you be as close to optimal as possible in terms of compile-time and run-time performance. &quot;Perfect software&quot; as Andrew talks about.<p>In short, engineering choices taken early will let Zig be something that Rust maybe could approach too (in theory), but in practice never will. Of course Rust is something that Zig will never be, too.')
