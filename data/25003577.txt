And (before the covid mess) the traffic was already not great. So if we ever get back to in-person office working, and after Google sets up their new office in SJ and others will consider doing the same it probably is going to suck big time. But if it will be &quot;mostly remote&quot; setup then SJ has plenty of space and opportunity to accommodate more business.')
