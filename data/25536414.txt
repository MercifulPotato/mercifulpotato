When &quot;X does Y&quot;, you don&#x27;t usually need to learn about it within 60 minutes. You usually need to understand &quot;What are the implications of this? Is Y really necessary? What is the motivation driving X?&quot;. I can recommend subscribing to the paper version of The Economist, you will see that the &quot;breaking&quot; news section is usually just 2 pages long (&quot;The world this week&quot; in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;weeklyedition&#x2F;2020-12-05" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.economist.com&#x2F;weeklyedition&#x2F;2020-12-05</a>). The rest is mostly analysis (of the current events) and opinion.')
