You abstract out possibly too much.<p>Finally, you get to a phase where you realize a lot of abstractions that you&#x27;ve created aren&#x27;t actually used and you&#x27;re writing more &quot;meta code&quot; than you need. In this phase you learn to engineer just enough for what you need at the time and design things to be easily changed in the future. You trust that even if you&#x27;re system design can&#x27;t handle everything right now, you&#x27;ve designed options for yourself to expand as needed.')
