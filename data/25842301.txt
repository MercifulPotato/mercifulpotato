Where do you live? I spent a couple of months over the summer in Texas (in a non liberal part) and there were like a grand total of 2 people who took any of it seriously. I think its evident based on what happened here that the majority didn&#x27;t really care, but even if you happen to be right, we don&#x27;t need a majority, we need 100%. Just go back to early February 2020 and remember that timeline. It only took 1-2 people, then there were 10, then 100, etc. It&#x27;s exponential.<p>I think your only bet here with a majority (let&#x27;s conservatively say 60% of people in agreeance with the severity of the virus) is to stop all international&#x2F;domestic travel completely for a few months. Stop all flights, no interstate travel. Nothing at all, a complete military lockdown. That is the absolute only way to have stopped the spread, akin to what China did. And I simply don&#x27;t buy that the USA in 2020 would do that without anything short of a revolt.')
