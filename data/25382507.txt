You&#x27;d presumably need multiple charge ports and possibly multiple chargers (by which I mean the AC-to-DC or DC-to-DC converter built into the car) and for them to tolerate being connected in parallel with each other.<p>Just to be clear, you&#x27;d ordinarily have the cells themselves in series or a bunch of parallel groups in series to reach high voltages, and as far as the charger is concerned it&#x27;s just one big battery with a single positive and a single negative terminal.<p>On the other hand, if you&#x27;re suggesting balance charging where you have an individual connection with the charger between each cell, that&#x27;s not really practical to do with large batteries because the current would be very high and the voltages very low, which, as far as cabling goes, is the worst-case scenario.  Charging a single cell at 100 amps and low voltage requires basically the same size cable as charging a bunch of cells in series at 100 amps and high voltage.  If you need a big, thick cable for each cell, that gets unwieldy very quickly.<p>Another unpractical option is to switch the battery into a single parallel group during charging and charge the whole group as if it was a single low-voltage high-amp-hour cell.  That&#x27;s unpractical for the same reason; low-voltage charging is an inefficient way to move energy around.  Also, switching from series to parallel would require a lot of high-current contactors (basically, electro-mechanical relays), which are kind of expensive.')
