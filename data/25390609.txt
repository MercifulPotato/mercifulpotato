That&#x27;s kind of the point.<p>&gt; Yes, there are urban schools which are underfunded and disproportionately affect minorities, but there are also rural schools in predominately white areas that are also underfunded.<p>You could presumably also find some instances of so-called &quot;white trash&quot; being disenfranchised by aggressive voter eligibility requirements.<p>&gt; So in my opinion, property tax funding of schools would fit more with the &quot;rich get richer&quot; paradigm.<p>All of racism fits into that paradigm. Racism is a system for causing poor black folks and poor white folks to fight against each other instead of fighting with each other against the systems oppressing both of them.')
