This also seems to imply that the &#x27;budget&#x27; of number of transistors for that CPU-part of the SoC is also comparable to previous Intel processors, not a significant increase. (Assuming 20% of the 16b transistors in M1 is CPU part, it would be 3-ish billion transistors, and the Intel does not seem to publish transistor counts but I believe it&#x27;s more than that for the Intel i9 chips in last year&#x27;s macbookspro)<p>Perhaps my estimates are wrong, but it seems that they aren&#x27;t throwing <i>more</i> hardware, but managing to achieve much more with the same &quot;amount of hardware&quot; because it is substantially different.')
