They couldn&#x27;t more different and were developed for dramatically different use cases.<p>The author of your beloved article compared M1 to Zen 3, and all Zen 3 CPUs use the same 8-core chiplet. From the cheapest 6-core Ryzen 3 5600 to the 64 core EPYC. All of them are made of the the exact same chiplets, just then number of chiplets varies. If you have 2 chiplet you get 16 cores, etc.<p>&gt; Yes, even the EPYC Rome only has 4 instruction decoders.<p>It doesn&#x27;t have &quot;4 decoders&quot;; it&#x27;s just one 4-way instruction decoder. It&#x27;s not the same thing.<p>&gt; Firestorm cores to essentially process twice as many instructions as AMD and Intel CPUs at the same clock frequency.<p>A decoder doesn&#x27;t not process instructions, it only interprets them and splits it up into smaller instructions. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to compare number of instructions across different ISAs anyway, ARM has smaller, simpler, and on account of that more numerous instructions. One x86-64 instruction more often than not maps to multiple ARM instructions. It just makes no sense  to compare counts.<p>I sort of stopped reading your comment around here, sorry about that.')
