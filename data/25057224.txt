He clearly had strong opinions, but he provided references for his assertions that his readers can look into for themselves. The more that we can &quot;hyperlink&quot; journalism to sources, the less an individual writer&#x27;s bias matters, I think.<p>By stark contrast, Bloomberg&#x27;s controversial piece on alleged Chinese spy hardware had no named sources and no references for readers to follow up on, and furthermore companies Bloomberg alleged to have been compromised all reported the allegations were false. The piece even featured an artist&#x27;s idea of what the hardware might look like, not an image of an actual device, and the only way to know it was an artist&#x27;s rendition was to read the fine print under the picture.<p>I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s any way to know the truth, but the article should not have been published, in my opinion, without some way for readers to dig further into the available facts independently of Bloomberg&#x27;s reporting.')
