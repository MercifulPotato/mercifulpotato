It seems highly unlikely that this year&#x27;s design and last year&#x27;s design really both needed exactly the same cooling system - they have totally different thermal characteristics.   A redesigned thermal system could have been smaller and lighter, leaving more space for a bigger battery or any other new feature.<p>The plastic spacers in some iPhone models show the same...  Was there really no better use for that space, from a company who traditionally would pay big bucks to make a chip 1mm smaller?')
