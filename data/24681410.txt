As a native catalan and spanish speaker, there are times where that &quot;fancy&quot; word is easier to come up with than the &quot;standard&quot; one (because &quot;fancy&quot; english words tend to be those that come from latin).<p>Your &quot;ameliorate&quot; example is a good one. In catalan, &quot;millorar&quot; is an extremely common verb meaning &quot;to improve&quot;. Hence, I can easily see myself using it at some point, as rare as it may sound to you.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it is better to do it this way, what I&#x27;m saying is that instead of being so annoyed at the author trying to seem smart, maybe you can shrug it off as a quirk of those who are writing in a foreign language.')
