Item(by='tenacious_tuna', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610556384, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25763757, text='Personally I&#x27;ve found all my workspace learning to be far, far more effective <i>and</i> enjoyable than my school experiences. A lot of it is the 1-on-1 mentoring I get in my work environments, or the much more hands-on learning I can do (writing code or making changes myself). This, combined with a much less intense deadline culture  (no exams, no hard assignment deadlines), work has always been a more enjoyable learning environment for me.<p>I realize I may be in the minority here, but I find it very hard to see how an apprentice-mentor relationship could ever be outstripped by large-scale lecture-audience dynamics in terms of quality. (Excepting, of course, a poor mentor, but that&#x27;s balanced out by poor instructors anyway.)')
