Yes, Tesla has the best UX for charging. Yes, right now this is an important consideration point when buying an EV, especially in the US market that is lagging in terms of EV choice.<p>Do you really think that the guys at VW and others can&#x27;t figure it out? It just takes a while. Just like it was with cars - they were behind Tesla, now they are in the driving seat in terms of numbers on the markets that are truly developed (in Norway Audi, VW and others are eating Tesla&#x27;s lunch).<p>The chargers will become a commodity in 5 years time and Tesla really needs to figure out something special as the first mover advantage is going away. The chargers (and the fact that it&#x27;s sold out) are the only thing that is currently preventing me to go and buy a Skoda Eniaq IV (size of Tesla X, costs less than Tesla 3). I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s changing in two years time when my current lease expires.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s a fully autonomous approach and perhaps they can really make it, but it&#x27;s really hard to see through the PR bullshit Tesla produces. I guess we&#x27;re in a phase where people are valuing Tesla more than all car makers combined (crazy, right?) and this hype obviously reflects in news.')
