It they don&#x27;t value it they don&#x27;t value it, having the government mandate and tell you what&#x27;s good for you helps no one in the long run.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that simple at all. There are lots of small reasons people right now act the way they do which in the aggregate makes it look as though they don&#x27;t value repairability. That doesn&#x27;t mean that they wouldn&#x27;t prefer a world where repair was easy and cheap. It also doesn&#x27;t mean that a world where repairs are easy and cheap isn&#x27;t preferable to one where it isn&#x27;t, in a bigger perspective (environmental, for one).')
