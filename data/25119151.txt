I kind of liken the geometric algebra unpopularity and conundrum similar to 18th mathematicians suspicious views when complex number was originally introduced and looks how far we have got now by embracing it [1]. Basically the discovery and utilization of complex number provide us with WiFi 6 and 5G. But if we want to move forward with robust and reliable wireless similar to wired (or close to wired connection reliability) we need to take control of EM polarization by embracing geometric algebra.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Complex_number#History" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Complex_number#History</a>')
