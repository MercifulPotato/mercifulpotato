That&#x27;s meant to be exceedingly boring. Tether is anything but boring, with all kinds of intrigue, lack of transparency about its reserves, law suits and so on.<p>There are a bunch of other stablecoins out there that just seem like better propositions, so why does crypto price action continue to be primarily driven by inflows from Tether?')
