They could have started design collaboration with others whenever they started this project, and they would have almost certainly ended up where they are now today, except with RISC-V.<p>Most likely, the real issue is that it would have required them to make a really visionary choice, which does come with a significant level of risk. Hindsight is 20-20, and with perfect clarity we can see now that that RISC-V ecosystem has matured extremely quickly and is now a very compelling place to be. There is a ton of stuff in RISC-V -- it&#x27;s not some void as you seem to be implying.<p>Instead, when they set out on this project, they chose to lean on their own internal strengths, which is certainly the ARM architecture. Back then, I&#x27;m sure things were less obvious than they are now -- but that&#x27;s why I want them to do visionary things to move industry and education forward.<p>Espressif (the makers of ESP32) don&#x27;t seem to be in nearly as comfortable of a position to try innovative things as the Raspberry Pi Foundation is, yet they managed to release a compelling RISC-V option -- because that industry trend was obvious enough to them, I guess, even if it wasn&#x27;t obvious enough to the Raspberry Pi Foundation.<p>As I&#x27;ve indicated, I&#x27;m sure this product will be successful, and I&#x27;m excited to see what people do with this, but I can still wish the Pi Foundation would have done something more here. I&#x27;m not wishing them failure or anything like that at all.')
