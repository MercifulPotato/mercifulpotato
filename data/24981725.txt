The writer claims at several points that divorce law in Italy is (allegedly) unfair because judges know that fathers typically have more resources to engage in litigation appealing bad judgments, and hence more lawyers and domestic violence clinics will get paid. Where is the evidence for such an over-the-top accusation?<p>The fact of the matter is that divorce is terrible, and there&#x27;s no good way to allocate resources after the fact.  Of course there isn&#x27;t---divorce is fundamentally the destruction of all kinds of financial assets (all the economies of scale in the marriage) and the upsetting of huge social, financial, and geographic commitments, even <i>without</i> children being involved.  Of course everyone is going to be dissatisfied with however the courts divide that poisoned pie.')
