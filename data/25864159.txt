That wouldn&#x27;t make it disinformation.<p>Lying is only one of the <i>many</i> ways you can mislead someone.  My point was that lying is inferior way to deceive than assembling true facts in a deceptive way.  So the fact that the NY Post themselves didn&#x27;t outright lie in this story does little to refute the idea that they&#x27;re a disreputable paper.')
