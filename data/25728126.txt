Can&#x27;t deny the facts.<p>I already responded to those criticisms elsewhere but here goes: I never expected any messenger to do end-to-end encryption. I am quite aware how un-ergonomic such a messenger would be so I know that Telegram does little more than TLS protection of the network socket. And that&#x27;s fine with me and with millions of others.<p>But I still don&#x27;t get why Telegram is the constant target of HN. Why not WhatsApp? Viber? Or literally every other messenger? I challenge you to find such brutal and full of flagged comments threads not pertaining to Telegram. As said above, we both live in our own bubble but all WhatsApp threads I&#x27;ve seen lately only aim at the user&#x27;s data privacy and almost nobody ever mentions that their &quot;encryption&quot; is also a glorified TLS and their claims for end-to-end encryption are very likely dubious and a pure PR stunt.<p>Admittedly some of the responses earlier -- which were very unconstructive -- got to me.')
