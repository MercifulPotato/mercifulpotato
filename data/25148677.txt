Item(by='langitbiru', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605787548, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25148484, text='Yeah, I know, bootstrapping a marketplace is one of the hardest things to do in startup. So I have a plan to overcome those barriers.<p>1. Liking people can be done secretly (people have to like you back in order to know you like them) and publicly (people can see who like them without liking them). Liking secretly is useful for a small team (a small company or a small community). Who knows some members of that small community or company like each other but don&#x27;t have a courage to express their liking. So they can use my website to do that. Of course, one of them needs to be an initiator.<p>2. I plan to give some benefits to premium accounts of SwanLove. So you&#x27;ll get benefits even you are the only one who uses SwanLove. For example, I build PredictSalary (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;predictsalary" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;predictsalary</a>). Next year, you can predict the salary range from Linkedin profiles using PredictSalary. But only premium members of SwanLove are able to use that feature.<p>3. Got some funding from investors and use marketing &#x2F; ads to drive people into my website. :)')
