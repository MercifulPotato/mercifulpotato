Previous studies have shown human soluble ACE2 can reduce viral load by a factor of 1,000-5,000.<p>&quot;Nine days after the onset of symptoms, the patient received hrsACE2 twice daily for 5 min by intravenous infusion. Administration of hrsACE2 was continued as scheduled for 7-days and was well tolerated with no clear drug-related side effects. A marked reduction in serum angiotensin II levels with concomitant increases in angiotensin 1–7, angiotensin 1–9, and their metabolite angiotensin 1–5 was observed after the first dose of hrsACE2. These changes were sustained through the observation period. Significant ACE2 activity was observed 7-days after administration of the last dose of hrsACE2. In addition, marked decreases in the concentrations of critical cytokines implicated in COVID-19 pathology to include interleukin IL-6, chemokine IL-8, as well as the soluble receptor for advanced glycation end product, the inflammation marker ferritin, tumor necrosis factor α, surfactant protein-D, C-reactive protein, and angiopoietin 2 were observed. The copy number of SAR-CoV-2 decreased dramatically from 32,000 copies per mL 2 days before administration of hrsACE2 to 2,500 and 270 copies per mL after the first and second day of hrsACE2 treatment, respectively, with rapid clearance from the patient’s plasma during daily testing until the end of the observation period. Furthermore, hrsACE2 injection did not reduce the generation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG antibodies&quot;')
