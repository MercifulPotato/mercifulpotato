Advice is contradictory, practices and processes are often orthogonal, and tools quite literally don&#x27;t exist. I say this as someone that&#x27;s worked in large companies and saw how lengthy not only process feedback loops were (especially developer â†” product team), but also engineering feedback loops (testing, deployment, dev environment setup, etc.)<p>And I also say this as someone that works on side-projects by myself. The tooling simply isn&#x27;t there. Setting up fast engineering feedback loops (multi-tiered deployment, test, dev, local, prod, etc. environments, heck even hot reloading or debugging) is needlessly difficult, or janky, or simply impossible. This goes for just about any language&#x2F;framework out there: from Java, to Javascript, to Go.<p>It&#x27;s not surprising that FAANG often designs their own internal systems that handle this sort of thing (from DevOps, to automated testing, to A&#x2F;B testing, to deployment). I&#x27;m a believer that this is also a space that&#x27;s ripe for disruption. I want environments to just <i>work</i>. I want code to just <i>compile</i>. I want containers to just <i>run</i>. Without me having to start digging through documentation, looking at thirteen Stack Overflow threads, and cobbling a solution that will inevitably break 3 months from now.')
