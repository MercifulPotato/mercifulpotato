Contrast this with Europe, where things like unprofitable state enterprises are propped up essentially forever, sucking away capital and people that could be doing something useful instead.<p>But this was a long, long time ago.  These days I don&#x27;t hold out much hope for the US <i>or</i> for Europe: humanity&#x27;s future is in Asia.')
