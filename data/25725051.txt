IMO we downplay them only because of fatigue and denial and even helplessness. &quot;Surely this is a one-off thing over one dumb podcast, not symptoms of a larger problem that I can avoid thinking about&quot; or maybe &quot;It&#x27;s fine cuz I don&#x27;t like that guy&quot;. And that&#x27;s how we deathmarch into the next, for example, Holocaust.<p>That said, I will admit that our comments sections sucks ass on these topics which is perhaps reason enough to avoid them.
