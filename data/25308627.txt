At all. Had to take a few pills just to get some shuteye and woke up with a shitty metal taste in my mouth every morning.<p>I started getting heart palpitations at odd times. Was on SSRI for a few years just to get over the burnout. Acid reflux so bad I could only eat unseasoned chicken and white rice for 6 months.<p>Since that episode I&#x27;ve learned moderation and have had a hard 8h&#x2F;day policy with rare exceptions. No issues since, and my output hasn&#x27;t really changed.')
