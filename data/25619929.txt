Item(by='orky56', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609654469, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25616945, text='1) Fully remote<p>2) HQ is an hour domestic flight but my job has been remote from the start 3.5 years ago<p>3) Although I&#x27;m an introvert among large crowds, I&#x27;ve found myself to become an extrovert among small groups of people. That latter aspect has disappeared since having started this new remote job. I form more genuine relationships with clients than coworkers in my customer-facing role. This period in my life has coincided with the birth of my child so I see myself focusing more towards my family than my social circle.<p>4) It sometimes feels like an illusion on whether I control my life, time, and actions with this remote arrangement. Whatever flexibility I have in taking care of errands or spending time with loved ones is counterbalanced by the erratic nature of work, childcare, and my exhausted discipline to take care of body&#x2F;mind&#x2F;soul.<p>5) I&#x27;ve been fortunate to move in to a multiple bedroom residence in HCOL just months before the pandemic which has afforded me the ability to physically separate from work when needed. That extra square footage is nice but space does not mitigate loneliness or the ability to truly separate and unwind.<p>6) Remote work feels inevitable not as a utopia but rather as a post-apocalyptic reality. It really blurs the lines between work, self-worth, and our purpose. I cautiously recommend remote work but you&#x27;ll need a totem a la Inception to stay grounded in the dream.')
