You treat the computer, under python, as an abstract machine which has unlimited memory, and don&#x27;t worry about its use. you focus on algorithmic understanding and fundamental data structures.<p>Once you grasped the computer science fundamentals, then you tear open the box and learn the underlying impl. of a computer - such as memory allocation, and assembly, etc (ostensibly, by making your own operating system using C, and&#x2F;or writing a compiler using C).<p>you can replace python with haskell, which imho, does an even better job as a first language.')
