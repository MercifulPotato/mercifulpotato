Now, whether that will actually happen is a secondary issue -- but I submit that you have a mistaken conception of what a &quot;state-level actor&quot; means in a threat model. The fact that Google Inc doesn&#x27;t hold the necessary keys but Signal LLC does is not a meaningful distinction to a state-level actor.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say &quot;all crypto is hopeless&quot;, simply that you shouldn&#x27;t consider Signal to be state-level actor proof.')
