Item(by='vmception', descendants=None, kids=[24667818, 24673360], score=None, time=1601677744, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24667015, text='That site makes only a back of the hand assumption about how much energy use is a renewable or clean source.<p>My work with large miners - who all rely on clean or reducing pollution by using unused energy - and the economics of all miners would say that 75% of all mining is renewable energy.<p>You would therefore have to divide all their problem metrics by 50-60%.<p>Regarding &quot;e-waste as much as Luxembough&quot;, is that really a lot? I don&#x27;t actually know what to compare that to, all I see is &quot;<i>gasp</i> a <i>country</i>!&quot; and no quantitive metric compared to say any other industry or even other jurisdiction&#x27;s use. With that in mind, I also am not sure it is accurate. Bitcoin e-waste doesn&#x27;t really result in more machines, it results in the same amount of machines being replaced and doing more. This is because the economics has already pushed people to renewable energy sources, and the people that can already have. People that are just catching on are using people&#x27;s &quot;wasted&quot; machines and mining with those.<p>Ah the source you ask? All the private details about <i>my</i> clients. Hm, yeah not going to happen, there might be a few press releases, and there might be a few court documents that have nothing to do with mining but normal business disagreements in companies that do mine.<p>The balanced answer is that this is something to remain vigilant about. Nations mining at a loss and printing currency to do so will absolutely not care about the power cost or source, and this is where we are headed. The private sector is not capable of doing this as uneconomically as that site suggests, pay attention as that site&#x27;s assumptions are intertwined with facts. Just notice where they don&#x27;t have any facts and be willing to balance that with other accounts like mine.')
