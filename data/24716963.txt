Any speech made illegal by law isn&#x27;t protected unless the supreme court rules that case to be different, IIRC you americans have precedence rules for that sort of stuff.<p>Protected speech is any legal speech that additionally enjoys protection from the constitution, while unprotected speech would be legal speech that is not otherwise protected. And then you have illegal stuff that is outlawed.<p>Courts to my knowledge, even in american, don&#x27;t consider the constitution at the lower levels, just local legislation, ie any legal speech is equivalent regardless of protected status.<p>Specific protection status would be regulated by precedent in higher courts which do have the capacity to interprete the constitution.')
