Expect to see a shit ton of money trickle down to Eurocrats and bureaucrats in their respective countries, before one ounce reach one country.<p>Another issue is the fragmentation of the EU. If there is a pool of funds for a particular research target, the EU has to divvy it between its major countries. So even if a university in country X doesn&#x27;t have much of a history researching something, they still get funded from the EU pool, as long as their country raises a tantrum over it.<p>Meanwhile the US&#x27; (and most other countries&#x27;) policy often looks at funding individual projects to one or a few unis at most. More targeted funding = better outputs.<p>Not that EU doesn&#x27;t have its successes. Galileo could be called a success, but the road to it was very very bumpy.')
