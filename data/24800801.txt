Also honing motoric skills is a key part in doing many things - arts, sports - so getting accustomed to that is a big plus too. The downside of doing only that is yes, you will be quite lost with the abstract and also reinforce some bad habits.<p>So no cynical HN commentary from me! If it works, it is definitely a big help for learning to play piano.')
