I finally gave up and set up a Linux VM via Parallels. Now my battery lasts at least twice as long during local development.<p>- Cloud deployment targets (including serverless) are almost always running Linux, so running&#x2F;debugging on the Mac is less accurate (unless you&#x27;re using Docker, but performance is bad).<p>- Homebrew is great and all, but Ubuntu is a more important compile&#x2F;release target for most open-source packages.<p>Now for front-end development, I still prefer the Mac for a few reasons, especially the quality of the screen, trackpad, and the Quartz display-PDF window manager. If design work is necessary, some of the best tools are on the Mac.<p>Maybe a Linux VM in Parallels on macOS is the best solution for now, but you can see why I&#x27;d prefer a Microsoft (or Apple for that matter) Linux OS if I could have that with a great screen, trackpad, display-PDF window manager, and graphics&#x2F;design software.')
