Civil disobedience and conscientious objection are going to be more effective than merely communicating your displeasure to your Twitter followers or starting a petition on change.org.<p>It&#x27;s unreasonable to expect that the individual who took this action could go to court against the RIAA and extract their deeply embedded claws from the legislative, executive, and even cultural environment in which they&#x27;ve entrenched themselves.<p>Instead, it&#x27;s reasonable to expect that somewhere in a conference room at say, Gitlab, Sourceforge, etc., sometime in the near future, some lawyer is going to mention &quot;We got DCMAs from X for repo Y, and foo for repo bar, and from the MPAA for the popular repo (insert software tool here), obviously we should remove all of those repos.&quot; Maybe someone familiar looks up and says &quot;that sounds a little silly, isn&#x27;t that tool just a general-purpose media player?&quot; And the lawyer might respond &quot;We don&#x27;t care-we don&#x27;t have the budget to determine if the DCMA notice looks valid or not, if it turns out to be valid we have to do it and if it&#x27;s not valid it costs us nothing to take it down&quot;.

Like a little flock of oxpecker birds riding a rhinoceros, we wouldn&#x27;t even register in a fight against a tiger, we can only warn our larger intermediary of the danger we perceive. The RIAA doesn&#x27;t care that you&#x27;re against them. We need to change the incentives for companies like Github that have a chance to be heard.')
