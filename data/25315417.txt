That said, you can still do a lot in terms of following good programming practices to create something that looks and works great and is reasonably maintainable.<p>It ultimately comes down to your (and your teams) tolerance and business needs - there&#x27;s no hard reason we need to stop using stimulus, we&#x27;ve just decided that there are parts of our app where we could make leaps in developer productivity by using something else.')
