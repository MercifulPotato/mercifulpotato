Item(by='alwillis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609083214, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25550194, text='<i>Bitcoin used to be an alternative currency that was anonymous, but with a current $7 transaction fee it&#x27;s clearly not going to be used as a currency to buy a morning coffee (i.e. it fails the transferability requirement of a currency).</i><p>Not sure why bitcoin skeptics keep pointing to these transaction fees. As I write this, it takes 3 sats&#x2F;byte to get into a block in 30 minutes and 1 sat&#x2F;byte for 1 hour.<p>And as I write this, 1 sat = $0.00027210. A typical transaction is about 250 bytes, so to get a transaction into a block in 30 minutes costs about 7 cents. If it&#x27;s more important, you could pay $1 or something.<p>Of course, Lightning Network is faster and cheaper than using bitcoin&#x27;s blockchain for every transaction, which cost a fraction of a sat for every hop the transaction has to travel.')
