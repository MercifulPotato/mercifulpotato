One of the times it didn&#x27;t work, I noticed all of my programs were being killed by the OOM reaper, even though I had just started the system. After running free in a spare terminal, I realized it was reporting that I had roughly INT_MAX memory in use, and so it was deciding to kill basically everything to try and get back to having a non-negative amount of free memory left. There must have been memory corruption in some kernel data structure somewhere that deals with memory allocation.<p>I rebooted and it never happened again, but it was pretty funny running free and seeing those ridiculous numbers pop up. I was kind of amazed the rest of the system was even working at all.')
