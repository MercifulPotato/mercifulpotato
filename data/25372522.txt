You think that is easier? Not to even talk of the ethical concerns or the unintended consequences, just from a logistical standpoint, your statement is absurd. There is <i>no way</i> that is is easier to reduce a human population than it is to increase water availability. I don&#x27;t usually attack people (and technically I&#x27;m only criticizing your statement, not attacking you directly) but when malthusians start talking I immediately know that they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about.<p>And on an ethical note, managing populations is something you do with sheep and cattle, not human beings.')
