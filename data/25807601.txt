Took longer and was harder than I expected.  The locals don&#x27;t speak English and most of the magical stuff happens in Spanish.<p>My Spanish speaking personality is quite different from English speaking me.  I say things to my Colombian girlfriend in Spanish that I would never say in English.  My Spanish speaking interactions don&#x27;t have an English equivalent.<p>Come for a few months, speak English, and you can have a great time.  If you come for a few years and learn the language &#x2F; culture, you&#x27;ll have a new worldview.<p>Sidenote: there&#x27;s a misconception that you can learn a language by being in a country for a few years.  I&#x27;ve known lots of expats that have been here for years and still don&#x27;t know the language.  Even fewer have truly understood the culture.')
