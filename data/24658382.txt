I&#x27;d suggest to read the often recommended on HN small book &quot;The Gervais Principle&quot; to understand how most organizations work. And calibrate your emotions, seriously: the more energy you invest in them, the stronger they become.<p>Recognizing the right thing is good, but not enough. What you did is you went to the forest to teach wolves good manners and got almost eaten alive, but wolves are wolves and you can&#x27;t blame them. A better approach would be to undermine the project from inside. They tell you to implement a fraud scheme? Fine. You appear very professional, knowledgeable and volunteer to coordinate the project, while secretly you add subtle, but serious cracks in the foundation, and document the process for the future litigation. You say you reported it to the gov eventually. I&#x27;d contact FBI, again secretly, work with them to gather information, install a couple legal landmines and leave with a plausible cause half a year before the ship is scheduled to sink.')
