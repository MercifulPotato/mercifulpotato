It was not worth the trouble.<p>Maybe it was only possible in the last decade (2009-2020) due to the stock market being in a valley when I started investing a large percentage of my income each year, but I now make 6 figures a year in dividends and capital gains from my investments in S&amp;P funds. I did live frugally and sacrificed a lot, and it probably helped that I do not have a family nor a mortgage.<p>Because I still live way beneath my means, this &quot;business&quot; continues to grow exponentially year after year, and I&#x27;ll be able to retire pretty comfortably in my mid 40&#x27;s (estimate). It takes very little of my time (compared to an actual business like Ebay reselling or some small SAAS that I could create). I know it&#x27;s not the type of side-hustle many on this site imagine, but it probably is more feasible for those who don&#x27;t have any million-dollar ideas, don&#x27;t want to put in the time and energy into a high-risk venture, and already enjoy (or can tolerate) their day job that pays well enough.')
