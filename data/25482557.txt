However, <i>as a practical matter</i> I don&#x27;t think a pure Pigovian approach could ever fly. Overhead and enforcement issues would sink it. A hybrid approach with most revenue from land-value and value-added taxes gets pretty close and is fairly straightforward to administer. Not saying we shouldn&#x27;t tax those other things, but that wouldn&#x27;t be a huge percentage of revenue.')
