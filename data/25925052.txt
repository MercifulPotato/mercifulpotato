You seem to be using the definition of cash-flow-positive, or something like that.<p>Taking a loan, or investment, does not suddenly make a company unprofitable, that would be a silly way of looking at the world.<p>I don&#x27;t have any figures for SpaceX, but I suspect the amount of cash they&#x27;ve be able to raise relates directly to the expected future value of the company. That they&#x27;re able to launch 60 satellites at once for a fraction of the cost of other launch companies probably helps.<p>Part of the reason I asked what you meant by profitable is that you seem to be conflating operating and capital expenses.<p>From the perspective of the &#x27;launch-arm&#x27; of SpaceX, launch costs are operational expenses and profitability analysis will typically balance that against payment for the service provided.<p>From the perspective of the &#x27;starlink-arm&#x27; of SpaceX, launch costs are capital expenses and should be accounted for by depreciating the cost over the life of the asset (the satellites).<p>If you want to look at the profitability across the entire business then you have to be very specific about what you&#x27;re measuring, and clear what you mean when you say profitable - at least if you want your analysis to be useful.')
