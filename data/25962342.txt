Item(by='wlesieutre', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611953458, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25958665, text='A typical lithium ion &quot;14500&quot; battery has that issue, yes.<p>There are some more unusual ones such as Kentli, which have built-in buck converter to give you 1.5V as a substitute for normal AA batteries. It&#x27;s a clever design where the top of the cell has two separate contacts, the normal button-top gives you 1.5V, and a recessed ring around that hooks up to the actual battery cell for charging purposes. So you need a special charger for these.<p>Images and more info here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lygte-info.dk&#x2F;review&#x2F;batteries2012&#x2F;Kentli%20AA%202800mWh%20%28Blue%29%20UK.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lygte-info.dk&#x2F;review&#x2F;batteries2012&#x2F;Kentli%20AA%20280...</a><p>I&#x27;ve never actually seen any of these (have a bunch of NiMH cells and one fancy charger already) but it&#x27;s a cool system. I don&#x27;t think the capacity is significantly better, but devices that have trouble with NiMH&#x27;s lower voltage would do better with these.')
