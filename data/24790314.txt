I don&#x27;t live in SF but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a nice place to live. There&#x27;s still a lot going on there, like universities, food, diversity, etc. Rent and house prices in the city are likely to go down, which is a good thing given how insanely expensive it is right now. Long term it might be even good for the city.')
