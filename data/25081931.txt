I&#x27;m glad I visited the US last year because I have a feeling I&#x27;m never going back there. Same reason why I wouldn&#x27;t go visit North Korea.<p>BTW why am I hearing this &#x27;freedom is not important&#x27; stuff from so many people on HN? Is that what your leaders are preaching? I&#x27;d be suspicious of your leaders if that were me.')
