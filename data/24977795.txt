I develop and sell a desktop app and I try to build as much relationship with my users as possible, and then ask them for feedback.<p>- I have installed a chat popup on my landing page and I always try to answer any question within 1 hour, and then follow up with those users afterward.<p>- I have a feedback portal (similar to canny). Whenever anyone leaves any kind of feedback, I write them a thank you email and try to elaborate more on the feedback they left, no matter if this is negative, positive feedback or feature request. For example, if they ask for a feature, I tell them when I plan to develop it.<p>- Whenever user purchases a license for my app, I also write them a thank you email, and ask for a small feedback. I try to do a short investigation on what user is doing and include some personal touch in it. Usually, 50% of such emails get an answer.<p>- If I see some bug report coming from a known user I immediately send them an email explaining why that bug has happened, how and when I&#x27;m gonna fix it.<p>I also keep a page in my notes called &#x27;Followups&#x27; where I put the user&#x27;s name and the reason why I should follow up with them. For example next week I&#x27;m preparing a new release of the app that has changes which I know are used heavily by a couple of users and I will reach out to them this week, give them an alpha build and ask for their feedback. Whenever I get an idea of how I can bring someone&#x27;s attention to the product, I add their name to this list.')
