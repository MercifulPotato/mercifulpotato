But honestly, when did you start using the word &quot;sedition&quot; and when did the word acquire emotional weight to you, as a dastardly crime? When and how do you think other people got familiar with the word?<p>If I&#x27;m being honest, my association with the word sedition before pretty recently was almost <i>entirely</i> a very dim memory of the Alien and Sedition Acts being mentioned in grade school. And an even dimmer memory that they were unpopular and probably unconstitutional.<p>It&#x27;s not that I think it&#x27;s necessarily wrong to use it, I just feel suddenly surrounded by people who are pretending that we all are used to using it and viscerally being outraged by people who commit it. Which feels weird since I can&#x27;t remember seeing it in normal conversation in like 30+ years.<p>Maybe it sounds better than treason, perhaps because treason is a word right wing types like to use?')
