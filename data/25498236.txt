I&#x27;m down with the idea that a non-enterprise distro with a contribution pathway is useful, and enterprise stability is mostly unnecessary.<p>But functionally, I don&#x27;t think this helps resolve the issue. The issue is the business model, and RH will never make people happy while it attempts to charge for the OS. The basic thing people are after is RHEL itself, at no cost. That feels unreconcilable.')
