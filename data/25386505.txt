Those tools are knife while what you&#x27;re suggesting is for politicians to use a rock.<p>Also as a practical matter having the government need to raise taxes to pay for spending is a (for government any way) relatively immediate form of feedback.  Taxes go up and those who are taxed start complaining right when they hear what the tax bill will be.  Inflating costs is imprecise - the &quot;cost&quot; comes on slowly and the &quot;fix&quot; for it - almost always raising interest rates is very painful and happens very quickly.  So painful that politicians have historical needed a buffer - an appointed federal reserve in the US - to actually do it.')
