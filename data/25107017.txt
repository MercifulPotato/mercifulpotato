He also mentions when explaining Ω that it is often used as a stand-in for a run-time error. An uncaught exception can do the same job, for example.<p>(The reason for this that if you are describing the semantics of a language using a collection of reduction rules, and evaluation gets to a point where no reduction rule applies, then the program gets “stuck”. You would normally implement this as a runtime error but semantically it has the same effect as an infinite loop.)')
