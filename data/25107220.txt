A previous benchmark[1] showed a MacBook Air with M1 getting 1687 on the single-core test and 7433 on multi-core. Compared to a 4-month-old kitted out iMac (1251 &amp; 9014)[2] this is 35% faster on single-core and 17% slower on multi-core (8 cores on M1, 20 cores on the i9).<p>Getting a better result via Rosetta 2 on the single-threaded benchmark is very impressive. I assumed that their benchmark included some vector instructions (which as far as I understand Rosetta 2 does not emulate) so this would mean that these higher numbers are for general-purpose instructions vs vector. That said, I can&#x27;t find any reference to AVX or SSE in the &quot;Geekbench 5 CPU Workloads&quot; document, although the one for Geekbench 4 does mention them. It would be interesting to see numbers for Geekbench 4 on M1, if it runs via Rosetta at all. I would imagine that the tool is able to detect what is supported to run optimized code for each CPU being evaluated.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;11&#x2F;m1-macbook-air-first-benchmark&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrumors.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;11&#x2F;m1-macbook-air-first-be...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;browser.geekbench.com&#x2F;macs&#x2F;imac-27-inch-retina-mid-2020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;browser.geekbench.com&#x2F;macs&#x2F;imac-27-inch-retina-mid-2...</a>')
