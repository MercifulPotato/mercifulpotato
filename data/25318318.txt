The %&gt;% operator, by default, pipes to the first argument of a function. If you want to pipe to a different argument, you can do:<p>a %&gt;% func(x, arg2 = .)<p>It seems like the native pipe doesn&#x27;t support a placement argument, but you can use the new, more concise lambda operator:<p>a |&gt; \\(d) func(x, arg2 = d)<p>A little more verbose, but it&#x27;s not a very common use case, it&#x27;s more general, and I&#x27;d happily trade a little more verbosity for the rest of the improvements. (That said, I haven&#x27;t played around with the magrittr 2.0 improvements yet, so maybe the difference is going to end up being less than the presentation suggests.)')
