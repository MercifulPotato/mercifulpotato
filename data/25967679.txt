Sure I was banned for the last comment that ticked the mod off (a comment against privacy violations of users who had their data stolen through theft) but the decision was \nnot based on that alone. It was based on comments leading up to it: Most of which concern Big Tech Censorship. You can check my comments section if you are sceptical. It&#x27;s publicly accessible anyways.')
