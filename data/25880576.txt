I think the parent question was, I have a large object in memory, I want to delete it now so that I can load another large object without running into memory limits. But I don&#x27;t want to call gc.collect which will stop my whole application, interfer with the garbage collector heuristics, and do all sort of unecessay steps.<p>I had instances where I knew only one of these large structures could fit in memory and had to call gc.collect before allocating a new one, as I would get an outofmemory exception before the garbage collector would kick in by itself.<p>You can do that with unmanaged objects but it doesn&#x27;t look like you can with managed objects (other than gc.collect which I saw on other videos is not recommended by microsoft).')
