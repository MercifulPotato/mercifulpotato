Should the authors have started with, say, Python or JS, they won&#x27;t have the problem with support from third parties. Please note how their choice was between open-source Rust and proprietary (CORRECTION: also open-source already) F#, both descendants of the ML family.<p>When you pick a language and start to feel you&#x27;re overgrowing its ecosystem, you either migrate off of it (as in the post), or start developing it to help it move in the direction you want. In the case of OCaml, Jane Street and Facebook chose the latter route.<p>UPDATE: Thanks for reminding that F# has been open-sourced: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;fsharp&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;dotnet&#x2F;fsharp&#x2F;</a>')
