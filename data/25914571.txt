Item(by='sgt101', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611660110, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25913564, text='I wish I could agree.<p>Here is why I am not sure.<p>The nuclear weapons program is seen (in all good faith) by all those running it as vital to national security and national survival.<p>Anyone who expresses the slightest skepticism or concern about any aspect of it is seen as undermining this vital national goal. It should be noted that the skeptics &#x2F; concerned are on very difficult ground professionally, because there are so many layers of secrecy and the barriers to disclosure are so strong that asking questions <i>is</i> actually nasty and rude. The people who are being questioned cannot disclose their true position or hint at why an arguement or line of questioning is silly and so they have to sit there (decent and honourable as they may be) sharply aware that they look shifty and silly. This is bloody unfair and unpleasant, it&#x27;s never going to build bridges or relationships. It is an &quot;unprofessional&quot; line to follow.<p>So, these people (the skeptics) are then excluded from the program and anything that connects to it. The exclusion happens professionally (that guy is not honest or straightforward - don&#x27;t trust his judgement), commercially&#x2F;employment&#x2F;youarefired &amp; socially (you are a heretic, abhorrent, communist, idiot, greenie).<p>And that is ok - as far as it goes - I understand, I get it, there are many other roles and interests in life to pursue. But what it has created is the most profound bubble around the development, control and management of nuclear weapons within which everyone involves genuinely believes that they are safe, effective and necessary. There is no doubt. And without doubt there is complacency and ignorance. I hope to god that this doesn&#x27;t lead to a major accident, but right now I am pretty sure that it will.')
