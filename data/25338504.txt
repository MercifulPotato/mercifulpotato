Would love to know if there&#x27;s anything that can be done for people experiencing this, even if it costs money and takes time. I would pay quite a bit not to have to change my number, and I imagine there are quite a few people out there in the same situation.<p>I received a call from an obvious scammer (something about my social security number being stolen, etc), and in their recording they didn&#x27;t provide an option to be put on a no-call list which has happened in other cases. The only option I was given was to dial &quot;1&quot; to talk to one of their agents. I dialed 2, and was instantly greeted by someone who had an almost accent-free English but was on a poor phone connection. He said &quot;hello,&quot; and I said &quot;would you please remove me from your list.&quot; He said he&#x27;ll do that if I paid him $2k. I declined and said I need to be removed or I&#x27;ll contact the police. At that point, he reiterated his offer, but added that he&#x27;ll call me every single minute until I give in. I responded that I am not falling for this and that I&#x27;ll file a police report, at which point he started using foul language and told me &quot;that I am f*cked.&quot;<p>What surprised me about the call was the rudeness. I was expecting someone on the other line hoping that they are not going to get themselves in trouble and politely apologizing for calling the wrong person. Instead, the person I talked to was clearly convinced that they cannot get caught. Given the digital nature of our world, I am a bit surprised that&#x27;s the case if you come across a sufficiently motivated person.')
