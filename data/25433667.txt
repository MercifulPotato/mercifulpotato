You might be able to get away with only supporting SCIM, the main thing you&#x27;d be missing is &quot;just-in-time&quot; user provisioning.<p>But given that you&#x27;ll probably need SCIM at some point anyway, probably a good idea to start with SCIM, and then add SAML only when you need to! It&#x27;ll also inform what subset of SAML you actually need to implement.')
