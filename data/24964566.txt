Greenwald offered to publish the story elsewhere (which he is explicitly allowed to by his contract) and they said no.  He published both the article and the emails leading up to his resignation.  The Intercept clearly breached the terms of his employment contract and expected to pressure him into accepting it.<p>I think what makes it hurt so much for Jeremy (who strikes me as good guy) is that he is still loyal to the organization and doesn&#x27;t want to face up to its hypocrisy.  I don&#x27;t know how he reconciles his opinion of Betsy with her comments accusing Glen of acting like a spoiling child.<p>I want Biden to win and think the NY Post stinks but Greenwald is right on the merits.')
