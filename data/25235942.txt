This meant that while things like marriage equality or divorce law reform could happen on a state-by-state basis in the US, in Australia they could only happen at the federal level<p>* US states have power to levy state income tax; Australian states are <i>de facto</i> banned from doing so. (Federal law says that if a state imposes income tax, it makes itself ineligible for federal funding grants, which makes state-level income taxation infeasible).<p>* More generally, Australian states are far more dependent on federal funding than US states are<p>* The Australian federal government has massive direct economic expenditure in several areas – health, education, disability, broadband – which in the US are primarily state or private funding responsibilities<p>* The external affairs power gives the federal level the power to override any state law if required by an international treaty. Although the Treaty Clause of the US Constitution may be similar, that requires a 2&#x2F;3rd supermajority vote in the Senate which is a difficult bar to overcome, whereas the Australian external affairs power only requires a normal 50%+1 majority in each house of the Australian Parliament. As an example, Australia has a national ban on the death penalty enacted on the basis of the UN treaty &quot;the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights&quot;<p>* US constitutional amendments require approval of state legislatures; in Australia, the federal government directly seeks approval of constitutional amendments by the voters in national referendums, leaving the state governments&#x2F;Parliament with no direct role in amending the national constitution')
