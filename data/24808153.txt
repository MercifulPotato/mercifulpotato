Progress is slow, but it is there and the libraries + proof assistants (possibly AI assisted) will improve. Somehow that will find it&#x27;s way in one or more of the languages we are using now (because shiny new things).<p>Anyway; I don&#x27;t have that feeling, at all, about languages and codebases I have been using for 1 or more decades; c, c#, php, java, pascal, perl (only exception is JS; it was awful 10+ years ago and I do like to complain about that but I maintain only 1 significant codebase in &#x27;older&#x27; js (about 8 years ago?); it is a (callback hell) nightmare, currently being rewritten in c#); I work on significant sized codebases in all of these and they work fine (no money lost, no people died (no avionics either though, but still enough opportunities where people could&#x27;ve died because of something I wrote or was lead on)).<p>&gt; Its psychology. We need the shiny new thing to give more meaning to our lives.<p>&#x27;We need&#x27; =&gt; maybe most people do, I don&#x27;t. I actually never really liked new things. I want stability as my work demands and has demanded that for decades and it creeped into my non-work life. I want things to be reliable and robust &#x27;forever&#x27;, not new things that I don&#x27;t know of how good or solid they are (spoiler; they are usually not, in code nor meatspace). I like to pay people, keep my company healthy and sleep at night; shiny new things do the opposite in most cases.')
