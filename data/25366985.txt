Like sun tzu said the battle is won before the first shot is fired. And this is a losing battle.<p>Here is what I think of an ideal future. Platforms need to be separated and service providers need to be separated.<p>They can be one company but separate management with no influence between each other.<p>Messaging platforms can be separate with interoperability.

And more than I care to know.<p>This is too much power under one management.<p>By splitting platforms from service providers seeking customers on those platforms, and allowing customers to disconnect from those platforms and move to other platforms, a large fracking sound will be heard.')
