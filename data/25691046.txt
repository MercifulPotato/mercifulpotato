Your best bet is to be honest and tell them that you&#x27;ll take all the security best practices you can on your end, but at the end of the day, even that is no guarantee against a data breach, wanted or unwanted, done via lawful or unlawful means, executed by the Government or hacker group, or whomever.</i><p><i>YOU CANNOT GUARANTEE PRIVACY IN THIS DAY AND AGE</i>.<p>It would be simpler just to be honest and up-front to all of your users and simply tell them that, <i>EVEN IF</i> as a result of this they stopped doing business with you, or using your website, or whatever.<p>You&#x27;d get a lot more sleep at night -- if you had a clear conscience...<p>I quote to you the 3rd Delphic Maxim:<p>&quot;Surety brings ruin&quot;.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Delphic_maxims" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Delphic_maxims</a><p>If the Court (or any other entity, Government, Corporation, Person) makes promises to anyone else, implicitly or explicity, while those promises might not be written down, those promises constitute a <i>CONTRACT</i>.')
