You can see that talk here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;virtual.awsevents.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;1_usujusng" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;virtual.awsevents.com&#x2F;media&#x2F;1_usujusng</a><p>For any AWS EMR&#x2F;hadoop users out there, this means the end of emrfs.<p>For the uninitiated, emrfs recognizes consistency problems but does not fix them.  It&#x27;ll throw an exception if there&#x27;s a consistency problem, even give you some tools to fix the problem, but the tools may give false positives.  The result is you&#x27;ve got to fix some consistency problems yourself, parse items out of the emrfs DynamoDB catalog, match them up to s3, then make adjustments where needed. It&#x27;s an unnecessary chore.<p>It surprises me that this issue has not got more attention over the years and thankfully it&#x27;ll be solved soon.')
