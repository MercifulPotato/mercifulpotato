And in that context it&#x27;s on point. When he writes monitoring he means alerts that mean something important is surely broken and that somebody should wake up right now and log on to fight the fire. I myself call that &quot;state monitoring&quot;. And I find the Nagios model still the best for this.<p>The other kind I call &quot;trend monitoring&quot;. And here you can feed data to some program that might detect anomalies, find correlations between different data deltas and so on. This can be very valuable and obviously a computer can crunch a lot more data a lot faster than humans.<p>For state monitoring I find black box tests to work very good. You don&#x27;t need to understand how the system works, you don&#x27;t need any inside data, just try to use it. Have a bot try to buy the product from the web store. It&#x27;s a lot more reliable than trying to deduce the state of the system from how internal components act and interact. Again, the scope here is to alert somebody that action is surely needed ASAP.<p>Ofc you also need trend monitoring, you don&#x27;t want to wait until you&#x27;re out of space when you can project from the current growth trend. But in keeping with that example a data import will always trick the AI into thinking we&#x27;re heading for disaster so it&#x27;s not very reliable as a fire alarm.')
