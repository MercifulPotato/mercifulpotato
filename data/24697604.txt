Yes server and client JS are not the same runtime but they are easy enough to smooth over that they are practically “the same”<p>Yes a JS only developer is probably lacks certain experience but I am well versed in Java and have had solid exposure to C#, like they them both a lot, but today would prefer to use TS on backend and front end for any small project. The fact that I can share types and  validation code (Joi) on both server and client is really powerful in my opinion. There’s only so much you have time to focus on when you’re working on a small project. Context switching two platforms is a big impediment in such cases.')
