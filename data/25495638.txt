If your kid starts talking about converting to Islam and becoming a jihadist, surely parents should alert the authorities.<p>Err..., definitely not. I would hope most parents have a word with the child instead, and certainly not because the child is interested in Islam, as others have also stated. I find this thinking rather bizarre, to be honest - dobbing your own children in to the authorities, for thought crime.')
