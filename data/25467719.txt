But then I watched the documentary about the creation of the first Netscape web browser around 1995 or so, when they presumably didn&#x27;t have any of the above. And yet, the interviewed people were still clearly on a verge of burnout. One of the developers said that she plans to quit the industry in her early thrities as she cannot imagine doing this for her whole life. So I guess the hard part is the task itself, not the circumstances.')
