Item(by='mrtksn', descendants=None, kids=[25262909, 25262588], score=None, time=1606799074, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25262165, text='The web is horrible now because of the tooling and the functions.<p>The tooling is bloated, very heavy codebase and the million ways to do the same thing even gave a way for Google AMP and despite developers hating it AS A USER I always tap on the search result with the lightning icon because it means that it will load fast and give me the text I am looking for right away.<p>Also, the functionality or business model usually needs to recognise you. So the first time you visit a website you have to go through the install process.<p>To use a website, the first thing is, you need to decide how much you should be tracked so you have to deal with the tracking settings(BTW, no EU doesn&#x27;t make anyone to put tracking consent  popups, it&#x27;s just that somehow the Web people decided that they must track and this is the way to do it).<p>The next step of the website installation process is, creating an account. If the website provides periodical content it will slap you the &quot;subscribe to our mailing list&quot; pop-up. For some reason the close buttons usually work slow for me, takes multiple taps on the (X) to close this. It will have this annoying fade-in, fade-out effect with the content barely visible beneath it.<p>Then comes the monetisation part of the install process. I will be presented with %80 suggestions to do something else instead of using the website that I just installed(in other word, ads) and there would be %20 content and most of the times that content would disappoint me because it is yet another low quality thing that was made to take me there and show me the %80 of the page and collect my information.<p>Do you know why the old web was great, in my opinion? Because we were freeloading the great pre-web content and the tooling was just advanced enough to show it to us but not advanced enough to make money from us.<p>The interactivity made the fun even greater but what we were doing was freeload the old content, create some new content and do all this on some investors dime. Now these investors own the thing and want their money back back and they are not sponsoring the &quot;open web&quot;, so anyone trying to do anything on the web must pay from the pocket or make the experience horrible so can monetize it.<p>The web is dying because no one wants to pay for it. The people who used to pay for it (the investors) no longer pay, the remaining good quality web is just a sidekick for their actual business.')
