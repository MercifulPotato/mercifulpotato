A good example of this is Tesla&#x27;s Fremont factory (which used to be a GM&#x2F;Toyota facility) and their Shanghai Gigafactory. The layout of the Fremont one contributed to significant inefficiencies in manufacturing compared to GF3 which was built from scratch for EVs.<p>Buying Ford and GM would also mean taking on the baggage of hundreds of billions in debt, pension obligations, employees with minimal experience in building batteries&#x2F;drivetrains&#x2F;EVs, a dealership network that doesn&#x27;t want to sell EVs and the old guard that has no desire to innovate.<p>Tesla uses manufacturing methods no other OEM does (e.g. Giga-press casting machine for Model Y&#x2F;3 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Giga_Press" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Giga_Press</a>). The facilities they are currently building are massive compared to Ford&#x2F;GM&#x27;s factories. They vertically integrate, soon going all the way down to cell manufacturing&#x2F;lithium mining. Buying an incumbent OEM would end up a burden.')
