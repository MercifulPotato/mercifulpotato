Spotify has been God&#x27;s gift to mankind as far as my experience goes. I&#x27;ll get the negative out of the way first: their UI teams loves to keep tweaking stuff, which is annoying. It&#x27;s a stable app and they should leave it alone.<p>Having said that, it&#x27;s wonderful. I can download all my music. It has some truly wonderful playlists for when I&#x27;m coding. It&#x27;s recommendation engine seems to recommend really nice tunes week after week. The yearly reviews, the On Repeat etc. all this stuff is really nice to look back at.<p>Then, I FINALLY have a podcast search which can search for podcast <i>episodes</i> and then, when I click on the search result, take me to tho god-damned episode instead of the full podcast with 2500 fucking episodes to hunt through. It actually has a sane podcast interface that isn&#x27;t a cluttered mess.<p>I was so sceptical of it because I loved Pandora to the absolute hilt, but now it&#x27;s the only Saas I pay monthly for.')
