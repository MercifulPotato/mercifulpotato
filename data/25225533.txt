We had a long experience with such a system. After we extricated ourselves from it, we had a long experience extricating other countries from such systems.<p>I hope you&#x27;ll excuse me for saying so, but there is something profoundly solipsistic and unreasonable about asking me to accept your Korean experience as a basis for a claim as broad as you are making. If that is really the end and the beginning of your chain of reasoning, I urge you to reconsider your approach: we can&#x27;t, unfortunately, base our understanding of political development on our experience: it&#x27;s a topic with a long history and a long, long cycle time. A comparative approach, and a willingness to consider like problems and like situations in other countries, nets greater understanding in this area.')
