Sure, React code written in 2015 will still work, but it&#x27;s hardly the &quot;modern&quot; way to write React and if your organization&#x27;s code was written entirely in 2015, engineers will probably be clamouring to rewrite it.<p>Taking the somewhat-arbitrary but reasonable standpoint that &quot;stable&quot; means that there aren&#x27;t any major architectural changes required to bring a codebase up to modern standards, I think the best you can say is that React has been stable since hooks were introduced in Feb 2019. So about a year and a half of stability, which isn&#x27;t horrible but it&#x27;s a far cry from stable since 2015.')
