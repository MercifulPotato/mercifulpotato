This is error prone.<p>In garbage collected languages like Java there is a garbage collector who figures out when is a piece of memory no longer in use. This has run-time cost.<p>The third possible way is to make the ownership of that part of the memory explicit. This way the compiler can check memory safety at compile time.<p>There is a much better description of this in the Rust book: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;book&#x2F;ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doc.rust-lang.org&#x2F;book&#x2F;ch04-01-what-is-ownership.htm...</a>')
