You have to find a balance that works for your needs.<p>Some recommendations, from across this continuum:<p>Use a VPN, from a company that you trust.<p>Firefox - use containers to get some separation between services.<p>NoScript - for blocking JS. This takes some time to get used to but is definitely worth it. After you have a whitelist going, it is much less painful.<p>uBlock Origin - for blocking ads. This one is a super low hanging fruit.<p>Privacy Badger - occasionally catches some trackers missed by Firefox and uBlock Oigin.<p>Decentraleyes - to avoid big CDNs.<p>OpenDNS instead of your ISP’s or Google’s DNS. Or consider setting up a Pihole.<p>Switch your search engine to DuckDuckGo.<p>Tor (or even Tails) - significantly more privacy, but at a much higher convenience cost.<p>The biggest privacy win will be no longer using services from companies that don’t respect your privacy. This is doubly true of mobile. Many people cannot go without a smartphone (I still use a smartphone) but it’s worth considering whether you can drop it.')
