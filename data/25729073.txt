From personal websites, to that pesky terms of service you need hosted for launching your iOS app. All your content is one-way synced from Google Docs so there&#x27;s a clear source-of-truth (No more copy-pasting!). After you share your folder and hit publish, Lttrs builds an optimized, statically generated site (with a perfect 100 Lighthouse score for performance).<p>It&#x27;s still early and I&#x27;d love to hear what you think!')
