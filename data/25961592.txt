He&#x27;s still involved in a variety of Pony decisions, discussions, etc. It&#x27;s a rather different role than what he had in the beginning when he was the primary coder on it.<p>There was an uptick in contributions that were driven by Wallaroo Labs that involved improvements that were needed for Wallaroo, beyond that, it&#x27;s all volunteers.<p>If you&#x27;d be interested in contributing, swing by the Zulip. We love to get new folks involved.')
