I was the first hire of a batch that made the IT department 2.5x bigger.<p>Some of the initial red flags were all the empty desks with readily available computers and multiple monitor setups, and the fact the IT manager was a guy who struggled to communicate in English or the local language.<p>Long story short, one year after I joined all the IT department (including me) had left, with the manager being the only exception. We found out the hard way the company had a long story of hiring batches of developers and struggling to make payroll in the following months, which the CEO &quot;fixed&quot; by having the IT manager create a very toxic environment where people blamed each other for all sorts of things, thus distracting themselves from the elephant in the room (the company was broke and the CEO didn&#x27;t care, and our manager was little more than a puppet).<p>My main takeaways were:<p>- Financially unsound companies are likely to have a toxic work environment.<p>- You should look for signs of high, recent employee turnover the first time you visit your employer&#x27;s offices.')
