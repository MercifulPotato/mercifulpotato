(So arguably the laws that allow that might be &#x27;bad&#x27;.)<p>Finally, while it&#x27;s not as bad for AWS, for App &#x2F; Play Store it&#x27;s like only having two landlords in the whole Western World, and get evicted from both (one of which still allows you to set up your tent in his garbage dump).<p>&gt; AWS gave them the time agreed to in the contract to remove offending content and present a plan for continued moderation to prevent the same thing from happening a second time. They wouldn&#x27;t even commit to moderating the speech Amazon told them was in violation of the TOS.<p>This is not what Greenwald claims. Do you have any opposing evidence ?')
