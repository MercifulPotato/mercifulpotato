Banks do not view the problem of money forwarding scams large enough to fix. If there were added regulatory burden of getting fines, class action lawsuits, pressure from the media or Congress, then the economics may change enough to fix their operational deficiency.<p>Look at other dark patterns that used to exist but no longer do, like suppressed salary collusion between Google, Microsoft, Apple 15 years ago vs now.
