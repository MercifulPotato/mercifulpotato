For the latter two, obviously, having a track nearby is more important than the fact that it exists within the borders of their country.<p>I was at COTA for the inaugural F1 race, and had a fantastic time, and also traveled there to see Aussie V8 Supercars there.<p>That said, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d want to drive the track in a street car. I&#x27;ve driven it in sims I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s great at typical road car speeds.')
