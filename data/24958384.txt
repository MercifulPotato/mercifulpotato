My “40 includes wind + gas” was confusing, and if that’s “40 on average”, my bad.<p>My point was to address the idea that nuclear is too costly as a long term solution, which I <i>think</i> (?) OP was using that cost&#x2F;MWh comparison to intent.<p>FTR though, I do appreciate that gas + renewables can be a nice transition strategy (like the UK seems to have done to eradicate coal).<p>&gt; There is no 30&#x2F;70 split as you imagined.<p>It seems you understood I was talking about a 30&#x2F;70 split in cost. That is not what I said: I was talking about a 30&#x2F;70 split in usage.<p>But FTR, even in the sense I intended, you’re right, the number 30&#x2F;70 is wrong, or at least it can only be valid under specific conditions that I’m not really able to quantify (electricity mix, coverage of demand, etc), and I hadn’t thought it through a lot.')
