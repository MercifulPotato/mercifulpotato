This is just from mostly middle aged americans being frustrated with their facebook groups being deleted. It&#x27;s pretty easy to start chans out of the box and the userbase will eventually congregate to one place<p>&gt;&gt;Maybe you end up with three new chans, but you end up with three smaller, more fractured chans. Organization and relationships will evaporate because people won’t have alternate ways of recognizing or reaching their friends, may not use the same handles, may not end up on the same sites, etc.<p>This is pretty irrelevant to anonymous communities. Mostly they just move to like boards, i.e. 8chan, 16chan, 2ch, 4ch, endchan, infinite chan, and more all have an &#x2F;anime&#x2F; board. The point being that the board is more relevant than the chan site itself.')
