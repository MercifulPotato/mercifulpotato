This contrasts with a monopsony which relates to a single entity&#x27;s control of a market to purchase a good or service, and with oligopoly and duopoly which consists of a few sellers dominating a market.[1] Monopolies are thus characterized by a lack of economic competition to produce the good or service, a lack of viable substitute goods, and the possibility of a high monopoly price well above the seller&#x27;s marginal cost that leads to a high monopoly profit.[2]<p>For example, almost everyone can get their medication at Costco, Walmart, CVS, and Walgreens.')
