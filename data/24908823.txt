By the time we became aware of it, the Slack channel had been deleted; we attempted to recover it but were unable to...<p>I find this slightly worrying. We use the free tier of slack (which in itself is a bone of contention), one of the big problems being that there&#x27;s only a 10,000 message history available to users so useful information quite often drops out of view.<p>That said, Slack have specific admin tools to deal with harassment and bullying. Even on the free tier it&#x27;s possible to contact them and ask for this history, even if it&#x27;s been deleted by a user and even if it&#x27;s past the 10,000 limit. The fact they can&#x27;t get the chat log strikes me as suspicious.')
