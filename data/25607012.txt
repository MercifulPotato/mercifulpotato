I can review code or a product just as effectively remotely as I can sitting in an office chair. What I can&#x27;t do is walk the cubes and see who is sitting in front of their computer at the moment, and at least in my experience running IT for a moderately sized organization, this is what managers seem to have a problem with. Over the past several months I&#x27;ve had to fend off requests to pull reports on how many e-mails people have sent, setup mail forwards to their managers, line up VPN times to timecards, or find monitoring software for PCs, all in the name of making sure employees are &quot;working enough&quot;.<p>Fortunately so far I&#x27;ve been able to fend these off by pointing out that none of these are real metrics for what&#x27;s being actually being accomplished and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s really being exposed here is that the manager doesn&#x27;t know how to tell if an employee is doing a good job and&#x2F;or pulling their weight, and is trying to use butt-in-seat time as a proxy rather than figuring out what actually matters.<p>&gt; You can&#x27;t as easily come in and check-in when you need too, you need to formally setup meetings or reviews.<p>I can hit the call button on teams at any time. Sure it &quot;feels&quot; disruptive in a way walking into their cube didn&#x27;t, but in actuality I think their about equally disruptive. Managers tend to underestimate the impact of &quot;just swinging by&quot;.<p>&gt; Also it&#x27;s unpleasant to be on Zoom all day long, and since your job is just meetings all day, that&#x27;s your new reality.<p>I suspect most people would agree with you on preferring in-person meetings to Zoom. If we&#x27;e doing cameras I agree with you too, but... just don&#x27;t. I spent most of my meetings this summer out on my front lawn with a notepad watching the bees work the clover. Made them infinitely more tolerable than being stuck in a conference room.')
