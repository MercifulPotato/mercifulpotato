This number is incomplete because of a lag in reporting. The CDC estimates that there are at least 73,000 more deaths in weeks 1 through 48 that haven&#x27;t yet been received and processed.<p>(Note that this data includes the last 3 days of 2019.)<p>But even with the incomplete count, we have already surpassed 2018 and 2019.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to make predictions, especially about the future, but it looks we&#x27;re on track to have 3.2 million to 3.3 million deaths this year. We won&#x27;t have a firm grasp on the numbers until March.')
