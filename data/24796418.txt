I would get injured with regularity.<p>So then I went to a running shoe store and had them analyze my gait.  They “prescribed” a very expensive “high stability” shoe.  After a week in those I thought I had permanently damaged my knees.  Switched back to moderate shoes.<p>Then I tried minimal shoes.  At first I thought I was hurting my feet, but then I realized that they were just getting a workout for the first time.<p>I’ve been running in minimal shoes and have been injury free for quite a while now.
