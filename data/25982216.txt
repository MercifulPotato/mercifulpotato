Are you willing to trade income for a more relaxed job?<p>I am asking because I do believe that a healthier relationship with your job is absolutely worth the salary cut long term. I have already seen and heard plenty cases were people just dropped to 30ish hours&#x2F;week rather than working full 37.5h or 40h (and obviuously all of the overtime that just... occurs).<p>I think finding a sweet spot quality of life is really important. I am completely content at this instance in time and have no desire to make my work life more stressful for more money because I don&#x27;t need it. I have everything I desire, including an SO I care for more than &quot;the next level&quot; at work. It&#x27;s not that I am not ambitious but I have seen jobs wreak havoc on people&#x27;s lives with nearly nothing in return to show for it (aside from shit you don&#x27;t need).<p>Work is never worth more than you need to feel content. You&#x27;re not going to make serious money slaving away for some corp anyway. Assuming you&#x27;re a normal employee, use vacation days and call in as sick as often as you truly need it because you&#x27;re not gonna help your team&#x2F;project being frustrated and burned out.<p>Health is more important than some corp&#x27;s bottom line. You can power through shit at 22yo but even at 32yo your body will make itself known quicker than one would expect. I mean you must know better than me. No product releasing tomorrow is worth breaking your mental or physical health over!<p>You&#x27;re not really going to get more than a fishy handshake once you leave for whatever reason - even if you shouldered 80% of the weight for 10 years.<p>Also, you apparently amassed decades of experience - leave before you break if you can&#x27;t make it work. You&#x27;re worth something on the market. You will find a job with healthier conditions. Maybe less salary or whatever but again - unless you really depend on the money I&#x27;d rather take a cut here in favor of health.')
