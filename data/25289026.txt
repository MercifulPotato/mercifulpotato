To complete this benchmark workload, it took less than an hour in two different environments (Digital Ocean self-managed &amp; Timescale Forge fully managed) to ingest 1 billion metrics and run all 30K queries. It took us a week of work (testing, modifying code to try and make Timestream better) to get 40% of the metrics into Timestream and then query it. 1 hour vs 7 days.<p>2. If you look at the bill&#x2F;costs, the main driver was querying. We (attempted) to run the same 30K queries on less than half the data (410 million metrics) in Timestream and somehow scanned 21TB of data. I have no idea why and there&#x27;s nothing we could do to change it.<p>As a developer, that&#x27;s going to be your biggest unknown. If you&#x27;re ingesting millions or billions of metrics a day and querying it with a real application, you could really get hit with crazy query costs.<p>With a more traditional server architecture, at least you know your day-to-day costs and can set a known capacity to achieve the performance you need (or scale in understandable ways when you need it)')
