Genuinely curious.<p>The 0.02% or the more recent 0.06% rejection rate is very low. \nThink of it this way. Out of 1000 people taking a test that needed two signatures, that matched.  Only 2-6 did not not match. Thats an extremely low number.<p>This is why teachers are always reminding students not to forget to sign their test, in a class of 30, and that only requires one signature.<p>If you worked with the general public, and you asked them to tie their shoes, I honestly believe you would have a higher failure rate than 0.02%')
