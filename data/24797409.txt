Why aren&#x27;t students doing that instead of taking on debt? Or for that matter my not take all your courses online for mostly free?<p>1) it&#x27;s extremely hard to finish a course when no one is pushing you to do your work. You may be able to finish a few abut not 4 years worth.<p>2) Employers(society) put a lot of weight on where someone got their degree. Students are looking at a university&#x27;s reputation.<p>3) University is a social experience in addition to an educational one.<p>4) Many Students need additional help to learn in addition to the lectures.<p>There are more but I&#x27;ll stop there.<p>So given the previous, you need to charge enough to recreate some of the other things that students need from a university. It&#x27;s probably a few thousand a year but that&#x27;s after automating as much as possible. It&#x27;s not impossible but it&#x27;s a lot harder than just putting a few lectures online.')
