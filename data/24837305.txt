I don&#x27;t mean so much Agda, Idris, etc., which try to approach theorem proving from a programmer&#x27;s point of view. But theorem proving systems that embrace the full spectrum of abstract and correct thought.<p>Zig and Rust try to get there without paying the heavy price that theorem proving incurs (Rust pays that price more than Zig already, though). But to truly progress we need to pay that price and make it lower and lower with time.')
