It&#x27;s about <i>our</i> freedom to hear differing points of view and make up our own minds about them.<p>If a handful of corporations with mostly homogeneous ideologies control who is allowed to talk to the public, then we don&#x27;t have any real choice when it comes time to vote. We only get to choose from a pre-approved list of options that all have to conform to whatever Twitter and Facebook deem is acceptable. Twitter and Facebook et al are unelected and accountable to no one. That&#x27;s not democracy. That&#x27;s a corporate dictatorship with sham elections.')
