It&#x27;s more silent, slower and harder to stop if your self esteem is also low. This makes it a double-whammy since the person looks weak, approachable and gentle. Other party is also weak and attached to this approachable person hence, is somewhat powerless.<p>When everything is over, the victim is damaged much more deeply. Same person&#x27;s encounter with a narcissistic person is much more harmless since person with low-esteem will be driven away by the dominant, narcissistic person.')
