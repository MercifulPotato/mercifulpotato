Plus the whole 6% fee.<p>No, you&#x27;re not listening. TransferWise Borderless is a <i>bank account</i> into which you can deposit and retain US dollars or Euros or CAD or NZD, and any other currency you want, <i>even in Brazil</i>. There&#x27;s no 6% fee because there&#x27;s no conversion. There&#x27;s no exchange rate because <i>there&#x27;s no conversion</i>. Unless you elect to. <i>Read about it and then reply.</i> It stays in the currency which you receive. It&#x27;s a multi-currency online bank account.<p>They give you an account number and a routing number in the US, and in SEPA, and in the UK, and in Australia, and so on. You receive a domestic transfer. It shows up in your account in the foreign currency. And it stays in the foreign currency. Then you can send it elsewhere if you want. Or hold onto it.<p>Doesn&#x27;t expanding TWB sound way better than crypto? It&#x27;s nice and regulated, and insured too!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;transferwise.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;multi-currency-account&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;transferwise.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;multi-currency-account&#x2F;</a>')
