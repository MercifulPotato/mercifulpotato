I pay donations monthly to The Guardian, Glen Greenwald, Matt Taibbi, NPR, Apple News+, and Democracy Now. That is about $35&#x2F;month. I really try to ignore all other news sources unless a friend sends me a link to an article that they want me to read.<p>My wife and I also subscribe to streaming video entertainment, which is much more expensive, but she gets good value from it.<p>Off topic, but as Google gets some justifiable criticism here on HN, I am very happy with their paid services. I pay for Pro Colab, YouTube Music, GCP, and occasionally buy books and movies.<p>I detest the “free” models for content. I like Twitter because I follow some awesome tech people, but I wish I could pay a monthly fee and not see the advertising. Why they don’t offer that option seems a little crazy to me.')
