With 9p, for every T message there&#x27;s an R message that is waited on before the next T is sent. So if there&#x27;s 100ms of latency you have to wait 100ms between EVERY 9p message. Pain and suffering. The labs people never focused on performance but actually building a clean comprehensive system with the small team they had. It was a pragmatic approach for sure and compromises were made.<p>Though when using local ethernet, heavy graphics isn&#x27;t that bad. I can play doom over local ethernet using drawterm to a cpu server which is actually running the doom processes. Of course blowing up the game screen makes it suffer as doom doesn&#x27;t use dev draw.<p>Another thing to realize is that plan 9 graphics are done via dev draw which is a sort of 2d graphics engine that you load text and bitmaps into then issue commands to draw and move them around on screen. So a local dev draw on the terminal only receives draw commands for the loaded resources so there is some caching and heavy lifting done at the terminal end. It&#x27;s not like vnc or rdp where you are viewing a remote frame buffer.')
