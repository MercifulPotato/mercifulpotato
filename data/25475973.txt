Radio-friendly indie rock had its 15 minutes of fame in the 2000s and now it&#x27;s out of the mainstream. So what ? Metal&#x27;s sub-genres are on a seemingly never-ending expansion, psychedelic rock is doing great, new occult&#x2F;hard-rock&#x2F;doom&#x2F;acid bands are seemingly popping up every day, you&#x27;ve got stuff like Saharian blues-rock giving us awesome music [1] etc. Plus the tropes of rock music feeding into new forms of instrumentation (ie. electronic music).<p>And music isn&#x27;t restricted to bland rock, hip-hop or EDM archetypes. The spectrum of possibilities is infinite, and the spectrum of what comes out reflects it pretty well. Especially if you dare looking out of your little cultural fishbowl.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GZvPoE0EH1o" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=GZvPoE0EH1o</a>')
