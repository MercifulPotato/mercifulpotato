I experienced another, similar phenomenon, albeit not with the code itself.<p>I&#x27;ve done literally all my best work for the past 25 years in Emacs. Recently I decided to switch to Visual Studio Code because &quot;that&#x27;s where the momentum is now&quot;. Well, it lasted a few weeks and then it was back to Emacs. I wondered why this was.<p>I realized that despite using Borland and Microsoft IDEs in the 90s, I never acclimated to the way IDEs in general handle small tasks like bracket matching and indentation. Emacs does these things <i>right</i> in a way that virtually every other IDE-like editor does <i>wrong</i>. I can work with vim, but working with VSCode has a sort of tactile (instead of visual) &quot;ugliness&quot; about it that increases friction and makes me actually less productive.<p>That and the wrong way VSCode handles File &#x2F; Open by default made me frustrated enough to go back to Emacs.')
