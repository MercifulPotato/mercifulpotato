If you look at how much running you need to do to burn off a daily burger it&#x27;s intimidating.<p>The only caveat I&#x27;ve learned is that weightlifting can make a dent. It&#x27;s one of the few things where as you improve, you can burn more calories in the same amount of time instead of fewer (partly because you&#x27;re doing more work as you add weights, partly because the muscle you build is more metabolically expensive to maintain).<p>I also had success restructuring my life so accessing food was way more of a hassle. Kept a mostly empty fridge. Meal prepped so only whole meals were there. Don&#x27;t take money unless I know I need to buy something, found a few reasonable options at local sandwich places that became routine, etc.<p>I&#x27;d love to see a correlational study on fridge size and obesity. In America we buy SUV fulls of food, in Europe it&#x27;s much smaller frequent trips, i.e. generally higher hassle per calorie.')
