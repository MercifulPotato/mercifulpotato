It goes something like:<p>0. Know i will be working with C, expect that a C layer should exist<p>1. Open the docs for the C layer with SPC h l &lt;search for C&gt;,<p>2. In there, search how to set it up to use a lsp backend<p>3. add (c-c++ :variables c-c++-backend &#x27;lsp-ccls) and lsp to the list of layers<p>4. install ccls with my distros package manager<p>5. restart emacs and get to work<p>Sure, there are some more steps, but i don&#x27;t really see it as a burden. And oftentimes it&#x27;s even easier than that - open a file, get prompted to automatically install the appropriate layer, wait a bit while it does it&#x27;s thing and you&#x27;re ready to go. Ok, you should also uncomment the git layer in the configuration but it&#x27;s already there.<p>So yeah, i do recommend Spacemacs to the developers i know if they think they might be into a keyboard-centric experience to using the editor and other benefits that Emacs brings (buffer management is a big one for me). It was easy enough for me to jump on using it, without being familiar with Emacs beforehand and without knowing elisp. You do have to know basic vim, though.')
