We could have a similar discussion of how absolutists on the torture question aren&#x27;t doing a proper cost&#x2F;benefit analysis and are &quot;providing their opponents an easy strawman for a hollow victory.&quot;<p>I know this is Hacker News, but not every argument requires infinite nuance, we don&#x27;t need to sit down and examine the pros &amp; cons of torture or any other clear and obvious abuse of government power. We don&#x27;t need to dignify the position of &quot;read all citizens private correspondence&quot; with a cost&#x2F;benefit analysis.

It is permissible, even strategically valuable, to have certain positions that we are absolutist on, policies that aren&#x27;t tolerated under any conditions.')
