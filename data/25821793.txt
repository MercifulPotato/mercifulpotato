This includes Angular, but also Go and Firefox, for example. Their teams are working at a level too far detached from the general public to care, and they mostly focus on their internal priorities instead. And that&#x27;s a valid approach to managing your FOSS project - it comes with no express or implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, in all caps no less.<p>If a bug report does not immediately catch the attention of the maintainers under such circumstances, it&#x27;s unlikely to do so later on. The maintainers don&#x27;t care about dupes, because they didn&#x27;t care about the original either. They&#x27;re going to have tens of thousands of tickets no matter what.<p>Of course, if you find yourself at the wrong end of this process, the best way to get attention for your bug report is to attach a patch.')
