Doesn&#x27;t Hacker News let readers downvote unpopular opinions until they&#x27;re effectively erased? Why isn&#x27;t anyone calling HN on its censorship? Is it just the size of the viewership that matters, as if, after a big enough user threshold you have to act like a public service? I&#x27;m being honest here, why should Youtube have to host any uploaded video it doesn&#x27;t want to? Question to free speech absolutists: should Youtube allow pornographic videos on its site? What about extremely violent videos, like car crash fatalities, etc? What about child pornography? Why does Youtube &#x2F;have&#x2F; to host garbage?\nIsn&#x27;t the issue here something else, that a lot of people now have bandwith to express what they want, yet the biggest channels for this expression are just like every other important commercial segment, in that a few very big companies are in control of most of the bandwith? When did network TV stations were accused of censorship if they didn&#x27;t want to air a KKK ad, or interview one of its leaders just because he wanted to air his opinions on race?')
