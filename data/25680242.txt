Item(by='Aachen', descendants=None, kids=[25680321, 25680863], score=None, time=1610069342, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25680212, text='Planting trees, carbon capture, etc. is NOT &quot;going faster&quot;. It&#x27;s definitely good if you can do it supplementary, if you have money to burn after funding things that will help reduce emissions (roof insulation, double windows, replace car with electric car, add rooftop solar, fund a solar park or wind turbine nearby, etc.), but in virtually all cases it&#x27;s much more expensive than reducing emissions and helping others do the same. We need to explore how to live sustainably rather than hope everyone will pay for their share of carbon capture (in the form of trees or whatever) while &quot;the others&quot; fix the underlying problem. We&#x27;d need an absolutely humongous number of trees or capture plants to retrieve today&#x27;s emissions.<p>That said, I was actually just writing about the topic of planting trees :)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25680156" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25680156</a><p>&gt; For what it&#x27;s worth, if you have unavoidable emissions today that you want to compensate, and want to also fund the people working on CO2 capturing technology, see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;climeworks.shop" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;climeworks.shop</a> for a pay-what-you-want option. I don&#x27;t really believe in planting trees (which is way cheaper per ton of CO2 it claims to absolve you of), and these machines apparently emit &quot;only&quot; 10kg for every 100kg of CO2 captured (90% effective sounds reasonable), and it&#x27;s accounted for who claimed which share of the machine&#x27;s captured volume so it sounds directly effective to me. It&#x27;s just that the scale is peanuts and will remain so until public bodies and companies start to run out of emission reduction options and decide to use it - but at that point we better have this tech geared up.<p>I do need to sleep still tonight (0230 here) so I won&#x27;t now type out (on mobile) the reasons I don&#x27;t think trees are a reliable option. And by tomorrow it won&#x27;t matter anymore, nobody will read it (I don&#x27;t like the ephemerality of HN&#x2F;reddit threads.) So these are my 2ct, hope I could clarify my reasoning as I will go sleep now.')
