I&#x27;ll agree, there&#x27;s a chance someone earning a high salary has some in depth knowledge in their field.<p>Or maybe they&#x27;re a manager with some good connections?<p>Or hell maybe they have in depth knowledge and they&#x27;re a manager with good connections.<p>Maybe that commenter earning a low wage has spent their life immersing themself in that knowledge because they enjoy it but never made it a career.<p>The amount of money someone has doesn&#x27;t necessarily correlate to how much they know about something.<p>Money comes and goes, having lots of it let&#x27;s you have and do some pretty cool things, let&#x27;s you not worry about necessities so much, let&#x27;s you throw some weight around.<p>But I disagree it&#x27;s a good indicator of how much knowledge a person has on a subject or that it automatically makes them a trusted authority on something.')
