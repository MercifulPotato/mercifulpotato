Particularly in a situation where you need to roll your own priority queue.<p>That&#x27;s why I said it&#x27;s likely the person who built it would done a bit of research. When hiring someone I care that they remember enough to realize that and are capable of doing the research, more than that they remember exactly how to implement some data structure.<p>&gt;If I could have this conversation that we&#x27;re having right here, right now with them then they&#x27;d probably pass my hiring bar.<p>I think that&#x27;s a totally reasonable. My problem is that this isn&#x27;t what people are complaining about when complaining about white board interviews.<p>99% of the time the interviewer is asking for the answer to a very specific problem that is highly biased towards new grads who would have just seen it on a test.<p>And even if they say you don&#x27;t care about the optimal solution they will always hire the person who gets the optimal solution in 15 minutes b&#x2F;c they memorized it versus the person takes 30 min to bang out something that kind of works.<p>Here&#x27;s my approach:<p>I ask someone else on my team to come up with an interview problem, so I haven&#x27;t seen it before hand. Then I work with the candidate on hashing out a solution.')
