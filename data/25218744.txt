For example you need a block with holes in it with particular spacing, particular diameter and particular depth. CAD packages like Fusion 360, SolidWorks, FreeCAD etc. are all dedicated to this task and make features like constraints and measurements front and center.<p>Blender on the other hand is, at least in my experience of it, all about bringing somebody&#x27;s artistic vision into a 3D environment. It&#x27;s usually not important to somebody&#x27;s vision that parts meet dimensional constraints, it&#x27;s more important that it looks &quot;right&quot;. And so Blender is full of tools that allow humans to change things to arbitrary dimensions.<p>Does it really make sense to try and fit both of these use-cases into one tool? I can&#x27;t help but think that Blender would come out worse for it.<p>And that&#x27;s CAD, I really can&#x27;t come up with any reason why CAM would make sense in Blender.<p>Is there something I&#x27;m missing?')
