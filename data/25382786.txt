While this might be true in some ways and to some extent, it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s also very easy to deceive yourself about. You can easily make up a story about how distinctions that one language does (or doesn&#x27;t) draw reflect the excellence or more appropriate priorities of its speakers&#x27; culture. Like &quot;oh, this language makes distinctions that English doesn&#x27;t -- because the people who speak it are so attuned to perceiving fine details!&quot; or &quot;oh, this language doesn&#x27;t make distinctions that English does -- showing how its speakers are not distracted by the pointless minutia that occupy us in settled industrial civilization!&quot;.<p>A challenge to this kind of analysis is that studies of linguistic typology (deep structural features that languages do or don&#x27;t have in common) show languages with, and without, particular characteristics <i>all over the world</i>, in languages spoken by people from all different kinds of cultures and societies. Most generalizations that might be given a higher significance just sort of fall flat when you look at typology data. Oh, that cool thing that we like in this language -- is also present in this other language from a different culture and part of the world! Oh, that thing we find annoying or irritating -- is present elsewhere too.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Linguistic_typology" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Linguistic_typology</a><p>A kind of counterexample that I learned from John McWhorter&#x27;s books is that complicated irregularities in languages (e.g. a very large number of noun classes with distinctive classifiers and agreement rules, or a very large number of irregular verb forms) are likely a sign of smaller and more isolated speaker communities, whereas simplification that removes these irregularities is associated with circumstances in which more people have to use a language non-natively (and therefore have a harder time mastering these details), which could include migration, social disruptions, or the widespread use of a language as a lingua franca, trade language, language of imperial administration, etc. That does mean that indigenous languages (especially if they have almost exclusively been used by a native speaker community in a relatively small area) can often be harder to learn for non-native speakers.<p>But you still can&#x27;t necessarily count on cultural generalizations based on those observations. One exercise you can try to do (maybe this is also an idea from McWhorter?) is pick a random set of characteristics that some language might have, and then try to come up with an essay explaining why those features show how awesome or admirable the speakers&#x27; culture must be. If it sounds deeply plausible, then maybe that&#x27;s a sign that people aren&#x27;t actually good at being objective about this. :-)')
