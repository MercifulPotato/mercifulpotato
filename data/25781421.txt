It is currently cheaper to use the land and needs to, over decades that will have to change by necessity. I surely do appreciate the scale as I have family in farming and it is massive.  However, land is also in demand and will only grow, eventually it won&#x27;t be economical for many types of crop.  Already marijuana and herbs are mostly vertical&#x2F;indoors. Anything that grows in a greenhouse currently is apt for vertical&#x2F;indoor farming.<p>Lots of innovations are underway for it. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;interestingengineering.com&#x2F;13-vertical-farming-innovations-that-could-revolutionize-agriculture" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;interestingengineering.com&#x2F;13-vertical-farming-innov...</a><p>The comments here are alot like the EV comments back in 2000, can&#x27;t be done, battery tech not there, no way to fuel on long trips etc etc.<p>Eventually the necessity will require it either due to population, climate change or other planets.<p>Sure, right this very moment it isn&#x27;t as viable, but it is for many industries like herbs, marijuana and as you say niche products.  That is how all innovations start.<p>Farming will still be massive on land when this happens as cattle, pigs, chickens etc need lots of land. Many of the biggest farms are cattle ranches so those won&#x27;t be going anywhere much longer.')
