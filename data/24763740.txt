Then a huge number of scripting languages appeared basically saying: &quot;let&#x27;s do everything at runtime!&quot;.<p>There is another trend where correctness is the driving factor (Haskell, Rust). Proving correctness on large programs tends to be CPU&#x2F;memory intensive, so in a sense that trend is also enabled by hardware.')
