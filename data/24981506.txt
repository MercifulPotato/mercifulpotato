The tax base would be reduced by 10-50% if not more (due to progressive taxation) and though it may even out in the end, it would make tax receipts unpredictable and likely somewhat lower overall.<p>I don’t see the issue with corporate taxation - it’s a liability shield, and it has a cost. Those who don’t like it can do a tax pass-through and risk the liability. Almost no one wants to do that.')
