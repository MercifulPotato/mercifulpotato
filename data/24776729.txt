If you can’t distinguish yourself from the pack in some small ways, it’s going to be harder for you to win elections. Taking that back to the Special Mayoral election, London Breed managed to do just that, over Mark Leno and Jane Kim who had this kind of mutual endorsement deal going on exploiting the nature of the ranked choice voting.<p>But it <i>is</i> a power struggle internal to the Democratic Party. Sure you have different people with different ideas about where to go, what to do, but overall the trajectory is largely the same, and to be frank, it isn’t a direction I <i>like</i>. I still don’t know if I was naïve in hitching my wagon to the Democratic Party when I came of age, if I was never really in agreement with it, or of it just left me, and I’ve been trying to figure that out. What I do know is that there’s no place for <i>me</i> in it anymore, but whether I was naïve before, then and now, they’re still the only game in town and the combination of Ranked-Choice Voting and Open Primaries is further cementing them both here and in localities around here. I have my ballot in front of me, and for every race below President, it is virtually indistinguishable from a Democratic primary ballot because that is in effect what our General elections around here have become, a question of whose career do you want to advance or maintain under the auspices of this particular party banner?<p>&gt; Again, if your focus is policing people&#x27;s sex lives and consensual relationships, it&#x27;ll all look the same to you.<p>Since nobody has mentioned anything of the like in this comment chain, I’m forced to conclude you’re making certain assumptions about me and insinuating something unsavory there. Maybe my conclusion is wrong, you tell me. Unfortunately for you, that’s never been something I gave a crap about. I’m not some bloody transplant weirded out by the Castro, I grew up in the Castro, and for the moment it is still my home.')
