Pre-OS X, they really were wonderful, best in class without a doubt.  I kinda get the attraction back in the early 2000s, when Linux could still be a chore and Macs were a decent choice to get a computer which had a shell and ran real software.  But now?  They are just not for me.  I want to own my own computer, write my own software and control my own destiny.')
