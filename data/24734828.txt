Two can play the game of cherrypicking troughs and peaks.<p>This is just wrong: the article is not talking about inflation; it is talking about indexing the minimum wage to productivity. Eyeballing the graph from the original article (and projecting productivity back to 1949), if indexed to productivity, then minimum wage would be at ~$15.<p>Your subsequent criticisms have more merit, but the article addresses them as well. You may disagree with the article&#x27;s arguments, but you should at least acknowledge them.<p>&gt; It would be claimed that the productivity of minimum wage workers has not kept pace with average productivity growth, so that it would not be feasible for minimum wage workers to earn pay that rises in step with average productivity growth.<p>&gt; There is some truth to this claim, but only at a superficial level. The productivity of any individual worker is determined not just by their skills and technology, but also by the institutional structure we put in place.')
