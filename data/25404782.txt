I got a tv for christmas.  When I set it up it scanned for channels.  It picked up channels with decimals in the high range and there were pay movies on but when they finished the channel would go dead.  The next day I rescanned the channels because of fuzzyness and it picked up new channels with decimals.  This time some of the movies were x-rated.<p>I would rescan daily usually in the evenings and watch what other people paided for.  Thursdays and Fridays were good. During the day mostly kids movies.<p>In the mornings someone would watch a porn fast forward 10 minutes to one specific part.. slow down the video to play 2 minutes then turn it off.  Very funny.<p>If you are in a building let your tv scan for channels in the evenings.  If you see a decimal high channels you may have it too.')
