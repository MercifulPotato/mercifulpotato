It was developed by people who were working 80-100 hour&#x2F;11-14x7 work weeks literally putting themselves in the line of gunfire to establish a 40 hour week. There&#x27;s nothing sacrosanct about the 40 hour week or the 2 day weekend <i>at all</i> except the value we give it (or the value we let employers extract from it).')
