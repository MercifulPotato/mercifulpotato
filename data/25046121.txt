And since it usually makes a LOT more financial sense, it can often make a lot of the other points moot as well, because you could save so much more working at a FAANG that you could afford to take time off to do whatever you want, or retire early.<p>I mean, in this example Baremetrics actually had a pretty good outcome, better than most, and the employee&#x27;s basically got very, very little for their overall equity. Even the founder probably got less than a mid&#x2F;senior level FAANG employee would get (and the FAANG employee had no risk).<p>Of course, not everyone can get an offer at a FAANG, but again, if you <i>could</i> get an offer, startups basically never make sense anymore. You almost always will get more <i>even if the startup hits</i>, which is rare.')
