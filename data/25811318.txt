But currently all &quot;land&quot; on the internet is privately owned, and people who disagree with landowners are told to &quot;buy their own land&quot;. That&#x27;s unjust, you wouldn&#x27;t advocate that in physical reality. People should simply be free to talk. Either create &quot;public land&quot; on the internet, or force &quot;private land&quot; to allow everyone to talk.')
