Currently all &quot;land&quot; on the internet is privately owned, so &quot;land owners&quot; can stop people from talking. That&#x27;s unjust, and appealing to the sanctity of &quot;land ownership&quot; doesn&#x27;t make it just. Neither is the demand to build your own platform - it&#x27;s like the demand to buy some land if you want to talk. No, people should simply be free to talk. Either create &quot;public land&quot; on the internet, or force &quot;private land&quot; to allow everyone to talk.')
