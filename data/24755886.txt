Lambda&#x2F;Function implementations do this right, and also support multiple requests per process, so the overhead can be more manageable. People who are nostalgic for CGI ought to be running something like OpenWhisk (or using AWS Lambda), not FastCGI.<p>If you&#x27;re going to all the trouble of creating a FastCGI service, you might as well also create an HTTP service and route to that.')
