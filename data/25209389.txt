Did you mean that nothing has to be installed in the docker image?<p>Either way, you should check to see if they already have Unbound installed and not clobber their configuration file.  Hopefully most people would figure this out before running the script, but it is just a suggestion.  If they do have it installed, consider adding a file to &#x2F;etc&#x2F;unbound&#x2F;conf.d&#x2F; and running the config check first before reloading and after the unbound-checkconf returns status code 0.<p><pre><code>  unbound-checkconf</code></pre>')
