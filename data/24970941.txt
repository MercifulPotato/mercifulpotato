It was fun, and worked really well.<p>Git is truly decentralized, in that each developer has a full copy of the code and its history, and any of these copies can be used as the source for other copies.<p>&gt; In a true decentralized system (e.g. Bittorrent, Bitcoin, etc.) it&#x27;s practically impossible to delete something, and there would be plenty of accessible copies of data in jurisdictions that are out of reach of any single country&#x27;s law enforcement, and even out of reach of the original creator to delete, so the original creator&#x27;s government would not be able to force them to delete it.<p>That&#x27;s how it works with git; everyone who cloned the repository to their desktop (for instance, to develop and contribute a patch) has a full copy of the history up to that moment, and that copy is out of the reach of both other jurisdictions and the original creator. There&#x27;s no way to even know how many of them there are, much less who has them.')
