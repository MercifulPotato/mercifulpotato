In our unequal society, some people have 100s of potential partners waiting in line for them while for others, they will never get a single chance in their entire lifetimes. Same with career opportunities. Either you&#x27;re rich and have more opportunities every single day than you can possibly fathom or you don&#x27;t have a single good opportunity in your entire lifetime.<p>What&#x27;s more tragic about it is that it has increasingly little to do with merit or hard work and increasingly more to do with dumb luck. It&#x27;s all social networking; but that&#x27;s totally random. People are only selecting friends and partners based on capital these days, not based on any other meaningful characteristic. People are just appendages to the capital... Capital is the agent. People are replaceable.<p>You can thank the reserve banks for that.')
