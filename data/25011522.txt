My personal journey as a programmer started before Robocode (with TI-83 Basic -&gt; TI-83 Assembly), but it was Robocode that truly &quot;sparked&quot; my interest in the field.<p>Back in the day, there were competitions and discussions about strategy. Mods to the base game and more. I don&#x27;t know how much the community is active... but I honestly never got &quot;competitive&quot; at the game.<p>Nonetheless, beating the demo-bots that came packaged with the game (&quot;Wall Bot&quot; or &quot;Circle Bot&quot;... and of course &quot;SittingDuck&quot;) was fun enough to get me into programming. Hopefully this game can continue to inspire a new generation of programmers, even if things have changed in the past 19 years.')
