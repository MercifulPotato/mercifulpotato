The world is worse off because of the Internet?<p>The Internet has been the single best thing that has happened to the world ever. Information is effectively free now. It&#x27;s given limitless opportunity to billions of people everywhere in the world, regardless of class or wealth or social status. Largely, the Internet itself is not discriminatory.<p>Sure, it has its downsides, like misinformation, and 1 in 10m people getting locked out of their accounts.<p>I lost my Google account, which was tied to my phone number (Google Voice), a few years ago. It sucked. But, honestly, it wasn&#x27;t even as bad as losing my license.<p>I&#x27;ll take free information for that.')
