Now I can yell &quot;Find my phone&quot; (or wallet, keys, etc) and my phone is there.  Yes I could go to my computer, go to the find my phone page, but there&#x27;s just more friction and these issues happen to me all the time.  The more things I link up to voice control, the more options I have in regards to accomplish a task, and sometimes voice is the most efficient means of going about it.<p>I can get entertainment like a podcast or music without a single screen being involved, which given that I inherently have low impulse control, is a nice separation of things.  Or I can again, find my stuff without looking at any screens.  Voice input can act as a lesser evil to screens.<p>Saying to just use FOSS and air gaps, because of how immature such solutions are, is effectively saying you shouldn&#x27;t use these systems at all.  The benefits of using the systems that exist today makes it so that the average person, like yourself, judge me less because I appear more punctual and less forgetful and more productive and better rested and so on.  Being human, you are likely to disrespect me for being late and disorganized no matter what my excuse is, whereas you&#x27;ll only disrespect me for using voice assistants if you know I&#x27;m using them, so it&#x27;s a winning tradeoff.  Just like how some will judge me for taking medication but only if they know I&#x27;m using it.')
