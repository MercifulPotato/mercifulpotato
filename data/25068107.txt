You cannot be forced to unlock your smartphone via PIN, or share your password.<p>Ok that&#x27;s why I said fingerprints are different to passwords?<p>&gt; Your fingerprint can be unreadable under circumstances. With sandpaper you can remove it.<p>Please don&#x27;t nitpick. You don&#x27;t really think I didn&#x27;t know that.<p>&gt; Inaccurate, and untrue. They&#x27;re all over the place.<p>Your username is `Fnoord`. How can I get your fingerprint just as easily? I did not say it is <i>very difficult</i> to get someone&#x27;s fingerprint if you want, just that it is harder than getting a username. You can just <i>ask</i> people for their usernames, people will usually give them out to strangers. Try that with fingerprints.<p>In fact, if it is just as easy to get a username as a fingerprint, here&#x27;s my username: IshKebab. Now can you find my fingerprint?')
