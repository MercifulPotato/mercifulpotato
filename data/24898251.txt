You need to have a control group, in order to assess the efficacy (and safety) of the vaccine. If the control group is wearing masks and socially distancing, but the vaccinated group is going partying at bars and clubs every night, then comparisons of how often each group gets infected won&#x27;t have much meaning.<p>It&#x27;s only unethical to withhold the vaccine if you know that it&#x27;s safe and effective. The whole point of the study is to figure out if that&#x27;s the case. It&#x27;s possible for vaccine candidates to be ineffective, or even harmful (e.g., antibody-dependent enhancement).')
