FB has banned accounts even if there is no violent content, simply due to affiliation with QAnon, per this new policy on militarized social movements.<p>This seems like selective enforcement given that there are large numbers of groups used by protesters&#x2F;rioters of various affiliations (BLM, antifa, police defunding groups, etc) that are still permitted to operate on Facebook-owned platforms despite issuing calls for (or support of) violence and criminal acts. The official Facebook blog post claims to have banned many antifa-related pages and groups, but numerous such pages remain, including prominent ones with clearly proven records of criminality.<p>For example, the everyday march groups in Seattle (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;instagram.com&#x2F;morningmarchseattle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;instagram.com&#x2F;morningmarchseattle</a>), which are BLM-affiliated, are still allowed to operate on the platform, even though they regularly hijack public infrastructure. This is despite their role in dangerous incidents like trapping drivers in a tunnel recently (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twitch.tv&#x2F;videos&#x2F;742848253?t=00h35m36s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twitch.tv&#x2F;videos&#x2F;742848253?t=00h35m36s</a>) and terrorizing residents at their home by demanding they leave the neighborhood (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nypost.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;14&#x2F;seattle-blm-protesters-demand-white-people-give-up-their-homes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nypost.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;14&#x2F;seattle-blm-protesters-demand-...</a>). I see far more concrete, actual violence from rioters&#x2F;antifa&#x2F;BLM-affiliated groups than with QAnon, which seems more like a distant joke. Shouldn’t Facebook revise their priorities accordingly?')
