Sorry about the length of that last sentence.<p>It would also encourage devs to have an idea of how every section of the product works, not just their specific window into it :)<p>Combine that with enforcing non-work time and it _should_ be cool as long as your company isn&#x27;t trying to take advantage of you. I don&#x27;t have Slack installed on my phone because I&#x27;ve learned that any problems with my code are either a) not serious enough to get me to work at 9pm (i.e. it can wait until morning), or b) serious enough to warrant an actual phone call (because let&#x27;s face it, I could be out in the yard, out grocery shopping, etc. and not able to use a computer and read Slack or email messages conveniently).<p>Startups in particular can sometimes take advantage of employee&#x27;s willingness to be available 24&#x2F;7 by expecting _all_ employees to be available 24&#x2F;7, but that should definitely be voluntary.')
