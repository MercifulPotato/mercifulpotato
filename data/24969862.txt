Item(by='uberman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604334682, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24968760, text='I work in the higher ed space and this article infuriates me.<p>Were you asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement prior to taking the course?<p>I would reach out to the Dean of Students Dr. Zelon Crawford if you have not already. You might also speak to the Office of the Ombudsman.<p>The Adjunct Professor in question has only been at CBS since March. This is likely her first or second class and my guess is her fellow partners are pissed that she is bragging to her class about things they think are important. That is between her and the rest of the &quot;investing partners&quot; at Durable and should have nothing to do with you.<p>The class she offers is called &quot;Compounders&quot; and as you rightly point out, that is not a proprietary or even novel concept in investing. The rules of 70 and 72 can be traced back more than 500 years. She clearly cannot teach this topic then say oh by the way everything in this class in retroactively confidential despite there being a wikipedia page on it.<p>The CBS faculty (the real ones), the school as a whole and the university should clearly stand behind you (legally if needed) and politely ask &quot;One of Canada&#x27;s Most Powerful Women&quot; to go back to her &quot;day&quot; job. It is shameful that the University has not already clearly protected its students from an ADJUCT for god&#x27;s sake who is threatening her students because they want to independently explore the topic of a class she co-teaches.<p>No one should be fooled into thinking that this professor is a benign victim here. She is one of the two founding partners at Durable. It looks to me that the other partners are pissed now and as is always the case, the efforts to cover up a potential mistake are resulting in a Streisand Effect.')
