The fact that people could 10+ year sentences for possession of cannabis (with no charge of intent to distribute) through a combination of mandatory minimum sentences and so-called three strikes laws was and is a massive travesty of justice.<p>I 100% support the legalization of recreational cannabis use.<p>I also support not criminalizing addiction.<p>That all being said, if you look at cities like Seattle or San Francisco (eg the Tenderloin) you see the negative externalities that a lack of enforcement brings. People open shooting heroin in the streets doesn&#x27;t seem like a good outcome. For anyone.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t know where the happy middle ground is here.')
