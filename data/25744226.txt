This gives us several months between the worst of their Influenza cases on the far side of the world and us needing to inject our vulnerable populations with a vaccine.<p>This means the relatively mild flu load in Australia and especially New Zealand actually hurt this year&#x27;s Northern Hemisphere guess - they were isolating because of COVID-19 and so they had far fewer than usual cases on which to base guesses.')
