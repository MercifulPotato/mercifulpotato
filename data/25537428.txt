Item(by='mercora', descendants=None, kids=[25542451], score=None, time=1608914601, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25534095, text='no, the via part is just not considered. it does not make much sense to try though as it is impossible to have multiple peers with the same AllowedIPs addresses set. if it would honor the via address and allow me to configure multiple peers with the same AllowedIPs setting some dynamic routing could be made possible but it is not. However, i do configure it like you described just for consistency reasons when looking at the routing tables.<p>i.e. i could have peer A at 172.16.1.1 and peer B at 172.16.2.1. peer A would have AllowedIPs=172.16.1.1&#x2F;32,172.16.0.0&#x2F;24 and peer B would have AllowedIPs=172.16.2.1&#x2F;32,172.16.0.0&#x2F;24 and i could decide which peer gets traffic for 172.16.0.0&#x2F;24 using the routing table by setting the via address to either 172.16.1.1 or 172.16.2.1 respectively. however, as stated this is not even allowed as only one peer would be able to have that subnet in its AllowedIPs setting present.')
