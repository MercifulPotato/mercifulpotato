No one I know uses Whatsapp over here.<p>I did however do what others are suggesting. I installed Signal, and told my close family and friends to install it to communicate with me - and to not use standard SMS anymore.<p>While I did get a bit of grief over it initially, we are all happily using Signal now, and more people I know are moving to it all the time.<p>It&#x27;s also a great middle ground for iPhone and Android users to communicate.')
