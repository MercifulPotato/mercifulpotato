I bought in 2008 and cash offers were still preferred over 20% down, which was preferred over less than 20% down.  It&#x27;s because when you make the purchase agreement, the buyer can get a bunch of outs, many of which are based on financing not getting approved.  The more difficult your financing situation, the more chance there is of it falling though.')
