Both sides are filled with inconsistent hogwash, but at least in US politics the right is much more focused on staying on message.  Deep down the modern right was formed from multiple independent groups so unity is what ties it all together.  The left is far more fragmented and therefore more willing to bend.<p>What’s interesting is both the left and right are actually forming a unified belief system in younger people.  It’s going to be interesting to see what happens over the next 50 years as demographic forces shift the political landscape.  Politicians know how to be ideology flexible, the general public adds some real friction.')
