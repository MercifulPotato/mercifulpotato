You seem to be assuming that more available jobs of any kind = better for workers over time, but a quick review of the US labor market over the last 30 years shows this isn&#x27;t really the case at all.  I&#x27;m also not sure why you&#x27;re bringing Japan into this discussion - its economic, demographic, and societal conditions are so different from the US that it doesn&#x27;t make much sense to use it as a comparison.')
