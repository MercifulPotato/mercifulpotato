That is the first that I&#x27;m hearing of this. That&#x27;s crazy. Even without doing all of this, Robinhood having the ability to unpredictably&#x2F;arbitrarily decide when to disable&#x2F;enable actions on stocks is extremely bad for the market. They disguise this as protecting their users, but you cannot expect to have freedom as an investor if you don&#x27;t know when or if you will be able to make a trade because a stock &quot;isn&#x27;t allowed right now&quot;.<p>Part of the problem is that Robinhood treats their user-base like children. Nobody wants to be protected from risky decisions or from themselves and you can&#x27;t just do that to people. It is an insult and an unfair withholding of the right of risk and the means to make money from the little guy. That&#x27;s the dumbest thing I have ever heard. Risk should be a right. Nobody should be able to force you to not take a risk.<p>I understand that talking to someone off a bridge is a wonderful thing, but at the end of the day, that person is never withheld the right to jump.')
