Item(by='b20000', descendants=None, kids=[25162957], score=None, time=1605894347, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25161220, text='IMHO one of the main problems of open source is that you cannot personally police the use of your project because you do not have the time or money to do so. So once it&#x27;s open source someone can use bits and pieces of your intellectual property without ever letting you know, and how are you going to find out? This is true for example for obscure tricks relating to optimizations when dealing with OS interfacing code or with specific algorithm implementations. I have a few large code bases I have thought about open sourcing and the lack of solutions to these problems have kept me from doing it. Yes, I can use GPL, but how do I efficiently also license it for commercial use and how do I monitor the use without needing to pay lawyers to police all of it? If you deal with an industry with thousands of indie developers this becomes even more complicated.')
