But fortunately our friends at Our World In Data have collected a nice graph of it:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;covid-19-death-rate-vs-population-density?minPopulationFilter=1000000&amp;time=latest" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ourworldindata.org&#x2F;grapher&#x2F;covid-19-death-rate-vs-po...</a><p>As you can see, it&#x27;s not easy to draw a trendline that would show that a higher population density would produce higher covid infection rate. Basically, the pattern is what you get from a shotgun.')
