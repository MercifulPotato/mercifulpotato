It can be a treated as a light weight replacement for say an Andrew NG course. You wont learn anything practical &#x2F; code something in PyTorch or Tensorflow but you ll understand what happens under the hood in these framework<p>&quot;Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems&quot; is an amazing introduction to implementing all ML ideas. I think there is a new PyTorch version. The accompanying notebook will get you started to a point where you can do some hobby projects.<p>This book surprisingly seems to fill an interesting gap explaining about how these ML systems are used in real life in large scale. I work for 1 of the FAANG companies &amp; I can say that every chapter here would correspond to bread &amp; butter of a team responsible for maintaining a large ML system say Recommendation &#x2F; Fraud detection. The target audience would be someone who is interested to learn how to put a large end-end ML system together.<p>I would be very excited if there are practical examples on how to use this with MLFlow &#x2F; KubeFlow &#x2F; Sagemaker. Really excited to read this<p>edit : typos')
