Item(by='platinumrad', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603275778, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24834838, text='Clang does not check MISRA rules or calculate other metrics that are considered important in embedded industries.<p>The vast majority of MISRA rules are either purely syntactic (governing things as trivial as variable names) or obvious to the point of uselessness (like &quot;don&#x27;t violate the One Definition Rule&quot;). The few actually useful ones require dataflow analysis but frankly Polyspace doesn&#x27;t appear to do a very good job at it. My impression was that it achieved a 0% false negative rate by way of a 99.99% false positive rate. However, we never reported any of these false positives as bugs as the reports likely would have been rejected outright. The bugs we reported were all far more clear, such as the tool refusing to compile perfectly valid code, or glitches in the user interface.<p>I&#x27;m honestly not privy to most of the politics and no longer work in this area, but my impression was that even if Clang were to implement these checks, it would not be taken seriously by auditors as it doesn&#x27;t come with a price tag or tick other boxes like generating nice PDF reports with violation counts and so on.')
