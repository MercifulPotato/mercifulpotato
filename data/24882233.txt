I had amazing managers, but the crazy demands of their jobs ate up the time they needed to really optimize their teams. They had to support an army of engineers without the time or tools needed to understand what was going on in the scrums. My goal, and CodeGem’s mission, is to optimize software teams by giving managers the analytics and tools needed to foster teams that love what they do.<p>CodeGem integrates with the tools that software engineers use to collaborate (eg. GitHub, Slack, Jira) to automatically generate analytics that give managers the full picture of their team along with tools, like our 1:1 framework (that is not a google doc!) to take action.
