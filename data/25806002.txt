Author said people would be more impressed by code - but I think a protocol spec along with a reference implementation would be useful.<p>I went and looked for a protocol spec as well.  When I didn&#x27;t see anything concrete on the site in the submission title, I poked around the comments a bit more and found a link to the Github issue[0] requesting detail with respect to the architecture of the TMTP protocol.<p>I further poked around in the appropriate places[1] but found nothing remotely related.<p>The protocol spec[2], while useful in defining the control mechanisms and message formats is vague or silent when it comes to a variety (too many to list completely here) of functional, operational and implementation issues.<p>A comparison of TMTP&#x27;s spec with SMTP[3] (&quot;the protocol at the root of all these problems&quot;[2] with messaging), is quite illuminating.<p>While SMTP by itself lacks a variety of features, it provides a robust, interoperable architecture that&#x27;s broadly supported and has been augmented repeatedly by other protocols (e.g., MIME, DMARC&#x2F;DKIM, SMTP-AUTH, LDAP, etc.) to provide such features.<p>It&#x27;s not clear to me that mnm&#x2F;TMTP has been fleshed out enough to provide a real alternative to SMTP+extensions.  Rather, it appears to be another (there are many) client&#x2F;server messaging application that&#x27;s not interoperable.<p>Should these issues be addressed, discussed and refined in the appropriate forums[4], It&#x27;s possible that TMTP could turn out to be a viable replacement for SMTP.<p>I applaud the authors&#x27; work and hope they have much success with their entry in the messaging app market.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;networkimprov&#x2F;mnm&#x2F;issues&#x2F;5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;networkimprov&#x2F;mnm&#x2F;issues&#x2F;5</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ietf.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ietf.org</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mnmnotmail.org&#x2F;rationale.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mnmnotmail.org&#x2F;rationale.html</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc5321.txt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc5321.txt</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ietf.org&#x2F;how&#x2F;wgs&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ietf.org&#x2F;how&#x2F;wgs&#x2F;</a><p>Edit: Fixed links.')
