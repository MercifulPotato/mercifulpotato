I had a cool little device from Sandisk with, I think, a 512MB solid state drive? I bet it&#x27;s still kicking. That thing was way cooler than an iPod, it ran off a AA battery (I think) and it seemed pretty tough. I dropped it in a slushy road puddle and it just kept trucking. The iPod had good capacity but the spinning drive in there was a huge failure point.')
