It looks like I&#x27;m just on my phone as normal, so nobody sees that I&#x27;m actually just talking to myself. Sometimes the mistakes the AI maks are hillarios, but usually they&#x27;re just annoying, as I need to manually edit them. But in the end, doing that takes a shorter amount of time than thumbing it in.')
