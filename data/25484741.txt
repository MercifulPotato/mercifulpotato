They would just get stuck in a reboot loop at the storage driver loading section of the installer, which means that no errors could be written. Hence, no specific errors could ever be sent back to Microsoft other than &quot;failed&quot;.<p>I eventually found a workaround myself, but the root cause was never fixed, and will never be fixed, because Microsoft is blind to it.<p>Similarly, anything that causes a BSOD gets reported back via telemetry, but hangs and freezes aren&#x27;t. Random performance issues, glitches, etc... are in the same bucket of permanently invisible issues.<p>If you&#x27;re wondering why Windows is crashing less but glitching more... there&#x27;s your answer.')
