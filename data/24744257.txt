Actually, often these are things that I have said in piecemeal many times in other places and it can be remarkably useful to just sit down and force myself into the constraint of “ok, I need to get these all together in a coherent thought that someone else will want to read”.

How can I distill it into something that others can understand? What parts can I support with evidence? Which parts don’t really make sense anymore?”')
