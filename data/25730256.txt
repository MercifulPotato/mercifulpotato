Item(by='codethief', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610379290, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25727509, text='&gt; No - There is no &#x27;easy&#x27; way to store&#x2F;restore the entire phone as I believe Apple does.<p>I think Android phones with the Google Services Framework installed do provide such a way. Alternatively, if you&#x27;re using a custom ROM (like GrapheneOS on Pixel devices), you can use Seedvault[0] for full backups of your phone. It basically acts as a drop-in replacement of the backup service provided by Google.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;seedvault-app&#x2F;seedvault" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;seedvault-app&#x2F;seedvault</a>')
