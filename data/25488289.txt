Brute-force evaluation of\nall possible configurations is clearly not feasible due to the massive number of different hypotheses.\nInstead, we present an algorithm, shown in Figure 1, that iteratively searches the best combination\nof connection values for the entire network by optimizing the given loss. To do this, the method\nlearns a real-valued quality score for each weight option. These scores are used to select the weight\nvalue of each connection during the forward pass. The scores are then updated in the backward pass\nbased on the loss value in order to improve training performance over iterations.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s actually pretty clever.')
