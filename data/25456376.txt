Item(by='Zigurd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608218774, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25454831, text='This is a tremendous example of argument by anecdote, and a strange anecdote at that. And a tenuous link to an event that is not simple to interpret: A prominent Scientologist berating members of a film crew on the basis of what might or might not be a pretense.<p>Here is a more plausible analogy: I write books. All of my books have been pirated. Almost all of the pirated copies are consumed by people learning to code who would otherwise not be able to afford my books, or who would buy them from local publishers in developing countries from which I make a pittance. While I am not left out of residuals the way a movie crew is, once I have made money in first world markets, that&#x27;s mostly it. I really have no incentive to pursue pirates, much less make anti-piracy a fetish and lobby to impose draconian measures on the general public.<p>The MPAA is a lobbying organization like other organizations that lobby against the public interest. They need to construct a self-justification the way coal, cigarettes, soda pop, etc. have that need. There don&#x27;t care about the &quot;little guy&quot; but will cynically spin that story if there is an advantage in it.<p>When sugary fizzy drinks are taxed, think of the out of work... dentists? Or would it be more like &quot;if home soda machine DRM is hacked...?&quot;')
