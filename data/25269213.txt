It takes quite a bit of wealth to get to the cash flow limit that &#x2F;may&#x2F; stop making you happy (60-80k&#x2F;yr iirc). Unless you think ~50% of your waking hours are worthless and can be given away for free, you need that wealth before these limits become a factor (even if one&#x27;s job was perfectly aligned with their life meaning, which isn&#x27;t the case for almost anyone, they could just do it anyway with the wealth, minus the  economic insecurity; otherwise (i.e. for almost everyone) they could do something either more fun, or more meaningful, or both, with the time).')
