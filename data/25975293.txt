The current political party in power in India now is the political arm of the right-wing religious fundamentalist organization called the RSS. The RSS was inspired, and is modelled, after the Nazi party of Hitler in Germany. And like the Nazis, their goal is to take over complete control of our country and make it a theocratic-corporate-state under one party controlled by them.<p>To this end, the government now abuses its powers to effectively use the corporate run media to discredit and attack any opposition against it, along with even physical threats and attacks using the RSS goons against any vocal activist or protestor.')
