It allows the user to get a &quot;quick look&quot; at a file without launching a default application. Also, in macOS you get access to QuickLook from inside any application&#x27;s Open dialog. That&#x27;s a huge time saver when you have similar files and just need to see which one before doing a full open. Think large image files that you want to place in a layout.')
