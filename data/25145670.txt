Why does anything have to change?”<p>I have seen this attitude so much in relatively young companies with long tenured employees. The needs of a company of 10 are not the needs of a company of 100. If you enjoy working at a company of 10, it&#x27;s fine to know that about yourself, and it&#x27;s fine to leave to seek out what you like.<p>It&#x27;s hard to watch a person slowly have their job and company taken away from them. If you aren&#x27;t willing to go with the flow - if you really don&#x27;t want to participate in medium&#x2F;large company work, you&#x27;ll have a really awful time. The company isn&#x27;t going to hold itself back to make you happy.')
