I cannot imagine there is something extra-ordinarily hard that mathematicians do, that is somehow not captured by how a Go player approaches the game.<p>There is also the &quot;come up with an interesting conjecture&quot; part, which I think is a lot harder. It is extra-ordinarily hard to specify what exactly makes some conjectures more interesting than others. So I reckon this part of math will be much harder to automate in the long run. It will probably require a lot of cross-contamination from AI that manage to write interesting books for example.')
