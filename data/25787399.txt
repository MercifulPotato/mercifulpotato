But then there&#x27;s Dropboxes cost which doesn&#x27;t make sense when we&#x27;re talking about a simple markdown editor.<p>I&#x27;m so tired of using Confluence for our internal documentation but that cost was just too prohibitive.<p>I&#x27;d even toyed around with making our own Paper clone but priorities dictated otherwise.<p>So glad to have found this and the product looks fantastic.<p>Couple of Questions if I can:\n- best way of porting Confluence spaces across to Outline? \n- any plans to bring in team permissions etc?\n- what does the road map for the product look like?<p>Amazing work well done')
