They&#x27;re just protecting their own interests.<p>You use the platform; you accept the TOS. You accept the <i>arbitrary enforcement</i> of the TOS.<p>That&#x27;s how it works on every platform right now.<p>Right? Wrong? I don&#x27;t know... but I&#x27;ll tell you what I do know: a) I&#x27;m not surprised, and b) there is zero chance this will change without legal compulsion.<p>So right now, concerned or not, it is what it is. Suck it up, or accept legislative change; you can&#x27;t have it both ways.')
