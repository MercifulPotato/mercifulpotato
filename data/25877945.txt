Item(by='konjin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611359727, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25877654, text='&gt;Anonymity seems to just bring the worst out of people (that&#x27;s not a tech problem, that&#x27;s a human&#x2F;culture problem). I would personally love to see a &quot;web&quot; where you have to comment...as your public self. Post messages...as your public self (not just on an individual platform level). So on and so forth.<p>I&#x27;m going to guess you&#x27;re liberal and think the &#x27;storming&#x27; of the capital was the political event of the decade on par with 9&#x2F;11.<p>Yet it was all organized in the open on facebook using real names.<p>Curious how using real names did not stop anyone.<p>People are willing to do things they believe in that are detrimental to themselves. That is after all why the US exists.<p>Anonymity is a way for people to say that they want to blow up parliament and get feedback on why it&#x27;s a good or bad idea before doing it.<p>It is very confusing to me why the US, a country that hasn&#x27;t had a real genocide since the 1860s, is taking advice on speech regulation from countries whose last genocide was in the 1940s.')
