Honestly, three simple circles would have been better. As for the &quot;3D ellipsis&quot; concept -- I think this is a classic example of a Gestalt psychological phenomenon, where knowing the concept in advance informs the holistic visual interpretation. I have to wonder if they bothered to focus test the logo on individuals who were not privy to the concept before their initial impression, because this reads like a circle followed by two 2D squashed ovals, with no obvious indication of three-dimensionality.')
