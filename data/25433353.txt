GraphQL reduces both response payload size to only what is necessary for the client, but also reduces round-trips.<p>Unless you are writing custom REST endpoints for every aspect of your UI, most formulation of what data a consumer needs will usually resolve in multiple trips to the server. So, you either scale out by having custom REST endpoints to handle each case of this (which both feels odd and presumably won&#x27;t scale very well), or you take advantage of GraphQL doing this natively.')
