From my understanding which could be wrong, is that you are free to use &quot;this&quot; software if you give the same freedom to your downstream work and any modification you do must be given back to original work. Why is that difficult ? If I am using libreoffice and I develop a fix for bug that I found in my usage, why not give it back to the entire community so that the software is made better for the entire mankind?<p>Second, which is more important than anything hobbyist use, if I am a for profit corporation looking to earn money, why should I be allowed to take existing code built by God knows how many volunteers, make slight changes and market it as &quot;my&quot; product and totally ignore the work done by these people?<p>From what I have been reading over time, no one is going to come after a &quot;serious hobbyist&quot; if they ran GPL code in their projects having proprietary blobs. That is just scare mongering.<p>Leeching off of work of community and passing it as own work without passing modifications and improvements to community is what the issue is and unless you want to do that, fine. Use commercial or software that is permissive only.')
