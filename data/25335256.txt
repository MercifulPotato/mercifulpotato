I think people living in SF notice when new services come out that are only available there, like Uber was at first. But they don&#x27;t notice when those services later spread to the rest of the country. You can get Amazon Prime shipping and rideshares everywhere now. Other cities may have somewhat less luxury retail, but likely have shorter drives with less traffic to get to nature.')
