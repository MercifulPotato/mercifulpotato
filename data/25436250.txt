This is an example.<p>To me, &quot;lol&quot; means &quot;laugh out loud&quot;.  So I ask, and it&#x27;s a genuine question, did &quot;alt.religion.emacs&quot; really, honestly, make you &quot;laugh out loud&quot;?  It may have done, but I&#x27;m interested to know.<p>The follow-up is this.<p>If it <i>did</i> make you &quot;laugh out loud&quot;, what is it that you found funny?<p>If you <i>didn&#x27;t</i> &quot;laugh out loud&quot;, what do you actually mean by &quot;lol&quot;?<p>I&#x27;m interested in language, its uses, and how it&#x27;s changing, and this is one case where I&#x27;m definitely in doubt as to the intended meaning of the comment.<p>Thanks.')
