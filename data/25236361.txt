The machine spins the plastic into a material that is similar to cotton candy (a mesh), which is also electrocharged by the spinning.</i><p>I&#x27;m always sceptical of these kind upcycling plastic narratives that involve melting them, since apparently a lot of plastics only are labeld safe under the assumption that they <i>don&#x27;t</i> get heated until the melting point. After that they may start leaking chemicals, a bit like the whole non-stick coating story.<p>But if the source of plastic is reliable then this sounds pretty good.')
