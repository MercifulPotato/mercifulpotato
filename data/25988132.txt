Item(by='zozbot234', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612183565, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25984330, text='&gt; I worked at a startup a handful of years ago which decided early on that mongodb was good enough. We figured we&#x27;d move to a proper database down the road.<p>Yeah, that can&#x27;t end well. It&#x27;s a bit ironic from parent poster&#x27;s viewpoint but &quot;boring&quot;, well-understood technology is generally also the easiest to migrate away from. That&#x27;s one key reason to choose it at the outset even over more &quot;innovative&quot; and perhaps more &quot;ergonomic&quot; choices like mongo, that in reality aren&#x27;t nearly as simple to deal with.')
