Taking an Uber a few times a month meant finding new UX patterns every time, sometimes features would be there, sometimes they wouldn&#x27;t. It was very annoying to find that useful features had suddenly disappeared. After feeling that the UX was hostile due to this, and some IRL hostile experiences with drivers with a terrible support follow-up, I just dropped Uber for good. Alternative apps were more expensive but absolutely more stable.')
