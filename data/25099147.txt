I don&#x27;t think that polls should be treated differently than other kinds of upvotes, which already are very intimate data. We take protecting that data and keeping it private very seriously, but of course there&#x27;s some risk in any such arrangement, so if you don&#x27;t want any risk, your best bet is not to vote on HN.')
