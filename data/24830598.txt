Putting an explicit &quot;Join&quot; button with some relevant icon next to the channel name would be much more intuitive. It would also clarify, for example, how you leave the channel. Once you&#x27;re in one, a separate &quot;Leave&quot; button appears at a totally different location in the footer of the UI, but I can&#x27;t honestly be sure whether or not clicking the channel name would also do the job of backing you out.<p>I think the discomfort in this case comes from the semantics of clicking an item in a list. Every desktop interface for the last 25 years has taught us that clicking a list-item means &quot;select&quot;. This works for text-channels, and I can kind of see how you might stretch that definition to joining a voice channel - though that&#x27;s more of a &quot;significant action&quot;, which traditionally warrants an actual button - but it makes absolutely no sense for <i>leaving</i> a voice channel.')
