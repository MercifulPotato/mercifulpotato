With immutable ds when we talk about data we are just talking about exactly that and time is taken out of the picture. Its called immutable because now you are talking about facts and not the representation in time of those facts. Because now we are talking in versions so it does not make sense. The thing is this data is a snapshot so you are not guaranteed to have the most up to date snapshot. And that&#x27;s ok because precisely here we take change in time out of the question in order to be able to talk more precisely about the data. Tracking change in time is another story.<p>So for example you could have things like react. There you have snapshots of the world updating. When you talk about the data it is immutable but then you change it and update the mutable variable where you are keeping change in time.')
