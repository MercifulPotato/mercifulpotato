I can&#x27;t seem to find EPA range results for ID.3, maybe because it&#x27;s not available in the US yet? And to be clear, I&#x27;m really happy that VW appears to be pushing into EVs in a bigger way than most of the big car companies. I wish they all would. But I think they&#x27;re a ways from taking the limelight.')
