Another post here recommended Grandstream products for connecting analog phones to VoIP.  Looking at the user guide for the HT802 you can make direct calls between the extensions.  <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.grandstream.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;gateways-and-atas&#x2F;analog-telephone-adaptors&#x2F;product&#x2F;ht802" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.grandstream.com&#x2F;products&#x2F;gateways-and-atas&#x2F;analog...</a><p>Unfortunately there system requires dialing &quot;*701&quot; or &quot;*702&quot; and dialing star on a true rotary phone isn&#x27;t possible without some other system in place.
