Item(by='cletus', descendants=None, kids=[25596156], score=None, time=1609441305, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25591492, text='Message queues are one of these things that sound great in theory but IME has simply been a way of adding more failure modes and points of failure to chase the (largely unjustified) goal of systems decoupling.<p>There are two types of people in the world: those who divide the world into two kinds of people and those that don&#x27;t. As one of the former, I like to view MQs as being essentially one of two types:<p>1. Stateless<p>2. Stateful<p>Stateless means if there&#x27;s no one there to handle the message, it is simply lost. The benefit of course is you don&#x27;t need to consider all the complexity of persisting messages. But a stateless MQ is really just a routing &#x2F; service discovery architecture. Now that&#x27;s completely fine to abstract that away but it&#x27;s not really that exciting. It&#x27;s still synchronous delivery, essentially.<p>Stateful OTOH means you really can queue things up and deal with them later. Unfortunately you&#x27;re now dealing with:<p>- Reliability: what if the persist call fails? Do you have enough storage? Can your persistence medium keep up with the volume of reads and writes?<p>- Is delivery guaranteed or is it simply best-effort? This is a big one. Best effort is MUCH less problematic but doesn&#x27;t tend to be what people want. You see guaranteed delivery in a lot of enterprise MQ software (eg TIBCO certified messaging) where you have things like MQ integration with two-phase commits and the like.<p>3. What ordering guarantees are there? Guaranteed ordering or best-effort or no promise?<p>Basically you&#x27;ve probably just created another database. Worse, that database may be different to your other databases.<p>Also, is your MQ a FIFO or some form of priority queue? If it&#x27;s a FIFO, how do you handle throttling and buffering?<p>The post describes the apocryphal MQ as having infinite capacity. No MQ is.<p>IME the supposed benefits have been outweighed by all the negatives.')
