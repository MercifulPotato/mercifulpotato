I am awe-struck, my only response is: LOL<p>My second favorite tidbit was about their game &quot;New World&quot;, in which players &quot;colonize a mythical land and murder inhabitants who bear a striking resemblance to Native Americans&quot;. Then refused to believe their employees who said this was racist and offensive. Until they hired a tribal consultant who, indeed, found it offensive.<p>There&#x27;s other good things in there as well - not listening to other employees, hiring and then wasting talent, chasing trends, not understanding the industry, not scoping correctly (lumberjack). Even AMZN&#x27;s culture was restrictive and harmful (IMO especially &quot;leaders are right a lot&quot; lmao, not at all in this case!).<p>Could you imagine working in an industry for a decade, and then being in this position? Where your boss literally cannot differentiate between a rendered video and a pre-release video game - but the culture has an in-built &quot;you&#x27;re probably wrong, peon&quot; attitude? I&#x27;d leave so fast I&#x27;d probably forget my desk plants!')
