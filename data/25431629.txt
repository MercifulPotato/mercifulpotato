And it isn&#x27;t actually that popular in distributed systems, as it demands certain software development process most real world distributed systems can&#x27;t benefit from, the only examples of distributed systems are literally distributed cloud services made at megacorps no less, like in the video. But mostly it&#x27;s purely people who are into formal proofing who play with it, regardless of whether there are actual benefits. I don&#x27;t like doing it and was never able to justify using it on any real project, I was always able to find more beneficial ways to spend this time on instead. And tiny cases where I really needed to make sure of something I just covered the whole state space with tests and simulations. Maybe if it wasn&#x27;t written in java and all the tooling was some portable C easily integratable anywhere things could be different, but as it is I can&#x27;t even accept having jvm everywhere.')
