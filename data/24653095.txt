Cenk Uygur comes to mind, off the top of my head - he&#x27;s lost out on opportunities from things he said in the past that were perceived as racist, but nobody in good faith &#x2F; nobody who matters considers him to continue to espouse those views. It helps that he quite vocally criticizes those views.<p>What is probably actually true is that, statistically, many people who were racist in the past are still racist, and many people who murdered in the past and went to prison commit no further violent crimes (for many reasons).')
