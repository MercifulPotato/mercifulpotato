I personally see it as a part of my work and having to pay for that feels like microtransactions in a game to me.<p>So not sure how such a thing could be monetised properly. Likely by only offering enterprise-grade services: the tool itself is free, the customer&#x27;s programmers could employ it to achieve migration but the customer prefers to outsource the cost. Sort of how several Linuxes are free but come with paid support contracts.')
