But we’re going to try and give our Republicans ... the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.<p>That&#x27;s it? No calls to illegally seize power, nothing. Just to march down a road and show support to a subset of politicians in the hope that they do technically legal things that are helpful to his cause.<p>and on Twitter:<p>&gt; I am asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence! Remember, WE are the Party of Law &amp; Order – respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue.
