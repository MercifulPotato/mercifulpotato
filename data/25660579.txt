Basically performing recall on textbooks and architecture powerpoints.<p>* Senior-level: You can always go crazy on the same technical topics, such as by replacing &quot;recite a paragraph from your old CLRS textbook&quot; with &quot;... and here&#x27;s how that&#x27;d look on a multi-gpu&#x2F;asics cluster&quot;. I didn&#x27;t see anything directly on technical leadership, so maybe rethink the architecture questions from team&#x2F;HR + product design + company&#x2F;LOB perspectives. Weirdly, prepping at the CLRS-level seems like you&#x27;re aiming for a more junior technical role &#x2F; org, and I&#x27;d think more about &#x27;revisit track record&#x27; and &#x27;networking&#x27; than &#x27;prep&#x27;.<p>Curious how FB folks see that -- I&#x27;m probably misunderstanding something as there&#x27;s a wide spectrum between &#x27;Mostly knows how a production system works&#x27; and &#x27;Ready to lead tech for a new team&#x2F;LOB&#x27;.')
