They&#x27;re not extensions to our legs in a genuine sense of the term. They don&#x27;t improve, or interact with our physical capacities. On the contrary, they atrophy our legs, make us fatter, and produce urban pollution.<p>They&#x27;re not a technology that enhances or melts with the human who uses it, it doesn&#x27;t vanish into the background, the car doesn&#x27;t even evolve much, rather the environment changes to fit the car, if anything hindering evolution, it displaces the natural ecosystem, it doesn&#x27;t become part of it.<p>The same can be said about technologies weakening memory. They look like an enhancement maybe, but they may actually just cause impairment of function, becoming a crutch.')
