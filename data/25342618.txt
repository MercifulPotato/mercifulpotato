I think given how I hold the phone (closer to the base of the phone) I tend to notice the Librem 5 more often than I notice the Pinephone getting hotter. This is mostly because the frame &#x2F; chassis for the Librem 5 is metal, and conducts the heat around the sides of the phone. So you’ll notice it getting hot after you’ve used your phone for a good bit.</i><p>Power management is complex these days.  You&#x27;ll often get a minimal implementation from the chip vendor, and it is a fair amount of work to really polish the lower level support.  On top of that, you have to integrate this with the rest of the OS, so that active apps can increase the clocks, which then get automatically scaled back as system load decreases.  So there&#x27;s a lot to do on the userspace side as well.')
