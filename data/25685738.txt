It is unwritten and fuzzy, but Britain definitely has a constitution or at least &quot;constitutional principles&quot; as mentioned in the quote you provided:<p><i>&quot; . . . In this way the courts of the United Kingdom, though acknowledging the sovereignty of Parliament, apply principles of constitutionality little different from those which exist in countries where the power of the legislature is expressly limited by a constitutional document.&quot;</i><p>While it may technically be possible under certain circumstances, I find it very hard to image how a piece of legislation could be crafted that would successfully override the arguments made here.')
