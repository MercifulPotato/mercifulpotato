I see no reason for that to be the case. Maybe it&#x27;s just a matter of us not having the computational power to find such an opening and analyze it&#x27;s continuations to completion. I know that there&#x27;s a huge number of reachable chess states, but it still seems like there could be an opening that always wins.')
