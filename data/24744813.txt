It&#x27;s enough to report on something as a fact if a number of independent news articles reports them as true.<p>Wikipedia doesn&#x27;t (and shouldnt) do original research.<p>These policies are great for the vast majority of current affairs but fail in a few edge cases where news reports align together on the same message.<p>For current news and culture war stuff, consider the articles to be re written in the future when memoirs, PhD theses, documentaries and historians look at what happened.')
