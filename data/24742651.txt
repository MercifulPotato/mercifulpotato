Let&#x27;s <i>assume</i> you&#x27;ll always walk left or right of it, as a function of your initial left&#x2F;right position across the width of the path, in a bounded time t_max.  (We assume there isn&#x27;t some unstable center position, or set of positions, where you get stuck an arbitrarily long length of time before deciding which side to take, because you&#x27;re human.)  It follows that the laws of physics are discontinuous.<p>It feels kind of like Arrow&#x27;s Impossibility Theorem -- in both cases your cleanest way out of this jam is nondeterminism.')
