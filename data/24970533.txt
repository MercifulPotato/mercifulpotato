You will be someone who is comfortable working with the most challenging problems, designing and creating the most elegant systems alike. We need your help to reinvent the recommender systems experience on eBay&#x27;s item pages. This is a unique opportunity to influence the most visited page on eBay (billions of views a day) and learn recommendation technology which ranks eBay&#x27;s 1+ billion active items. We apply cutting edge machine learning techniques on petabytes of data and thousands of Spark&#x2F;YARN nodes. This includes Deep learning, XGBoost and online learning. We are a small team in a growing remote office, building eBay Ads&#x27;s future and seeking experienced (2+ years) applied researchers. The day to day work includes 50% coding and 50% data science. Our interview consists of two phone screens and one onsite (virtually) to meet the team and do a code test. contact: wsalle@ebay.com | Ask for Zhen')
