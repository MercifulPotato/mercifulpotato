I&#x27;ve seen colleagues port Python to C++ and wonder why it&#x27;s slower.<p>Of course Python is slow, but it will call into efficient C routines for a lot of things that aren&#x27;t just available out of the box in C++. So what does the average programmer do? They implement their own, inefficient version of this in C++.<p>Now you&#x27;ve saved the overhead of copying your data from the Python to the C-world and back, but the main part of your computations is just not on the level of numpy.<p>So naturally C++ can be much faster than Python, because it doesn&#x27;t have this overhead, but you have to do it right, which may be more effort.')
