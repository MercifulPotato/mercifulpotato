It&#x27;s far less violent that your typical BLM&#x2F;Antifa demonstration destroying peoples&#x27; livelihoods &amp; definitely less violent than what the Cartels do to unfriendly politicians &amp; journalists in Mexico. I get it, the political establishment controls the narrative &amp; the politicians got scared (with hilarious photos) that the unwashed masses entered their hallowed halls in &quot;The Peoples&#x27; Building&quot;, but this was not nearly as violent as the media has hyped this up to be. The idiots who &quot;stormed the capital&quot; are going to be arrested, shamed, etc. It&#x27;s taken care of, there is no insurrection.<p>This is a shot across the bow &amp; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wise to crack down &amp; punish a large portion of the population. If you think this was bad, it could get much worse. Let&#x27;s not make this worse...please.')
