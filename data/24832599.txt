I do read written policies very carefully, but I often misinterpret things because I read more literally than the author expected. if it&#x27;s something important (eg, specifications at work), I will rewrite the ambiguous passage in my own words and ask the author &#x2F; person in charge if it&#x27;s a correct interpretation. this annoys people sometimes, but it makes it not my fault if I misunderstand :)')
