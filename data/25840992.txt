If you&#x27;re very interested in VHF&#x2F;UHF (repeaters, simplex with your neighbors) and you only have $20, then it&#x27;s the perfect radio for you.<p>If you have $10,000 and want to chat with people around the world, then you&#x27;ll want something else.  People hear &quot;ham radio&quot; and think &quot;chatting with people all around the world&quot;, but that is not what Baofeng radios do :)')
