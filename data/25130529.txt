Babies <i>aren&#x27;t</i> fun. They eat, shit and cry, and that&#x27;s about it.<p>The way to overcome it is to sort of just plod on. They grow out of the potato stage, and start becoming people you can interact with, play with, talk with. For the first few years, being a good dad largely consists of keeping your kid alive!<p>I basically just told myself that it would get better, and stage by stage it did. Mine&#x27;s nearly five now, and there are still a lot of challenges, but it&#x27;s nowhere as difficult as it was for the first few years. Being a good dad is actually <i>harder</i> in some ways now now, because it requires more mental and emotional commitment, vs. just being able to deal with sleep deprivation and isolation, but also easier in a lot of ways because they&#x27;re a person you can <i>do things</i> with.')
