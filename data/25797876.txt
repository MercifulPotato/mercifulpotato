They should have tried to monetize it with their $1 a year (or whatever) fee and see how many paid.<p>The truth is that they became big in geographies like India (population 1.3 billion) because they didn&#x27;t actually enforce the fee for most users, and because Whatsapp worked very well with low data usage across all platforms including Symbian and offered free messaging at a time when Indians were used to having to pay per SMS.<p>It&#x27;s convenient for the founders to grandstand now that Whatsapp is someone else&#x27;s responsibility, but it was their responsibility once, and they never converted it into a profitable company, and when they got a offer too big to refuse, sold.')
