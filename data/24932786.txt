I agree that it would be nice to have more things, but I&#x27;m skeptical of the numbers working out. The Apollo program brought back ~850lbs of moon rocks and cost ~$150bn. Obviously the primary purpose of the program wasn&#x27;t mining, but I think what I said above applies.<p>It <i>might</i> work out and we <i>might</i> get a lot, but we should make investment choices with the assumption that it won&#x27;t. If we are ever in a situation where civilization makes asteroid mining work or it falls apart it would be very bad because asteroid mining is hard! It&#x27;s likely easier to use platinum more efficiently.')
