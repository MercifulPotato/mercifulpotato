Plugging in and charging overnight makes a lot of sense for those that a) do have that and b) don&#x27;t do long enough trips to need to charge elsewhere. But that leaves out an awful lot of people. And EV ranges aren&#x27;t nearly as long as the manufacturers quote* in any but ideal conditions with a single occupant and no luggage. So filling stations will still be needed and they will all need superchargers.<p>* Yes neither are ICE&#x27;s but this isn&#x27;t a problem for anyone because there are petrol stations everywhere')
