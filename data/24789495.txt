Nobody locked them in their houses for 6 months.<p>The government policy response for most of the first decade the AIDS epidemic was known about was “do nothing, it&#x27;s just killing undesirables we&#x27;d like to eliminate, anyway”, so it&#x27;s kind of a weird model to hold up for emulation.<p>But (1) HIV isn&#x27;t a respiratory virus, so taking the kind of precautions that apply to a respiratory virus wouldn&#x27;t make any sense; (2) prevrnting the spread of the epidemic outside of the undesirable groups was used as a pretext for the Justice Department permitting employers to fire people for having AIDS, and was part of the overt pretext in a number of new adopted (and more proposed) laws across the US extending discrimination against and exclusion of homosexuals.')
