For example, I evaluated their new Front Door combo accelerator &#x2F; CDN product recently. One page listed their customers, and there were about a half dozen total. Out of curiosity, I scanned the top 1000 domains and found none using it. I got the impression that I was one of the few people even evaluating it, let alone using it in production.<p>Despite just kicking the tyres on the thing, I found about half a dozen bugs or missing critical features. That&#x27;s just shocking to me.<p>For comparison, CloudFront -- the most direct competitor -- is far ahead in features and is used by far more customers. It also works out of the box.<p>All of the other Azure services other than plain virtual machines give me the same impression of being a first adopter and one of only a handful of customers.')
