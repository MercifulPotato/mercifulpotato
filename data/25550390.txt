So much that I switched from Mac back to Windows twice in the past because the functionality was so important.<p>I search for a word or phrase through 1000s of documents, spreadsheets, PDFs, and email archive files going back two decades. On my desktop or in a cloud service. X1 displays matches in real time, fast-as-you-type, with all the results easy to grok in one glance in list form, sorted by any field. And on the same screen, X1 renders a preview of the file&#x2F;email as I click through the list. No need to open the file&#x2F;email: I can read the whole document right there on the search screen. I can also copy &amp; paste from that document. And all search terms are <i>highlighted</i>.')
