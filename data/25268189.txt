Zuck (as the current victim in this discussion) took those technologies, and used them to personally enrich himself while duplicitously selling out other people&#x27;s self-interests. In a world in which the original inventors of things like TCP&#x2F;IP, DNS, HTTP, SSL, Postgres, and PHP never make any real money at it, the implied expectation would be to at least honor their intent. That&#x27;s the deal that&#x27;s been abrogated. This argument is so obvious that I am forced to assume that you&#x27;re just playing devil&#x27;s advocate here, for the sake of discussion, so I&#x27;ll play along. And you can say that it&#x27;s their fault for not monetizing those technologies, or not creating a license to prevent what&#x27;s been done, and maybe that&#x27;s true, but that&#x27;s beside the point.')
