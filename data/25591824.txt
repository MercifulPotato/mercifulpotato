Currently it&#x27;s <i>Chrome</i> that pushes its own standards at neck-breaking speed with utter disregard to any objections. For example,  all of the standards that Mozilla considers harmful are enabled by default in Chrome. Or standards that both Safari and Mozilla consider woefully under-specced or badly implemented? Well, Chrome ships them to Google&#x27;s own teams and then refuses to hide them back under a flag.<p>Apple may not give enough resources to Safari, that&#x27;s true. But don&#x27;t for a second assume that Apple is unequivocally bad and Google is unequivocally good when it comes to the web. I&#x27;ll take Safari over Google any day of the week.')
