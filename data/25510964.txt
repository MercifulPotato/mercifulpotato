The CEO who gave him the time and the opportunity. He could&#x27;ve easily told him to fuck off, as many would do. Who was he, what&#x27;s his name?<p>More often than not, we get nowhere without people in better positions helping us, it would be great if more people would keep an open mind like that. That CEO deserves recognition.<p>And if you manage to climb higher on the ladder, don&#x27;t forget to help others like someone helped you before. Pay it forward.')
