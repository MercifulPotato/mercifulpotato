They used to sync them to Google Drive, so you could at least use Backup &amp; Sync to have local copies. However, they got rid of that feature some time in the last year.<p>I had to switch to using a third party app to sync my &quot;photo reel&quot; from my phone to Google Drive: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.ttxapps.drivesync&amp;hl=en_US" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.ttxapps.dr...</a><p>Then I use Google Backup &amp; Sync to create a local copy on my NAS, which is also backed up to Backblaze B2. In my setup, these irreplaceable photos &amp; videos exist on my phone, Google, my NAS, and Backblaze.<p>If you are relying on Google Backup &amp; Sync to restore a large amount of data after a data loss event, you are in for a world of pain and disappointment. It simply does not handle any significant amount of data well. I had to stop backing up &quot;My Computer&quot; with Backup &amp; Sync and just switched to using Google Drive. The files in Google Drive seem to be the only way to &quot;restore&quot; a large amount of files after a data loss event. If they are backed up under &quot;My Computer&quot; in Google Drive and you have a decent amount of data (50GB+), you will have no way to restore these files. The web interface will simply time out when you try to download them. The Backup &amp; Sync client won&#x27;t even attempt to download these files, even if you try the dead-end workarounds suggested on the web. You won&#x27;t be able to drag them into your &quot;Google Drive&quot; folder as a workaround either. The whole thing is atrocious.<p>Google Backup &amp; Sync is a fucking joke, and Google should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such a shitty product which does not actually help consumers protect against data loss. Consumers will only realize this at the point they are fucked and trying to restore their data.')
