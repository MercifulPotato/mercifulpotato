I agree this creates a new problem: I don&#x27;t even know what I bought in the last years, what kind of online live books with exercises I bought and from where. I try to keep them in a document, but sometimes I forget and search email to find out.<p>Still I would like to ask that if someone just wants to share information and it is not focused on monetization then please  consider other options than Medium.<p>A lot of newcomers will not make a subscription there.')
