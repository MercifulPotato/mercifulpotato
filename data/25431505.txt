Item(by='cnity', descendants=None, kids=[25432061], score=None, time=1608048420, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25431377, text='I don&#x27;t quite understand what you mean. Do you mean that in general you don&#x27;t recommend DFT for signal processing? This seems counter to most approaches in the field. Issues (aliasing, spectral leakage, etc) arising from DFT more or less iron out with reasonable use of zero padding, sample rate, and windowing.<p>Edit: I didn&#x27;t mean for this to sound so closed minded. I don&#x27;t know that much about more recent audio processing practices and I think you probably know things I don&#x27;t. If you have any reading about wavelets vs DFT I&#x27;d be very thankful and interested.')
