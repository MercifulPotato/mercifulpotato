New information comes to light, the stock crashes, and you realize you were wrong and the stock is a dog. You no longer want to own it at the strike price. Oops. You effectively bought it above your updated estimate of its worth.<p>2. The stock keeps rising and rising, you collect the option premium but you could have made a lot more money if you just bought the damn thing outright.<p>These are more subtle failures than the usual &quot;Oh my God, I blew up my account!&quot; but they&#x27;re real.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly fine to keep doing what you&#x27;re doing if you&#x27;re comfortable with this risk.
