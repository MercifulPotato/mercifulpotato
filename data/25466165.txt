We also have a right to phone numbers, meaning that if I switch to a new provider, my phone number follows to my new subscription with no additional fee.<p>But if I switch e-mail provider from gmail to proton, I&#x27;ve no right to have my email address, no less the actual inbox transferred to my new provider.')
