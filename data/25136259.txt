This is a very dangerous conversational pattern, where someone makes a factual assertion and the reply is to something which wasn&#x27;t said, and reimagines the original comment as evil in some way.<p>Whenever I see someone do this, I generally stop talking immediately, but I am sticking up for GP on this one.<p>The comment you are replying to in no way made a statement about what is or isn&#x27;t awful. Simply a comment about the size of various things.')
