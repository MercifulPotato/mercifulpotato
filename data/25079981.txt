Why in God&#x27;s name do people agree to participate in so-called &quot;telemetry&quot; and submit to whatever changes Apple wants to make in the OS, without question, in the form of &quot;updates&quot;.  Trying to control what programs users can run via &quot;AppStores&quot; and &quot;developer certificates&quot;, and making them pay Apple for the &quot;privilege&quot; (what should be a &quot;right&quot;).<p>If what the author says is true, I cannot see how anyone can take Apple&#x27;s claims of &quot;privacy as a human right&quot; seriously.  Purchasers have no right to privacy that can be asserted against Apple, who apparently needs to know how, when and where each customer is using the computer he&#x2F;she bought.  The company should be held to task for making such claims.<p>I still have an old Mac G4 with OS9.  It is not connected to the internet.  Safe to say no one at Apple cares how, when or where I am using it, and that&#x27;s how it should be.  It is astonishing how overzealous this company has gotten.  As Nancy Reagan once said, &quot;Just say No.&quot;')
