Who unironically states &quot;OH YEAH, YOU GOT IT! YEAH! White Power!&quot; The dudes tone of voice is completely sarcastic and not authoritative. It&#x27;s truly a reach to think someone who is being agitated saying something to provoke someone else is truly a statement that they are a white supremacist.<p>I&#x27;ve actually seen the whole video and to not be able to tell when someone is doing something to directly provoke someone who hates them is silly. Do trolls and provacators cease to exist outside of the internet? 4chan &quot;culture&quot; (if you can call it that) can and do exist outside of the internet bubble, they unapologetically say things with the purpose of pissing someone off.<p>I&#x27;m sad we have a whole generation of people incapable of understanding context and that people purposely say provacative things in order to belittle the power of the statements themselves. It&#x27;s pathetic honestly that people can&#x27;t see that.')
