Now I just hit the Windows key and type the name of the app or setting I&#x27;m looking for. The search is very quick and usually throws what I&#x27;m looking for. Here are two examples of how I use this that I think are great:<p>I created a quick ppt or xls file yesterday, not sure how I named it. I hit the Windows key, type Excel (usually you don&#x27;t need to type the whole word, specially if it&#x27;s a frequent search) and it immediately shows the Excel shortcut and a list of the last few files I&#x27;ve opened.<p>The other case is I wanted to modify the action when closing the laptop lid. I know that setting is somewhere in the power configuration, but can&#x27;t remember exactly where. So I just hit the Windows key, type lid and voila! there&#x27;s the setting')
