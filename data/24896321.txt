For example, I am writing API endpoints. Each route uses the same scheme, they need to hold a list of messages with their status code which will be sent to the user. In Python, I must currently repeat their declaration in each function. Boilerplate. What should I do, use classes? Ugly solution. A quick `with-my-variables` macro would write the boilerplate for me, ensuring it is written at one place, making it easier for maintenance, future refactoring, etc.<p>Python has decorators. They have a specialized, limited interface. Sometimes they are limiting you. A macro would impose no limit.')
