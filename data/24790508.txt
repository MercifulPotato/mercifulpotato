Additionally, as someone in the thread pointed out, this decision really doesn&#x27;t make sense by Dropbox. You have a series of problems that I can&#x27;t see a solution for.<p>1) If we have Dropbox Studios, who dictates the frequency of those visits? If a manager dictates, there will be resentment of some sorts. If its a democratic vote, what about the people that can&#x27;t make that date?<p>2) Assuming the dates have been finalized, the people that cannot make that date are at a disadvantage. They might not be in driving distance to a hub or for other reasons. That would mean information again has to be propagated back virtually for all members.<p>3) If a date is set and all the necessary people have come together, is it essentially a company day off? If the goal is to meet and talk to people without doing solo-work, I would assume its filled with meetings or events. If this is true, this doesn&#x27;t make sense to do it too frequently. If done infrequently, it defeats the purposes of these studios.<p>All of the thoughts so far don&#x27;t even go through the cliques &#x2F; groups that would form that can be gatekeepers of information for true remote workers that can&#x27;t meetup.')
