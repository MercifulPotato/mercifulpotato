First, HCL is very limited - HashiCorp didn&#x27;t even use it for Sentinel! I won&#x27;t switch to TypeScript either - I wish they&#x27;ve adopted an embedded language like Starlark like in this POC [0].<p>There are many inconsistencies; refactoring is very, very painful. While `terraform import` and `terraform state mv` work, it&#x27;s all manual, and the first doesn&#x27;t work with their SaaS - Terraform Cloud as imports, unlike runs, are always local, but sensitive variables are only available in the cloud. As pointed out, secrets are in plain text - GCP state even had my personal access token, which it&#x27;s not supposed to as it&#x27;s not something that has to be shared with the team.<p>The good thing is that the velocity is greatly improving - we had v0.13 this year, and v0.14 is almost out - many features of v0.15 are done, so that pace compared to v0.12 is new!<p>My biggest issue is how much copypasta you need for just reusing modules! There&#x27;s no clean way to do Dependency Inject, and you have to replicate code all over the place as you can&#x27;t &quot;export&quot; resources or data sources - you can only export primitive values, and then you need to have a data source, which uses that primary key of the resource.<p>Terraform could turn into a huge, missed opportunity. I hope they realized the potential and that they need to execute fast.<p>Also, it&#x27;s very maddening that their prioritization is based on the number of thumbs-ups!<p>Last but not least - many key providers are run by people who don&#x27;t follow standards and are working part-time on key projects instead of HashiCorp making sure there&#x27;s great DX with major vendors. One such example is the GitHub provider. A huge fiasco recently had a backward-incompatible minor release, which also didn&#x27;t update the docs. After three weeks, the maintainer was still considering unreleasing when people already have found workarounds and reverse-engineered the issues and the missing documentation. Same provider still does not provide organization-level secrets even though this features has been available for more than 6 months!<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ascode.run&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ascode.run&#x2F;</a>')
