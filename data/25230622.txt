Item(by='kmeisthax', descendants=None, kids=[25232644, 25231981], score=None, time=1606498076, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25228676, text='The EU PDO scheme conflates geographic origin and a particular type of product in a way that is transparently protectionist and silly. When people say &quot;feta cheese&quot; or &quot;american cheese&quot;, they&#x27;re not asking for &quot;made in Feta cheese&quot; or &quot;made in America cheese&quot;. They&#x27;re asking for a particular flavor profile and cooking behavior, and possibly a specific method of manufacture. There is no particular reason why you can&#x27;t make feta outside of Feta. There is nothing magical about the location in Greece that makes cheese produced in the same way outside of the town inherently inferior. Fuck terroir.')
