Item(by='tzs', descendants=None, kids=[24810265], score=None, time=1602871255, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24801646, text='&gt; Have you tried to add the numerical values of Remdesivir letters?<p>82 69 77 68 69 83 73 86 73 82 are the ASCII values of &quot;remdesivir&quot;. For each of those, replace it by the sum of its digits, and keep doing that until each becomes a single digits: 1 6 5 5 6 2 1 5 1 1.<p>Take those in pairs, 16 55 62 15 11, and do the same kind of reduction to single digits: 7 1 8 6 2, to get 71862 is Remdesivir symbolic number.<p>What does that tell us about Remdesivir?<p>Well, add 24 to it - the answer to the ultimate question of life, written backwards. The result is 71886.<p>Write the number backwards, subtract 1960 - the year first contraceptive pills hit the market. The value is now 66857.<p>Write the number backwards, subtract 1989 - the year of the Exxon Valdez spill. The value is now 73877.<p>Subtract 13 - the symbol of bad luck. This gives you 73864.<p>Flip the number backwards, then divide by 7 - the number of deadly sins and the symbol of magic. The outcome is 6691.<p>This number, written backwards, spells 1966 - the year Anthon LaVey founded the Church of Satan.<p>Clearly, we should avoid Remdesivir.<p>But wait, I hear you say. Why did I use ASCII values? Maybe I should use 18 5 13 4 5 19 9 22 9 18, which are the positions of the letters in the alphabet. That would give 58649 as the Remdesivir symbol.<p>OK, fine. But that still ties Remdesivir to Satan:<p>Write the number backwards, add 2 - the symbol of duality. The number is now 94687.<p>Add 4991 to it - the year Jeffrey Dahmer died in prison, written backwards. The result is 99678.<p>Add 61 to it - the atomic number of sulfur, written backwards.

The value is now 93674.<p>Divide by 14 - the number of pieces Osiris was torn into in Egyptian mythology.
