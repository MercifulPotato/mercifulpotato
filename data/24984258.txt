Never heard of anyone in the org using Angular (there&#x27;s some shops doing jQuery&#x2F;Bootstrap stuff, and some at least experimenting with Blazor which isn&#x27;t surprising given how .NET-heavy the org has been.)<p>There was a time when Angular was sort of the enterprise Java of SPA frameworks, but I think that&#x27;s kinda past already, and lots of big boring enterprises missed it completely.')
