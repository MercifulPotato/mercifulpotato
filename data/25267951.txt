Obviously you would only run one of the main functions (via a wrapper) per process invocation and you would need to rename conflicting global symbols at some point before the link step, but this is basically how tools like busybox work. If the application uses global constructors or init functions then those would require special handling since they bypass mainâ€”C tends to work better than C++ in this regard. Applying LTO to the resulting code for inter-application optimization would be an interesting twist.')
