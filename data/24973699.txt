The unprivileged process runs as nobody and is chroot into an empty directory, so the file descriptors are capabilities. It doesn&#x27;t really matter if the unprivileged process is a child of the root one, so long as it discards all inherited resources&#x2F;privileges other than its end of the socket before real work begins.<p>The advantage over merely inheriting resources is that you can grant new resources later on and decide whether to grant them in the stateful manner.')
