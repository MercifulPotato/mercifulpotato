This would mean that there are plenty of cases in which you search for a restaurant and end up on Seamless, even though that&#x27;s not the &quot;right&quot; search result.</i><p>This already happens. These platforms go as far as posing as the businesses themselves, using the businesses&#x27; names and sometimes even stealing assets from the restaurants&#x27; real sites, like the logos or location pictures.<p>Slice did this to a local pizzeria that opened right before the pandemic hit and has been struggling. It&#x27;s just so scummy, but the platforms are betting that small businesses don&#x27;t have the resources to fight them, and they&#x27;re right.<p>If I posed as say, Best Buy or Domino&#x27;s, and created fake websites using their assets, not only would I be dragged into court on civil suits, but I&#x27;d be raided by the FBI for trademark and copyright infringement.')
