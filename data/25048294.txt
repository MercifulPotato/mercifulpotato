They ship as many IOS devices as the China factories can produce and dump trucks full of money keep lining up outside the front door. Why should they spend money on technical documentation, or better developer tools, or even the quality of their desktop operating systems? Those things don&#x27;t make Apple money.<p>What makes Apple money is building pretty, locked-down computerlike appliances that are completely under Apple&#x27;s control. I don&#x27;t think Apple even sees developers as necessary any more, except the ones in their employ.')
