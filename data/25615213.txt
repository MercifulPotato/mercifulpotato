That thing was a beast, but as someone else mentioned cost is a. big consideration too. It had 150 mAh on the newer models, before it was discontinued, so while I&#x27;m sure it definitely eats up energy I think it&#x27;s definitely possible to fit more RAM in the power constraints.<p>Granted that was an e-paper display.  (They had color and black and white options)')
