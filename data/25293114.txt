Your correlations are absolutely not evidence at all.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly fine to <i>recommend</i> them, <i>encourage</i> them, or do information campaigns about them. Let people make their own informed choices. And if you think masks are fantastic, and that people who aren&#x27;t wearing them are assholes, stay away from those people then! It&#x27;s so simple.')
