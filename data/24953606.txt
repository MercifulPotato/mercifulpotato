Of the 50+ Indians who work at our company I think I know the caste of two of them - because of a shared family last name. In my 17 years in the workforce working as an Indian with Indians in America, I have only once heard someone mention their own caste - which was to share      A personal account of discrimination the previous generation of their family faced in India a few decades ago. Having said that, caste discrimination is alive and well in large pockets of ignorance in India and the larger a group of people the higher the likelihood of ignorance and bias. Given the sad history around caste in India, this is not a problem to ignore.')
