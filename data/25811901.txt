Item(by='yangwuzrite', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610900127, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25810245, text='The author of this article has no idea how 2FA works or why it&#x27;s used.<p>2FA is used to prevent or mitigate the impact of phishing or other attacks where a password is compromised (password reuse, random guessing, keylogger, etc.).  The author does bring up one hypothetical attack -- a man-in-the-middle attack -- where someone can trick a user into providing their 2FA or triggering an authorization (like with a Duo push).  This requires the ability to execute a real-time attack.<p>FIDO&#x2F;U2F&#x2F;Webauthn (I still haven&#x27;t figured out exactly what you&#x27;re supposed to call them) security tokens solve that use case by allowing the website to authenticate directly to the token.  That can&#x27;t be phished -- even if you&#x27;re tricked into a fake website and given a fake webauthn prompt, AFAIK there&#x27;s no known way to proxy or otherwise intercept that second factor authentication to allow a phishing attack to succeed.<p>His complaint that the token doesn&#x27;t have a password is largely pointless -- the token is the second factor, the password on the site is the first.  If you&#x27;re using passwordless FIDO2 logins, then it does have a PIN.<p>Long story short, this guy is full of crap.')
