His prescription seems sensible:<p><pre><code>    i. Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.\n\n    ii. Never use a long word where a short one will do.\n\n    iii. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.\n\n    iv. Never use the passive where you can use the active.\n\n    v. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.\n\n    vi. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.\n</code></pre>\n... but I&#x27;m well aware of how sensible an asinine prescription can seem to a layperson.')
