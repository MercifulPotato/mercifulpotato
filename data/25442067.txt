Businesses will try to protect themselves with regulation to whatever extent possible - it&#x27;s what the market does (which is why I find it silly to discuss private markets and governance as if they were two separate and independent things). But &quot;no regulations&quot; isn&#x27;t a solution to regulatory capture. It&#x27;ll only make competition more cut throat (possibly involving real throats being cut), and companies more anticonsumer.<p>(Not that any of this matters much these days - companies like Uber demonstrate that you can absolutely run an <i>illegal</i> operation in western countries, and end up with a double-digit billion dollars IPO.)')
