Until the EU bans these, I don&#x27;t think there is much hope for European social media companies which actually respect EU laws and regulations (American social media companies obviously have nothing but contempt for these regulations and will dig in their heels for every inch they&#x27;re dragged.)<p>Just ban them already.  Hobbling these corporations would help Americans too, for whom legislative reform seems like a pipe dream.  Anything that harms these corporations abroad will negatively impact their ability to lobby American politicians.  That might not be much, but it&#x27;ll be better than the status quo.')
