If you were building a suspension for a car with square wheels and a 900hp engine, you might object immediately and the wheel maker would try again. In software, if you were to object, you’d be in a lengthy discussion about wheel ‘style’ and then get assigned the implementation of your idea for the wheels and engine, which will be ignored anyway, and then you’ll be reprimanded because the suspension doesn’t work. Everybody else’s unit tests pass. The solution is to be ignorant of a better way of doing things, and deliver a cookie-cutter suspension with a unit test over a road surface shaped for square wheels. Now it’s someone else’s problem. But if you’ve ever seen a car or a road before, you’d lose your mind in these meetings knowing that nobody would buy this monstrosity. And you’d be right, but, “not a team player”.')
