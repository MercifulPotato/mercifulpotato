And yes, the article is quite vague in general. I believe it&#x27;s intended as thought-provoking and not really a proper argumentation. I think in that sense it&#x27;s an interesting piece. We must remember to not be too myopic when knees-deep into our over-fitted math frameworks.<p>I&#x27;d only add that, in my opinion, the vehement rejection of non-mainstream ideas is actually more common in non-professional circles. While a physicist may find interesting considering a new idea, a <i>physics enthusiast</i>, in my personal experience, is much more likely to acuse of pseudoscience and crackpottery. It&#x27;s sort of a validating and gregarious warm and fuzzy feeling. <i>Look at those people with their clearly energy-conservation-violating nonsense</i>. Hey, I&#x27;ve done it before.')
