But I would strongly expect to dislike a randomly chosen anime title (generously, filtering down to stuff at least loosely targeted at someone my age). It&#x27;s relatively easy to find curated lists of stuff that is not crap. Games are harder. I feel like at this point I look at a game and can more or less visualize the entire game loop, estimate a low percentage of content that would actually interest me, and just yawn at the prospect of playing it.
