Item(by='boyakasha', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605870273, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25154240, text='&gt; I&#x27;ve discovered that I am nonplussed by patterns that leave other devs downright emotional and it&#x27;s just not worth the effort to discuss<p>One thing that annoys me (and I&#x27;m not saying that you&#x27;re doing it here) is that the people who say it&#x27;s not worth arguing about are usually the ones doing the arguing. Like, if it makes no tangible difference either way, then just let people do whatever. It literally doesn&#x27;t matter. But that&#x27;s not acceptable to the &quot;it&#x27;s not worth discussing&quot; people, and suddenly it becomes very important to discuss consistency. And not just any old consistency. We can&#x27;t just flip a coin. No, it has to be consistent with their favourites, which are correct and therefore not worth discussing.<p>My personal standard is that if somebody suggests a rule and nobody really opposes it then great, enable it. If there is opposition, then it stays disabled until one side can persuade the other. If they truly care about consistency then they are welcome to change sides at any time. Attempts to browbeat the opposition should result in some private feedback from their line manager. There are exceptions for things that matter, but a lot of this stuff just doesn&#x27;t.')
