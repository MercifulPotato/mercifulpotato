Such human factors are too muddy and debatable.  Arguments about any one event, was that particular things real or not, wont ever answer the question.  We must analyze UFO reports in an international context.  The phenomena is very mush only reported in the western world.  There is also a temporal association between UFO reports and contemporaneous Hollywood movies on the subject.  A real phenomena, as in the XKCD above, should be country and culturally agnostic.  Reports should ebb and flow with the number of potential witnesses, not the release dates of movies.')
