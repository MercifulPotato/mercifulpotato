Item(by='WorldMaker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602175446, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24718221, text='&gt; but whether that affects the perceived volume of tinnitus isnâ€™t clear to me<p>My understanding is that varies by person and &quot;type&quot; of tinnitus, but I know my tinnitus is often an inverse relationship with how quiet a room I am in (though it is a slow, dynamic adjustment) and sometimes a white noise generator is helpful to turn the tinnitus volume down a bit. Noise cancelling headphones can certainly create relatively &quot;quiet rooms&quot; that turn up the &quot;tinnitus volume&quot; for me (and part of why I generally prefer headphones without noise cancelling, personally).')
