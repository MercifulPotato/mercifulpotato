Because acceptance is not automatic. There will always be people who won’t accept you as you see yourself.. it is their right.<p>Having said that..<p>As a counter example: as immigrants, we always get ‘where are you from originally’. One can’t be ‘outed’ as an immigrant. It is what it is.<p>And so what? If I had to hide that I am an immigrant, then it would mean that I am ok with discrimination against those who choose to disclose or can’t hide that they are immigrants.<p>It is a fear based position. The calls for suppression of truth comes from a place of fear. I have some compassion for those acting out of fear, but we cannot sacrifice rational means to find fixes to problems ..neither can we suppress freedom of expression.<p>If trans people are discriminated against, we should tackle that phenomena of intolerance. We can’t pretend that trans people don’t exist and we can’t feed the paranoia..justified or not.<p>The only way to figure out answers is to dig down deep to get the root of the issue. This is impossible if we are not allowed to talk about it.')
