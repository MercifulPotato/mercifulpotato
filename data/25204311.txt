C on any real world machine has quite well defined (and expected) behaviour.  In the real world we don&#x27;t expect to have to support 6 bit or 18 bit CPUs today.  Numbers are stored in binary, not trinary.  The C spec should really be tightened up to define a lot of what was left undefined for these relics of history.<p>The worst example of undefined behaviour abuse by a compiler is when gcc developers decided it was a good idea to optimize away a NULL pointer check just because the pointer was dereferenced.  Seriously?  Sometimes I really wonder who comes up with the idea that removing code the developer wrote is OK, but I guess that&#x27;s the primary goal of any optimizing compiler.')
