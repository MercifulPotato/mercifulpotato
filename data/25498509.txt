Huge portions were still orchards and farms that were selling out for new subdivisions. The issue is it&#x27;s a valley. There&#x27;s no more open land unless you move impractically far away.<p>Growth in any area will raise prices but here the issue was compounded by a lack of extra land available after the cheap land was sold.')
