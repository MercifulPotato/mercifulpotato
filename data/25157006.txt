But, if you save often, the built in version control is really nice.<p>It&#x27;s pretty neat though, except for the marketplace is absolutely filled with assets that contain malware. A script can be linked with any object in the game, used to give the object life. But, that script has nearly global control.<p>I think the scripting and standard libraries would really benefit from a huge overhaul, but it&#x27;s pretty neat. There&#x27;s quite a bit of friction getting started though. Much of it isn&#x27;t intuitive, with magic undocumented names required, and you&#x27;ll usually find well meaning, but very beginner, game developers providing colorful information in the forums.')
