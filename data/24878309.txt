Certainly for the databases they have been rock solid. It&#x27;s possible to crash them by running the server out of resources of course, but I have never had them outright crash with a malloc problem. The kernel has more bugs perhaps, but that too has been rather stable for me.<p>C might not be perfect but it&#x27;s clearly perfectly possible to write stable and secure programs in them.')
