Matt Lauer - the lists go on.  Hell do we even need to talk about Roman Polanski or indeed the co-founder of Sundance (where the award that Netflix points out they won) was CONVICTED of child pornography?<p>How does this keep happening? It&#x27;s because there were people like you willing to make the argument you are making - &quot;oh, it&#x27;s just a little bit - it&#x27;s not that bad&quot;.<p>Nope.  There is NO QUARTER.  Not one more square inch.  This movie is flat out unacceptable in and of itself and that is more than enough.  You can defend kiddie diddlers if that&#x27;s really the legacy you want to leave here but I have zero problem being unequivocal on where I stand on this issue.<p>I wish that having people willing to compromise even the slightest on the exploitation of children could shock me - that&#x27;s what&#x27;s even more disgusting to me about this thread.')
