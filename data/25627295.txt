Miles away from our office. Our office is overseas.\n3. I just create a routine and stick to that schedule. I take on as much work as I can, but there&#x27;s only so much I can complete in a day. I know my limitations, I set my boundaries based on my schedule and workload, and I don&#x27;t extend myself beyond.\n4. Pros. I have the flexibility to take care of appointments and errands. There&#x27;s no need to commute, no traffic. I can do the work, anytime and anywhere. I can save money, time and I can wear anything. :)\nCons. There is no physical separation between work and leisure time. Lonely as you were working alone. :(\n5. Having a separate room for office is great but the distractions from the kids, well... :P\n6. Iâ€™ve been working remotely for over eight years now, so definitely.')
