They can literally just raise the price and those that have insurance are going to get it which ultimately covers the loss in those that refuse service due to price.  That ultimately is reflected to the customer in the form of higher premiums which they pay regardless of whether on not they get EKGs.<p>Further, with less people getting services it really is as simple as cutting nursing, doctor, and lab staff because there isn&#x27;t as much demand.<p>It may make a difference if the market was completely unregulated and insurance didn&#x27;t exist at all.  In that case, some guy could do EKGs out of his van at a much lower cost.<p>However, that&#x27;s not the market we have.  Doctors command high salaries and we&#x27;ve regulated that only those with medical licenses can practice medicine.<p>Medicine is not a free market and it&#x27;s a bad idea to ever make it one.  There are already major issues with unlicensed quacks selling placebos.')
