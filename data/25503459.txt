Neat.<p>Related to the Espionage Act specifically, here is an excerpt from Christopher Hitchens [1]:<p>&quot;Everyone knows the fatuous verdict of the greatly overpraised Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes who, asked for an actual example of when it would be proper to limit speech or define it as an action, gave that of shouting &quot;Fire!&quot; in a crowded theatre.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s very often forgotten what he was doing in that case [2] was sending to prison a group of Yiddish-speaking socialists -- whose literature was printed in a language most Americans couldn&#x27;t read -- opposing President Wilson&#x27;s participation in the first World War, and the dragging of the United States into this sanguinary conflict, which the Yiddish-speaking socialists had left from Russia to escape.<p>&quot;In fact, it could be just as plausibly argued that the Yiddish-speaking socialists ... were the real fire fighters, were the ones who were shouting &quot;Fire!&quot; when there really was a fire in a very crowded theatre indeed.&quot;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4Z2uzEM0ugY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4Z2uzEM0ugY</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Schenck_v._United_States" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Schenck_v._United_States</a>')
