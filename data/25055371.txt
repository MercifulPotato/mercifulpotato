Item(by='free_rms', descendants=None, kids=[25055412], score=None, time=1605067122, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25055175, text='Whomever&#x27;s downvoting both of us should chill, first off.<p>Second off..  I mean Biden&#x27;s basically center-right, and he does nothing for any of the values most loudly espoused by the democratic base.  He&#x27;d have been fired from a FAANG company for the &quot;You&#x27;re not black&quot; comment, but everyone just agreed to pretend it didn&#x27;t happen instead because we were stuck with him at that point.<p>So you can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s about values instead of winning.  The thing is, our values <i>would</i> win.  60-70% of the country supports medicare for all, most people would support a more redistributive tax code, most people don&#x27;t like the idea of cops shooting their kid, it goes on and on.  But the democratic professional class refuses to run on those values, again and again.<p>Do you ever see the Republicans telling the pro-life people to eat shit the way the Democrats consistently tell progressives?  No, they make a deal that they&#x27;ll fight for it, probably lose, but at least they&#x27;ll fight, and they get votes for it.<p>And the coup de grace is that anyone who questions the democrats&#x27; commitment must not really be on our side.  Probably a closet racist.  It&#x27;s really kind of genius if your goal is to maintain control of the party.')
