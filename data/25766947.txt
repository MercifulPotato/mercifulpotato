At least not for grade school, less of a problem for college.<p>In France, they initially started to close schools, but for the second wave lockdown, they didn&#x27;t. And now that cases are on the rise again and a third lockdown is being considered, the authorities are pretty clear: schools are the last thing that they will consider closing.<p>At school, kids are really taking the rules seriously, much more than adults: masks, hands washing, etc... no problem. Social distancing is a bit trickier but still, they do their best to do as they are told. One reason they are so docile: they really don&#x27;t want another lockdown with school closure!<p>School is not just about learning stuff. It is a social hub for kids. Most of us here are probably lucky enough to have a good family, but for some, it is the only place where people actually care about them. It also teaches kids to be good citizens, respect authority, etc..., which is most important when parents don&#x27;t do it.<p>That&#x27;s not really answering the question, but my recommendation would be: try to get your kids to school for real, taking as many precautions as necessary. Kids are low risk for covid, are not that good spreaders and they won&#x27;t get their lockdown time back. I think that small risk is worth it.')
