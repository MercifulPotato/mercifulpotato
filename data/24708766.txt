I don&#x27;t have any history with Fiat but I do know since the merger of Chrysler &amp; Fiat in 2014 Jeep has gone downhill. As others have mentioned it&#x27;s become a lifestyle brand instead of a utility brand. IMO once more people become aware of the significant reduction in their utility value then their sales will plummet. But I could be wrong. All I know is I have a 2008 Jeep Wrangler with 220,000 miles on it and I found it worthwhile to drop a new engine in it. That was a cheaper and more reliable option than getting a new vehicle - even knowing in 2-3 years I&#x27;m going to have to put a new transmission into it.')
