On the Contrary, due to the automatic admission requirements the most common person you&#x27;ll meet on campus is an upper&#x2F;middle class person from a Houston suburb.<p>I&#x27;ve never encountered the &quot;white men being the source of the world&#x27;s problem&quot; thing in person at any point, only in characterizations online and in some people blaming some perceived slight or disadvantage on it. I even took a wide range of the &quot;softer&quot; liberal arts courses to supplement my CS education.<p>I also disagree with UT Austin being a particularly liberal campus beyond a typical college campus. Austin itself is plenty liberal compared to the average city in Texas but again, due to the automatic admission requirements, UT is really a fairly average distribution of upper&#x2F;middle class people throughout Texas.<p>I&#x27;ve also had more professors try to sell me on the ministry of Jesus (3, insistently) than on any sort of leftist politics (1, in my Eastern Philosophy course) and had one professor that moved to UT Austin after being ejected from his prior university for in his words &quot;being too conservative&quot;.')
