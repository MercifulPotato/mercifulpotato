Item(by='eaton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612120051, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25976607, text='&gt; Trying to act like just because they aren&#x27;t all a scam doesn&#x27;t mean there isn&#x27;t a systemic problem of waste that still needs to be addressed<p>No, of course not. But it&#x27;s undeniable that these threads on HN (and other engineering-dominated forums) always include a healthy dollop of &quot;I&#x27;d have done that better, because I&#x27;m a <i>good</i> software engineer&quot; disdain. It&#x27;s often paired with ignorance of how large-scale enterprise and government contracts and procurement work, what roles are necessary for large-scale projects with a significant discovery component, and what the planning process looks like when a team can&#x27;t afford to launch-and-get-feedback or fail-fast-and-learn their way to a full specification.<p>I mean, this Deloitte project and the rollout are clearly a shitshow on a million levels. They got a no-bid contract for an eye-popping sum, then more than doubled it before the building even started! But the approaches boldly prescribed in most of the comments here wouldn&#x27;t have produced a working system at the scale needed, either â€” only a cheaper broken one. A cheaper failure is still a failure.')
