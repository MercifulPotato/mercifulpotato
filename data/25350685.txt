Eventually they realize it doesn&#x27;t pay bills but while it does make them feel great and that&#x27;s the temporary payoff. We all learn from our mistakes.\nIt might also be genuine kinship with their coworkers and this is exactly where the leadership of the said company is extremely smart and evil at the same time: they know how to attract intelligent benevolent nerds to exploit and they know that they&#x27;ll eventually smarten up and leave but the world is large, <i>There&#x27;s a sucker born every minute</i><p>All in all, the revolving door and the high churn rate won&#x27;t make a big dent for the company.')
