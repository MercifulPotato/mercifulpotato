Computers are <i>supposed</i> to be our agent in the digital realm, reaching out for us, in our best interests.<p>If we turn off all storage of personalised information completely and utterly, 95% of everything I ask can be answered from context (please show me cheap TVs).<p>Look, i don&#x27;t object to the idea behind the sandbox (it&#x27;s always been weird that browsers tell the server what fonts and other settings exist.  I mean who ever optimised for that)<p>What bothers me is that it&#x27;s a google id.  Just let me have a few U2F ids - this is my shopping id, track it if you may. when I take it out of the slot stop tracking me.<p>I am sure I am feeling extra grumpy today, but when we stop tracking and trying to find ways to make me buy, and start finding ways to make my life better, that&#x27;s when we have a digital revolution.')
