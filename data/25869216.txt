Google benefits from networking build out, regardless of if they&#x27;re providing the network; it&#x27;s just as good for them if someone else builds the network. If starlink can fill the niche that Loon filled, that works just as well for Google, on someone else&#x27;s capex&#x2F;opex.<p>Or if the freespace optics they worked on for Loon can reduce backhaul costs for traditional cell towers, that might help get more deployed in areas that don&#x27;t have connectivity; which again works well for Google.')
