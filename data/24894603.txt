I would gladly buy a premium Lenovo 2in1 or some Ryzen 5xxx series ultra portable windows laptop (they are much better on thermals from what I&#x27;ve seen) but I still need a OSX client from time to time unfortunately. There&#x27;s just no flexibility with Apple ecosystem - you either fit into their intended use cases or you&#x27;re stuck with suboptimal tradeoffs.')
