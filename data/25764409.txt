Now let&#x27;s also take a marriage rate of 5 per 1000, which is pretty low given that this is a historic opportunity. Even granting this, the actual numbers indicate a rate close to 3 per 1000. This is close to half of the current rates, which are widely seen as historic lows:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jec.senate.gov&#x2F;public&#x2F;index.cfm&#x2F;republicans&#x2F;2020&#x2F;4&#x2F;marriage-rate-blog-test" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jec.senate.gov&#x2F;public&#x2F;index.cfm&#x2F;republicans&#x2F;2020...</a><p>This is in a new england state. So it&#x27;s not something you accuse due to being in the Bible belt. In actual numbers, the impact of gay marriage is fairly tiny. Your friends are outliers. It&#x27;s actually tiny enough to hurt a lot of compelling reasons for it; state-sanctioned marriage as a tool to help combat gay male promiscuity for one, or any form of economic benefit to it. Ironically SSM wasn&#x27;t something to worry about because the people who want or need it are small enough a population not to impact anything in practice; it was more of an ideological issue it seems.<p>As for climate change, yeah my point is if we do identity politics now, over things which are let or let live, what is going to happen when there are things that we cannot do so? I think it will ramp up more even.')
