The rules look like they were designed for maximum entertainment and sudden changes. The fact that you can win with less votes. When the other person already has 250 electors, but then on the last second you flip Florida or Pennsylvania with a few thousand votes and bam! you are the president!<p>That&#x27;s why people love watching your elections so much. Or maybe also because of the fallout in their countries.')
