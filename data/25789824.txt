And so the other way is to cause the energy to be reflected in various different direction so that it is not perceived as single sound.<p>And so, putting objects in your room helps a lot as any person that has removed all their furniture from their room can attest.<p>When you remove furniture the room acoustics suddenly becomes very noticeable due to powerful reflections and standing waves from bare, parallel, hard wall surfaces.')
