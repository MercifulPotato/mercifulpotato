IP reputation also obviously makes sense to take into account, but the fact that Google collects all of this fingerprinting information demonstrates that’s again only a part of what factors in. The same profile can show up from behind a different IP.<p>Not sure what you’re getting at about GDPR and IP reputation. GDPR says that an IP address is PII if it can be associated with an individual, but that doesn’t mean an IP address is a “subject” for the purpose of filing an Article 15 Data Subject Access Request. And it doesn’t mean that stored information that is keyed by an IP address is personal data, even if the IP address can be associated back to a particular individual.<p>I also find it strange that you’re talking about reCAPTCHA being “anti-trust candy” in the comments of an announcement about how a <i>different</i> captcha service now handles 15% of the entire internet.')
