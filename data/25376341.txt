Item(by='BadInformatics', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607622789, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25369464, text='I think my point emphasized aesthetics too much to the detriment of the main argument, so let me rephrase: aesthetics are also important if you want a of majority enterprise users to enjoy using your product (ask anyone who has had to deal with SAP). There will always be a few who love the brutalist or &quot;power user&quot; UI, but I think we&#x27;re in agreement that visual appearance does matter.<p>With all that out of the way, the example I _wanted_ to raise above (but neglected to, apologies) with the &quot;kool-aid&quot; drinkers is that corporate users are absolutely aware of how fast and responsive something is _in addition_ to how it looks. I think many folks have been in a screen share or training session where the presenter has to awkwardly wait for an application they&#x27;re &quot;selling&quot; to load or respond to input. Is the presenter oblivious to this latency? I&#x27;d say they are even more aware given the audience, if not flustered. That was the thrust of &quot;people are not idiots&quot;.<p>WRT why people continue to use this software, I think you underestimate the impact of top-level purchasing&#x2F;procurement and the captive enterprise audience. Those making purchasing decisions are less likely to use software after the sales demo and thus are not exposed to any UX or latency issues. Again. there is no idiocy or mal-intent here either, it&#x27;s just an artifact of how bigcos operate.')
