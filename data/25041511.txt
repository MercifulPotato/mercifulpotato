I try not to buy known brands from Amazon unless the ability to identify a counterfeit is really easy. This has been especially problematic with clothing, and I just don&#x27;t buy clothing from them anymore unless it&#x27;s from a cheap unknown brand where I don&#x27;t care about the quality&#x2F;brand.')
