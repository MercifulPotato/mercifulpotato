Slow consumer does not slow down ingest which means that your task executor is simply that - processing is slower but no data is lost because ingest is still operational.<p>Kafka is not a queue. It&#x27;s a distributed log. The difference is significant because in a queue, the message can be processed by a single worker within the single unit of time - message is picked, locked, nobody else can see it, after processing, message is either acked or nacked.<p>In a log, multiple consumers can process the same message in parallel. If a message is bad, it is usually skipped by simply advancing the offset to the next offset.<p>The log has the advantage that the reason for slow processing is easy to identify and isolate - it&#x27;s the slow consumer. It&#x27;s also very easy to monitor the consumption lag - simply look at how fast the maximum offset grows vs what&#x27;s the current consumed offset (high &#x2F; low watermark). If the difference grows, your consumer is too slow.')
