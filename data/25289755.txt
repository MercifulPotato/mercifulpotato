If I can&#x27;t negotiate my cell phone contact I&#x27;m placed in an impossible scenario where I either agree under duress or endure the impossible life of someone that refuses to sign contracts. Essentially, there are 4-6 contracts I&#x27;m capable of negotiating in my life out of tens of thousands I&#x27;ve agreed to under duress. Those 4-6 are: apartment lease (keep the Wi-Fi take off $50), groundskeeping (days, times, work to be done, breachs), trash (when, where). These negotiations are only possible because these companies have sole proprietors who will get on the phone to keep a customer. Let&#x27;s move every company closer to this model by requiring every contract to be negotiable or, if online, optout no guarantees, no warranty, no liability, no tracking except for carefully and explicitly outlined exceptions.')
