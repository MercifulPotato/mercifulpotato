Wait a few minutes. HN does not allow immediate replies to new comments. This is the preferred solution.<p>2. Click the timestamp on the comment to get that comment on a separate page. On that view you can reply even if the comment is in the &quot;no replies yet&quot; window from #1. (I&#x27;m not sure if this is a bug or a feature).')
