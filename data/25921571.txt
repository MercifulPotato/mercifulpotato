JIRA is by far the worst. The functionality is ok. Maybe it is a bit bloated. Maybe our process is a little over complicated. That&#x27;s not a big deal. The thing that really gets me is performance.<p>The performance is absolute dog shit. Every interaction with it painfully slow. For example, the page to view a single issue is almost 20MB fetched over 100 HTTP requests and takes 10 seconds to load. This is without cache. With assets cached, it is still 4 seconds to render. This is the fastest interaction by the way. Everything else is worse.<p>Maybe some of this is my organization&#x27;s fault. I really don&#x27;t know. What I do know is that it is so slow that I dread every interaction with it.')
