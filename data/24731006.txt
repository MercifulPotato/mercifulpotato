I am and live among white first world people and I often hear the opinion that the problems of muslim immigrants both here and in their home country are caused by their bad character traits, either culturally or genetically.<p>To me this is bullshit. Most of these problems are caused by poverty. If you&#x27;re poor you don&#x27;t have good education, information, nutrition, health systems and all the like. And that causes all sorts of disadvantages people can&#x27;t imagine. It&#x27;s not character or genetics.')
