In my environment (from helping people with their computers) I regularly hear things like &quot;Damn HP, wanting â‚¬80 for a set of tiny ink cartridges&quot;.<p>And most people know very well how to find their aftermarket ink, either in the shop or online. None of them think what they&#x27;re buying is official. Sometimes (but rarely) really cheap ink does cause printer problems, but even then it&#x27;s worth the risk. An Inkjet is pretty much &quot;total loss&quot; after the first ink change anyway (a full cartridge set costs close to what the printer is worth).<p>I always advise Epson EcoTank ones for inkjet use (though these are pretty pricey) and Brother for laser (which besides not being bound to expensive toners are actually some of the cheapest printers around too). For most people a simple B&#x2F;W laser is sufficient anyway (and just to order photos online).<p>But they often end up falling for Canon, Lexmark or HP again because they&#x27;re just cheap and fall for their marketing even though they were bitten by extremely overpriced cartridges before... &lt;facepalm&gt;')
