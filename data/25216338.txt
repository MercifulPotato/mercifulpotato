Only took a few seconds to understand it and authn via twitter<i>, and create my 1st blrb. The &quot;edit&quot; fn seemed unresponsive (at least before I tapped &quot;save&quot;). But it works, and I appreciate the focus on doing one simple thing.<p>The transcription was pretty good, just a few v minor errors.<p></i> I was quick to trust use of twitter for auth bc I know who you are, but was surprised at how frictionless it was -- did I really not see any disclaimers or opt-in &#x2F; legalese at all?')
