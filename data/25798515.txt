Fitzgerald was a master writer so that in itself is why English teachers love to recommend his book. The story is less powerful now than when it was written close to 100 years ago. Society is different and the basic ideas have been rehashed many times in different works over the years.<p>At the very least, it&#x27;s worth reading for its simplicity and poetic writing. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s an English language book that can match it.')
