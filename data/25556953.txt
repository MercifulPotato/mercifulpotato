Same with strangers, some people are unhinged enough to rant and rave in public, i wont share my thoughts on anything until I know whether you are going to have a rational response or not, and i keep it to my self to avoid interjections from people who are passionate enough to complain to a stranger. Like some of my surf spots are filled with regulars who are vocal conspiracy right wing political people and let everyone know it. I&#x27;m not sharing my thoughts about anything in that kind of environment<p>though i agree, this article is kind of weak, the topic it self based off the headline could be interesting')
