This is mostly relevant to embedded processors, and my understanding is ARM and RISC-V is somewhat equal there.<p>But for 64-bit, ARM has dropped support for Thumb, while RISC-V still supports compressed instructions. In that case, RISC-V is more dense than ARM. I can&#x27;t find the numbers for that right now, but I read it just yesterday so I&#x27;m pretty sure I remember correctly.<p>Also keep in mind that Thumb is a mode that the ARM CPU has to switch to, while RISC-V compressed instructions can be mixed with normal instructions.')
