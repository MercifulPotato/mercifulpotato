It&#x27;s about in line with my experience. I think my frustration so far isn&#x27;t in the expectation of being cured, but in not have any treatment giving any kind of relief that&#x27;s not measured in minutes, even just taking the edge off of the pain, as you described. I will definitely take to heart the suggestion of tempering my expectations. Thanks again for sharing.')
