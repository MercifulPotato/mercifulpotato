Playing Empire was a favorite obsession in my undergrad years (Batak was my preferred country name back in the day.)  I loved the explore and expand part of the game, building countries and setting up a productive economic engine.  The fighting?  Not so much.  I was a tasty little hors d&#x27;oeuvre for someone better at conquest in the later stages of the game.  The luckiest someone like that could get would be to have me on their border to set up a well run, but ineptly defended country.<p>Good times.')
