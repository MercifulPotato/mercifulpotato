If I upload code to GitHub with no license attached, it is technically “all rights reserved.” As in, you have no right to use it <i>at all</i>. If someone has no way of finding out their legal right to use my code, they aren’t allowed to. Same with YouTube: if I make a movie and put it on YT, that’s <i>not</i> an implicit license for you to copy elsewhere.<p>Logically, it being on a torrent website, you would think it would be different because seeding is a thing, but the law says otherwise.<p>The problem is that the law doesn’t make a distinction between “seeding” and “distribution”. They’re one and the same.<p>Disclaimer: IANAL')
