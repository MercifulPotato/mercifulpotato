It is only a matter of time before one of the CEOs will deliver a Henry Reardon (Ayn Rand&#x27;s Atlas Shrugged) styled speech which will leave these smarty pant Senators with an egg on face. It wont come from Sundar, Jack or Zuck but it will come from someone. Perhaps someone like Musk.<p>Instead of using these hearings to genuinely uncover information we don&#x27;t have, Senators are using this to ask rhetorical questions that can give sensational headlines for the partisan websites e.g. &quot;Who elected you ? Angry Cruz flays far left tech company Twitter&#x27;s CEO&quot;. I have seen ordinary journalists asking more relevant and better questions to Jack and others than these Senators.<p>These hearings were once about people holding other powerful individuals accountable. Now they are about clever soundbytes ironically optimized for platforms like Twitter.')
