The law doesn&#x27;t change quickly, and medicine hardly changes at all from year to year.  Our mental models of civilization don&#x27;t really change much from year to year.  And the human body doesn&#x27;t visibly evolve even from decade to decade.  Of course it&#x27;s easier to have a meaningful certification in those fields.<p>Software still changes incredibly quickly.  Not as quickly as in the 1990&#x27;s -- but not slowly enough to warrant blanket certification bureaucracy that will just have to change in 5-10 years.')
