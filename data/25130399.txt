You&#x27;ll find a simpler, smaller set of rules is guiding them (which can be somewhat unique to your tastes).  Also as an artist I would advise paying attention to both hue and saturation when looking at outfits. Usually things look bad because people put too many brightly saturated colours next to each other.')
