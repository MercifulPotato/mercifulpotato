Most clients want to know exactly what they&#x27;re getting and how much it will cost. Experienced tech leaders know estimates are estimates and clients usually can&#x27;t even articulate what they need clearly enough anyway. It&#x27;s why client services people get paid so much and why it&#x27;s so hard to find good ones.')
