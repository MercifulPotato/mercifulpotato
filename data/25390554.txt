Usually the <i>actual</i> source of long startup times is the incessant need for these machines to spin up oodles and oodles of background services doing who-knows-what, and it&#x27;s remarkable how much faster a machine boots when these services are pared down to more reasonable minima.  And worse, it&#x27;s these background services that often make modern computers feel so slow even after they&#x27;re booted up.')
