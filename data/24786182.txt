When my daughter got old enough to ask why don&#x27;t we have a printer I said: Whenever you want to print, go to the library and I&#x27;ll give you the money for printing, there is no limit. For some reason the whole family&#x27;s printing budget has never exceeded 5 Euros per year in the last 20 years. Distance to the library cannot be the reason, it is 1 minute from school. I worked in a paperless company for many years, where the printer was locked to print only contracts and similar documents.<p>While printing is overrated, of course the library printer needs a driver, too. And preferably open source in true Stallman spirit (I&#x27;m not a big Stallman fan, but wasn&#x27;t it so that the whole Free Software movement started because of a closed source printer driver?). But as a domain of little general importance, I am not surprised about the lack of a thriving community.')
