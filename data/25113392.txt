Just had symptoms I never had before in the 2 waves we had in france, just after meeting persons who also got seek at the same time. This is enough coincidence for me to think I have covid.<p>I also think that this reasoning may be more accurate that the official not very accurate covid tests.<p>Doing this reasoning myself also saved me money and the 4h waiting queue to do the test (the last thing I want to do when I have fever).<p>On the other side, I know people who had symptoms, tested negative (and trusted the test) and still when out to meet (and maybe contaminate) friends or colleagues.')
