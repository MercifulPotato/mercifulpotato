The goal right now is not to store sensitive data in Config.ly - your read API keys will be on your clients - and so in theory anyone who can read that source code can fetch your keys.<p>&gt; Who has access to each client&#x27;s database? Is it audited? Is it encrypted at rest? I&#x27;m sure it is, but Config.ly would be wise to add this information to avoid fears.<p>This is great feedback, thank you.')
