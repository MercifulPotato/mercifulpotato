I forget this every single time I open a tweet thread and try to figure out the context.<p>Once you scroll up, it sort of makes sense -- each tweet with a line connecting user icons but then suddenly the expanded tweet thread has the main tweet in a larger font, then the &quot;retweet&#x2F;like&quot; controls below it, THEN another line of smaller-font tweets that comprise the thread. Then you get some limited number and have to click &quot;more&quot; for more.<p>The monochrome of it all reminds me of when GMail got rid of the very helpful colors-for-threads and went to grey on grey on grey.<p>It&#x27;s not visually apparent at all.')
