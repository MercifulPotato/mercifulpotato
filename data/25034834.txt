Sort of close to the lowest rungs of other caste systems.<p>Modern Capitalist workers actually have a very large spectrum they encompass, from very rich to very poor. Which is not totally unlike Athenian slaves, some of whom could become quite rich. But doubtless the modern worker has far more freedoms, and elects to restrict their life, in part due to institutionalized fear of no wages.')
