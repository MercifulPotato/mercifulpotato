Do you have a problem with capitalism? The purpose of work is to earn a living. Outside of hobbyists and open source developers, nobody does this for free. It&#x27;s work.<p>Should app developers be poor and unable to earn a living off apps? I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s not what you mean, but that&#x27;s how this comes across.<p>I think what you mean is that you&#x27;re happy Apple controls distribution. My argument is that this isn&#x27;t fair - they&#x27;ve built a computer, captured 50% of the US market, and control every economic funnel around these consumers, the likes of which we&#x27;ve never seen before in human history.<p>They have a mega monopoly. They&#x27;re distorting the entire market. There are consumers, and then there are <i>Apple consumers</i>. Try to do business with the latter group without going through Apple, jumping through hoops, and getting taxed. And you come out without a direct relationship with your customer.<p>iMonopoly')
