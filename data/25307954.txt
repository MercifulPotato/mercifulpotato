Let me explain.<p>To me, clickbait means that I&#x27;m luring you into reading an article by using a catchy title, but the content of the article doesn&#x27;t exactly match what I expected; or that I use human psychology to trick you into opening a new web page (e.g. &quot;you will never guess what happened next&quot;).<p>I instead find the title refreshingly nice and simple, and reading the article fully matched my expectations. Great &quot;marketing&quot; (the ability to pick a catchy title is good marketing) shouldn&#x27;t be confused with being clickbaity.')
