But they&#x27;re not priced as powerful high-end devices. The Pinebook Pro is $199 -- what other thin, metal chassis ultrabook with reasonable display, input devices etc can you get for that price new? This watch is $25, no-one expects it to have monster specs. An older, proven low-power chipset arguably makes things easier for a device to tinker with anyway.<p>That said, I too would love to see higher specced devices from Pine. An update to the Pinebook with a fancy new ARM chip and 16GB ram would be tempting indeed.')
