I used text mode daily for many years on a succession of 3 PCs and did not notice any slowness when I switched to graphics mode (around 2006). I am pretty sure graphics mode is slower, and I didn&#x27;t notice only because the slowdown does not bother me.<p>Similarly, when I switched from Terminal.app to Emacs&#x27;s shell mode for interacting with Bash, I didn&#x27;t mind the fact that it was much slower (because &quot;cursor control characters&quot; and ANSI color codes are processed by Emacs byte code rather than much faster objective C code) whereas other users here on HN find Emacs shell mode unusably slow.<p>I am usually the first person to be annoyed (e.g., by the flicker from many brands of LED bulbs) so it is refreshing to find a tech trend that annoys someone else before it annoys me because I have the luxury of sitting back and watching them lobby for reform before the trend continues far enough to annoy me :)')
