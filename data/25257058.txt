And rich people &#x2F; institutions doing whatever they can to &quot;make money&quot; no matter what.<p>Am I saying crypto has no value at all and never will? No- but it&#x27;s stupid that the &quot;drive&quot; for people to create new cryptos and hold current crypto is to uh.. make money off of it vs a currency like USD?  That&#x27;s stupid as hell.<p>Crypto that is not pegged to something like USD is made for gambling and to make the rich richer.  If I were to &quot;gamble&quot; $1000 in crypto the last few years sure, maybe I make 50-100k. Whoopdydoo. Yeah that&#x27;s great but it&#x27;s not like mega life altering.  Rich people can be like &quot;Oh I&#x27;m going to throw $1 million into this.. oh look, I just made $50-100 million, now I can take this and buy a bunch of new businesses or buy my new mega mansion somewhere!&quot;.  It&#x27;s just sickening, honestly.')
