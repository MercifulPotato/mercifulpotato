I was expecting for it to feature in the article and sure enough there it was.<p>The narrative that &quot;bad people use X&quot; becomes &quot;bad people used X to do thing Y and the government was helpless to stop it, omg!&quot; in various echo chambers. Soon, news reports start appearing with &quot;Thing X was used by bad person. If only the government could have acted in time, tragedy would have been averted&quot;.<p>The various governments and TLA&#x27;s arguing about the need for back-doors is akin to them complaining that they can&#x27;t solve crime because of the invention and use of curtains on windows. I mean, can you picture them arguing that if only people left their curtains wide open all the time then there would be no more crime happening inside houses.')
