Those of you like me who were building industrial and military software in that era know what I&#x27;m talking about. The web, and JavaScript, etc. and even windowing systems were a huge step backwards in terms of software productivity. Those of you who were programming nuclear power plants, battle ships, air traffic control systems, etc. please weight in and tell me if you disagree. Those who didn&#x27;t - I&#x27;m honestly not interested in your opinion.')
