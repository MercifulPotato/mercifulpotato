But what was and is always stunning, are the details of the moon ... (you need a filter, though).\nYou can see the shades of the crates moving for example.<p>Oh - and sunspots. Meaning you turn your telescope around and project the picture of the sun.<p>But one day soon, I am going to order a real one. \n(But I also always wanted to have my own observatory.\nAnd I guess, if I have that, .. I can&#x27;t wait for my own space based telescope. Ah yes, the greed ..)<p>Anyway, enjoy what you have :)')
