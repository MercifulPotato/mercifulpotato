Repeat until you only have a digit or two, and what&#x27;s left is a multiple of 13 iff the original number was.<p>Clearer as an example: Is 4173 divisible by 13? First iteration: 417 - (3 x 9) = 390. Second: 39 - (0 x 9) = 39. And 39 is divisible by 13, so 4173 is. (No worries if the last subtraction gives a negative result; same rule applies.)<p>To test for divisibility by 7, do exactly the same thing, but multiply the one&#x27;s digit by 2 instead of 9. For 17, use 5. For 11, use 1.<p>I learned the divisible-by-7 trick from a book when I was a kid, but didn&#x27;t figure out why it works, and how to generalize it, until I was embarrassingly adult. Left as an exercise for the reader.')
