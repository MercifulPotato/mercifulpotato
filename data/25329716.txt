Even wealthy countries with developed healthcare&#x2F;government infrastructure are missing a significant fraction of deaths (in the USA alone, we have probably missed about 100k Covid deaths from the confirmed count). In many less developed countries, a majority (in some cases an overwhelming majority) of Covid deaths are never counted as such.<p>It will be hard to get a total estimate until at least a year or two after the pandemic is over, because even in developed countries death reporting can lag by up to a year (that’s leaving aside cause-of-death attribution). If you check back in a year or two WHO, CDC, etc. will have much better estimates for the total death toll in 2020, with (possibly wide) error bars you can largely trust.<p>Beyond that, this is weak pedantry about the definition of “millions”. People commonly use this plural to mean &gt;1 million; we’re talking about the order of magnitude here, not the precise count.')
