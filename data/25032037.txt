That&#x27;s what the ballots are like shuffled through the USPS....homogeneous....there&#x27;s no cream rising to the top of the bottle, and there&#x27;s no stacks of Kings or Aces lodged all in one spot because the system (mail) shuffled them.<p>There should be no discernible patterns of any kind.<p>One for you, two for me, two for me, two more for me, three for you, one for you, one for me, two for you and so on, all leading on his graphs, towards a very straight line.<p>So there shouldn&#x27;t be a stack of ballots that suddenly burst on to his graphs leaning heavily to one group or the other at any given time....but there is....in multiple states, all happening in the wee hours of the morning.....and all happening on the 4th.<p>And in each state, they all (on the 4th), lean Democrat.<p>Discernibly.
