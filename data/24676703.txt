But even in JavaScript one may write +obj.version instead of obj.version to make it numeric. Evading this is a straight way to hell.<p>In a statically typed one, conversion is typically generated from description and type checking applies just at reading.<p>The problem with vaguely specified format is in more simplex cases.
