I still remember searching for anything that&#x27;s not Kibana since their interface has been dreadful (and probably still is). I remember people turning away from Logstash to Fluentd and others pretty early, but don&#x27;t know the exact reasons. I remember when pretty important and frankly &quot;core&quot; stuff like authentication and authorization among others moved into Shield and other specialized commercial plugins.<p>They have leveraged almost a decade of developer good-will to cope with their inherent architectural problems and to fight for introducing &quot;weird open source software&quot; in their respective companies and ultimately give them their street cred of &quot;logging aggregation == ELK&quot;. Now, after most of their stack &quot;just works&quot; like people expect it to, they throw it all away, putting people who fought for them in license jeopardy while pointing the finger at Amazon? I don&#x27;t have any sympathy for this. It&#x27;s your business, if it fails, nobody is at fault but yourself, especially if you a 14B behemoth. May the exodus begin, it&#x27;s long overdue.')
