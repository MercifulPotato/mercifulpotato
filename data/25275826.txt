I&#x27;m aware exponentiation is more fundamental, but the kind of exponentiation you are referring to is related to the intuitive concept of &quot;do this N times&quot;, which only makes sense for positive integers.<p>When you are talking about real numbers, the notion of &quot;repeated multiplication&quot; and &quot;exponentiation&quot; diverge, for example, (-2)^2 is well defined and equal to (-2)(-2), but (-2)^(1&#x2F;2) isn&#x27;t, unless you relate it to the exponential function.<p>Since the OP was about a notation proposal for working with real numbers, in that specific context I believe the more natural interpretation is to relate everything to the complex exponential and work your way up from there.')
