I can&#x27;t wait for him to be replaced.<p>Comments like this make zero sense to me. Apple might be better if Jobs was still alive. But without a time machine, and potentially better medicine, that&#x27;s not an option.<p>Under Cook Apple:<p>- Increased profitability and market share massively.<p>- Created the most successful watch brand in the world.<p>- Turned Beats into Beats + AirPods, the two most successful headphone brands in the world.<p>- Massively increased Mac, iPhone, iPad, install base.<p>- Avoided the sort of ridiculous cash burning acquisitions to inflate growth Ballmer was guilty of.<p>Apple has a bunch of mis-steps under Cook, but none of them have had long term company damaging impact. Many of the things people beat Cook up over were actually things Jobs was as bad&#x2F; worse with. For example almost all the App Store policies everyone hates were created under Jobs. Jobs was also far more protective and litigious.<p>Cook isn&#x27;t Jobs, since Jobs is dead the comparison is pointless. Cook has done better than the vast majority of CEOs who have taken over successful brands. Apple is doing just fine.')
