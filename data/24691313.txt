Period.<p>what a stunningly pretentious and ignorant thing to say.<p>reasons to be tired and drive: rotating shiftwork, working multiple jobs, caring for a newborn, caring for the sick. that covers millions of people, off the top of my head, without doing any research. and those are only the most black-and-white examples. more ambiguous cases include: driving from physical activity like OP mentioned, long drives to visit friends&#x2F;family, events like weddings.<p>if you want to make the argument that sleepy driving is more dangerous than we give it credit for, then we can talk - but thats not what you said. &quot;You should never get behind the wheel if there&#x27;s a chance you&#x27;ll fall asleep!&quot; is an absurd thing to say.')
