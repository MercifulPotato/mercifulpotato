The intellectual view that &quot;all speech is about power, not truth&quot; is much more prevalent among the left.<p>Now, that wasn&#x27;t a view that was largely held on the right.  In fact, I suspect it still isn&#x27;t.  The &quot;post truth&quot; on the right are people who still believe in truth, believe that they have it, and won&#x27;t listen to any evidence to the contrary.  In fact, maybe this is the consequence of the &quot;post truth&quot; left - if the right believes that the left believes what the left says about speech, then the right has no reason to trust any truth claim coming from the left.<p>But the <i>change</i> may in fact be as you say, that the post-truth people grew on the right.  Now you can&#x27;t sway chunks of either side with facts.')
