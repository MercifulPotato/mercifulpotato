(see the abysmal C which at least doesn&#x27;t pretend anything at all, C++ which doesn&#x27;t require you to know all this stuff and then it just blows up if you make a particularly wrong misstep and most recently Rust, which will call you names for using the wrong type in the wrong place, in turn greatly confusing people who say strings are easy).')
