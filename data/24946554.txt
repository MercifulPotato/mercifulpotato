The effect of wolf in environment and its role as key species is described in conferences monographs and books.<p>Teams of scientists studied the populations of each single big mammal and bird in Yellowstone, before and after wolves. You can find their conclusions in the libraries of all universities specialized in ecology and animal management.<p>The results were even better than expected, but this was a big success because it was based in a entire life of previous hard work.<p>We talk about reviewed, easily verifiable and painfully verified facts, not about a pulp novel written on a weekend or somebody tossing a coin. Do you really think that somebody could just upload a fakebook video linking to a fake scientific article in this field without being detected and disclosed immediately?')
