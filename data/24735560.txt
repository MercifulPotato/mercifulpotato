I&#x27;ve never used a pen so much in my life.<p>Some things I noticed from writing several thousand sticky notes:<p>Writing by hand might help me remember stuff, but it definitely helps me ignore stuff. Overall I enjoy using a pen, digital or otherwise, and I <i>still</i> want to subject myself to writing as little as possible. Handwriting makes me a better editor.<p>I use cursive for some things, but 99% of my sticky notes are in &#x27;ALL CAPS&#x27;. I&#x27;m not sure why.<p>Wayfinding and reexperiencing a large amount of handwritten notes&#x2F;ideas&#x2F;plans is much more preferable to me than walls of text, especially if their placement and orientation is imperfect (on a virtual or real wall).<p>Writing&#x2F;drawing over graphics is a great memory aid for me.<p>Handwriting seems a great choice for big picture stuff. I&#x27;m not sure why.<p>I still use a keyboard for brain dumps, but increasingly rely on speech to text. The difference in the style and tone of my words across handwriting, typing and speech to text&#x27;ing surprises me.')
