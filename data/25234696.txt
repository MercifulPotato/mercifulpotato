It came out nicely and the presentation went without a hitch. I liked the flexibility in slide progression (you can easily create a graph of sorts to pick different paths to go through as a presenter, instead of just a linear progression). But honestly I struggle to think of many cases where you really need HTML&#x2F;JS for your presentation.')
