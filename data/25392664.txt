But with space not being at a premium, I would happily restate something from up-thread because it can make it easier to read and reply to.<p>&gt; If the worse-case engineering disaster ... millions would have died.<p>No, I don&#x27;t think so. I think you&#x27;d need an engineered, as in intentional, disaster for that. Like terrorists.<p>And engineering disaster (improper planning) is what Fukushima had. That&#x27;s very unlikely to be improper enough to kill an entire city because engineering mistakes tend to be planned for to some degree and mitigated by building redundant systems.<p>Very unlikely to cause a disaster, as in almost impossible even if you tried to form the same materials into a bomb.')
