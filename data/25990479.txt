What I ideally want is a a dumb drive bay I could buy, and then connect ( somehow ) to my existing server, so I could use its CPU and RAM.<p>I don&#x27;t want this drive bay to have its own CPU, I just want it to hold data and transfer it over some wire. Ideally I would achieve close to gigabit speeds requesting data off of this server&#x2F;drive bay.<p>Some options I&#x27;ve explored are those dumb quad storage bays that connect over USB-3. But I was worried about running ZFS over a USB interface, as well as potentially parallel read and writes with the quality of the USB controller.')
