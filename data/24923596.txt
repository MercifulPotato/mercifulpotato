Where the corporate PAC spreads its money is more like lubrication to enable their will, but the human resources that are all bred to think and say and act the same way, is all done to enable the corporate will.<p>And that corporate will both feeds of and demands that more human resources be imported that are harvested from foreign countries; and greasing all wheels of Congress equally is how they enact that.<p>It&#x27;s equally impressive how not just Google, has managed to ensnare people in a kind of mental trap or illusion, where serving and worshiping immoral and unethical corporate interests is interpreted as good through a kind of Faustian bargain. We seem to actually be witnessing a kind of birth of a religion of world dominating corporations, an entity with no moral constraints or code beyond it&#x27;s own will and expression at the whims of its corporate shamans and muftis.')
