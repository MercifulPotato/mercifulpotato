I&#x27;ve read you could even use a pizero if you don&#x27;t care about the Web interface being all that snappy.<p>&gt; Any weird sites that donâ€™t work with it running?<p>You set your own blocklists so you can choose how permissive you want to be. I have something like 1MM blacklisted URLs and rarely find sites to be completely broken. It&#x27;s easy to temporarily pause the blocker, or add a single domain to the whitelist.<p>&gt; How much better is it than something like ublock origin?<p>uBlock origin has the advantage of hiding content directly from the page, whereas pihole tends to leave a greyed out box where the ad used to be. I tend to use both at the same time anyway.')
