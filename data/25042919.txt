They have never brought wars, death, destruction, slavery, genocide, and concentration camps to those distant lands.<p>Yes, they expanded along their periphery, which is how they got to their size today.<p>But even when they had boats, they visited as far away as Africa, and traded with them, instead of enslaving them.<p>However, in contrast, letâ€™s list all the countries that have enslaved foreign lands.<p>Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, United States, Netherlands, Australia. Yes, you guessed it. All these are European countries that have brought an untold number of deaths and destruction to the lands that they visited.<p>But of course, you are free to turn a blind eye to all their injustices that they have done in the past.')
