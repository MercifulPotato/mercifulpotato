The BTC GitHub repo was hijacked years ago by corporate interests and Blockstream. They artificially limit the number of transactions to try and push people onto their &quot;second layer&quot; products. BCH (for example) forked just in time and follows the original Bitcoin White Paper. Ethereum aims to be a global decentralized computer, XMR is building an anonymous version of BCH. Wake up dude, it&#x27;s almost 2021 and even central banks has realized the benefit off crypto currency. Users like this are either trolling  for Blockstream or legitimately have no place commenting about crypto.')
