The way you protect free speech is by not allowing any company to become so large and powerful that it rivals governments and can enact censorship.<p>&gt; And my mention of net neutrality is to show how flawed your whole logic process is.<p>I don&#x27;t see how that points out a flaw? I just explained that net neutrality is not protected under freedom of speech, so I don&#x27;t see its relevance.<p>&gt; hm I actually find this scary. Maybe you&#x27;re from China, where deviant opinions&#x2F;minorities must be snuffed down for &quot;harmonious society&quot;?<p>Thank you for keeping the discussion respectful. I don&#x27;t think opinions should be snuffed out, but I also think you shouldn&#x27;t be forced by the government to publish lies. I worry that if governments can force companies to publish all opinions including the ones they don&#x27;t agree with, then they can also force them to publish propaganda.')
