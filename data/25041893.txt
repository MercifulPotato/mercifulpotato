In <i>your own damn comment</i> you&#x27;re saying:<p>&quot;For what it&#x27;s worth, I think the most likely explanation for the stuff found is that he was geeking out some harmless experiments.&quot;<p>In your own goddamn comment you&#x27;re saying your primary thought is this was innocent experimentation.<p>When someone is running at you with a knife is the thought &quot;this person is going to harm me&quot; a tertiary thought?<p>You realize it&#x27;s not illegal to own any of the materials he had or to experiment with them? The reckless endangerment charge is <i>not</i> just for having them but for having a box catch fire after storing it near a stove?<p>Your entire comment is essentially &quot;I have no objection to anything you actually said I said but I still want to build a strawman to tear down&quot;<p>I mean<p>&gt; This was ammonium nitrate (among other stuff). Ammonium nitrate is used for fertilizer and explosives.<p>Where the HELL did you see him have Ammonium Nitrate? Don&#x27;t tell me you read POTASSIUM Nitrate... literally saltpeter you can order of Amazon right now with next day shipping... and thought it was AN. It&#x27;d just drive home how precious little you know of the topic and hand and how your serious of comments literally is just concern-baiting that we&#x27;re jumping way too quickly to treat an innocent person as innocent...')
