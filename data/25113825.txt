Co-morbidities associated with the COVID-19 deaths in each state are also tracked. The sources that I use for each graph are linked to right next to each graph and there is a page on my site that goes through talking further about the datasets â€“ all of which are sourced directly from CDC resources.<p>In times such as these, information is critically important. The goal with this application is to provide as granular of data as possible from reputable sources. It has been a ton of work to get this site going (I am also a full-time college student), but I think it is finally ready to be shared.')
