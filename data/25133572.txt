And this make the adoption of new tech much faster.<p>Sure its a portable IR, but is a very limited one and therefore it will be sub-optimal in a lot of scenarios compared to the traditional native applications.<p>In the web alone it will be sub-optimal to the state-of-the-art optimized javascript of today in a lot of cases, even having a much better performance in some special cases. And in the case of desktops, mobile, etc, this will make it even better for javascript applications, which will profit the most in this scenario, with hybrid apps (javascript + WASM).<p>Of course, the FAANG that control the platforms would love to limit more and have absolute control over the platform which will probably be the only native app allowed or that people will run. But the day WASM take the world and we are not allowed to run native applications anymore except the ones the walled gardens allow us to, will be a dark future compared to the freedom we once had.<p>Clean-room monopolized innovation and big tech mammoth&#x27;s..')
