Care to define rioter? At what point does a worked up crowd of protestors become a riot? What if the police use agitators? What if a couple of protestors start damaging things, but the rest of the crowd remains peaceful? What if the rioters are running away, is it still okay to kill them? What if the rioters are legitimately trying to prevent a fascist regime from taking over? Do motivations count at all? Is it rioting to run from black-blocks? Is it rioting to shout at police lines? Is resisting arrest rioting?')
