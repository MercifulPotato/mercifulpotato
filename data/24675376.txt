The downside being that you spend more time writing parsers of the data. But if you had some sort of separate schema that generated all of that for you, it would no longer be such a big deal.<p>They mention that their key&#x2F;value pairs are ordered. The downside here is that not all languages (eg. javascript), support them.<p>I also prefer them to be unordered. The downside with ordered dictionaries, is that you need to always be asking &quot;does sequence matter here?&quot;. So it adds an additional thing to think about, more tests need to be written, and certain optimisations can&#x27;t always be made.')
