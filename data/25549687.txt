I was into C++ programming many years before the first dotcom boom. But I did not really profit from it. Instead I studied for many years, then slacked off for a few years, and only started working full time as a software engineer at the age of 30, working on satellite operations and the ground system of the international space station.<p>I could have been a millionaire many times over if I had realised how valuable my skills at the age of 16, 18, 20 were.<p>On the other hand, only due to my weird, suboptimal path through life did I meet my wife, which is for me a global optimum. I literally can not think of anybody I would rather spend the rest of my life with.<p>Now I work at a startup at an age where most software engineers in SV are retiring. So it&#x27;s all good.')
