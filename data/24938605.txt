We just need to accept we are mostly idiotic.</i><p>I do not like this attitude. Everything is false, because the truth exists only in ideal condition of math. But it doesn&#x27;t mean that we are all idiotic and know nothing worthy knowing. The trick is to understand the relation between knowledge and the reality, to feel this relation in your guts. It helps to know a lot of falsehoods, and to be smart, even wise and knowledgeable.<p><i>&gt; We are all mainly dumb at most things.</i><p>I could agree with this, because to really know something one needs to spent all his life researching the topic. And even the life full of the dedicated research might be not enough.<p>But as I see, to be dumb is not so about having no knowledge, as about having no idea of limits of one&#x27;s knowledge.')
