I think that things like Mutexes or Boxes are deep enough to have 30-50 pages dedicated to them, and I can say this not only about Mutexes and Boxes. When explaining some powerful things, one need not only explain how they work, but also what kinds of real tasks they can solve - ways of usage are obvious for you when you know it and have experience of usage them, but absolutely opaque and not obvious when you reading about them for the first time.')
