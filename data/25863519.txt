If anyone can break out of Plex they are on your local network.<p>Besides, if you&#x27;re going through all that networking hassle, you&#x27;re better off doing things right. Get a real firewall like pfSense, then setup a separate network just for outside facing services. To access those services locally create firewall rules that allow traffic 1 way: from your trusted network to your outside facing network. While you&#x27;re at it, consider making separate networks for IoT devices, and maybe even another for untrusted guest devices. You can use VLANs or physical interfaces if your firewall has enough ports.')
