Never.  Don&#x27;t claim to be a patriot ever again if you think dismissing the first successful attack on a congressional session (hell, the VP was in there too) in the history of the republic is a good argument to make.  Hell, five people died.  That&#x27;s more than at the Reichstag fire (I checked with Godwin, by the way, he approves).<p>This was a moment of deep shame.  And comments like yours make it worse.')
