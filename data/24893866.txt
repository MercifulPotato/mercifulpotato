But I stand my ground that I think the assumption of fair use for this copyright circumventing algorithm is wrong.<p>------<p>First off: Fair Use does not exist. It is an assumption, not a defined situation as it requires legal evaluation in court to apply. And on top of that: It is a regional difference and is therefore completely unpredictable whether it applies or not.<p>Assuming fair use on a platform with a proprietary license that even forbids downloading, while downloading proprietary content specifically to circumvent copyright protection, while fair use does only exist as a &quot;possibibility&quot; inside, and only inside, the US and only after a legal case was decided in at least state level court ... really?<p>You get sued for downloading 512kB of porn illegaly, just as you can get sued for downloading 10kB of copyrighted youtube videos.<p>As I said, this was just a suggestion to remove that attack surface. Another attack surface is the trademark violation, but that&#x27;s a different case.')
