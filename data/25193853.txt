I am quick to execute a project and can pick up stuff easily.<p>I had a good 3 year run and I was getting regular business from a guy from Asia. Unfortunately he is not responding from the past few weeks and I am totally out of work.<p>Can you help me find work? I can only work hourly and from home since I am pregnant and have to take care of an ailing family member at the same time. I did try finding work at a web shop but they were not so accommodating when they heard I was pregnant. I am sure they have their own reasons so I am not complaining.<p>It&#x27;s best if I receive an hourly payment as I am really short on payments with a rent due this week and a couple of other bills to pay off. I can execute anything design related and which can be done using Adobe.<p>Please help me if you can. Someone said I can get work if I accept Bitcoin. So I started an account at 15tLDG1PvV1ux2r4wdtmDDNg2BvFfbL9gR . Not sure if this is how it works but I just want to work and get paid soon. I can do any online IT job if there are no design jobs available.<p>Thanks good folks of HN!')
