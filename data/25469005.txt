Which was a lot faster than a standard brick and mortar school. You can see the course catalog here [0]. My work paid tuition for my degree, but they had an upper limit on reimbursement. WGU was what I found that they approved, and came in under cost (I didn&#x27;t want to pay out of pocket).<p>I really do recommend WGU for experienced professionals, and self-guided and motivated learners. I would not suggest it for a brand new high schooler, or people who have no experience in the industry they&#x27;re trying to get a degree in.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wgu.edu&#x2F;about&#x2F;institutional-catalog.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wgu.edu&#x2F;about&#x2F;institutional-catalog.html</a>')
