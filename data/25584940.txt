I honestly can&#x27;t figure it out, but it seems like Americans are always going &#x27;to the DMV&#x27;, this side of the pond I think the equivalent (authority handling driver licencing, road tax, vehicle registration, etc.?) is the DVLA. I have and would never &#x27;go to the DVLA&#x27;, I have no idea where that would be, I assume it&#x27;s just offices. It&#x27;s all online and other than changing address when I moved I haven&#x27;t even needed that.<p>Whereas in normal years, for all the jokes you&#x27;d like to make about British teeth, I go to the dentist every 6&#x2F;9&#x2F;12 months (according to ~how short of cash he is~ his recommendation) - but going by HN comments and films et al. &#x27;the DMV&#x27; seems an even popular day out!(?)')
