They&#x27;ll <i>accept</i> OCSP-stapling, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>This is a very serious concern for Enterprise PKI systems: revoking certificates is now virtually impossible. CRLs and OCSP do practically nothing.<p>Google especially has unilaterally decided that Enterprise PKI systems don&#x27;t matter. They have established a new &quot;standard&quot; called Certificate Transparency, which they use to make CRLSets that they publish as Chrome updates.<p>Which is fine I suppose for <i>public</i> CAs, but utterly useless on internal-use private CAs on local networks, especially those with lots of BYOD or guest&#x2F;partner systems. Think universities or hospitals.<p>Google has become a juggernaut with more control over <i>computing</i> in general (not even just the Internet!) than all of the world governments <i>put together</i>.<p>They&#x27;re getting truly terrifying.')
