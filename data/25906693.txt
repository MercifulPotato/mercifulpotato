Like a photo of a 5 years old girl that lives at 10 miles of a 5G tower and dies of cancer. Or a photo of a 5 years old boy that got all the vaccines and now has autism.<p>It&#x27;s easy to get one shocking photo of each of these cases, because girl get cancer in spite they are not nearby 5G towers and boys get autism in spite they are not vaccinated.<p>The difference is that using statistics you can show that cancer is not more usual in people that live 5G towers and autism is not more usual in people that is vaccinated.<p>Statistic and serious medical reporting can show the difference of information and misinformation. Shocking photos put them at the same level.')
