Right? Wrong! Nobody cares!</i><p>Same experience.<p>But now I found having a cynical mentality is actually liberating, it allowed me to mostly ignore arguments and holy wars among people regarding to the platforms I&#x27;m using. I can only say, &quot;It&#x27;s simply my personal preference, and I fully accept any good or bad consequences of my choices. Talk to me only if you are genuinely interested.&quot; Now my main computer is not even running a standard distro anymore, but QubesOS, an experimental security operating system. When I first installed QubesOS, I found I was unable to work on my personal projects because some features I needed was missing. Instead of writing an angry blogpost (it sucks!) or defending my choice (this view is unfair for a project with limited resources!), I immediately cloned the git repository and spent a week hacking the source code to make it work for me without saying anything. Objectively, is it a good user experience? Not at all, but I&#x27;m personally okay with that, and hacking code is much more enjoyable than advocating the platform in an argument.<p>I guess this mentality is not good for encouraging improvements, and I fully respect those who choose to actively engage, but for me, I need to have a rest.')
