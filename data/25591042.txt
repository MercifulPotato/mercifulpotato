Worst experience I have is with devs who call themselves &#x27;coach&#x27; and know it all. They should be quiet  more often.<p>At the same time, I have this junior dev in my team who is very stubborn and never listens. This is very annoying, she can work days on a single small assignment. When I give advise on how the problem can be tackled I see it is just being ignored.<p>So, in these cases &#x27;listen more&#x27; is good advise :)')
