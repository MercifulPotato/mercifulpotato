Item(by='majormajor', descendants=None, kids=[25963454, 25967976], score=None, time=1611951483, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25961477, text='&quot;The short interest staying at a similar range means nobody has closed out their old positions so we can keep squeezing&quot; seems to be a big one.<p>If you assume that new short positions are being opened - and at the recent prices, that&#x27;s not an entirely unattractive thing to do - then the short interest staying steady suggests some positions being closed and others being opened, and tells you little about single actors.<p>And anyone opening short positions at today&#x27;s prices is basically &quot;resetting the clock&quot; on how long you&#x27;d need to squeeze to get them to back down... so if I were to sell it short now, I&#x27;d be betting that some folks making some of their first investments ever to ride the hype train are going to be more likely to blink first than I am.')
