Hiring a contractor will also cost a lot. I would advise against hiring from fiverr&#x2F;upwork, unless you want some minor work to be done or already know how a software is developped inside out. You can then cut the project in smaller chunks and tasks and seek someone to develop it for you.<p>2- Thinking that once you have your MVP you will be off the hook and can go try sell the product, get traction and some sales, and finally re-invest everything back in the buisiness will NOT work. You will need a developper&#x2F;company on your side all the time, all the way trough your venture.<p>3- I was thinking of investing around $1k per month to get an MVP done, but this wouldn&#x27;t have been good on a long run anyway.<p>4- I came to the conclusion, that it would be faster&#x2F;easier just to learn programming from scratch instead. There are a lot of free resources out there. It takes time and persistence, but you will get there. This will save you long term, and even if your MVP fails, you would have learned programming and you can you that for another venture or get a job.<p>Hope this helps.')
