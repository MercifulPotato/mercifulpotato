The population of Germany is about 83,000,000. That makes roughly 940 tomato plants to offset the CO2 emission of one person.<p>Even putting that number aside, tomato plants are not exactly small plants. A significant part of world population won’t have the leisure to keep even <i>one</i>, let alone <i>ten</i>, tomato plants (or the equivalent in other plants). Think people who live in slums, people who live in dense areas (e.g. people who subsist with minimum wage in subdivided apartments in HK).<p>Yes, we should definitely grow plants, but even more so, we need to consume way waaaay less.')
