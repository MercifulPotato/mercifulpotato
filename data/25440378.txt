E.g. Alex Majoli shot wars for Magnum Photos with compact digital cameras (this one: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dpreview.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;9257233153&#x2F;olympusc5060" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dpreview.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;9257233153&#x2F;olympusc5060</a> ) and won awards.<p>And of course tons of pro photographers have shot with the iPhone and such phones. Even more so in photojournalism, street photography, documentary photography etc.<p>Now, ad work, wedding, magazine portraiture, etc will of course mostly use their medium formats or $10K mirrorless setups...')
