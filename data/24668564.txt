Only because it paints the Apple Watch as the brainchild of this new-age health platform<p>Watch still is an exclusive way to drive consumers to iPhone. Today, it&#x27;s more capable than ever, but smartwatches weren&#x27;t exclusive to Apple - Pebble, Android Wear, Fitbit and Garmin (which I had) did them. And better in some aspects.<p>4 years later, I&#x27;m still not blown away at the sensor technology on Apple Watch. (disc. I have one) Sleep tracking wasn&#x27;t added till the latest release!!?? It&#x27;s def. a fashion statement. Like blue iMessage bubbles, Apple Watch is a sign of luxury and exclusivity, and it looks solid.<p>Apple owns an ecosystem, and at the center is the user. A computer on the wrist makes sense, it&#x27;s always on, always there, and it&#x27;s still a connected experience for when you can&#x27;t have your phone. But I can&#x27;t say Apple created a whole new industry - it only works because they own an ecosystem. Not because they have a fantastic wearable watch.')
