Not even new Edge uses fluent design controls.<p>WinUI sort of has fluent, but it is extremely inconsistent. When should things be rounded vs squared? It’s completely inconsistent internally.<p>Even if Qt wanted to go fluent they’d have a hard time finding any concrete examples to work off of. I can’t think of any “fluent” apps that are consistent with themselves, consistent with the design system, and not breaking major rules.')
