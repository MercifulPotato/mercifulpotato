Because back in the 1970&#x2F;80&#x27;s people argued the exact same thing (no nukes, solar will save us). And what happened? We got more coal plants because they were way cheaper except in the few places that actually built nukes. The same argument happened in the 1990s&#x2F;2000s and what did we get? A few percent of wind&#x2F;solar, and a shift to NG due to fracking.<p>_TODAY_ if you want a competitive solution you build somewhere in the ballpark of 20-70% wind&#x2F;solar and back it with NG.<p>Where will that put us in over the next 40 years?<p>Its going to create even more C02 because power utilization is going up. All that is going to do is slow the rate of increase, which is exactly what the current charts are showing. The rate of wind&#x2F;solar rollout is barely exceeding the demand curve and in a lot of places its regressing, particularly in places where ancient nuke plants are being replaced by &quot;green&quot; technologies.<p>Yes, sure wind+NG is better than NG or coal, but its a shit solution. If batteries actually get cheap then we can do 2x wind+battery, but that isn&#x27;t here today. What we have today are nuke plants, just like we did 40 years ago. If back then instead of waiting for the future to save us we were more pragmatic the ice caps wouldn&#x27;t be melting.<p>My personal opinion is that in 40 years what is going to solve this problem is a giant war, because wishing for the future to save us hasn&#x27;t worked yet.')
