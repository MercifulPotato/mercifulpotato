Redux doesn&#x27;t magically seperate state information from the tree. It&#x27;s built upon react context&#x2F;provider system, which in effect can be seen as a component.<p>The special sauce, in regards to seperation, is that it can be wired into the component tree without passing it down, which is a property of provider&#x2F;context and not redux itself.')
