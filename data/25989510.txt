If he actually believed in 2016 that there was massive fraud, and a risk of the same happening again in 2020, he would have done something about it. If anyone believes he was sincere, the fact he took no action for so long in inexplicable. You&#x27;d think it would be a matter of vital, urgent concern.<p>The fact that he ignored the whole issue until it was convenient for him to do so again speaks volumes. So I think it&#x27;s perfectly clear, he doesn&#x27;t believe a word of it because he doesn&#x27;t act as though he believes it, and none of the people in the Republican party who say they believe him actually act as though they do either. They are doing nothing whosoever to address he problem, because there&#x27;s nothing there to address and they know this perfectly well.')
