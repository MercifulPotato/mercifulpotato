I bet any developer given that time to test his own UX would improve it ten folds when he starts to get frustrated with his own design.<p>Data entry UX? Suddenly instead of having everything overwhelming a user you&#x27;d get only most used and then have an &quot;show advanced options&quot; button where you get the rest.<p>Charts? Show only important features then rest get hidden behind &quot;show advanced options&quot; button.<p>Reports? Menus to show only most common used reports, rest must go into &quot;Show advanced reports&quot;<p>And so on and so forth. See VLC player options, I think that UI is beautiful, despite it&#x27;s myriad of options there.')
