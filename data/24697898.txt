They&#x27;re very few in number - most people generally dislike surveillance, but don&#x27;t fight against it nearly as hard as they theoretically could. Economic incentives are working their magic here. For example, much of the NSA&#x27;s spying programs are legal specifically because AT&amp;T made everyone surrender metadata for advertising purposes as a condition of telephone service back in the 50s. AT&amp;T had monopoly power, so the only choices available were to sign over your metadata or live like Richard Stallman. Furthermore, any indication that your phone call records were being bought and sold was hidden in the fine print of long, non-negotiable contractual agreements.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t &quot;undesirables&quot; (MISS ME with that shit), it&#x27;s lies by omission and economic power brought to bear against people&#x27;s rational expectations of privacy.')
