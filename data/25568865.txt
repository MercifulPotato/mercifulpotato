While the HP&#x2F;Intel&#x2F;IBM&#x2F;etc. dinosaurs are slowly being sapped of relevance, I don&#x27;t think Google will fall victim to the same fate. Those dinosaurs largely saw their maturation before the rise of Internet, and as such still have a lot of pre-Internet culture in them, especially in the C-suite. Google (largely) doesn&#x27;t have that. And they, along with the rest of the FAANG companies, just deal with menacing upstarts by buying them. They&#x27;re public, they&#x27;re starting to become too massive, but no one cares as long as they continue providing their core free services.')
