I&#x27;ve been waiting for something like this for damn near two decades. It was the original promise of the internet: free and open access to all information, regardless of whether that makes people uncomfortable. And this protocol even gives you control over monetization options.<p>Still, they have a big hurdle. It all comes down to whether it&#x27;ll be adopted.<p>First impressions of the MacOS app: Loading time was long, but onboarding was effortless. Threw me right into the app.<p>Immense disappointment when I realized it was for video, not books.<p>Gave a video a try, &quot;A better way to split firewood.&quot;<p>Since there&#x27;s no URL bar, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any obvious way to link someone to a video.<p>But! There&#x27;s a web version: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;odysee.com&#x2F;@SicCooper:1&#x2F;3d-all-stars-super-mario-64-episode-12:5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;odysee.com&#x2F;@SicCooper:1&#x2F;3d-all-stars-super-mario-64-...</a><p>Seems like... youtube. Hmmm.<p>First impressions are ... surprisingly positive. This is somehow an almost-complete, fully working clone of Youtube. There are missing features, but I can look past that.<p>The recommendation engine is obviously the biggest weakness, since there&#x27;s probably not much content to recommend. But I found myself watching <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;odysee.com&#x2F;@atthespeedoflife:b&#x2F;it-may-not-be-adhd-pandas-lyme-cirs-mom:b" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;odysee.com&#x2F;@atthespeedoflife:b&#x2F;it-may-not-be-adhd-pa...</a><p>Pleasantly surprised to find a 2x speed setting. The production quality of the video is good too. No problems whatsoever.<p>This got me curious: How hard would it be to set up my own channel? So I clicked sign in, and was delighted to discover they have a &quot;sync my youtube&quot; checkbox.<p>... Unfortunately, after creating my account, there&#x27;s no sign of where the &quot;Sync my youtube&quot; feature went to. I checked the box, but there wasn&#x27;t any prompt or further info. Well, back to watching.<p>The production quality on these videos is actually incredible.

Yep, it&#x27;s on there too: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=sn1Y6zIS91g&amp;ab_channel=AlphaPhoenix" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=sn1Y6zIS91g&amp;ab_channel=Alpha...</a><p>They have 14k subscribers, which isn&#x27;t huge, but is significantly greater than &quot;nothing.&quot; Did LBRY somehow convince people to sign up and cross-post their videos, or are they simply hosting random videos? Now I&#x27;m curious where it&#x27;s hosted.<p>This is interesting enough to give a fair shot. I&#x27;ll be watching it closely.<p>Their FAQ is a solid resource: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lbry.com&#x2F;faq" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lbry.com&#x2F;faq</a><p>I&#x27;m mostly curious how they pulled off a fully-working clone of YouTube. That&#x27;s an incredible achievement, setting aside all the questions it raises.<p>I see that Google banned them, which honestly makes me want to support LBRY more.
