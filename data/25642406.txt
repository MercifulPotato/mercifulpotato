By definition if someone&#x27;s called elitist, the target audience probably disagrees with that judgement. But again, if self reflection is being considered, the target audience should try to think if there&#x27;s any base to the accusation.<p>In this case I or others are not alleging this person owes the company much. They should feel free to move as soon as possible if they don&#x27;t like the commute or the work. It does look like the hardware place looks like a crappy deal. I&#x27;m just curious if the OP is truly doing whats in their interest or if they&#x27;re overindulging their cushy position (being an in demand engineer) to their own long term detriment.')
