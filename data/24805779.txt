It&#x27;s called open source for a reason.  If you want recognition when someone uses your open source project, pick a license that has an advertising clause.<p>This is similar to other open source projects which GPL their project instead of AGPL, and then get angry when people and companies (like Amazon), literally abide by the terms of your license but you don&#x27;t like the outcome.  Then they act all offended like someone did something wrong.  If you don&#x27;t like it, switch your project to AGPL and stop trying to act like someone did anything but honor the license you released your code under.<p>People like this do damage to open source because they blindly pick their licenses rather than understanding what they mean.')
