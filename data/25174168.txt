Linux on AMD motherboards which support ECC has reporting. There is no reason why it wouldn&#x27;t. If the ECC is there and active, Linux can get the information (EDAC).<p>On Intel though, they flat out fuse ECC off on consumer CPUs for market segmentation reasons. If you want a consumer motherboard with ECC, you go AMD.')
