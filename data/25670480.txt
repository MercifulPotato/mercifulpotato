It&#x27;s only useful to keep this reproducible if I&#x27;m debugging the script.<p>And, in this case, anyone who&#x27;s proficient with R would recognize this problem from personal experience or the many warnings in tutorials.  I usually wouldn&#x27;t shoot down a given example as though it disproved the existence of any example, but I don&#x27;t know if there is another example.  Unless old code relied on undocumented or contrary-to-documented behavior.')
