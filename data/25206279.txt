He allows a full 20% for rooftop PV. He just didn&#x27;t realize that both would converge toward similar technology and efficiency.<p>Nuclear is fine as far as the physics goes. It&#x27;s the inability to hold to projected budgets and schedules that has sidelined it. Betting big on nuclear was much more reasonable in 2007 when the book came out. At the time I certainly thought that the UK would add more TWh from nuclear than from renewables by 2020.')
