Therefore, the Fed has not been printing money.</i><p>&gt; <i>When the Fed buys assets (government bonds, Fannies, etc.) from a bank, the bank gets back &#x27;bank reserves&#x27;, which are just a number in the bank&#x27;s Federal Reserve account somewhere.</i><p>The money in my saving (or chequing) account is just a number in the bank&#x27;s account somewhere, but it is still &quot;money&quot; that  I have with them. Similarly the Federal Reserve is a bank account for the banks: so your bank (BoA, Chase, Wells Fargo, etc) has money at the Fed just like I have have money at (e.g.) Citibank.<p>Otherwise, your statement &quot;the Feds <i>buys</i> assets&quot; makes no sense: with <i>what</i> exactly does the Fed buy the assets if not money? &quot;Money&quot; in the modern economy is (1) a means of exchange, (2) a unit of account, and (3) a store of value. In this case we are using (1). Just because the &quot;money&quot; is in digital form does not change its essence.<p>&gt; [â€¦] <i>so swapping a US Treasury with cash is just turning one type of money into another; no net creation.</i><p>Can US Treasury bills be used for reserve calculation purposes? Because if they cannot, then the higher reserve accounts mean that banks would be able to create more loans (assuming they can find borrowers).<p>While reserve holdings and T-bills may have similar net values, each may be have restrictions on how they can be used in various circumstances, which could have knock-on effects.')
