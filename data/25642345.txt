Extremely rare for me to even hear friends (many of which I communicate with using Signal) talking about problems, I vaguely recall having something go wrong a long time back, but can&#x27;t even recall what it was now, only that it went away and started working properly fairly quickly&#x2F;easily.<p>(I disagree with Moxie&#x27;s choice to use real phone numbers as an underlying hard requirements, and also with the choice to notify people when other people from their contact lists start using Signal - but I understand why he made those choices (to piggyback pre existing social graphs) and respect how he implanted it without needing to grab my contact list and have it vulnerable on their servers...)')
