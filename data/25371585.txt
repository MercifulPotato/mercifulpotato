More limited, but still pretty big.<p>&gt; If your world view is &quot;block javascript or let any and all javascript run&quot;, I don&#x27;t know how to help you, because that isn&#x27;t reality.<p>You can&#x27;t help me, I think no one can. For now we can still kind of run ad blockers, even though Chrome is working hard on stealthily removing them.<p>But for regular users, who don&#x27;t run them (probably 99% of users out there), how do they protect themselves from cryptominers? From nasty ads?')
