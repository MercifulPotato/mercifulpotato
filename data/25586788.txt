I find it weird that if I were to buy and apple device, and I wanted to write my own program to use only for myself on it I would have to pay an annual fee to Apple to get permission to run it.  I think it does sort of boil down to a semantics argument about what is a license for a device you own or not own?  Or if you want to want to sell and distribute something you need to pay an annual fee plus 30% of every sale (or 15% if you do their multi-year subscription magic, Or are large enough like Netflix).<p>Apple is very hostile towards their customers and developers&#x2F;business partners.')
