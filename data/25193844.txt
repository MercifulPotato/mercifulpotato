I know there are stories of police abusing this &amp; taking cash of people in random traffic stops: That&#x27;s theft. But a huge portion of asset seizures are forfeits from drug crimes. The DEA along takes about $500 million a year in this way, and state, country &amp; municipal departments take even more.')
