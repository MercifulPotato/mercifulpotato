The point isn&#x27;t coding in isolation is good, nor that we shouldn&#x27;t break our work down into smaller tasks, it&#x27;s that the developer should be given the responsibility and freedom to decide what those tasks are for their work, not dictated from above.<p>If I&#x27;m responsible for project A, I should be able to make 85% of the decisions for that project. Too often, recently, development organizations make every decision from above, then break that up into miniscule tasks that require no thought from developers.<p>Hackathons, IMO, are just gimmicks to gloss over a deficient product management group or software architecture. If your organization can&#x27;t be convinced of the need to spend time on something outside of a gimmicky &quot;hackathon&quot;, then something needs fixed.')
