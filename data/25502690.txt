Item(by='mulmen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608609399, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25502609, text='&gt; I find `mulmen`&#x27;s efforts very distasteful (trying to stop piracy on networks is like trying to stop kids from doing drugs) but not crossing the line as much as forcing certs on kids personal machines.<p>You have badly misinterpreted my comments here.  Everything we did was to protect the student&#x27;s interests.  We were the gateway between them and whoever was trying to sue them.  The University took whatever action it needed to in order to maintain that position and keep students safe from abuse.  We were often riding the line of legal action taken against us by those rights holders, frivolous or not.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any student ever losing network access because of piracy.  We just sent a lot of emails saying &quot;please stop&quot; and in general students did.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you find distasteful about that but I stand by my words here and my actions at the time.')
