One of my side projects for example is a programming language where I have 100% code coverage.<p>From a career perspective, I have seeded new infrastructure services with 100% code coverage. At core, I believe achieving great reliability requires a solid foundation.<p>I don&#x27;t claim these services are perfect, but when a bug is discovered then I can usually use the logs to figure out what state the program is in and then test the bug with a unit test. Then, I can protect future engineers from that issue.<p>Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, there are LOADS of silly tests for languages like Java to make code coverage tools happy. Like &quot;new ClassThatOnlyHasStaticMethodsInIt()&quot;, but the key is that you can alarm on code coverage less than 100% but once you let the paper cuts build up it is hard to manage.<p>I&#x27;m a big believer in &quot;slow is smooth, and smooth is fast&quot; when it comes to building services for others.')
