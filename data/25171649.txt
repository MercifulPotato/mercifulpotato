If I was logged in it would be even worse with it having to load the text editor thingy etc.<p>Don&#x27;t mind me typing &quot;what?&quot; in the search bar there, I thought the close button would just dismiss the bar at the top. Also note that I had uBlock active which blocked some requests. I don&#x27;t even want to know how long it would take without it.<p>And for comparison here&#x27;s old reddit: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;streamable.com&#x2F;z2ath6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;streamable.com&#x2F;z2ath6</a><p>Do you seriously want to defend this?')
