Here in the United States we&#x27;re not supposed to accept that.<p><i>&gt; Imagine running a country</i><p>Imagine having a country where no one person or small group of people gets to &quot;run&quot; things--where, instead, every adult citizen is assumed to be responsible for their own life and their own actions, and to suffer appropriate consequences if they cause harm to someone else. Where nobody is allowed to just declare by fiat what everyone else has to do or can&#x27;t do. Where collective action is done by reasonable people persuading other reasonable people that a particular course of action is best for all, not by some people just dictating to everyone else what the &quot;right&quot; thing to do is.<p>The United States of America is supposed to be that kind of country.')
