Most welfare states.<p>Is it guaranteed? ie. do you have to be disabled&#x2F;retired to qualify, or is it open to everyone?<p>&gt;Distributing food nationally is hard (consider cold chain, warehousing, distribution, managing expiry, dietary requirements, demand), so most welfare states distribute money instead and rely on the private sector to provide the infrastructure.<p>But then the food isn&#x27;t guaranteed, is it? You&#x27;re only really guaranteed money, which could be converted to food. Consider a hypothetical: let&#x27;s say a country has a poll tax of $100 per person, then offsets it by giving everyone $100, is it fair to say that you have the right to vote in that country? Feel free to replace &quot;right to vote&quot; with other rights, such as freedom of speech, right to not self-incriminate, protection against unreasonable search and seizure.')
