There&#x27;s a lot here.<p>Last thing first: Abortions are at their lowest rates since Roe. Abortions are health care. Frankly, the idea that people should be alarmed by a supposed reframing of abortions as health care is incoherent. People who oppose abortion should be happy that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s seen. I come from a very large, very Catholic family, I went to 12 years of Catholic school, my godmother aunt who has made multiple pilgrimages to MeÄ‘ugorje and pickets hospitals still gives me presents every year, and I will relate to you the previous conception pro-life culture had of abortion: a cosmetic convenience.<p>If our outlook on abortion has changed, it has empirically gotten <i>more conservative</i>. I agree that conservative white people are alarmed by change no matter what form it takes. But we can&#x27;t reasonably discuss that here while suggesting that destabilizing conservative shifts are somehow attributable to elite left discourse.<p>(Also, next time you think about how people casually look at abortion as &quot;health care&quot;, I&#x27;d ask you also to consider that Catholic organizations control huge chunks of the health care infrastructure in this country, and they deny routine medically necessary procedures and medications to women because the church has deemed them abortifacient. I&#x27;m a parent and a Catholic and I&#x27;ve seen this firsthand; it&#x27;s a real problem in Chicago. There is more going on with the &quot;reproductive health care&quot; thing than you&#x27;re acknowledging here.)<p>Moving along:<p>The tuition programs you&#x27;re talking about build on the DACA framework. They don&#x27;t reward adults who cross the border with free tuition. Instead, they seek to acknowledge that people brought here as children, a huge portion of whom have known no other life but that of an American, are for all intents and purposes American. This notion is <i>wildly</i> popular in the US; it gets something like 3&#x2F;4 in favor in surveys. (Would it be more popular if it hadn&#x27;t been set in motion by executive order? Sure. But that supports my point, which is that the concern you have about destabilization has more to do with partisan politics than it does with ideas).<p>One of the problems with our discourse on immigration --- surprised if you disagree --- is that we used to be proud of our inclusiveness. People don&#x27;t pay enough attention to how strict European countries are about immigration. We have birthright citizenship! The left spends too much time rhetorically tearing down American institutions, and the right spends too much time tacitly conceding and expanding on the left&#x27;s criticisms. That&#x27;s a shift <i>rightward</i>.<p>I just don&#x27;t see what health care costs have to do with border security costs. The problem with $5B for border security is that it&#x27;s a joke; you can&#x27;t physically secure the border with that much money. It&#x27;s a grift, a jobs program for cronies and a monument for Trump. If immigration hawks were serious, their next move would have been nationwide mandatory E-Verify. But more to the point: I have trouble believing that your grandmother-in-law is really tallying up the Trump Wall against health care in the first place.<p>Nobody is being held responsible for things that happened before they were born. When your grandmother-in-law says that, do you ask her what, specifically, she means?')
