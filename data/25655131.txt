They&#x27;re definitely not perfect, you&#x27;re definitely getting some odd clipping and noise, but this shows a large amount of promise.<p>Being able to generate voices for games would enable a lot of interesting indie projects. IMO people should be paying more attention the market implications of products like this than to the social implications. There are a lot of projects that just aren&#x27;t really feasible right now that could be if this kind of technology was more polished and generally available for commercial&#x2F;self-hosted use. And in those cases, you don&#x27;t even need to do inference, makers will likely be willing to mark up their scripts themselves.<p>Anyway I digress. Congrats, this is really cool!')
