Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=[25434407, 25433544, 25434038], score=None, time=1608057022, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25432985, text='&gt; The operators of online platforms - such as social media apps and video-sharing sites of any size - must prioritise complaints raised by &quot;trusted flaggers&quot;, who have a track record of highlighting valid problems.<p>Who determines which problems are valid? Unless I overlooked something, this article seems really vague.<p>&gt; Likewise, all online stores must be able to trace traders selling goods via their platforms, in case they are offering counterfeit items or other illegal products. &quot;[It] will require online marketplaces to check their sellers&#x27; identity before they are allowed on the platform, which will make it so much more difficult for dodgy traders to do their business,&quot; commented Mr Breton.<p>I&#x27;m excited about the crackdown on counterfeit products, but I also wonder if it will raise the barrier of entry for sellers (if Amazon has to spend money to validate a given seller, why should they do business with smaller sellers?). Hopefully this authentication mechanism can be inexpensive such that it doesn&#x27;t disenfranchise too much legitimate business at the small end of the spectrum; big players already enjoy tremendous regulatory advantages over smaller players--no need to compound it further.<p>&gt; In addition, once a year they must publish a report into their handling of major risks, including users posting illegal content, disinformation that could sway elections, and the unjustified targeting of minority groups.<p>I&#x27;m really wary of &quot;disinformation that could sway elections&quot; and &quot;unjustified targeting of minority groups&quot;; how do you litigate these fairly? One person&#x27;s &quot;racial advocacy&quot; is another person&#x27;s &quot;racial patronization&quot;. These seem super subjective and thus ripe for abuse. Hopefully this too is just a case of poor journalism and the legislation is better.')
