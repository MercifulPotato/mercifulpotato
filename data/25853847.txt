My neighborhood also changes due to forces around it, around the city, the county, and so on.<p>My point is merely that change in a neighborhood is a natural and normal thing. A great many of the forces involved will be external, as it is rare that a neighborhood is in fact completely isolated from the world in every way.<p>I am attempting to set this up in opposition to the idea that we were presented with: that people have a right to hold their neighborhoods static against all things and we are obligated to honor that. In my opinion, neither is true.')
