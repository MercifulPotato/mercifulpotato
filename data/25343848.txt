I can&#x27;t speak for Canada on this, but at least for AU&#x2F;NZ, there&#x27;s also zero gun culture. I&#x27;m still not sure how much of an impact that has on the public&#x27;s psyche, but lack of gun culture does seem to point to trusting more in social institutions. As an outsider, my perspective is that Aussies&#x2F;Kiwis understand viscerally at levels unseen in American culture — and possibly Canadian culture — that nature can kill you, and that the authorities really are a good resource to draw upon when your life is on the line, which it was during the Covid pandemic.')
