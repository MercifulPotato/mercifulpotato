Item(by='mrDmrTmrJ', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606953995, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25283401, text='Yes, &quot;inadvertent terrorist&quot; would normally be a contradiction in terms, as &#x27;terrorism is the act of killing innocent people to spread terror and extort a body politic to make a political change&#x27;. So this can&#x27;t be inadvertent.<p>Yet, PG&amp;E 1) kills innocent people 2) demands more money from the population it kills 3) is unable to stop killing people 4) covers up their malfeasance in court 5) repeatedly sets my state on fire.<p>Agreed that PG&amp;E is &quot;responsible for multiple lethal felonies.&quot;<p>But, in your comment, I&#x27;ll note you only identified the problem instead of proposed a solution! So what English language phrase do you suggest to describe the above behavior?<p>Does &#x27;Functionally equivalent to a violent Mafioso organization that doesn&#x27;t actually want to kill but does wants all your money and can&#x27;t stop killing you?&#x27; satisfy your standards for the use of the English language? I reserve the right to be hyperbolic in my frustration as long as PG&amp;E keeps this up.<p>Politely, I ask you to resolve the problem you identified. \nAs by the use of the word &#x27;inadvertent&#x27;, I demonstrated that I know the definition in my initial comment :)<p>Finally, does &quot;Substantially more evil than Comcast&quot; work here?')
