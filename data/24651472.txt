It does not enable immediacy; it creates difference.<p>&gt; This really makes me wonder. How does it increase the gap, in comparison to B&amp;W pictures? How is the difference not there already? And why is that bad?<p>Probably because the colorization can be misleading.  With a B&amp;W images, it&#x27;s clear the color data is missing.  With a colorized photo, a red building could be shown as blue or gray, and someone could leave with the false understanding the the building was really a different color than it actually was.')
