Because Paris&#x27; subway system is mostly not accessible to disabled people. (Few or no elevators &#x2F; escalators in key subway stops).<p>I know this from personal experience when I took my two kids in strollers to Paris. Lugging the strollers up and down stairs was a nightmare.<p>But maybe disabled people have other options like buses so it might not be as bad as it seems initially.')
