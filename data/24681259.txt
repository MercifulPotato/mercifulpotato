Assange hasn&#x27;t committed a crime but Snowden has committed a crime of theft from the NSA; unlawfully retaining a National Security Agency (NSA) documents containing information classified at the TOP SECRET&#x2F;SENSITIVE COMPARTMENTED INFORMATION (TS&#x2F;SCI) level.<p>Let me clarify. What he did in exposing PRISM was fantastic, the people had a right to know, absolutely, but, the act in itself was still stealing. It&#x27;s no different to any other theft. When you work for a company and you steal, you can be prosecuted.<p>We can argue from two points; moral and legal. Morally he did the right thing. Legally he did not.<p>The difference between Assange and Snowden is vast. Assange is a published of information, no different to The Guardian. He did not steal the data he published. Snowden did, as did Chelsea Manning when he stole the known as Cable Gate.<p>The point in the article is that the OP thinks Snowden should receive a pardon. My point, is that Assange hasn&#x27;t even been pardoned for his supposed crime of publishing. If Assange hasn&#x27;t been pardoned for a lesser crime, then what hope does Snowden have of being pardoned for an actual crime of data theft  from the NSA?<p>Another lady stole data from the NSA. SHe is now facing prosecution and 10 years.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;opa&#x2F;pr&#x2F;west-virginia-woman-admits-willful-retention-top-secret-national-defense-information-and" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;opa&#x2F;pr&#x2F;west-virginia-woman-admits-wi...</a>')
