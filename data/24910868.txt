Within that group of things is a large subset which we shouldn&#x27;t force people to have to think about. Particularly if those people are tasked with also keeping track of other important things.<p>Yes, there are plenty of people who can&#x27;t be bothered to learn something because they are lazy, intimidated, or stupid. But it&#x27;s not even most, and that presumption, of all of the egotistical self-centered bullshit we pull, ticks <i>me</i> off most of all.<p>We only have time in our lives to become experts in a handful of things (some people think that number is one, or two, which is a shame), and lots of people have other shit they&#x27;d rather be doing, possibly (hopefully!) including things that you can&#x27;t be bothered to learn about. If we all worry about the same things then we don&#x27;t get where we&#x27;re going.')
