It says nothing about re-lending.<p>Naked shorting is not &quot;re-lending&quot;, it&#x27;s a very specific technical thing where you sell the stock <i>without owning or borrowing it at all</i>. Naked shorting results in <i>failure to deliver</i>.<p>Stock trades settle a couple of days after execution, so what it means in practice is that Alice &quot;buys&quot; the stock from Charlie, then 2 days later when settlement should happen and the share and money are supposed to actually change hands, Charlie goes oops I don&#x27;t actually have the stock. Then the trade is <i>undone</i>.<p>In effect Charlie duped Alice into a fake trade that artificially depressed the market price.<p>It&#x27;s an egregious market manipulation tactic and has nothing in common with the practice of lending or re-lending shares, in fact there is <i>not a single share involved at all</i>.<p>If you fail-to-deliver enough you&#x27;ll get booted by other market participants and&#x2F;or the SEC.')
