And the resulting jobs are going to be more and more boring. So you are going to configure something rather than code something up from scratch.<p>My strategy, albeit likely flawed, is:<p>- focus on fundamentals: so instead of learning a graphics API like OpenGL 2.1 or OpenGL 4.x, study the fundamental algorithms underlying hardware and software. IOW: write a rasterizer, a ray tracer from scratch with only the standard libraries of a given programming language. (E.g. write a pure C++ software rasterizer or ray tracer by only using the C++ STL. Then output the result into a simple image format like PPM.)\nI mostly ignore the naysayers here telling me that I am wasting my time reinventing the wheel and what not, but I actually really enjoy that process of learning why and how something works in the deepest levels.<p>- focus on the core subjects that will give you the most bang for your buck: linear algebra has haunted me throughout my studies, so instead of resisting it, embrace it. You can&#x27;t escape linear algebra really, if you are doing computer graphics, neural networks (back-propagation), Fourier transforms, image processing, probability theory. It&#x27;s everywhere, and it is the most useful subject for computer science majors IMHO. Then maybe algorithms and formal and non-formal languages like (C, Japanese etc.). Everybody speaks English nowadays, so why not pick-up a new (human) language?<p>What are your personal strategies?')
