After this it scales pretty well up for anything that is on &quot;one page&quot;.<p>Apart from work things the main example would be a that I built a small audio sequencer hacked together with Vue. That project would&#x27;ve been suicidal to do in JQuery but also went far quicker to make than if i would&#x27;ve been messing around with doing everything &quot;properly&quot; in React. (Iirc the entire thing is &lt;1000 loc)<p>My main &quot;issue&quot; right now is if i should just leave it and let it be useful at the current level (perfect for creating small retro-style chip tunes with fixed audio channel tone generator controls). Or to remake it in React to enable more easily supporting stuff like view plugins (to control parameters custom instrument&#x2F;filter plugins), I.e. in principle making it more &quot;application&quot; like rather than just a small one-page hack.')
