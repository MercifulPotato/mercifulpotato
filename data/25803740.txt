In <i>Railroads and Regulation: 1877-1916</i>, Gabriel Kolko shows that before government regulation, more railroad companies were being founded over time, that freight costs were decreasing, and that government intervention happened because the largest railroads encouraged it. Once the Interstate Commerce Commission was granted authority (through the Elkins Act), one of its first actions was to prohibit railroads from offering rebates and other price discounts. This increased railroad revenue by approximately 10%.<p>It&#x27;s a similar story for airlines with the Civil Aeronautics Board. The CAB was given the power to regulate airline fares, routes, and to control whether a new airline was allowed to enter the market. From the CAB&#x27;s founding in 1938 until airline deregulation in 1978, no new trunk airlines were founded. After deregulation, fares plummeted, new airlines flourished, and many incumbent airlines went out of business (either through bankruptcy or acquisition).<p>To quote David Friedman: &quot;If you do not believe that the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Civil Aeronautics Board are on the side of the industries they regulate, figure out why they set minimum as well as maximum fares.&quot;')
