There is going to be a gap of decades (maybe even more than a century) between the arrival of the first settlers and the attainment of self-sufficiency (autarky, the ability to survive without continual resupply ships from earth). From my reading of Musk&#x27;s various comments, he doesn&#x27;t think it is likely he&#x27;ll live to see self-sufficiency (autarky), but he certainly hopes that the arrival of the first settlers can happen in his lifetime.')
