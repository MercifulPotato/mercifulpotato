I always thought of Subaru as a niche car maker appealing mostly to outdoorsy types who don&#x27;t mind getting their hands dirty to do some maintenance on their car. I don&#x27;t think they really put much effort into their interior aesthetics. Heck, until recently they weren&#x27;t really making the best looking cars either. I drive a 2016 WRX and it&#x27;s literally a box on wheels. There is barely any sound proofing, the audio quality is horrid, the interior is as plain as it gets and they&#x27;re probably 5 years behind everyone else on innovation, but the car is just insanely solid and incredibly easy to maintain.')
