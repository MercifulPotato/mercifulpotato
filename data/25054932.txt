Item(by='wlesieutre', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605062036, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25050707, text='Another note on the Mini and MacBook Pro (in higher end SKUs) - these both used to have four USB-C ports, and now only have two. The Mini at least keeps its a pair of USB-A ports, but on the MBP you&#x27;re back on the road to dongle-hub-land.<p>I&#x27;m betting this is due to Thunderbolt controller and PCIe lane capacity. They couldn&#x27;t do four Thunderbolt ports with the M1 SoC, so they dropped the ports. Having four USB-C ports but only two supporting Thunderbolt would be a more obvious step back from the previous MacBook Pro. This way people can just blame it on Apple doing Apple things, instead of seeing a technical limitation.')
