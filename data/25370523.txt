It more or less read to me &quot;look at all the things we&#x27;re already doing&quot; + &quot;oops this really was a fuck up wasn&#x27;t it, but too late I guess so we&#x27;re going to try more things we were already doing to fix this&quot;.<p>In context, it only makes sense. Google is not going to admit in a memo that they have a structural problem with either race or ethics, but it still is ever so slightly disappointing to see this treated more or less as an internal PR issue and not a moment to look in the mirror.<p>The real mismatch here is what people think the core issue is vs what Google thinks the core issue is. From the memo, Google seems to think that some processes or policies would have prevented this. What it seems to me is that the general public sees a misalignment &#x2F; direct conflict of values between Gebru&#x27;s work and points and Google&#x27;s profit &#x2F; business. I think Google knows this internally but can&#x27;t say the quiet part out loud.')
