Cloudflare could give the user a contract that obligates itself to follow the rules under the TRR program, with fines similar to GDPR if it ever broke them.<p>That way the user could exercise control and agency under contract law, and the cost of breaking the obligations would be financially in addition to loosing TRR status. It would also not make the situation worse compared to keeping the default in EU to be the users own ISP.<p>At most the user would loose the protection given by national consumer agencies, which for me would be a loss but for the average in EU might be less so.<p>Would CloudFlare agree to do so, or would they just drop out of TRR if such requirement were made?')
