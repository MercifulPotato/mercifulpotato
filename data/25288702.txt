It&#x27;s not that hard to do.<p>Is there any reason for him not just do it, or that you&#x27;d need legal counsel? Thinking it through, I suppose theoretically you might worry that if you did it wrong you could get in legal trouble, but a) this guy is positive he owns the copyright to this thing it&#x27;s not any kind of grey area, b) even those who totally file DMCA takedowns under bad faith never ever ever get penalized for it, like nobody ever has been penalized for filing a DMCA in bad faith I don&#x27;t think? (This is not a good thing, but is in this guy&#x27;s favor here). And again, this one would <i>definitely</i> not be in bad faith.<p>Just fill out a DMCA takedown request and send it to github? It&#x27;s not that hard, you can definitely find a template and fill it out within a very unhurried couple hours max with a couple coffee breaks in there. You don&#x27;t need a lawyer.<p>I know HN loves to hate Github, but you can&#x27;t get mad at them both for taking things down when those claiming copyright ask them to, and also for <i>not</i> doing so unless someone actually follows the proper (pretty simple and not very burdensome) procedure.<p>The OP sounds like he&#x27;s mad that the world is not entirely arranged in his favor to cater to his personal needs, and this is somehow a new realization for him.')
