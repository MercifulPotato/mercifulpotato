I figure the better move would be to work on improving JavaFX. As far as I can tell it&#x27;s a pretty solid GUI toolkit, albeit one with little adoption.<p><i>edit</i> Also, I suspect one of the things holding back Java desktop GUIs might be that they&#x27;re often clumsy to distribute. Expecting the user to install the JVM isn&#x27;t good enough, the application should bundle a JVM, or use ahead-of-time compilation. The user should never be made aware of what language you built the program in. As I understand it, OpenJDK has been making solid progress on the latter option. (And Excelsior JET no longer exists.)')
