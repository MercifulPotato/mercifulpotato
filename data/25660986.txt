In a hiring cycle I encounter multiple &quot;Senior Engineers&quot; who can&#x27;t write basic code. Fizzbuzz. Can&#x27;t do it. Engineers should absolutely expect to write real code in an interview. It&#x27;s preposterous to think that someone can claim to have 20 years experience writing code and then be offended to spend 20 minutes doing it in an interview.')
