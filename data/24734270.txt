To not put anyone on a pedestal. Sure, it’s quite an extreme take, however...<p>Would you disagree that this is an issue in modern society? Selfies and social media perception above real life?<p>Not saying I agree in any absolute fashion with “no people in art” etc, but to argue in bad faith against Islam’s scientific position is just obtuse and argumentative.  There is merit there.<p>And of course, this should go without saying but sadly cannot: extremist Muslims who commit violence in the name of these beliefs are horrible and wrong and guess what - not actually considered to be “good Muslims” by any true good Muslims out there, who value their fellow humans as also prescribed by their faith.')
