You mention the enemy over and over: the coerced state that does terrible biddings. But you then exempt government as if it were innocent first and corrupted later.<p>It is the mechanism by which you decide on economic matters by power that produces the vast majority of the issues you mention, way above the famous &quot;market failures&quot; and unaccounted externalities.')
