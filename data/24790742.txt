The pads give a false sense of security. They do a lot of stupid tackles in football, leading with the head, using it like a battering ram. Nobody would do that in rugby. You go for the legs and wrap them up. You don&#x27;t get the constant stops in play you do with football, so you need to tackle efficiently and keep going.<p>I see a ton of high-risk tackles in football that just aren&#x27;t done in rugby. But I&#x27;m not sure if that is enough of a difference.<p>This is just my opinion, I&#x27;m no expert. I just played some rugby in high school and briefly in an adult league.
