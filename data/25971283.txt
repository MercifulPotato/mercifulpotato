That&#x27;s just one aspect of it. The other is the right to speak, advocate and protest freely. I&#x27;ve heard many people advocate for compulsory military service for a few years for every citizen to <i>&quot;instil discipline and patriotism and understand brotherhood, hardship and sacrifice etc. etc.&quot;</i>. I have a different take on it - I say youngsters should be encouraged to join political parties instead to really understand and appreciate democracy. (Note that I used the word &quot;encouraged&quot; and not &quot;compulsory&quot; - democracy means more choice and less compulsions).')
