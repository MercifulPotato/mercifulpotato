Just not directly. That&#x27;s why I linked the million vs billion illustration. He has such a huge amount of life changing money, he simply can buy his influence and manifest his will. Here an American billionaire influences a British research institution to make a decision according to his worldview, a decision in existential crisis to humanity.<p>If you align with his worldview, you may like the result, but I really can&#x27;t understand how you can be willingly ignorant about the dynamics at hand and <i>how much power</i> these billionaires have over everyone&#x27;s life. Much more, Gates didn&#x27;t become rich for making the better product, but for clever business strategies and ruthless monopolizing a market for the longest time. His success is exactly failure of the free market naivet√©.<p>Nobody should be that rich. (And yes, no single government official should be trusted with deciding how to spend tax money either.
