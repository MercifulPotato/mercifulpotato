Is a strong spice. Is poisonous in big amounts but half a leaf here and there adds a nice flavor.<p>On the other hand, I had seen americans before to mistake bay leaves and cherry laurel. Specially when trying to harvest leaves in gardens. Don&#x27;t do that. They look similar but cherry laurel contains cyanide.')
