Section 230 has nothing about “unfair moderation”; it explictly allows online services to act as publishers within certain boundaries (to which the “fairness” of any moderation is not relevant, only whether the content is user-generated rather than first-party) without being legally treated as publishers for most civil liability purposes.')
