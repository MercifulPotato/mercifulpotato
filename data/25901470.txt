There are two assumptions I see in your analogy\n(1) Development of computer will parallel that of food.  This is the raison d&#x27;etre of the analogy.\n(2) The food industry has matured and plateaued.<p>My personal takes:<p>For (1), I don&#x27;t think it is self-evident.  I see that the pleasure from the consumption of junk food and that from the mass media has some parallel, but tech has a far greater degree of freedom -- it&#x27;s potential to truly transform human lives (for good and bad)<p>For (2), the food industry, although, by its nature,  conservative, is going still going through evolution. Maybe fast food doesn&#x27;t have to be junk food.  Maybe nutritional balance can be achieved without compromising taste and cost.')
