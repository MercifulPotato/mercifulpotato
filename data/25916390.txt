It&#x27;s zero-sum. If you include fees, people lose slightly more money than they gain in options trading, on average.<p>This is pretty different from YCombinator&#x27;s startup investment. No one has to lose for YC to win. The money ultimately comes from customers of YC-funded startups, who are in theory engaging in positive-sum trade (getting more in value than the money they paid for it). On average, people are earning lots of money investing in startups.<p>To be clear, options trading does have value in terms of letting people buy insurance and providing a price signal in terms of how many people believe prices will go up or down, but this is comparatively marginal and doesn&#x27;t affect the options traders themselves.')
