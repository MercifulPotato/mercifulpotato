Its capabilities will be extremely limited without a network of cooperative parties supporting it. Working within such a network, it would have vast capabilities of course.<p>Something like crossing air-gaps would require specialized knowledge and tools that a super AI wouldn&#x27;t be able to acquire without extensive support.
