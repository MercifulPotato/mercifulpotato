On my iMac Pro, both AirPods and AirPods Pro had serious reliability issues. Occasionally during calls I would end up having skipping audio issues, and my bluetooth magic trackpad would also stutter when these issues were ongoing. Sometimes the bluetooth driver would seemingly crash, everything would reconnect, and it would be fine.<p>The workaround I discovered was that if I plugged in my bluetooth trackpad via USB during a call, these issues would basically never happen.<p>Not to mention all the other general issues with them failing to stay connected to my Mac, or failing to connect initially. These issues also happened on multiple MacBook Pros, including new top-of-the-line 16&quot; models. Whereas I have basically zero problems with AirPods on my iPhone or AppleTV.<p>In short: the macOS bluetooth stack has some serious shortcomings that aren&#x27;t present in iOS.')
