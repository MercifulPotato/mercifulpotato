Citing completely non-existent cases, sometimes from completely non-existent courts.<p>2. Citing quotes from real cases, but the quotes were not from the court. I remember looking at one where they cited a real Supreme Court case, and the quote was very favorable to the tax protester&#x27;s claim. Unfortunately, it was not from the opinion of the court. It was from one of the briefs filed by the losing side which the court completely rejected.<p>3. Citing cases that were subsequently overturned on appeal.<p>4. Arguing that Soandso (usually someone selling a book or offering a seminar on getting out of taxes) has not gone to jail or even been sued by the IRS and so his methods must work.<p>The flaw in that is that you have no proof that he is actually using the methods from his books and seminars. It is quite possible he&#x27;s not in trouble because he actually pays his taxes.')
