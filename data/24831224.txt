I am a living example. I went through school, up to 10th grade (junior high school) with only getting minimum passing grades. I was worse at everything except History. That was the only thing that I liked. And even at History I was getting like medium grades, not the highest marks.<p>Then in the summer vacation between 10th grade and 11th grade I got hit with a hobby of Electronics. I read by mistake an old book, from 60&#x27;s, that was in my father&#x27;s book collection, of how to create a radio for short waves that was powered by a potato (the vegetable, not the sarcasm!). And I went down through that rabbit hole. I started to learn electronic components and what they do. That required Physics, which I knew nothing about it - so I started to learn Physics as well. Well, have you ever encountered Physics to be, in practice, applicable without Math? So I started to learn Math all by myself. Between ages of 16 to 18, while I was as Senior in high school I recovered all previous 10 years when I slacked worse than a worm. That allowed me to go to University where I got hit by another hobby - programming. Both these hobbies still stay with me to this day.<p>So yeah, I would argue not only is possible to learn Math all by yourself, but I&#x27;d say that doing so you actually learn it even better then when is forced upon you, even if you&#x27;re good at it.')
