In &#x27;our&#x27; constitution there is the &quot;<i>Recht auf k√∂rperliche Unversehrtheit</i> &#x2F; Right to physical integrity(of your body)&quot; as in it is forbidden to harm you. I&#x27;d extend that to a right to mental integrity, which that sort of shit is in continous violation of. And even if you don&#x27;t directly consume it, the &#x27;overspill&#x27; alone is toxic enough.<p>In other words: mass media is one big superfund site.')
