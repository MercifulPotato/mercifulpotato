I probably see two or three attempts per week. Most of them are crude but not all, and they <i>work</i>.<p>Authy emits TOTP codes, so those can be phished. The phishing site gets you to enter your TOTP code, which it passes over to the genuine site, signing in the attacker with your 100% authentic working codes.<p>But a Yubikey (and dozens of cheaper alternatives including Yubico&#x27;s own Security Key) can also be used with WebAuthn, which cannot be phished.')
