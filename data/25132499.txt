The latter is clearly much more relatable and inspiring to people. So whether it&#x27;s a pointless waste of money depends on what you&#x27;re trying to achieve. But I&#x27;d argue that the inspiration and unifying aspects are two of the biggest payoffs of space exploration, and robots don&#x27;t quite cut it there.<p>Also, humans are much more flexible than the robots we can currently create, which is pretty useful.')
