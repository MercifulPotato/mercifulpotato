It doesn&#x27;t matter if &quot;Trump wins Pennsylvania, Ohio, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Nevada&quot; in that case, so its just meaningless.<p>------------<p>Another example:<p>If Trump wins Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina, and Arizona but Biden wins Georgia, Wisconsin, and Iowa then Biden wins<p>Clearly, the &quot;Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina, and Arizona&quot; statement is meaningless in this example. All that matter is &quot;If Biden wins Georgia, Wisconsin, and Iowa, then Biden wins&quot;.')
