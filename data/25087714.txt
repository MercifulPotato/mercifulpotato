Item(by='jfengel', descendants=None, kids=[25088003], score=None, time=1605302834, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25087031, text='Well, they certainly didn&#x27;t go out of their way to promote it.<p>My first quarantine project (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jfengel&#x2F;opendocent" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jfengel&#x2F;opendocent</a>) was for a tour-guiding app (list of places on a map, show where you are, what&#x27;s here, where to go next). Rather than make up my own builder, a bit of Googling turned up Google Tour Builder.<p>It was pretty clear that the thing had little support. Nobody seemed to be using it to make tours. I think its tours were intended to be taken virtually in Google Earth. I was trying to guide people in the real world, after having had frustrations with taking tours using paper maps.<p>It was kind of an ironic project to be working on under lockdown. If I ever get back to it, I&#x27;ll have to reproduce Google Tour Builder to drive it.')
