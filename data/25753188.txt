As far as I&#x27;ve been able to tell, CDC hasn&#x27;t conducted a single randomized survey on any large group, but have only collected convenience samples.<p>Also keep in mind that due to compounding (keeping these people from infecting others on the plane and at home), the effect extends beyond the people prevented from traveling.
