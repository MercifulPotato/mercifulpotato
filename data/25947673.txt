I try to edit it out most of the time, but I&#x27;m not fanatical about it. I think it reads more clearly to the original writer than it does to a reader.<p>You&#x27;re absolutely correct about the paragraphs. A paragraph is a tool for organizing your document. If you have only one sentence per paragraph, you&#x27;re sacrificing that tool. You already have the period to separate sentences, so you should use paragraph separators to group sentences into a coherent thought.<p>The rule of thumb is 3-5 sentences per paragraph.
