It does nothing for small businesses that relied on Zoom&#x27;s data protection claims. And it does not require Zoom to pay a dime. The Commission must change course.&quot;<p>Under the settlement, &quot;Zoom is not required to offer redress, refunds, or even notice to its customers that material claims regarding the security of its services were false,&quot; Democratic Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter said. &quot;This failure of the proposed settlement does a disservice to Zoom&#x27;s customers, and substantially limits the deterrence value of the case.&quot;')
