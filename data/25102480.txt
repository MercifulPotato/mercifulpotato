It&#x27;s just a matter of how much time the maintainer has and how they wish to spend it. People who submit PRs forget that they are the only person, at the time of submission, who understands what their PR does without any further effort. Maintainers have to spend time (away from their day job or leisure time or whatever) understanding your work and <i>not getting paid a cent for it</i>. For a popular project, spread that effect across a thousand or so users.')
