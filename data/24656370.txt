They don&#x27;t do it so that the charger can &quot;be compatible with&quot; the analog-audio ecosystem (what do you want to do; plug your charger into an amplifier?)<p>No, these manufacturers use TRS jacks, because TRS jacks (and sockets) are <i>cheap parts</i>. (Remember, they&#x27;re not <i>making</i> these parts; they&#x27;re just <i>ordering</i> them, in bulk, from some supplier that has a warehouse full of them. And that supplier doesn&#x27;t care what they&#x27;re used for; they just want to get them sold.)<p>USB-C connectors are now also seemingly beginning to be <i>cheap parts</i>.')
