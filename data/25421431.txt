For me, it&#x27;s really a lack of time and&#x2F;or focus.<p>Generally speaking, I spend the majority of my time actually working on my project. It&#x27;s hard to get involved.<p>Even then, I&#x27;m on Hacker News (obviously) but don&#x27;t take time to write out really great comments like patio11, etc. I&#x27;m also on Indie Hackers, but really only reply to threads based on suggestions I get from curated emails. Otherwise, I&#x27;m on quite a few subreddits, as well as a ton of discord and slack channels. I&#x27;m also on Twitter, but don&#x27;t know how to really contribute there either.<p>I&#x27;m quite the generalist, and I&#x27;m really into Rails, Svelte, Flutter, Godot, and bootstrapping&#x2F;indie projects.<p>How do you all find the time to be involved anywhere?')
