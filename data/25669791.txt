I&#x27;d prefer to be a millionaire so I could be independently wealthy and do what I want instead of living just to pay bills, but if I could be a thousandaire, hey that is a nice start!<p>I&#x27;m always amazed, despite being well aware of inflation,  the cost of things&#x2F;cash value of prizes in things of yesteryear. When you hear someone bought their house for something like 7,000 dollars or their brand new car for 2,400 dollars my monkey brain just refuses to stop for a second and go &quot;yeah but inflation&quot;.<p>Then there is the rabbit hole of goods that have gotten significantly cheaper over time, or even those that have been volatile at times (such as the spot price of silver and gold).<p>Way too easy to get lost thinking about stuff like that.')
