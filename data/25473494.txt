Furthermore, if there&#x27;s a takeaway from my comment, is that I don&#x27;t think there are arguments to be said in that particular discussion, only opinions supported by one&#x27;s specific experience. There&#x27;s certainly a dearth of solid empirical evidence one way or the other.<p>I was also agreeing with GP&#x27;s saying that &quot;static typing won&#x27;t save us&quot;. There are many things to say about Go&#x27;s type system, but it is definitely more static than Python&#x27;s, which I&#x27;ve also worked with.')
