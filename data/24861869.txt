We have a few more that are very susceptible to covid due to a few factors. It&#x27;s not been a good year.<p>I can tell you from very personal experience: Zoom funerals are horrible.<p>They scream and cry, but you can&#x27;t comfort them, you&#x27;re hundreds of miles away, and you can&#x27;t leave the call either. And when you do finally turn it off, you&#x27;re just there in your quiet room again. It&#x27;s just <i>so</i> surreal.<p>Please, take this disease seriously.')
