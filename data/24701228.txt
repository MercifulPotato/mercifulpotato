Zip, zero, zilch resources were used month-on-month. My fault, yes, but naively I assumed if this was the case, billing would automatically drop to zero.<p>Whilst I bought access to X servers but had no way to remove the charge associated with that without contacting customer services when I decided X=0, permanently.<p>I mean, really? I have no problem with PAYG or PAYG to a capped amount, but PAYG for a fixed amount regardless of whether or not the resources are actually deployed is disingenuous at best.')
