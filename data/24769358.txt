It was a conscious decision they made and would still be doing if this article was not published and there wasn&#x27;t some controversy surrounding it. \nYeah good for them for not doing it anymore but the point is they did and that was a year ago not a lifetime. \nApple is only trying to sell you privacy since its looks good for them.')
