My experience with developers who default to static method calls rather than objects in Java or C++ is that they also default to static (and therefore global) data as well.  Of course, you don&#x27;t have to do that: you can pass pre-transaction data structures to the static functions and let them operate on them, but that&#x27;s what object-oriented programming is for in the first place.')
