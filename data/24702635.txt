Its almost as if it had to be written to shock people on this thread in order to be accepted, which brings us full circle.<p>I enjoyed the report not because it shocked me but because it outlined its methodology, it showed clear examples, and it points to a growing trend. It makes me wonder where these things go next, it feels like squeezing a lemon. Sure if you get a hydraulic press you&#x27;ll get a bit more out. Then you&#x27;ve destroyed the entire communication channel.')
