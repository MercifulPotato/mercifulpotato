The difference being Zwift caters to people who are already vested and more hardcore in some ways where as peloton is the general public who want to try and get a quick good workout?<p>Also - if you are following the peloton model - how are you going to build out the celebrity following for your athletes?  I think that is one of the key components of why people buy in.<p>Product pricing - are you going lower cost than peloton as you could be considered a substitute product.<p>Good luck on the journey!')
