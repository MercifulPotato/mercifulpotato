Item(by='s3krit', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602064359, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24706544, text='I sort of get the argument for not having the rule based on intent - the game&#x27;s faster than it&#x27;s ever been, and even with VAR reviewing it, it&#x27;s nigh impossible to determine intent. At least this gives some clarity to the refs and players. I see it as similar in a way to players going down like a sack of bricks with a light (But legitimate) foul - it&#x27;s a way to clearly signal to the ref that contact was made (as well as, you know, get a pen) in a game with such tiny margins at the highest level of play.')
