I feel like the comparison is similar to investing in Amazon versus investing in a company that sells its products on Amazon. Betting on real estate means betting on the value of the home&#x2F;land increasing, while betting on Airbnb means betting on the company + the future of the market of renting homes.<p>I did some initial research on Airbnb vs. VRBO, and they do seem like very similar companies. However, VRBO started in 1995, while Airbnb started in 2008. VRBO had a head start, and yet has only 2 million listings in comparison to Airbnb&#x27;s 7 million[0]. The faster growth of Airbnb in comparison to VRBO might be one reason you&#x27;d want to invest in Airbnb over VRBO, especially in an America that allows monopolies to thrive under certain conditions.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnet.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;airbnb-vs-vrbo-which-is-the-best-vacation-rental-site&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnet.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;airbnb-vs-vrbo-which-is-the-best-v...</a>')
