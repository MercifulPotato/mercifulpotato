Item(by='jtolmar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608917430, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25537737, text='SSCAIT is one of a few major tournaments in the Star Craft: Brood War AI scene. It tends to be one the one that gets the most preparation and biggest releases, since it&#x27;s the only tournament that broadcasts every single game live on Twitch. The round robin phase will take a few weeks, then it&#x27;ll enter an elimination bracket.<p>Brood War bots are, roughly speaking, better than everyone who played the game casually, but not as good as someone who put in a few weeks of serious practice with modern strategies (The highest is roughly ICCUP rank C). They&#x27;re capable of extremely high APM, and some have extremely impressive micro tricks. Bots tend to be weak by over-microing their units, having poor positional reasoning, and poor overall strategic sense. They all work using BWAPI, a program that snoops Brood War&#x27;s memory for all the unit positions, censors the stuff a given player isn&#x27;t supposed to know, and provides functions to issue orders.<p>A surprise new bot was released late this year - Monster, a Zerg bot that might win the tournament by virtue of just playing very solidly. This would end a few years of Protoss dominating the top ten.<p>This has been posted before (it&#x27;s an annual event!) but HN has enjoyed it in previous years. I&#x27;ve also noticed that, when someone posts the tournament to places like HN, the SC AI scene is a lot more active for the following year. This is my nefarious motivation for posting it - I enjoy following the progress.')
