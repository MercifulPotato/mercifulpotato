My first thought was pretty much &quot;Oh man, they made a huge oversight.&quot;\nMany people that have tried it, say that they prefer it because it is not taxed as marijuana so they get around paying a lot. I mean you can buy an entire ounce of 95% pure Delta-8-THC distillate for $100ish. To give perspective, it is a sizable jar and you literally can scrape out about the size of a rice grain of this hard&#x2F;sticky substance and get ripped. There is a whole thriving market emerging with vape cartridges&#x2F;pens, candies and different blends of various cannabinoids to elicit different desired effects.<p>Hopefully they will just pass the MORE act and we&#x27;ll have full legalization across the board, but at least it will be harder to change the law with respect to just hemp derived products now.')
