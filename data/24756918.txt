Many of us are going to simply drop our ballots off in the mail. The mail is still running fine in the vast majority of locations.<p>Don’t get me wrong, these weird stories and edge cases are concerning and must be addressed, but it’s hardly the normal state of affairs for the vast majority of Americans.<p>In this case, the ballot harvesting efforts, however ill-advised, are likely not created with ill intent. Given the way ballots are sealed, it’s unlikely that these operators are somehow going to open the ballots, check votes, selectively discard them, reseal selected votes, and not invalidate all of them in the process.<p>Note that many of these drop boxes are popping at at weird places like gun shops, candidate headquarters, churches, and other locations that are likely to have voters skewed in a specific direction. However, it doesn’t make any sense that a political candidate or a gun shop would go out of their way to discard ballots collected at a location that skews toward their own constituency. Instead, it’s more likely that these people have consumed too much fear-mongering media about election tampering and believe that they are helping the situation by collecting and protecting the votes from like-minded people.')
