Bitcoin is not an inflation protected or anything-protected asset. It’s value goes up and down because of few large players including state. In other words, it’s anyone’s imagination what it’s value will be. A much better option for most people will be to open a free investment account and simply by SPY. They can do it using an app and it’s far less complex as well as safer than evaluating individual Bitcoin exchanges who no one controls and many are downright shady. Unlike Bitcoin SPY is technically US federal government protected asset because US government will always intervene if it’s values dip more than 20% as it affects everyone’s 401Ks and would cause removal of leaders in government. Unlike Bitcoin, SPY is truly inflation protected and ALSO delivers real dividends.')
