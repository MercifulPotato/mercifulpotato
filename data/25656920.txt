Could you be more precise about the sort of interference effects you&#x27;re talking about?<p>I generally wouldn&#x27;t call entanglement an &quot;interference effect&quot;. When I think about interference my mind goes to the patterns emerging from double slit experiments.<p>Consider a quantum teleportation experiment, I start with<p>N (a|0&gt; + b|1&gt;) ( |00&gt; + |11&gt; )<p>where N fixes the normalisation<p>I do a measurement on qubits 0 and 1 in the basis ( |00&gt; + |11&gt; ), ( |00&gt; - |11&gt; ), ( |10&gt; + |01&gt; ), ( |10&gt; - |10&gt; ) and observe the outcome associated with ( |00&gt; + |11&gt; ), so now my state is<p>N ( |00&gt; + |11&gt; ) (a|0&gt; + b|1&gt;)<p>Now we collect our grant money because we&#x27;ve teleported the state to the other end. I don&#x27;t see where the interference effect(s) were, from my perspective everything looked local and nice except for the impact of measurement, which is nonlocal in the &quot;standard&quot; picture and unexplained in general.<p>I think my perspective on interference comes from the fact that water waves and sound waves (for example) exhibit interference in pretty much the same way that wavefunctions do, but we can&#x27;t break Bell inequalities with them since we don&#x27;t have the same weirdness around measurement.')
