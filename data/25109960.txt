Anywhere you don&#x27;t have unelected legislators imposing censorship on what they feel is good and wholesome and what isn&#x27;t. Competing candidate&#x27;s platform advertisements in the run-up to a union election in that union&#x27;s newsletter isn&#x27;t displaying a lot of  capitalism and it&#x27;s as true there as mop advertisements between talk-show segments on late night tv. (One or more of the candidates might be, gasp, wilfully and knowingly telling, omg, lies!)<p>When the ads are creating a problem that is actually difficult to solve they&#x27;re revealing a problem that is not the ads themselves. It&#x27;s a crisis in education and the general public&#x27;s ability (or the pereception of it) to do a decent job critical thinking and bs detecting.<p>Making cruel fun of ridiculous fear-mongering accross society ought to be the answer to organised lying. When it isn&#x27;t, getting Zuck &amp; Jack to censor it is kind of a worrying development. Tough to get that back in the bottle even if it&#x27;s initially done in support of causes you kinda like, coz you know that condition of it only being &quot;for good&quot;, (where &#x2F;you&#x2F; define good) will not last. Guaranteed. Never does.')
