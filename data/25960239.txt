Capital gains are completely uninvolved. This is usually done by selling some fraction of the vested shares to cover the tax (3 shares vest, you sell 1, and end up with 2 shares and some change).<p>Then, the vested value is your cost basis for any cap gains, which are taxes as cap gains.<p>But if you&#x27;re paid solely in stock, your income is still $250k, and you pay income tax on $250k.')
