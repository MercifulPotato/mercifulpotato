The reality is, the problem is not very deep here. Without access to prescription medications, you basically have a handful of options that are more of less the same. It&#x27;s like walking onto a rental car lot. You need to know what category you need, but everything in that category is pretty much the same.<p>He isn&#x27;t solving anything for the physician market. His recommendations are very naive and lack the clinical backing to support actual usage. A physician isn&#x27;t going to buck their go-to&#x27;s because a random tool suggests something else. This tool needs to provide scientific backing for it&#x27;s recommendations and why that recommendation is better.')
