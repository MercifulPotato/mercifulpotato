That is not always the case. Now she is working 1 on 1 and not trying to work on multiple people at once. Not everyone is chasing a dollar. I sell chicken eggs for no profit but I like the chickens around and I get some eggs. But the egg farmer charging 5$ actually makes some profit. So if the clinic only makes 150-200k but brings happiness to them that is way more important then money in my opinion.')
