Then your monitor sits about in the middle of the table and you have so much space behind it, around the sides, and beside you. It&#x27;s a huge improvement to have this extra space.<p>Things marketed as &#x27;computer desks&#x27; are invariably about 4x too small for comfortable use and placing your equipment on.')
