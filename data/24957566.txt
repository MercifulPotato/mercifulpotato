It is still a root of inequality, and promotes all kind of bad behavior. Your accomplishments, your money, not your kids. When you die, the assets should go back to the people equally. That way all children, no matter their parents, citizen of a country, should have equality in opportunity.<p>In theory, children with rich parents will still have plenty of advantages, connections, know how, good education, etc. But they shouldn&#x27;t inherit any assets or financials.<p>Now how would that be managed in practice, no idea, and I haven&#x27;t fully thought through everything here, but I&#x27;m just surprised this isn&#x27;t an idea I hear more about, as it seems to me this is a huge source of inequality remaining in our society.')
