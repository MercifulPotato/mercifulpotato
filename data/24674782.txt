I think you&#x27;re reading it with the wrong quantifier: to me the claim is not &quot;[all] astronomers want [etc.]&quot; but &quot;[some] astronomers want [etc.]&quot;, which is perfectly reasonable.<p>But it&#x27;s fine to change a title when it&#x27;s landing the wrong way with some readers, and it seemed like there was a better link in this case, so a mod changed both the URL and title.')
