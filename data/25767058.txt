It&#x27;s fair to call Netflix a product because it&#x27;s something that end users actually care about for its own sake. You can pay for Netflix and nothing else and still get value out of it.<p>Dropbox is just a &quot;feature&quot; in that you can&#x27;t do anything with it on its own, you need to have some other data from somewhere else to use with it.')
