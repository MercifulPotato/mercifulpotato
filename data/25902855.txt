But that&#x27;s largely because EVs are still new and the &quot;average&quot; person just can&#x27;t afford to buy a brand new car every few years.<p>However, in 5-10 years we should start to see a mature market for good quality <i>used</i> EVs, making them much more accessible. At that point, better reliability, better driving experience, much lower operating costs, etc will make EVs the obvious choice for many, if not most, buyers.')
