Local referring to the idea that nothing is faster than light, and realism referring to the idea of there being a single objective world. You only have to sacrifice either locality or realism to make sense of the Bell paradox. The Many-Worlds Interpretation sacrifices realism but not locality. Faster-than-light communication isn&#x27;t necessary for MWI to work.')
