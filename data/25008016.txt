Item(by='jerf', descendants=None, kids=[25008926, 25008536, 25008462], score=None, time=1604674768, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25007435, text='YouTube fed me a couple of these videos before I blocked the channel(s); I didn&#x27;t completely put all the pieces together that it was abuse like this but I intuited that they were at least manipulative, because they were just too <i>interesting</i>. My wife had an internship for her degree at an animal rescue facility. Though they didn&#x27;t deal in pets, real animal rescue stories tend to be more like &quot;someone found this animal; they took it to the rescue facility, it got better or it didn&#x27;t, and they released it or not&quot;. You don&#x27;t get:<p>&quot;I&#x27;d seen this raccoon around the house for a while, had been feeding him, and had been filming his exploits for a while. But one day, he got caught in {extremely picturesque situation} and I knew something had to be done. So I called up these other people to help rescue him, and he was so cute when we fetched him!&quot; (Real rescued animals, BTW, are often injured in ways that will make most people vomit.) &quot;So we took him in to our facility, where he had numerous cute interactions with our other animals...&quot; (real rescued animals are often quite distrusting; there&#x27;s a couple of other videos where the main storyline was &quot;and he instantly trusted us after a bit&quot;) &quot;... and after we released him he still hangs around and visits us for treats and rollicking fun!&quot;<p>Especially all the bits from <i>before</i> the injury are just crazy. This is a story line from a kid&#x27;s book, not something that happens routinely. Maybe in the entire ~2 summers my wife worked at a rescue facility you could get one story of this level of &quot;interest&quot; out of it. You could get quite a few of lower levels of &quot;interest&quot;, but not this sort of long-running sustained level of interest, and certainly not over and over, every week or on some other regular posting schedule. It was all just too pat to be something happening like this all the time.')
