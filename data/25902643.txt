But I only use Wolt. They have excellent customer service, in the rare occasion that an order I placed was delivered incorrectly (missing dish etc) they made it right very quickly and with no fuss.<p>They also provide support in both English and Hebrew, which is is a nice benefit over the local companies that can help you in Hebrew.')
