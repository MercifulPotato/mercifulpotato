Their greater training complexity and compute costs are much more than amortized by improved performance, easier ability to train and deploy new models (it’s much harder and labor intensive to adjust a rat’s nest of custom business rules than a black box ML model, even in terms of transparency).<p><i>Just</i> reduction of operating costs <i>alone</i> is usually a reason to favor ML solutions, even if they only achieve parity with rules systems (though usually they outperform them by a lot).<p>Your comment makes me feel your methodology for assessing business value and comparing with rule systems is deeply flawed and probably biased to go against ML solutions for preconceived reasons.')
