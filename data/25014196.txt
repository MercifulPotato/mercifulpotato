He voted to authorize the Iraq war in 2003, and drafted and sponsored the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act in 1994, the largest crime bill in American history.  Biden’s win is a great signal for defense and law enforcement companies that spending will increase, so it makes sense. It’s likely a really great time to invest in these companies now that Trump has no chance of winning.')
