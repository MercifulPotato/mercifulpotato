I got a slim notebook that doesn&#x27;t have lan and as the article says the wifi is proprietary (also the nvidia gpu). I spent like 3 hours trying to work around before I gave up and installed ubuntu (it boots out of the box - pendrive). I got the non-free firmware and burned them in the pendrive I create with the debian installation, but with no success. Back in college I had a lot of free time to fiddle with this stuff, not anymore unfortunately.')
