When we had major renovations, one knowledgeable family member always had to be around to make sure things are going well. The main repairs guy is obviously hostile to this, they are the pros after all, but if you take a hands off approach you can get screwed. And other handymen don&#x27;t like taking up and finishing&#x2F;fixing botched jobs.  You can also try to run after your money. Sure you can delegate that too, pay a lawyer etc.<p>If you&#x27;re really rich you can just have someone who does all this for you and you just sit in your chair and enjoy life and point to things in catalogues and everything else just appears around you.')
