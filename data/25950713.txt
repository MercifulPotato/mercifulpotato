I made it a point to go and look at the communities that were pro-Trump in the aftermath of the election. There are clear similarities. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s the same thing, but I think we need to seriously take a step back and look at what&#x27;s actually happening, and what&#x27;s happening isn&#x27;t a level headed discussion about free markets. It&#x27;s a conspiracy riddled hysteria where many people are claiming they&#x27;re <i>never</i> going to sell a crappy retail stock for what can quite clearly be understood to be emotional reasoning.')
