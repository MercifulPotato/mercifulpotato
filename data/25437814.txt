Hasura takes advantage of Postgres&#x27;s JSON features to compile a deeply-nested graphql query into a single query.<p>It&#x27;s pretty impressive too. For any deeply-nested query, like fetching the 1-to-many children of 1-to-many children of some entity, a lot of ORMs will often have to resort to doing N+1 queries, which adds a surprising amount of latency to a request.')
