Primarily because it seems they had a lot of constraint in manufacturing and distribution with these models. There has been super strong demand early on with all the carrier incentives but once people saw the distribution delays that went out almost a month, I think that demand quickly died down as people wait for faster arrival times and more option diversity (iphone 12 mini models come to market).<p>This is all speculation and I am using my own experience here to determine this but I donâ€™t think the coming results are going to be as aggressive within the next quarter or so as distribution for the phones continue to be limited with rising cases and manufacturing capacity also potentially being limited')
