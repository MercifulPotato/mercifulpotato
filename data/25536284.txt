The latency is low and most of the time you don&#x27;t need to install anything: just plug an USB. It even provides APIs for running the plugins, if the DAW wants to use AU. Hell, even the built-in interfaces has good latency on Macs. Also, if you have multiple, different branded interfaces, Apple provides a tool to &quot;merge them&quot; so your DAW pretends it&#x27;s only one.<p>On Windows you need an alternative third-party driver solution, ASIO, just to get proper latency. Microsoft tried DirectAudio, Kernel Audio, among other tech, but it never worked and&#x2F;or never caught on. Even ASIO is not as stable as CoreAudio and requires installing (sometimes unstable) third-party driver software and control panels. IME, sometimes those drivers conflict with each other, so you can&#x27;t use multiple soundcards at the same time, or swap them. Most people eventually get there, but it still feels like a house of cards.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of small studios that choose Hackintoshes, so it&#x27;s not really the hardware, although M1 might change that, who knows.')
