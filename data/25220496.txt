Our problems there are all with healthcare billing, not healthcare production.<p>US freight rail is actually pretty good.  For why our passenger rail is terrible that comes down to high construction costs and this <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bikeeastbay.org&#x2F;rail&#x2F;fra.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bikeeastbay.org&#x2F;rail&#x2F;fra.html</a>.  The costs are a combination of the rest of the world inventing techniques that the US considers to be Not Inveted Here and a penchant for regulation by lawsuit rather than regulation by beaurocracy.<p>The US and EU are the two places you can get really good aircraft, it&#x27;s a major manufacturing export center for the US. China, for example, still can&#x27;t make modern jet engines and while the fusilage and electronics of their newest combat jets are fine its speed, acceleration, and fuel efficiency are well behind US jets for that reason.<p>The US is a major pharmaceutical exporter.<p>The US is also a major semiconductor exporter, we&#x27;re one of the three countries in the world along with Samsung and Taiwan that are still in the race while something like a dozen companeis have dropped out of the race as capitcal costs keep going up.<p>Shipbuilding, yeah, US shipbuilding can&#x27;t compete on the global market because US laborer are relatively expensive.<p>Basically high wages mean that the US can only compete in manufacturing in high value industries like the ones you mentioned.  Things like aircraft, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors.  But we&#x27;re not going to be a textile exporter until the rest of the world gets to be as wealthy as we are now.')
