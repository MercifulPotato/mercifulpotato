(The closest is the acknowledgement of the role the USSR under Stalin played as an ally against the Nazis.)<p>It does argue that 1984 misses the internal instability of totalitarianisms like Stalinism, which besame evident after 1984 was written.<p>&gt; His critique of the science fiction, that screens which watch you back is a poor prediction (because how on Earth could Google watch people at scale?!) is particularly hilarious, if a bit sad.<p>The critique isn&#x27;t of screens that watch you back, but of the failure of imagination of Orwell envisioning only screens <i>by which a human watches you in real time</i> rather than one that does so by some automated, scalable means.')
