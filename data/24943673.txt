Item(by='diggan', descendants=None, kids=[24943941], score=None, time=1604073985, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24943481, text='&gt; speculative work in an editor, with all its features, has always felt a lot more productive to me<p>Yeah, I agree with this, which is why I spend all my time in the editor, which is connected to the REPL. I never leave my editor to write stuff manually in the REPL, I simply send the forms from my editor to the REPL to be evaluated. So the best of both worlds :)<p>Recent example of how that workflow looks like: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vlaaad.github.io&#x2F;reveal&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vlaaad.github.io&#x2F;reveal&#x2F;</a><p>What&#x27;s on the left is vlaaad&#x27;s editor, and the REPL is on the right. Usually I have a similar setup, but the output of the REPL goes straight into my editor instead of in a separate window.<p>One question for you, if you rarely used the REPL, how is your workflow with Clojure unless with a REPL? If you&#x27;re working on a service, do you restart the process after each change or how to you avoid the REPL when working with Clojure?')
