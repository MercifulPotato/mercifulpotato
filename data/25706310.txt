Which is the point of a writing&#x2F;blogging app after all. It should encourage you to write, not get in the way with themes, CSS, hosting and all that entails.<p>You can only sign up with an invite code because I haven’t fully decided whether to subject the world to YABA (yet another blog app). I was going to add billing support first as I don’t want to support free customers, but I might see what the reception is here first ;-)<p>I have a bunch of ideas that will keep the basic writing&#x2F;publishing concept but make it more of a hub for reading too.')
