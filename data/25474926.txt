When doing your initial stability studies, you try and collect data for the most ideal conditions - no refrigeration needed, stable for X years from room temperature to 30C (to account for conditions during shipment).<p>No doubt Pfizer lined up a number of early stability studies testing -80C, -50C, -20C, 0C, etc.  They recognize that needing a -70C cold chain is a logistics hurdle.  If they could avoid it at all, they would have pushed for it and had data to back it up.')
