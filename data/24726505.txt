The portion you quoted relates to the ability&#x2F;necessity for elements of the Intelligence Community to create formal implementing guidance of the requirements within EO 12333 (e.g., which activities can be performed by the agency, under what circumstances, etc.) Basically there is a negotiation that takes place between the IC element and DoJ&#x2F;the White House in order to add some fidelity to the language in EO 12333. It is a process that generally takes years, not minutes. In addition, the AG wouldn&#x27;t be able to make an exception that is inconsistent with the requirements in EO 12333. Theoretically, the President could amend EO12333 to allow for additional activities, but there are even issues with that considering Congress&#x27; role in intelligence oversight, power of the purse via the Intel Authorization Act, etc...')
