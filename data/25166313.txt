Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25171242], score=None, time=1605914329, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25166037, text='&quot;Perhaps a bit but quickly governments would realize they are going to have to invest in research more rather than purchase innovations from the U.S.&quot;<p>Governments are not this sophisticated or operationally nimble unfortunately.<p>We&#x27;re in a pandemic, and I watch our Provincial medical leaders come out and talk almost every day, they&#x27;re all smart, but they don&#x27;t really understand what is going on - they don&#x27;t have the data. But in a pandemic that destroys 20% of GDP, maybe it would be a good idea to have every single person who takes a COVID test fill out a questionnaire, so the data can be made available? Masses of unemployed young people that could be put quickly and succinctly onto large-scale contract tracing programs? Releasing communications apps to collect data, getting national level experiments running to determine the primary vectors of propagation etc. etc..<p>They are all professionals with good intentions, but this does not remotely translate into operational effectiveness. What we need is a &#x27;Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27; kind of leader for this pandemic but his type is long gone and we may not even recognize operational efficiency.<p>Even during a pandemic when much is at stake, they&#x27;re limited by their own systems. A much broader strategy of &#x27;creating innovation to make up for the American loss&#x27; would&#x27;t work, even throwing $ zillions at it wouldn&#x27;t solve the problem.<p>The sophistication of Canadian products, and ironically economic diversity has been going <i>down</i> in Canada, as we focus on being &#x27;really good&#x27; at being a good &#x27;Foreign HQ&#x27; country.<p>My most recent hospital visit here in Quebec was a little scary: broken equipment in the main hall, the water fountain out of service, having to wait in a cold waiting room all day for a very small issue with no updates (and I couldn&#x27;t even leave the room), the halls were lined with elderly people in beds because they were overcapacity. I did receive competent care, but the economic stresses were visible.<p>And of course I don&#x27;t doubt for a second how insane the US system can be for billing, financialisations etc..<p>I think the US should be looking towards the Dutch or Swiss models, not Canada or UK.')
