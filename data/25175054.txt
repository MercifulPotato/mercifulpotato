A lack of research has unfortunately become the norm for their articles, along with many other news agencies here.&quot;<p>Another<p>&quot;Uh..this is just not true. There has never been a strategy of herd immunity in Sweden.\nTheir source for this is &quot;Dr Nick Talley [...] editor-in-chief of the Medical Journal of Australia&quot;. That is not a reliable source, especially to me as a swede who is following my governments statements and strategy.\nI have never heard anyone in the government say there is any hopes of achieving herd immunity without a vaccine, let alone that this would be a strategy. Sounds like something thinks Boris Johnson is Swedish.<p>You can absolutely have issues with the Swedish way of tackling covid-19, and you can certainly say it&#x27;s pretty much failed, but to claim that the &quot;herd immunity strategy&quot; has failed is just bad research.&quot;')
