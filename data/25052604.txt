That&#x27;s illegal.  Thin blue line flags and &quot;support our troops&quot; are out of place and it&#x27;s two-faced to pretend it isn&#x27;t just a signal of partisan support.  These are some of the major party issues.<p>Bad taste has nothing to do with it.  If someone wears a SUPPORT THE CURRENT PRESIDENT shirt, that&#x27;s support of <i>Trump</i>, not endorsement of the concept of government or something nonpartisan.')
