I think it&#x27;s an outdated paradigm though, if it&#x27;s not been wrong all along. A CISC chip can still officially support instructions, but deprecate them and implement them very slowly in microcode, as is done with some x86 instructions. And a RISC chip manufacturer might just have used this phrase as a marketing line because designing RISC chips is easier than starting with a monster that has tons of instructions, and they needed some catchy phrase to market their alternative. They then get into the gradual process of making their customers happier one by one by adding special, mostly cold, silicon targeted for special workflows, like in this instance.<p>Ultimately, the instruction set isn&#x27;t that relevant anyways, what&#x27;s more relevant is how the microcode can handle speculative execution for common workflows. There&#x27;s a great podcast&#x2F;interview from the x86 specification author: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Nb2tebYAaOA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Nb2tebYAaOA</a>')
