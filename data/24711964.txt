A component being faulty isn’t really on the same order of magnitude as the entire roof of the car detaching. I’m also reminded of a story a few months ago where the steering wheel of a Tesla simply detached in the driver’s hands. This is just an deeply flawed manufacturing and QA process that frankly deserves more critical coverage than other car companies because the problems are more fundamental, like potentially ending up like the police car at the end of <i>The Blues Brothers</i>.')
