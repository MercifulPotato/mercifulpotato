That&#x27;s one great way to differentiate from Alexa devices. We&#x27;re still running AirPorts at my house, though I know eventually they&#x27;ll die and we&#x27;ll have to find something else.<p>In the meantime, they&#x27;re super convenient for having my Time Capsule back up my Mac, and for piping audio via an Airport Express to the speakers I use with my projector setup.')
