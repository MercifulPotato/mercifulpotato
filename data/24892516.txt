Every human on earth, by living the natural world, has chosen chaos&#x2F;vitality at some level.  We also “moderate” that entropy in lots of convenient and comforting ways.<p>Cybernature is a new experience.  As a species, we are working out what level of moderation we would like.<p>Explorers tends to be rough-and-ready sorts, and so veer towards the vitality side of things.  They know how to make the chaos work for them.  For good and&#x2F;or evil.  Since there isn’t the downside of “instadeath” of the physical world, more risk-taking, and thus more chaos, may be justified.<p>Settlers tend to like fences, highways, channel markings, flight corridors...structure.  There are usually eventually  more settlers in any area, so their view prevails in the long run.<p>(You can be an explorer in one area and a settler in another...it’s not some permanent psychological feature.  You can demand political content freedom from de facto pseudocarrier monopolies while being happy with a locked-down OS for self-driving cars.)<p>In computing, the barrier to entry for exploration is so low and it is so new (in the long view) that the percentage of settlers is pretty low, hence the cultural bias toward freedom (including content) rather than control in these forums.<p>[Personally, I trust the American people to curate their own content.  I expect the educational system to educate the citizenry to be skilled enough in critical thinking to be able to curate the content presented.<p>But I expect the marketplace of ideas to police itself against systematic biases and inaccuracies, either with effective editing of its own content and&#x2F;or in <i>actively</i> and <i>effectively</i> supporting a “loyal opposition” to its views.<p>Twitter seems to be doing neither, because it’s much closer to being a de facto common carrier monopoly than a media channel.  Common carrier monopolies had been accepted and successful for a hundred years in the US, but only with heavy Federal regulation.  The hip, cool alternative: break them up.<p>Great truths from Gen X, the generation to which you can’t easily mass-market.]')
