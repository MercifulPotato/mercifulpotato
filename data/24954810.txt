It’s factored into my risk.<p>And FSD isn’t orders of magnitude safer. They are barely as good as human drivers and only in some conditions.<p>For the worst situations they aren’t comparable at all (since they won’t drive at all)<p>This must be repeated over and over for some reason: people will never accept self driving cars that are just as good or bad as human drivers. Nor should we. It’s a much too low bar.<p>Self driving cars will need to be orders of magnitude safer than human drivers to be even remotely acceptable.')
