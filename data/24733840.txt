Meta was headed to guardianship not long after the Meta2 was released.<p>Overall Meta was just a poor experience with basically zero traction.  They changed their hardware approach from the Meta1 to the 2 and it created a completely different experience while on the side the Hololens was blowing everyone out of the water and they weren&#x27;t in any position to compete. Add to that the complete collapse of Magic Leap and the bubble burst for AR this round.<p>Reinforcing again - Augmented Reality is probably the hardest market&#x2F;technology to succeed or even just stay alive in.')
