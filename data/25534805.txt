With charity, likely it is clear to you as the donor that you are doing something to help the world.<p>With taxes, you mail your check in and nothing.  There is certainly no thank you note or glimmer of recognition.  But in reality, particularly if you look at the state level budgets, it&#x27;s likely the impact dollar for dollar has a very high potential for helping a lot of people when its used for education, healthcare and the environment.<p>Perhaps the trick is, as tax donors, we have to look for the impact ourselves and mentally take credit for the impact we are having on other people&#x27;s lives.<p>And perhaps governments need to figure out how to make taxpayer understand in personal terms how they&#x27;re dollars are being used for good.  Then maybe people will enjoy paying tax donations (and maybe even pay a bit more) versus actively working to avoid taxes.')
