Item(by='danShumway', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612217747, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25994496, text='&gt; about Facebook&#x27;s access to the Apple IDFA<p>Which is used to uniquely identify me across apps, a totally equivalent level of tracking as identifying me across websites. It is the same result, just on a different platform.<p>And all of this data gets combined and utilized with the &quot;other data vacuuming issues&quot; you&#x27;re talking about. You can&#x27;t treat those like isolated issues, the unique identifiers across websites&#x2F;apps <i>enable</i> the data vacuuming.<p>You&#x27;re arguing that these identifiers aren&#x27;t primarily being used to build profiles, that they&#x27;re mostly innocuous, and then you&#x27;re saying that the fact that profiles are being built and data vacuuming is happening is a separate issue that&#x27;s not relevant to the current conversation? No, the data vacuuming wouldn&#x27;t be possible to nearly the same degree without persistent identifiers. That makes it relevant.<p>&gt; is not comparable to a quasi-anonymous unique value traveling from my computer to another.<p>You&#x27;re arguing about a matter of degree. The point I&#x27;m making is that violating my privacy doesn&#x27;t become automatically OK just because the advertising industry promises me they won&#x27;t look at the extra data they&#x27;re getting. And I think the reasoning behind why it&#x27;s not OK is the same in both scenarios -- because in both scenarios, it&#x27;s not reasonable to trust the person gathering that data to keep it secure or to never misuse it.<p>People bring up &quot;quasi-anonymous&quot; as if it&#x27;s some kind of perfect defense that puts these identifiers into a separate category of information, but it&#x27;s not. If it was actually anonymous, you wouldn&#x27;t need to put the &quot;quasi&quot; in front of it. But if it makes you feel better, I&#x27;ll put a camera in your bathroom and then disassociate the video stream from your home address or name, and then I&#x27;ll blur your face with an AI. Then the video stream will be quasi-anonymous too. I promise I won&#x27;t ever try to link it to a real identity, you can trust me.<p>The point is, it is a violation of my privacy to track every website I visit and every app I use. The reason why a company is doing that <i>doesn&#x27;t matter.</i>')
