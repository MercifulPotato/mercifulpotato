Cats are very affectionate creatures. They are not dogs and you shouldn&#x27;t expect them to behave like dogs. They are not all the same and not all of them are cuddly (especially if they are not taught to share affection via touch since a young age) but if someone says that cats only like people who feed them, then I have to disagree based on my experience raising more cats than _most_ people.<p>However, I do concede that sharing food is an easy way to form a bond with an animal (including our very own species).')
