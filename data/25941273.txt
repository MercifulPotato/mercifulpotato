We&#x27;d love to see an AWS API for exporting user secrets from user pools.  We&#x27;d add support for that really quick.<p>The experience is better for user pools that integrate with external identity providers, like SAML, since the IdP metadata can be fully replicated into the other region ahead of time.')
