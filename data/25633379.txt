We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result. We&#x27;re still a startup â€” today, we&#x27;re ~1,000 people who have been working on this since March 2015. We&#x27;ve built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch with fairness in mind.<p>We&#x27;re focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 30+ states. We&#x27;ve also successfully launched both a renters and homeowners product and an Enterprise arm of our core business, all in the last year.<p>We&#x27;ve raised the largest VC round ever for an Ohio technology company and we&#x27;re scaling rapidly, most recently launching our $6B IPO: \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nasdaq.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;root-insurance-ipo-poised-to-disrupt-the-insurance-market-2020-10-30" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nasdaq.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;root-insurance-ipo-poised-to...</a><p>We&#x27;re planning on leveraging that momentum to continue scaling rapidly and build something truly unique in the insurance industry. To do that, we&#x27;re looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers and continue creating great teams around strong leaders and experienced problem solvers.<p>Our tech stack involves Ruby &#x2F; Rails and Javascript &#x2F; React Native. However, we&#x27;re not only looking for people with experience in our stack, but rather, we&#x27;re looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.<p>We&#x27;re actively hiring in both Ohio and Illinois, where we have offices in Columbus and Chicago, respectively. Although we&#x27;re all working remotely for the foreseeable future, we have the utmost intentions of returning to these offices sometime in 2021 when safe. We know we work best together in person, so we&#x27;re searching for both experienced Engineers and Engineering Leaders who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch, specifically in both locations.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in learning more, feel free to apply at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;root.engineering&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;root.engineering&#x2F;</a> or email us directly at enghiring@joinroot.com, and either Tim or Chris will respond to you promptly.')
