Often, the unfortunate outcomes you describe aren&#x27;t due to overt willful interest in actively destroying the assets of people of color. It&#x27;s very often even more insidious and subtle than that and to some degree grows out of blind spots rather than willful destruction.<p>My remark is not an exaggeration. One* cannot claim this massacre was some unfortunate oversight.<p>Those distinctions need to be made for two reasons:<p>1. It is important to make it crystal clear that racism absolutely involves malice and isn&#x27;t simply a case of &quot;Well, we didn&#x27;t realize it was impacting people that way or we surely would have done something else because we are good-hearted people.&quot;<p>2. In cases where it does involve some degree of obliviousness, this must be acknowledged because in cases where people are just blindly going along with historical patterns and genuinely don&#x27;t wish to harm anyone, educating them that people are, in fact, harmed even if you didn&#x27;t intend to do harm is the best remedy.<p>Both points are essential information for finding a path forward. Taking only one of those points and overgeneralizing it actively undermines efforts to find real solutions.<p>* Changed &quot;you&quot; to one&quot; for the sake of clarity. Apologies for the confusion.')
