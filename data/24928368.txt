But then, I&#x27;m not a professional so I&#x27;m happy to be corrected. (Edit: Of course as a professional I&#x27;m even more happy to be corrected, that&#x27;s how you become less wrong!)<p>Edit: I was basing my understanding of &quot;what psychologists are actually saying&quot; on a bunch of kids books we have which have a page at the back written by psychologists (I haven&#x27;t checked their credentials) which lines up with my &#x27;unfounded optimism&#x27; definition of &#x27;good self esteem&#x27;. I know there are other interpretations once you get to legitimate psychology and stoicism actually seems fairly effective.')
