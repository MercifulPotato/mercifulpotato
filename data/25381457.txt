Norms don’t work if you only try to enforce them against the other team. Democrats eroded norms about acknowledging the legitimacy of elections in 2000, 2004, and 2016. What Trump is doing is much worse, but Democrats primed the public to believe it.<p>Look at what Democrats said just this year. Nadler asserted that if he wasn’t impeached, Trump would “rig the 2020 election.” They ran with a conspiracy theory that USPS would manipulate mail delivery to delay mail in votes. Numerous outlets ran articles on voting machine security and how easy they are to hack. You don’t think all this primed voters to believe our elections were easily manipulated? If you consistently piss in the pool, it’s fair to complain when someone takes a dump in it. Like yes, I’ll acknowledge it’s not the same. Yes, one is worse! But my sympathy is minimal.<p>Separate rant: As to Republicans being a “minority party”—Democrats thinking they’re the “silent majority” is a misperception that causes them to overplay their hand. They imagine that if only we had a popular vote, or higher turnout, or whatever, they’d win decisive majorities. We just had an election with mass mail-in voting with historically high turnout and Trump <i>increased</i> his percentage share of the vote from 2016. If you look at the data, Biden’s margin is built on (1) Republican-leaning suburbs in Phoenix, Atlanta, etc. (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;gop-women-who-ditched-their-party-vote-democrat&#x2F;616987" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;11&#x2F;gop-wom...</a>). Mine went +14 for Biden, but +38 for Hogan. (2) the collapse of the third party vote from over 5% to about 2% (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;21561230&#x2F;libertarian-party-third-party-2020-election" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vox.com&#x2F;21561230&#x2F;libertarian-party-third-party-2...</a>). And (3) Trump suppressing his own vote by telling his supporters not to vote by mail in an election conducted primarily by mail: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;JustinGrayWSB&#x2F;status&#x2F;1328782492913033219?s=20" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;JustinGrayWSB&#x2F;status&#x2F;1328782492913033219...</a><p>When you’re the liberal party and you have to cash in Romney Republicans and Gary Johnson voters—while running against Donald Trump of all people—how smug can you possibly be?<p>It’s also worth looking down ballot. Despite historic turnout and the easiest voting ever, Republicans held Democrats to a razor thin House majority. They’ll finish within a couple of points in the Congressional popular vote. They regularly win the Congressional popular vote outright (in 2016 by a point, in 2014 by 6 points, in 2010 by 8 points). If we had a parliamentary system like other countries, that would allow them to regularly form the cabinet executive branch and select the prime minister.<p>Also, while I’m ranting, if we had a “popular vote” like France, Clinton never would have won because it would have gone to a run-off with Perot eliminated. And Trump may still have won, in a run-off with Johnson and McMullin eliminated.')
