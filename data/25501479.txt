Iâ€™ve been writing code, starting with C, since 95. Mostly Python these days, but I try to make it clear and easy read. Mostly for myself. Future me is always happy when I take the time to comment my overarching goals for a piece of code and make it clean and well composed with enough, but not too many, functions.')
