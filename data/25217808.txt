Mass, spin, charge among others, depending on what weâ€™re talking about. If those properties match up with expectation, we consider this strong support of the theoretical formalism.<p>We can even measure more fancy stuff like virtual loop contribution to transition processes. This mostly works by measuring the transition probabilities with extreme precision, and then comparing it with higher-order theoretical predictions of the probabilities.')
