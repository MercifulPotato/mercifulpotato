I just don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll ever have functioning legal frameworks for that.<p>Basically: freedom of speech and expression will only apply to what you do with your mouth, in the street. &quot;Speech at scale&quot;, such as social media, will simply not be able to be included in it.<p>That might seem like a pessimistic take, but I don&#x27;t think it is. The alternative is democratically elected governments taking a greater role in social media, effectively claiming services to be part of the substrate of society (Twitter, Streets...). I don&#x27;t like that idea either. The lesser evil seems like the first scenario: freedom of speech not including at scale.')
