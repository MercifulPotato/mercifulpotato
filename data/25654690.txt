But both seem to be prone to unexpected setbacks, delivering late or never. My only outright scam was a &quot;thing&quot;, but quite a few of these have gone silent. Transparency in these projects was never great, but maybe that has improved since I stopped backing them?<p>Of the board games: I enjoyed half and still have 3. Honestly, this seems to be in line with the games I try in general. Kickstarter has practically become an official business model for the industry, with established companies using it regularly. The result is that there is a high standard even for amateur projects in terms of understanding the game they&#x27;re making, having artists lined up, having reasonable ideas of manufacturing&#x2F;shipping costs and delays, posting regular updates, etc.<p>Currently I mostly back RPG books. They&#x27;re often useful and inspiring for my own games and I&#x27;ve found quite a few systems that I&#x27;m keen to try (fingers crossed, 2021 will let that happen). About half of these result in a product I like and keep, and for the rest... Almost everyone running these projects is an RPG nerd like me, looking for an excuse to take their crazy idea as far as they can. I can get behind that. Transparency on these projects has usually been very good.<p>On lateness: every project has been late, except the ones that were basically just a preorder for something already in progress. The best you can hope for is regular updates that are transparent about progress and setbacks.')
