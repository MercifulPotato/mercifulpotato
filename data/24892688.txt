Item(by='johnsonjo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603684321, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24892677, text='A lot of tech book publishers actually release their books from their own websites in DRM free formats like epub, such as Manning, No Starch Press and often O&#x27;Reilly if you get them from the right place (humblebundle.com generally is a pretty good source for that if you&#x27;re patient.) Sadly O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s website has stopped selling books directly from their website and instead you have to get them from somewhere else (but before they were DRM free).')
