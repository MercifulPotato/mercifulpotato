At a minimum, I wake up every morning amazed that I&#x27;m getting paid to play with and figure things out on a computer. It&#x27;s a long ways from when I was a barely a teenager and my dad made me help him split firewood (he sold) using the hydraulic splitter or pick and sort oysters (he also sold in season), or the other random jobs I had until my first programming job in college.<p>And you&#x27;re also right about there being some complexity in all jobs. I could go on about all the important lessons I learned at my various jobs that have helped me my entire career.')
