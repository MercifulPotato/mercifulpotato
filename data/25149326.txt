I don&#x27;t necessarily endorse it, but from what I&#x27;ve read on the article and the announcement it seems that it has rewritten the terms to clarify that YouTube&#x2F;Google can monetise videos outside of YPP programme (and some other changes that are not in scope of the argument), so is this just net zero?<p>(Also: if a YPP creator has decided to not monetize a video, the video gets <i>less</i> ads which its proceeds goes directly to Google. This has been the status quo at least 2016(?)ish so this might be just to clarify that this indeed happens.)<p>Edit: I&#x27;ve realised that many of you are using some sort of ad-blocker, so you might not felt the changes when it was (silently) rolled out years ago, but this is from my experience using YouTube on devices which I cannot install an ad-blocker (like in some instructional videos for certain robots which some companies decided to use YouTube for).')
