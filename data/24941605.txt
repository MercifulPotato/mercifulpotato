But technology has so many other shapes, even in the field of CS. Would working on software to simulate and visualise atmospheric phenomenons be working toward more problems ? Working on optimizing the use of an electric grid ?\nEven 5G and autonomous cars are not problematic by themselves, its how we plan to make, deploy and use those technologies that will lead to even more troubles.\nTo sum up my view, I think that tech is not the problem, but tech providers and users are.')
