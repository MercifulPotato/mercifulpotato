They were using historical figures for PV and for on-shore and off-shore wind, and using the LCOE method which IIRC uses &quot;overnight construction&quot; assumptions.)<p>There is also the point that a higher investment hurdle rate is appropriate for fusion as it&#x27;s an untried risky technology.<p>Another paper points out that fusion economics are particularly sensitive to unplanned outages. (More modular and dispersed generation methods are of course less sensitive than gas or coal to outages, e.g. plane crash.)<p>So, fusion had its chance. Now we have cheaper alternatives, which are getting cheaper still.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0360544218305395" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S036054421...</a>  Approximation of the economy of fusion energy')
