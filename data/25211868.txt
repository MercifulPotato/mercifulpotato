Employees, particularly new employees, shouldn&#x27;t be expected to &#x27;hit the ground running&#x27; in every circumstance. It is unfair to the employee to have no expectation of on-the-job training.<p>Morale is an issue. The constant understaffing and overwork of current employment is often much more taxing than a bad hire. Yes, a bad hire can have a spoiler effect but in those circumstances it is worth the paperwork to remove them. I argue that an indecisive manager who refuses to do the work necessary to manage and staff for the need is far more detrimental than one lower level employee.<p>Employment regulations protect employees, not the company, and for good reason. Removing them is not going to make it easier for job-seekers, it just makes it easier to exploit them.')
