But using a PRNG also doesn&#x27;t reduce the entropy it already has. You only lose entropy by transmitting information, and the entropy lost is equal to the information transmitted.<p>For example, if an adversary with perfect analytical ability learns the outcome of a simulated dice roll you performed using &#x2F;dev&#x2F;random, they gain logâ‚‚(6) bits of information and you lose the same amount of entropy, irrespective of how many bits you actually read from &#x2F;dev&#x2F;random.')
