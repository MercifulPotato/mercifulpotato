A director shouted a homophobic slur at a subordinate during a heated confrontation in a meeting. Another manager threatened to beat an underperforming employee’s head in with a baseball bat.<p>That the article describes this situation as a &quot;missed out opportunity&quot; just means that the writer personal goals are antagonistic to mine. And, to ask people to pursue such a situation seems quite bad advice from a mental health perspective.')
