Thanks for sticking to the facts too. But are you rooting for more people to die to further your political agenda? Thats morbid. Thats what Republicans did when Obama was in office BTW, which arguably caused a slower, more painful and incomplete recovery from the great recession than was necessary. I was disgusted voters rewarded that behavior by giving Trump the win in 2016. Republicans legit STOLE 2 supreme court seats too and voters almost rewarded them again in 2020. That&#x27;s put me firmly in the anti-Republican independent camp, if such a camp exists')
