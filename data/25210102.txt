You can&#x27;t store billions of dollars without the price of Bitcoin being high. More and more people are using it to store and transfer value.<p>Why? Because as a currency it&#x27;s good. There&#x27;s nothing like it and I challenge you to give me an alternative.<p>Here&#x27;s the requirements you need to meet -<p>* Unable to be manipulated - this rules out most fiat currencies. The recent pandemic shows governments have no self control and will print trillions on a whim.<p>* Fast to transfer - I can send thousands of dollars worth \nof bitcoin around the world in under 30 minutes.  It takes days for ACH transfers. It takes hours for a wire transfer if you&#x27;re lucky.<p>* Cheap to transfer - Compared to wire transfers, transferring bitcoin is cheap.<p>* I can hold it - I can&#x27;t store large sums of cash or gold in my pocket (or even my house) safely. Large sums of bitcoin I can securely hold in my phone with my private keys backed up elsewhere.<p>* Open source - This entire system is out in the open for inspection. No company controls it or can mess with it.<p>* Battle tested - The fact that people have been trying to break Bitcoin for 10 years now and it still works gives people more confidence to use it as a store of value.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if it has no value to you. But it has a lot of value to myself and others. If you have an better way let&#x27;s hear it.')
