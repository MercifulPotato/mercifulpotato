I suspect that isn&#x27;t the case. Spam is always worthwhile to post because forum might change to remove the nofollow in future, a forum user might follow a link, and it&#x27;s not worth the effort bothering to check if a forum is providing &#x27;value&#x27; to the network. In other words, it&#x27;s easier to to spam everyone and hope some of it proves useful.')
