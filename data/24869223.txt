The reason that is important is because I feel like we’re talking about the same thing, just at different resolutions.  That idea is based on thinking of status as a combination of &lt;connections, culture, wealth&gt; or something of that nature, either accrued or inherited.<p>One could think of the “don’t mess up too badly” as “dad’s friends will still interact with me in public”, which is just a proxy for connections as you mentioned.<p>Going from low to high status is definitely made easier by leveraging high status individuals.  Lower, but not necessarily low, status is still expected, I think, as the son of the general still goes to West Point and proves themselves in lower-status roles like being a lieutenant - the gears are just greased to keep going.')
