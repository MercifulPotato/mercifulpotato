Item(by='Dem_Boys', descendants=None, kids=[25903486], score=None, time=1611584258, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25901777, text='&gt;  If those individuals got together and agreed that maximizing shareholder profit was no longer the common aim, the digital infrastructure could be different.<p>The article refers to &quot;those individuals&quot; as FAANG CEO&#x27;s.<p>This article&#x27;s stance that we just need big tech to forgo profits for the good of the people seems outrageous to me.  Yes I would love to see it happen but I know it would never happen.  Even if twitter, for example, made their algorithmic feed less addictive then that would just leave an opening for a competitor to come take market share.<p>Even if our government somehow mandated that big tech cannot tune their algorithms to consume the max amount of attention (&lt;- BTW I have no idea how that could be done) then how would it be regulated?  Open source code?  Government issued devices?   Also what happens with non-US companies, like tik-tok, that dont have to follow this &quot;be good&quot; principle?<p>This is just another vice created by technology that must be resisted by people in order to have a happy and balanced life.  Another good example is food.  Today&#x27;s food is so addictive processed that we must resist in order to be happy.  These vices did not previously exist.')
