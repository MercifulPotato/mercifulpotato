Python as well as you mentioned. From your other replies I see that you don&#x27;t agree that there is any ambiguity. That is fine with me, I don&#x27;t plan on trying to convince you. I lack the in-depth knowledge to be able to do that in a credible way anyway. I just note that the designers of newer languages seem to disagree with your conclusion.\n[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;golang.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;faq#inc_dec" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;golang.org&#x2F;doc&#x2F;faq#inc_dec</a>')
