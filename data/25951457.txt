Neither does the subject matter focus on a news aggregation site.<p>&gt; What if the free platform you are hosting is used by a ring of child molestors and pedophiles?<p>Guess what? The telephone network is used by &quot;rings of child molesters and pedophiles&quot;. And strangely enough, nobody expects the phone companies to &quot;deal with this&quot;. Same goes for a decentralized instant messaging and chat platform.<p>Also, the government and corporate opponents of privacy routinely inflate the prevalence of rings of supposed terrorists, pedophiles etc., because bringing them up  instills excessive fear and clouds our judgement. You write that you&#x27;re &quot;aware&quot; of this, but apparently you&#x27;re fine with it, as you&#x27;re making that the center of your argument.<p>&gt; Do you accept that freedom for all also means freedom for them?<p>Your question is phrased ambiguously, to manipulate us into believing that a free decentralized communications platform means that we agree that people are &quot;free&quot; to molest children, whatever that means.<p>Well, you should be free to pick up the phone and call whichever number you like, without having to first prove you&#x27;re not a child molester. And the same goes for putting up some flyer on a neighborhood notice board. And for putting up a website.<p>&gt; One where the discussions enrich... or rather the lawless zone...<p>If-by-whiskey: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;If-by-whiskey" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;If-by-whiskey</a>')
