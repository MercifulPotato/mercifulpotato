But Morehead&#x27;s review wasn&#x27;t of the M1 processor or architecture as a technology. It was a review of the 13&quot; M1 MacBook Pro as an end-user device.<p>Moorhead&#x27;s review literally contains this sentence:<p>&gt; The new M1 processor is impressive, but far from perfect- it has many warts, that nearly nobody is discussing.<p>He then proceeds to describe not warts of the M1 as a processor, but rather warts of the 3rd party software ecosystem. I think overall the review is fine and not in bad faith, but it&#x27;s easy to see how people are latching on to that sentence. If he were honest about making it a review about the overall product experience, rather than the silicon, he wouldn&#x27;t need to write that sentence.')
