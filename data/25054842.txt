The loss of tactile feedback is a fair one, and admittedly removing the escape key was a terrible idea. I recently upgraded to a machine with a touchbar, learned quickly why the <i>default</i> settings are pretty bad, and then quickly found BTT and set it up. The touchbar is not a revolutionary innovation, but it definitely improves functionality in some cases, and it&#x27;s fun to mess with. Oh, and a button to &quot;toggle mic in zoom&quot; actually solves a real problem.<p>The people who complain about the touchbar functionality must not be putting any effort at all into it. I customize so many other things on my system, regardless of the OS. Why would a new hardware feature be any different?<p>I didn&#x27;t know about this GoldenChaos thing though, thanks for that.')
