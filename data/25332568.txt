Item(by='ojnabieoot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607352531, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25331788, text='Lots of problems with this superficial and cliche-ridden article... but I was particularly irked that Python was dismissed as being dynamically typed, yet Elixir was excused because of Dialyzer - first of all, what about mypy? Second of all, it&#x27;s not the same thing as actual static typing. I get it - they like Elixir. But feigning objectivity here is extremely irritating (and culminates a pattern throughout the article).<p>It is fine - or at least only somewhat stupid - to have an arbitrary ranking of programming languages, though things like &quot;no garbage collection is bad&quot; is obviously domain-dependent and the author should be upfront about that. But it&#x27;s extremely frustrating when people pin objective-seeming criteria on their personal preference with seemingly no hint of irony or self-awareness.')
