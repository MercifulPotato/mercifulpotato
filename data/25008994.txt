I hope folks don&#x27;t mind this being posted and wanted to be up front that I&#x27;m the author of inlets so here&#x27;s the disclaimer.<p>The idea here is to show a pattern for hybrid cloud, we are seeing more and more prospects wanting to do very similar - sometimes with K8s on the public end, and at other times with a VM in the cloud.<p>Hope you enjoy the tutorial, and you can find others on the site and in the docs for the OSS inlets tooling too.')
