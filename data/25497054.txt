I paid 3k for my shares when I left, made 3k net. Not bad.<p>2 - Company was self-funded when I left, paid about 2k for shares. When they took external investment years later, I needed to sell my shares, net 6k.<p>3 - Company I was still working for was acquired. I&#x27;m acquihired at a better salary &amp; benefits, plus retention bonus after a year. Exercised my options at 4k to net 55k.<p>I&#x27;ve had a run of good luck, and, in each case, the cost to exercise my options was one I could afford to lose if things turned. If it comes up again, I&#x27;ll have to evaluate where I am at that time. Each event is unique, you have to judge your specific circumstances.')
