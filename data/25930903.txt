Likely, you need to install a 3rd party app first then you need to feed that app your CC information and then you need to tell that app a station number to activate.  You better hope there&#x27;s good internet because if there&#x27;s not you might not be able to charge.<p>Further, for stations that do take a credit card or tap and pay.   It&#x27;s like 50&#x2F;50 on whether or not it will actually go through.  Usually it takes a crazy long time to actually validate the card number before charging (Like, I&#x27;ve waited 10 minutes before for a charge to start!).')
