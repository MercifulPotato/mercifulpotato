They can be revocable or irrevocable.<p>Not: Gratuitous (not contract) licenses are, by strong legal precedent, revocable by notice at will by the licensor. The content and context of the license (including the statement that it is irrevocable) may impact the effect given to revocation due to other legal principles, particularly promissory estoppel, but those are separate from revocability.')
