There are screen technologies that adjust color representation and brightness together, to make it possible for a dimmer screen to <i>look</i> brighter (or show up better in brighter light) by sacrificing some color range in a mostly imperceptible range. If you&#x27;re showing off a technology like that to improve battery life, it&#x27;s <i>completely</i> reasonable to compare screens at different absolute brightnesses in nits. But if you&#x27;re comparing generations of SoCs, you should be doing so with exactly the same screen brightness.')
