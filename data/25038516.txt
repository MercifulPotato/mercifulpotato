Item(by='alangibson', descendants=None, kids=[25039272], score=None, time=1604949178, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25038189, text='&gt; it&#x27;s just messy to speak in ethical absolutes about unpaid labor<p>I&#x27;m willing to go out on a limb and say that unpaid labor where the other side is profiting is definitely bad.<p>&gt; if it only applies to change requests and not the software itself.<p>I tried to break down why I think it is necessary to split these in the context of open source. I&#x27;ll try to refine that point in the future.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s also messy to focus on the economic value of change requests and ignore the economic value of the software itself.<p>Much remains to be said about the economic value of the software itself. That&#x27;s just not what I&#x27;m harping on right now.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s messy to be perfectly comfortable with the open source license, but later expect that any communication with the author about the software<p>I never said &#x27;any.&#x27; Change requests are a very specific thing in our industry.<p>&gt; should not fall under the terms of the license the author chose.<p>I don&#x27;t get that. Why would communication with the developer fall under a software license?<p>Edit: I think you might mean that, because the source code was free, it&#x27;s implied that the changes should be free. If so, that&#x27;s exactly the norm I want to change and also why I split up the offer of source code from change requests. Getting the source code free <i>should not</i> imply you get changes free for reasons I laid out elsewhere in this discussion.')
