The more you make, the less you pay Steam, but the thresholds are in the millions. If you make more than $50 million then Steam take 20% not 30%. I understand the reasoning; Steam want to keep some of the big publishers like Rockstar Games, PUBG Corp and EA happy and not so tempted to move to their own platform (or to Epic).<p>But if you&#x27;re a developer who isn&#x27;t making more than $50 million (like me!) you end up paying more than the enormous corporations. Unless you&#x27;re on the App Store, where it&#x27;s the opposite. It&#x27;s funny how the focus is different here.')
