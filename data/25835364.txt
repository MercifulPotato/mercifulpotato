Item(by='WoodenChair', descendants=None, kids=[25835959], score=None, time=1611075029, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25833667, text='The thing about all of these articles analyzing Intel&#x27;s problems is that nobody really knows the details of Intel&#x27;s &quot;problems&quot; because it comes down to just one &quot;problem&quot; that we have no insight into: node size. What failures happened in Intel&#x27;s engineering&#x2F;engineering management of its fabs that led to it getting stuck at 14 nm? Only the people in charge of Intel&#x27;s fabs know exactly what went wrong, and to my knowledge they&#x27;re not talking. If Intel had kept chugging along and got down to 10 nm years ago when they first said they would, and then 7 nm by now, it wouldn&#x27;t have any of these other problems. And we don&#x27;t know exactly why that didn&#x27;t happen.')
