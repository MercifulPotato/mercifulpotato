Even still, I share a great deal of values with most of the EU citizens and will oppose the formation of an actual unified European state until at least values like &quot;democracy&quot; and the trias politica are shared across the country.<p>Perhaps total denationalization is a nice end goal for humanity, but it&#x27;s unattainable as long as there are still significant groups in the world who don&#x27;t believe in things like &quot;women are equal to men&quot;.<p>I agree that connecting a nationality to words like &quot;true&quot; or &quot;proud to be a&quot; is often problematic, but you cannot ignore that there are differences between regions.  You can pretty clearly see the border of Scotland on a Brexit vote map, for example; all of Scotland was, on average, anti-Brexit, and most of England was, on average, pro-Brexit. Does that mean that all Scots are inherently pro-EU? Of course not. But erasing borders will change very little about the attachment and emotions people feel toward the bit of land they were born in.')
