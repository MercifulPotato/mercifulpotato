Item(by='AnIdiotOnTheNet', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611318084, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25870813, text='&gt; The delayed choice experiment is not a proof of concept of time travel.<p>That isn&#x27;t quite what I&#x27;m claiming. All I&#x27;m trying to say is that an effect that looks impossible without some kind of mind behind it (or magic) is a testable real thing. I don&#x27;t think we are disagreeing here: there is no magic.<p>That we do not know if time travel is possible[0] isn&#x27;t the point, the point is that <i>if it were</i> you wouldn&#x27;t need magic to explain the self-correction effect. Like the apparent &quot;magic&quot; of the delayed choice experiment, it would just be a fundamental property of the universe wherein events occur such that they form a stable time loop without the requirement of a mind that has to work out how to fix it that way. Like the particles in the experiment, they don&#x27;t &quot;know&quot; anything, it just always works out that way.<p>[0]I think the vast majority of physicists would admit to a strong suspicion that time travel is impossible, and in any model where time travel is possible it is regarded as a flaw.')
