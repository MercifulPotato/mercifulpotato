A year or so later, I built a computer from components I bought from NewEgg.  No distros worked because I had bought a SATA hard drive and the drivers were not built in.  Knoppix worked when booting from a CD though.  I &quot;wasted&quot; about 2 weeks of my life compiling a kernel that had SATA drivers built in (not kernel modules), using Gentoo.  Air quotes around &quot;wasted&quot; because I learned a lot and it gave me confidence.  But I still get a &quot;kernel panic&quot; in my stomach while installing linux.')
