Would love some feedback. Polycred is an evolution of the traditional disposable email generator, we’ve created an easy to use extension that allows you to generate email addresses directly on the websites you sign up to or log in with. Polycred will remember what generated emails belong to what websites so you can auto fill the generated emails on the login pages without having to remember them. If you’ve used LastPass before you’ll be very familiar with how this works.<p>However unlike traditional disposable email generators, we differ because we allow you to continue to seamlessly use your existing email inbox and provider by forwarding the emails to you. This means that if your email address is ever leaked by a company, not only will you know which company is responsible, but you can simply disable that email in Polycred with a single click and stop all current and future spammers instantly.<p>We also offer a “Pro” subscription for a small fee if you’d like some additional features, such as the ability to reply to emails directly from your personal inbox without ever leaking your identity. You can use the coupon code “POLYCREDLAUNCH1” for 50% off for the first year. The coupon expires in 30 days.')
