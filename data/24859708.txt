So I&#x27;m not surprised GM sold out of e-Hummers, they&#x27;re probably making all of six of them.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some MBA-speak that explains it, like keep supply low on halo vehicles to make the overall GM brand seem appealing. But the end result has been that I&#x27;ve owned one GM car about 30 years ago (Geo Prizm), and only because my parents worked for GM and got a substantial discount. Since then, I&#x27;ve just kind of given up on them. Even if they make something I like, they won&#x27;t make enough of them.')
