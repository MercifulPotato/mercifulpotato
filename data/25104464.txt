One cannot defend the exploitation of the poor, young kids, the disabled, the old, sent to western Europe and forced into begging, stealing or mugging locals and excuse that with &quot;cultural relativism&quot;.<p>These ones live in shanty towns, do not send their young children to school even in places where school is mandatory under 15 thus perpetuate the cycle of illiteracy. Is this what educated people here are defending? really? This kids aren&#x27;t even given a chance to succeed.<p>They have a tight sense of community and most of them never assimilate wherever they go and barely make effort to speak the local language. This isn&#x27;t a clich√© or a stereotype, that&#x27;s the reality of these gangs. There is next to 500 Roma slums around Paris, and we&#x27;re talking about people that have for EU citizenship. One cannot blame that situation on &quot;racism&quot;, this is 100% due to criminal behaviour and gangs trafficking vulnerable people.<p>Yes, all Roma aren&#x27;t like this, a lot of them work tough jobs in agriculture or construction. But criminal Roma networks are a reality nobody can deny.')
