In general, that recession was due to &quot;the housing crisis&quot;. The truth is more nuanced, but no one really looks deeper.<p>In April of 2020, we were on the verge of a recession. Everyone in charge - and I mean EVERYONE - remembered the Great Receasion of 2007&#x2F;08&#x2F;09 and that &quot;the housing crisis&quot; caused it. They ALSO knew that they would never live it down if &quot;they&quot; let a SECOND recession happen because of &quot;housing&quot; (whatever that means). They were OK with a recession for ANY reason - just NOT housing. Leaders all over the country accepted this: Democrats and Republicans in Congress worked quickly to pass a massive stimulus: Democrats didn&#x27;t ask for too much, Republicans didn&#x27;t cut too many corners. State Governors worked to approve unemployment. The CDC even prevented evictions.')
