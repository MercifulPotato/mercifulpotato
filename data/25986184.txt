A large proportion of Philosophy YouTube channels push forward arguments that are completely wild and outside the realm of experience of the normal citizen. Instead of philosophies that match real-life, these positions are instead supported by clever linguistic tricks and sophistry.<p>Take for example postmodernism, under which there can be no legitimate communication between people, and all arguments are power plays between the speakers. In such conditions it&#x27;s very easy to foment cynicism and conflict, since without the ability to communicate you will not be able to solve conflicts or grievances.')
