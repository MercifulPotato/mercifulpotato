Then, out of nowhere, we have touchscreens, cameras, maps, etc AND the power of a desktop machine, in a device that&#x27;s 1&#x2F;20th the size!</i><p>This wasn&#x27;t all of a sudden. In 1999, I already had a Palm PDA with touchscreen, pen and handwriting recognition. Digital cameras also existed, but were limited by storage size and power efficiency. Handheld color screens were a commodity since the Gameboy Color in 1998, and had existed since the Atari Lynx in 1989.<p>All of those technologies already existed before the iPhone came along. The limiting factor, before 2005, was silicon (transistor) density and power draw, which also saw gradual increases (Moore&#x27;s Law), not a leap. After 2005 or so, the processors became powerful enough to support a generic OS and that allowed all those technologies to be combined in a single device.')
