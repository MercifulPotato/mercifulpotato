I found an old email address of his and was trying to get into it just to reconnect since he died when I was a child. I get shouldn&#x27;t see other people&#x27;s stuff but still... would have been interesting as it was in the early 2000&#x27;s that he was around. Would have liked to see how his mind operated. Afterall he was a successful person (eg. operating a 60ft yacht for several years) and he also referred to the handover of Hong Kong to China 1997 in recent context. I unfortunately did not inherit&#x2F;learn that business savviness aspect. Seeing his emails would have been like time travel.<p>I had that Black Mirror thought to strip personality from data.')
