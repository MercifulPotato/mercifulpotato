Item(by='cmattoon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608683429, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25506542, text='IMO, most courses are shortcuts to actual experience, and there are no shortcuts to such things.\nOne might describe this as Education vs. Learning.<p>I do agree with the general-case argument that Education (vs Learning) is largely a filter for conformity (and socioeconomic status).<p>However, depending on the job (and company) you&#x27;re applying for, conformity may or may not be a desirable trait. I recall an after-dinner conversation with a CEO and some VC&#x27;s who said their favorite (illegal) interview question was &quot;Have you ever been arrested? If so, for what?&quot;. Answering in the negative or pleading the 5th was a hard pass (as were stupid and&#x2F;or egregious crimes) - they wanted people who were direct, honest, and took (calculated) risks.<p>The typical college student is conditioned to avoid risk - memorizing&#x2F;cheating&#x2F;etc to get the highest GPA, or at least making sure they get the credits required to graduate. Pick the project idea that you <i>know</i> you can do in a week (okay, a weekend), pick the uncontroversial&#x2F;uninteresting subject for your paper, etc. - just keep your head down and pass the class.<p>Often, this seems to translate into people who can&#x27;t program their way out of a FOR loop (or whatever the appropriate metaphor is for their field), solve new problems, or create new products. Inside-the-box thinking is great for passing standardized tests but somewhat less great for innovation.<p>At that point, your four-point-whatever GPA and the two semesters you spent as the Deputy Assistant Vice Co-President of the Student Navelgazing Council are really just reasons to mock you after you&#x27;ve left the interview. Maybe the HR department of a dusty institution with those upload-and-re-type-your-resume-style portals will care, but I&#x27;ve never met a recruiter, hiring manager, or staff engineer that did.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;ve met people without CS degrees who have clearly put in the effort and know what they&#x27;re talking about. A prior CTO once remarked that he had more respect for open source contributions and Coursera courses than he did for people who only had a degree to show. All a degree indicated, he said, was that their parents could afford to send them to college.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t mean to disparage extracurriculars with my above comment, but there&#x27;s a similar phenomenon there, too: people who sign up for some club or organization just to pad their resume are less impressive than people who have developed some degree of skill in non-trivial hobbies. It demonstrates that you&#x27;re capable of developing yourself on multiple levels rather than simply checking as many boxes as your parents will pay for.<p>TL;DR I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re far from naive if you&#x27;re striving to learn and understand rather than recite and recall. You might get fewer wins when you punch above your weight class, but you&#x27;ll be better in the end for doing it, especially when stacked up against people who never got off the metaphorical couch.')
