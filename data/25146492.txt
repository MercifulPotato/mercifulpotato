Windows) on it. If I was buying a PC for Windows or Linux, I&#x27;d buy something else.<p>My big concern is that in 10 years+ or so, it&#x27;s likely my Mac won&#x27;t be supported by Apple any more and there is a good chance it&#x27;ll still be running. Right now I&#x27;m pretty sure I can still bodge together a Linux distro to run on my old iMac G4 sitting in my garage.<p>IMO that is where Apple supporting booting alternative OSs is the most important bit. In 10 years (heck maybe 5 years), it&#x27;s likely many of the drivers and whatnot will have been reverse engineered and we&#x27;ll be able to boot up Linux and get another 10+ years out of it.')
