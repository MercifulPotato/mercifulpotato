The first bias is WP has no original research or source of knowledge, it clings to the &quot;notability&quot; of sources and is thus biases by publicly available information, or at least the scope of what its editors can reasonably validate. WP is at best a mirror of current mainstream opinion, an a neutral reporter of what most think, without reference to what&#x27;s actually true.')
