And even if we do, spreading the technology beyond the Arizona suburbs will require costly retrofits to add navigational hardware to existing roads. This is a non-starter in the post-pandemic age of austerity. Most state and local governments now struggle to merely maintain a much simpler, yet more fundamental technology for orienting both human and computer driversâ€”the painted markings that guide us along the pavement.</i><p>I don&#x27;t buy this argument. Yes, retro-fitting costs money, but even if one were to lay down guide wires next to every major road, the costs wouldn&#x27;t be as insurmountable as it is being painted here. The cost of digging up a ditch next to the road just isn&#x27;t that bad.<p>Furthermore, it&#x27;s not just costs to bear, but also benefits to weigh. If an AV capable road might get you from city to suburb, the suburb might just pay for the retrofit themselves.')
