Since it was a police officer killed, the matter was investigated and the mangled Ferrari found on the estate. One of the house hold staff came forward, claiming he was the driver. Apparently this is somewhat expected in these situations. But it did ruffle lots of feathers, so the poor heir had to go on the run for a while. But no worry, a few years later all charges are dropped because everyone has been compensated and it was a while ago, so lets just let bygones be bygones, and go back to dealing with the stress of being a member of Thailand&#x27;s 2nd wealthiest family.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.abc.net.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020-07-24&#x2F;thailand-charges-against-red-bull-heir-dropped&#x2F;12490788" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.abc.net.au&#x2F;news&#x2F;2020-07-24&#x2F;thailand-charges-agai...</a>')
