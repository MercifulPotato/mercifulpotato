It&#x27;s important to realize that copyright violation and plagiarism are two completely different concepts. A copyright violation is the non-fair, unauthorized use or distribution of copyright works, which is strictly, formally defined in terms of laws and licenses. On the other hand, plagiarism is a concept from academic ethics, namely, failing to give credit where credit is due. Often, one doesn&#x27;t have any legal requirement to give acknowledgement in many circumstances, and to what extent an acknowledgement should be given is not always formally defined, it can be personal and subjective. However, overall, it&#x27;s considered as an act of honesty and politeness. For example, using a result without credit can sometimes be considered acceptable if it&#x27;s well-known and has a low contextual importance. On the other hand, creating a derivative work based on previous experimental data or literary works without acknowledging its source is considered dishonest, even if it&#x27;s totally legal to do so when the work itself is published under CC-0.<p>&gt; <i>This commonly comes up in discussions where folks release software under a license that allows some bad behavior (like plagiarism) and then complain when that plagiarism happens. People inevitably respond with some low brow blame-the-victim nonsense, &quot;well, that&#x27;s what you get for using a license that allows it.&quot;</i><p>Statements like these reflect the confusion between license requirements and ethics. Yes, it&#x27;s completely legal to use an existing FOSS work without explicit acknowledgements. And sometimes, it may even be considered by people&#x2F;authors as totally reasonable (one certainly doesn&#x27;t expect every single program in existence to acknowledge GCC or clang, unless you are writing a complier based on the ideas found in them).<p>However, when a company releases a product that is substantially based on a FOSS project (or its idea) legally without giving explicit credit, it&#x27;s still all but fair for its authors to express their dissatisfaction on the lack of acknowledgement. Sure, the company has the legal right to do so, and not everyone will find that it&#x27;s problematic. Regardless, it&#x27;s also certain that it will be criticized by many members of the public as being unfriendly to developers, and I think the existence of such public criticisms is not less reasonable than the act of using something without acknowledgement (read: use without acknowledgement in the way you want, and get criticized in the way we expect).<p>Giving credit is not fully a legal matter, and I don&#x27;t think attempting to codify all the requirements of acknowledgement in a bunch of software license is the right way to go. What we need is probably an informal code of conduct on attribution in the software industry.')
