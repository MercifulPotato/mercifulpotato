It&#x27;s an established technology. It seems hydrogen trains are a cheap excuse for places where infrastructure is lacking and train tracks haven&#x27;t been electrified. Except it&#x27;s not cheap, because physics dictates using hydrogen will always be much less efficient compared to direct electricity use, as it includes an additional conversion step.<p>I think developing hydrogen infrastructure is important for sectors where no other alternatives are available. For sectors were established technologies for electrifiation already exist - not so much.')
