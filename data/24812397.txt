Some examples:<p>- clicking a link to another reddit post from old.reddit.com takes you to reddit.com unless the poster made an effort to link old.reddit.com instead.  This was one of the most immediate and irritating issues I encountered with the introduction of the new UI.  I know there are browser extensions to address this.<p>- The image gallery UX on old.reddit.com is really terrible.  Returning from viewing a single image requires clicking on a not so obvious link that is difficult to use on mobile.  Why not just display all images at the same time in a column?<p>- Clicking a second time on an image from an image gallery opens the image in a new window.<p>- The &quot;play&quot; button that must be pressed to view some images is equally difficult to use on a mobile device and isn&#x27;t really obvious to an end user.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are more examples but these are the recent things that seem to have appeared after rolling out the new UI.  I&#x27;m sure there is no real malice behind it other than not wanting to spend any resources competing against the objective of pushing mobile users to use the mobile app instead.  The new UI is extremely aggressive about pushing users to the mobile app.  Being lazy about the UX on old.reddit.com is almost as effective, if not more.')
