It&#x27;s about 20,000 in the other direction.  Of course, EU has about 1.5x the population of the US, so it&#x27;s more like double the rate of immigration, not triple.<p>&gt; triple the money, quadruple the life costs<p>My short experiences living in Germany and the UK each seemed more expensive, denominated in dollars, than here, one of the highest cost of living regions in the US.')
