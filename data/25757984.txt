Out of all aggregators (what this is called), Plaid is by far the most open and privacy-forward.<p>First, they&#x27;re transparent about being a 3rd party that&#x27;s part of the flow (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plaid.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-all-new-plaid-link&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plaid.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-all-new-plaid-link&#x2F;</a>). It&#x27;s clear it&#x27;s Plaid, they use neutral colors and not the bank&#x27;s, etc. They have a portal where you can manage your data (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.plaid.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;my.plaid.com&#x2F;</a>).<p>Second, they are very open about not selling data (unlike most of the their competitors). It&#x27;s in their terms and their website (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plaid.com&#x2F;how-we-handle-data&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plaid.com&#x2F;how-we-handle-data&#x2F;</a>). I guess that could change, but from working with them I know it&#x27;s part of their positioning so I&#x27;d be surprised if that changed.<p>Third, they&#x27;ve announced bank integrations and afaik they&#x27;re moving to OAuth where the banks support it (I&#x27;ve seen this in the wild, but can&#x27;t replicate right now). The key here is where banks support it. I think you have to look at the historical context: the banks do not want you to own your data as a consumer. They don&#x27;t want fintech apps to exist. Having talked to banks about integrating directly with them, it&#x27;s onerous and only the big players can do it. Plaid&#x27;s fighting the good fight for fintech startups.<p>But yeah it&#x27;s a less-than-ideal solution and it sucks that it doesn&#x27;t work without creds flowing through and it&#x27;s not clear regulators or banks will work to make it better. That sucks. I just think bashing on Plaid here is one-sided.<p>(throwaway account because I work in fintech)')
