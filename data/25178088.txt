They literally have a standardized script to read to the kids. Things like drag and drop icons and stuff on an already open source website code.org. They do not teach anything. They just tell the kid what to do and make them feel that its done by them.<p>&gt;1:1 tutoring can be highly effective, creating a 2 sigma improvement.<p>Agreed, they do, but not when majority of  teachers they recruit don&#x27;t even need to know coding to teach coding. Some teachers are literally housewives trying to make an income during this pandemic teaching coding without knowing anything remotely related to computers. I don&#x27;t think circumstances like these will create a 2-sigma improvements in students. ;)')
