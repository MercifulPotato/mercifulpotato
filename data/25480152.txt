I can imagine the difficulties (selling your assets, taking your fortune, figuring out the new kingdom, wars and instability, etc...). This is no longer an issue with city-states like Dubai or Panama; and the fact that your wealth is floating online on some stocks, banks, bitcoin, derivatives, or real-estate scattered around the world.<p>This doesn&#x27;t concern the average joe, however. Which is why he continues to carry most of the tax bill and is cash-strapped.<p>California issue, however, is not the rich are greedy; but that its government is corrupt and inefficient. Raising taxes doesn&#x27;t help but only grow the corrupt bureaucracy.')
