I would argue that that is the worse possible way to do it:<p>* Increased bureaucracy (why not add a 0.1% to an existing tax?)<p>* Regressive taxation (you pay the same amount regardless of your income; if you used the income tax, you would distribute it more fairly)<p>* No market shaping (you could instead fund it with a tax on, say, TV ads for high-calories sodas, or whatever as a society you decide should not be forbidden but discouraged)')
