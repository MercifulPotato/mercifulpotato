If it means &quot;make more short term profit&quot;, then yes, they can do that by selling people&#x27;s data. But if it means &quot;make long-term sustainable earnings&quot;, that&#x27;s different; I&#x27;m not sure Sonos selling people&#x27;s data does anything to help them vs. the competition in the long term. It might be that they don&#x27;t care about the long term--that the owners of the company simply want to extract as much short term profit as possible and then get out. If that&#x27;s true, IMO it&#x27;s sad.')
