Think in terms of realtime control systems, building reliable and performant stuff (reliability to differentiate from competition), etc.<p>Never think of moving as rebooting your career. Always start with mindset of building on top of what you know -- always move forward, not backward.<p>A little change in mindset goes a long way.')
