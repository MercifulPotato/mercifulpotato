After moving to the U.S. and going to 6th grade, I coasted for three years.<p>Think about it! Three whole fucking years that my math education was at a complete standstill, because I had already covered that material by the time I was 10!<p>I was not a star student in the USSR! I want to an average city school and got decent grades.<p>The biggest challenge of math education in the U.S. is unified material designed for the 99%.<p>If you are not tutoring and home-schooling, you&#x27;re doing your child disservice and setting them up for a huge disadvantage.<p>(Russian education is nowhere near as good anymore, but most of the world is not sitting still.)')
