You need to send classical information over the wire, but you&#x27;re also sending photonic qubits thru <i>fiber</i>, just not as a communication method. The fiber is how you get the entangled qubit to the other side of the network (entangled qubits are generated together). But again, this is <i>not</i> how you are communicating information. Technically this doesn&#x27;t need to happen over fiber, you just need to somehow have entangled qubits in two separate locations, and obviously if we&#x27;re talking about entangled photons, fiber is probably the best way to separate them.<p>Information is communicated once the entangled photon has reached the other side of the network, at which point a measurement at one end of the network is made and communicated (classically). Once again though, the purpose of the classical bits is not actually to send information, but rather because any measurement of one part of the entangled system results in its collapse (Copenhagen interpretation), and thus a collapse of the entangled quantum system as a whole. So if you have a quantum computer doing some calculation with qubits and those qubits have been entangled with others at the other side of the network, you can perform measurements on the qubits at one end and this will collapse the qubits at the other end. This would not be possible to do as you&#x27;d expect from classic digital stuff, where you can just send the info over the wire.<p>The distance is limited because of fidelity loss in fiber - you actually need your single photonic qubit (entangled with another qubit at the source) to make it from one end of the network to the other. In order to extend the range you can use quantum repeaters, which are effectively just a sequence of entanglements.<p>As an aside, higher quality fiber made in microgravity (ZBLAN) could also help bring these transmission distances up.')
