They are specced as 180 degree, but from their normal center they can only rotate 90 degrees in either direction. Doesn&#x27;t matter, they are still capable of 180 degrees of revolution.<p>So, your parent comment was correct, owls can rotate their heads through 1 full revolution. If they could rotate their heads one revolution either direction, then they could rotate their heads 720 degrees.')
