Not nuclear weapons, not rogue states, not even asteroids. We could &quot;colonize&quot; an uninhabitable Earth more easily than any other planet. The fact that we could colonize a different planet makes us different from past species in mass extinction events.<p>That&#x27;s not to say we shouldn&#x27;t do it (though I personally would really like to get a chance to study Mars in its pristine state for a few centuries before we literally crap all over it). &quot;Advancement&quot; is a fine reason to go to space.<p>But the extinction argument doesn&#x27;t hold water to me, and that makes me suspicious. If it&#x27;s just a matter of increasing the urgency from the people who really want to go, I get that. I&#x27;d just like to be honest about it.')
