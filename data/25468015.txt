Once you&#x27;re there it can be hard to tell too unless you&#x27;re in a particular area or division or whatever -- part of the problem, lots of times, are vast differences in how different groups are treated or whatever, due to communication between and to different areas, biases, incompetence, whatever.<p>In my case my friends blew off what I was saying until I was leaving, and then for whatever reason when I was in the process started actually listening to what I had been telling them for the past several years. &quot;Wait... what??? You mean they do X, Y, Z? WTF?&quot; It didn&#x27;t matter that mutual friends had left, that they had lost 1&#x2F;3 of their employees in the past 3-4 years, that 90% of the people in my division had left, that they had surveys (buried in diversity reviews) showing that 50-60% of the remaining people were seriously thinking of leaving. The secret meetings, the lawsuits, you name it. It was always the same response from my friends: &quot;This is normal company politics everywhere.&quot; But it wasn&#x27;t.<p>What I wished is that I had been mentored more on how to leave to a different organization (I sort of left the field), with an explanation for why. But when you hear &quot;this is the same politics everywhere&quot; you kind of think &quot;ok this is what it&#x27;s like everywhere.&quot;<p>The thing is, sometimes it&#x27;s not the same everywhere. There are good places to work and bad places to work, and places that are good for some people and bad for others.<p>If it <i>is</i> bad everywhere (cf. Musk&#x27;s complaints about &quot;MBA-ization&quot; of America), then society needs to have a serious reflection on itself (maybe that&#x27;s the signal in the noise of US politics lately?).<p>FWIW, my experience <i>is</i> consistent with your bit about &quot;as long as you have a positive career path there&quot;. I think at some level that&#x27;s what prompted me to leave -- I got the sense that the reasons why some people were favored and others in the institution were not was all about weird purely personal factors, like who goes to who&#x27;s wedding etc. (Yes, I believe social factors are important, that it&#x27;s important to be cordial and genuinely friendly and positive and empathetic... but there&#x27;s a point where all of that normal &quot;being a good person and colleague&quot; doesn&#x27;t cut it anymore, and might actually be a detriment).')
