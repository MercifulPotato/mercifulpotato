Item(by='jfengel', descendants=None, kids=[25473300], score=None, time=1608332888, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25473159, text='My theater troupe (www.rudemechanicals.com) has never done Cymbelline -- the only play we haven&#x27;t done. We had it on our schedule to be performed next month, but obviously that didn&#x27;t happen.<p>I directed Pericles myself, and it was actually a hoot, albeit with a cheat. The plot is such a mess that I literally put the two writers, Shakespeare and Wilkins, on stage, and pretended that the play&#x27;s bizarre plot twists were the result of the two fighting over control.<p>Our Winter&#x27;s Tale was less of a farce. We set it in the 1960s, with the Bohemians as &quot;bohemians&quot;. It was lovely -- still not anybody&#x27;s favorite Shakespeare play, but a worthy project.<p>We&#x27;re doing Zoom shows to keep ourselves occupied until we can get back on stage. And when we do I&#x27;ll finally get to do a version of Midsummer I&#x27;ve been prepping for years, lit mostly with black lights. It&#x27;ll be beautiful. (I&#x27;ve directed it twice before, and my troupe has done it several other times as well. Audiences do love that play.)')
