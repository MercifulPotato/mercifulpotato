I majored in philosophy, still read philosophy (both ancient and modern academic), and have never encountered anyone saying that classification of things is a violent act.<p>Foucault, Irigaray, Rorty, and Butler to name a few.<p>These thinkers believe that distinctions are bad, that the borders between things should be dissolved, that concepts like rational-irrational, true-false, objective-subjective, man-woman are oppressive.<p>Chomsky is not radical in the sense I mean.  He&#x27;s a liberal who believes in progress, responsibility, knowledge, and the possibility of relations between people that are not coercive.  He&#x27;s just pessimistic about human relations as they exist today.  There&#x27;s a Chomsky-Foucault debate on youtube.  Chomsky sees a distinction between the responsible-irresponsible use of power and Foucault does not.  You can also look up the Habermas-Rorty debates.')
