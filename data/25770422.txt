Item(by='DoreenMichele', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610586692, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25770088, text='<i>HN just isn&#x27;t a racist or sexist system.</i><p>That&#x27;s debatable, but there&#x27;s probably nothing to be gained by debating it here and now.<p>It is the least worst thing I know in that regard, which is one of the reasons I hang here.<p>But my firsthand experience over the course of more than 11 years suggests that, yes, sexism is an issue here, though it certainly isn&#x27;t overt. The fact that it is subtler than usual actually makes it harder to root out.<p>Another reason I hang here is &quot;I&#x27;m too truthful to be good.&quot; and people here are willing to tolerate that personality defect. Unlike Metafilter and some other forums, I haven&#x27;t (yet) been banned for sometimes pointing out what I see when I&#x27;m sufficiently fed up and cranky and having a bad day and unable to keep erring on the side of giving people credit for their many virtues and I, thus, feel compelled to say something like &quot;...and, yet, I remain dirt fucking poor and no amount of virtue on my part of adding value or some shit -- like people say I should -- ever seems to remedy that.&quot;<p>To be clear, I count it as a tremendous virtue that so many people here are willing to tolerate my presence in spite of me being <i>too truthful to be good.</i> It gives me hope that HN will be the space in which the internet figures out how to do things better, in spite of all of us being human and having inherited so much awful crap from the past and the inherent challenges involved in redressing large-scale social injustices.<p>I don&#x27;t really care to discuss this further at the moment. I hope you have a great day in spite of making the egregious mistake of having spoken to me.')
