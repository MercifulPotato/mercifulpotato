They passed a bill that would effectively hamstring rideshare companies and other independent contractors while providing carve-outs for 50+ other businesses, and these companies are now using the process to pass a proposition that will undo this. Of course they are trying to do it in a way that maximally benefits them, but it needs to be borne in mind that they did not make the first blow. The assembly did.<p>Both Assembly Bills and Ballot Propositions are a part of California&#x27;s legislative framework. In fact Ballot Propositions are the purest expression of the will of the people, and hence supersede legislative action. Given how extensive lobbying is in the US, it&#x27;s not like assembly bills are pure and unsullied while Prop 22 is tainted by Uber&#x27;s blood money.<p>The problem in America is that instead of the government providing safety nets, affordable healthcare etc. to all its citizens, it forces these things onto an employer-employee relationship, with no regard for financial fundamentals.<p>CA is a giant state with no realistic public transport options for the vast majority of its population. Services like Uber and Lyft aren&#x27;t merely &#x27;luxuries&#x27; for its people, they provide a necessary service for many of them, without which their lives would not merely be inconvenienced but often be drastically affected.<p>It&#x27;s just not possible for Uber to be profitable while being affordable to a similar number of people and treating all its drivers as employees. The second and third order effects of these are all negative for the people of California.<p>Employment law should be about removing highly coercive situations, but other than that, adults should be allowed to provide a service in return of a payment without getting embroiled in byzantine regulatory requirements.')
