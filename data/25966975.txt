I can’t even work out where to start to guide you down a path where your “Understanding of both Law and Radio” might start to intersect with reality in 2021 society.

These days they are used for everything from global flight tracking like Flightradar24 up to some amazing things like passive radar tracking planes via reflections from powerful radio station transmitters.')
