They are a constantly reoccurring topic. Everyone wants something that&#x27;s &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;simple&quot; but this is at odds with having flexibility to handle more than one person&#x27;s favorite workflow. There&#x27;s endless discussion because there are endless solutions.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve used a number of static site generators and I ended up in the opposite direction. I needed a website where I could write posts and not have to worry about more than just writing and posting, no deployment, no plain text intermediate languages between me and the end result.<p>I ended up using Wordpress. I was already familiar with it, knew how to self-host it, and was comfortable modifying a theme to suit my purposes.<p>Writing and posting new articles is so much easier using rich text. I generally type up my post in Apple Notes first. Copying and posting to Wordpress saves most of the formatting. Inserting images is drag and drop.<p>Large numbers of good plugins meant it was easy to find something to implement features like having a click-through warning on 18+ posts. Install a plugin, configure it, and I&#x27;m done.<p>Wordpress works well for me, but a lot of programmers are rightfully horrified. Wordpress is popular and complex, which results in a long history of security issues requiring mitigation. It&#x27;s inefficient and needs caching. It needs to be backed up because everything is in a database, not plain text. As a result, it requires more systems knowledge than a static website.<p>Static site generators and applications like Wordpress are tools.<p>Everyone ultimately looks for a tool that works for them. My goal is to write posts, not fiddle endlessly. Other people love the fiddling.<p>So, if you’re looking to build and maintain a website, think about what’s important to you. What’s your skill set, interests, preferred workflow, and goals?')
