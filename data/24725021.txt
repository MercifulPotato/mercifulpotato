They have only turned into a mass market manufacturer in 2017. Shanghai where they could start fresh has very few of these problems. The Model Y rollout was early and much better the Model 3 already.<p>The argument that Tesla is not investing in improving quality is simply not true. Things like casting make far more exact parts and very repeatable. It also reduces 100s of parts, less variation, less manufacturing steps and thus mistakes.<p>They are investing in the most expensive paint shop you can buy in the market right now for their new factories and they just renovated the paint shop in Fremont (since then I have not heard of bad paint quality).<p>They defiantly need to do more but its unfair to say they are doing nothing.')
