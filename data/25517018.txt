I now feel like I have gained a certain level of mastery over CSS. And most of it had to do with a simple change of perspective.<p>Here&#x27;s an article I wrote as sort of a subset of the book, that covers a lot more about how you can truly start to get better at CSS, as a developer: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;planflow.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-to-get-better-at-css" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;planflow.dev&#x2F;blog&#x2F;how-to-get-better-at-css</a>.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;Debbg&#x2F;z823cp8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gumroad.com&#x2F;l&#x2F;Debbg&#x2F;z823cp8</a> (I&#x27;ve added a pre-order discount code to the book for those interested).')
