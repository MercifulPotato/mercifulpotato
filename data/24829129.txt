My current efforts are to prevent my current condition from developing into something chronic, though to do so I have to live like it <i>is</i> chronic for the foreseeable future.<p>For me, it&#x27;s mostly diet. No alcohol, no&#x2F;low dietary fats while trying to make sure I get enough B12, iron and protein as I&#x27;m anemic and my diet mostly rules out red meats now. And for pain, some codeine (or when things were&#x2F;are worse, Dilaudid) or acetaminophen or ibuprofen. That&#x27;s about it.<p>My focus is on what I have and what I want to do from here out. The initial circumstances nearly killed me, and that kind of thing is, cliche as it may be, but nevertheless, enough to alter one&#x27;s perspective.<p>In short, mine&#x27;s a case of dietary efforts to prevent an organ from failing and pain management. So I do that and get on with it, no more spinning the wheels. I feel good when I&#x27;m moving forward with something else.')
