A part of this saving can be claimed by the company that makes the app.<p>The rent difference between where you can have a restaurant vs where you can have just a kitchen in the same general area is huge in most places... so I think the business opportunity is real.<p>Now, the companies are competing to grab market share, and most restaurants still have the same restaurant kitchen, so we haven&#x27;t seen those changes, but I think it&#x27;s just a matter of time.')
