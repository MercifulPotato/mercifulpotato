I mean, I watch netflix, but haven&#x27;t ever had a cable subscription, and while I have a digital antena, I pretty much never use it. Visiting a home where the TV is on constantly is shocking, with all the ads and the viewpoints presented. It really shows how much the media fracturing is helping drive the political divide in the country too. I can&#x27;t really imagine having those messages constantly pounded into my head.')
