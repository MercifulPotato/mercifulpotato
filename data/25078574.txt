Any Camera lens effects, lens flare, bokeh is just simulated off of the very simple pin-hole model. The method in Lentil appears to be actually trying to simulate the ray bounces internal to the camera lenses via the geometry from patent information. I am not an expert on optics, but from what I know about modern lens design are these elements are coated to change reflection and designed to prevent optical problems that don&#x27;t exist in most computer renders (Chromatic Aberration). My initial take is this simulation incorrectly solves a problem that most users rendering things have no interest in even dealing with. Computer rendering has moved into this simulating the physical world but without asking why, in many rendering cases you do not want a camera that behaves like the physical world, you want it to behave better and with less control.')
