We could use our iPhone to play to the stereo pair from any app. But on the Mac, they disallow this. You can&#x27;t even get them to both play the same audio â€” you have to choose one of them to play and the other to sit silent. This is ridiculous.<p>I am about to get a Sonos soundbar instead, which I will AirPlay to from whatever app&#x2F;application I please.')
