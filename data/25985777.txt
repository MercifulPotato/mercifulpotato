Having sufficient supply, and thus not being able to scalp for profit, would help. But something as simple as backorders and a queue would help too, as that would tamper demand and need to go to resellers. I think it is utterly absurd that in looking for a new AMD card in the US, there&#x27;s nowhere I can order and just wait. (One exception I found was Provantage, back from the ol&#x27; mail catalog days. I have an order with them but the product has since been removed from the website. I&#x27;m not holding my breath, but maybe one day.)')
