But you lost me after that.<p>I never asked for benefit to every single person perfectly equally.<p>For society, having the quite significant proportion of people who are renters and apartment dwellers getting more than an insignificant benefit from our own government should be a thing.<p>I am not asking for handouts. But for the handouts to those people wealthy enough (not rich per se but wealthy <i>enough</i>) to own their own standalone home to stop. And for that money to benefit all via society wide infrastructure such as a powerstation&#x2F;energy storage&#x2F;grid costs and upgrades.<p>It&#x27;d benefit the standalone homeowners still. But everyone else too.')
