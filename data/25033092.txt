Especially places like EDEKA, REWE, Kaufland in Germany.<p>Strawberries, berries, raspberries, carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers, salads, apples, pears, eggplants, etc. - shiny (do they wax them?), large, unified size, saturated color. Barely any taste, all watery. Grown in perfectly artificial industrial greenhouses.<p>Not a trace of soil on them, not a trace of imperfections. This is not how fruits and vegetables bought directly from a farmer on a market look and taste like.')
