Item(by='skohan', descendants=None, kids=[25306274], score=None, time=1607107186, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25305871, text='&gt; Why do you think US has so many big tech firms compared to Europe and other places? And why is there so much war between tech companies specifically in US?<p>Historical&#x2F;incidental reasons I suppose.  I think a lot of it has to do with a lot of the big tech giants, and a lot of VC being centered there (especially around SV specifically) so there is a lot of defensive hiring.  When facebook pays a developer $250k per year, it&#x27;s not only because of the value they&#x27;re providing facebook, but it&#x27;s because of the value they could provide a startup which could compete with facebook.  By driving up the price of talent, they price startups out of the market.<p>Startups in Europe have much less access to VC funding, so they are less of a threat.')
