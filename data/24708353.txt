Probably all be fine for a couple of years&#x2F;warranty period though and even then, does seem well serviceable design wise - though how far you can service outside warranty without Sony limitations will be the crux with all manufacturer hardware.  But servicing any paste&#x2F;clean-down does from the ease in the video seem to be within the reach of many due to the lack of any special tooling, let alone any hot glue gun shenanigan.  Also mindful how they made the side panels very user accessible, so maybe custom side-panels will be a market opening up more there - which is a nice touch.  Though I&#x27;d imagine it may become a thing that running with the panels of makes it better akin to how people are with dust covers upon speakers.<p>Though as with all first gen new consoles, they do tend to sit on the edge needing large cooling systems and then a couple of years later a revised (die shrink) update comes along and is now cooler, less power hungry, cheaper to make....same old story.  I also expect by then the need and use of liquid metal will be removed as that won&#x27;t be cheap cost wise either over conventional pastes&#x2F;pads.<p>Still, makes you wonder if the blue-ray drive with that shielding is more additional heat-sink and be interesting in seeing the temperature of a disc before and after playing for an hour.  But then, you just don&#x27;t get those kinda things done in testing<p>They have two dust traps with dedicated holes to vacuum out - covered in the video.')
