Security has been on a path of “layer more complexity over inherently insecure protocols” and it’s not going to stop any time soon because selling more products&#x2F;services is worth too much money.<p>There’s a lot of work and very little money in replacing outdated networking protocols with smarter&#x2F;more secure protocols. And there’s very little punishment (from customers or regulators) for suffering from massive cyber attacks, even if you expose the sensitive information of people who never even chose to give you their information (like Equifax). There’s no punishment or reputational damages from having your network traffic rerouted from a BGP attack. The consumer pays all the cost and they don’t even change their behavior after paying that cost, so why would companies bother?<p>Normally this is a situation where governments would step in and protect their citizens, but... well there’s just too much money on the line. So the programmers get the blame and the customers pay the price and security vendors make another $100 million and we do it all over again next month.')
