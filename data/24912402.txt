Item(by='jcoq', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603835749, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24911495, text='There are numerous advantages to having a complete categorical or type-theoretic foundations of mathematics, especially one as constructive as HoTT. The main advantages in my areas of research would be that proofs in &quot;higher-category theory&quot; would become less cumbersome. Many set-theoretic proofs in this area are non-informative because they are are messy and opaque. This is the real promise offered by any alternative theory or explanation: insight.<p>Besides the immediate usefulness: if &quot;all HoTT does is give a theory that&#x27;s mutually interpretable with ZFC&quot;, then holy shit what an accomplishment!<p>You seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of mathematical research. Most fields of research do nothing but &quot;give a theory that&#x27;s mutually interpretable&quot; with some other field, or at least did so initially.')
