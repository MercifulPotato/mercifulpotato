And possibly to an invitation only sub group. They will form its circle in Telegram or other means of media. A bit slower than they first appeared. But the power of internet meant that movement is still relatively quick. And with the power of Hyperlink, news and information spread just as fast as they are in a single group.<p>So the platform isn&#x27;t Facebook, Twitter or Youtube, It is <i>the</i> Internet. Or the name <i>information super highway</i> really describe the point better. Which sort of brings the question of regulating the internet but we wont go into that for now.<p>There is another point wroth mentioning. The making of decent fake news that cant be easily rebutted is far easier than the time and money required to spent for Fact Checking. Not to mention most people dont bother Fact Checking in the first place.<p>Having been on the other side of the fence with freedom of speech <i>taken</i> <i>away</i>, I agree with parent and grand parent;<p><i>Freedom of speech is of extremely high importance for any free society and should not be taken for granted</i><p><i>I think deplatforming is a bad solution to this problem.</i>')
