It&#x27;s math-based, so it deals with abstract concepts, not concrete hardware implementations.<p>0-based arrays are based on hardware implementations; 1-based arrays are based on abstract collections; you could make the argument that 0-based arrays are a leaky abstraction, but the question then becomes: what abstraction? C explicitly tried not to abstract away the underlying hardware.')
