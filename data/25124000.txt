I&#x27;m kind of scared to try, perhaps irrationally.  Rebasing seems to change commit relationships in a way that seems like it may be difficult to untangle if it later differs with someone else&#x27;s clone.<p>I would also like the ability to see a nicely curated set of changes.  This mostly exists in the diff tabs of a pull request.  If this were to be a first-class feature in git, it seems appropriate to be in some layer other than commits, but alas, that doesn&#x27;t exist.')
