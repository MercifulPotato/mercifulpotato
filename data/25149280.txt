So I assume one faction argues that everything should be double quoted because it&#x27;s does not matter if there&#x27;s interpolation or not, while the other group would rather only use double quotes when necessary, otherwise use single quotes.<p>I&#x27;m personally part of the second group simply because my linter forced it, but at the end of the day, it&#x27;s such a low impact we don&#x27;t really care.')
