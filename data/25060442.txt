The algorithm <i>as I see it</i> from the article is that the #1 popular app comes first. Of course Apple takes the top spot ... this is unfortunate winner-take-all promotion that in fact the entire software industry actually <i>wants</i> regardless of what they say or gripe about on medium (only upstarts complain, which ceases the instant they make it big).<p>So, then the #2-#k spots are apps by the same maker, which both serves to help the user discover other apps they mightn&#x27;t have otherwise searched for (promoting use and engagement, and the app ecosystem per se), and helps persist the winner-take-all business model. By only promoting apps by the same manufacturer it maintains some odd definition of relevance.<p>Then after a run of same-manufacturer apps, we get back to #k-#n organic results. The user can very obviously and very easily pick out the fact that up to #k is pushing discovery, and that below there are the results they wanted. It&#x27;s actually not a big deal (actively harmful) because of the irrelevance of the #2-#k results.<p>So, if they had bothered to include information on apps that Apple doesn&#x27;t compete against (instead of producing a 1-sided story), for which there is a manufacturer who produces a very wide variety of apps, I wonder if you&#x27;d see the same type of results. #1 result being their super popular app for the search in question, #2-#k being other (unrelated to the search) apps by the same producer, then #k-#n organic results. Clearly <i>most</i> app makers are one- or two-trick ponies so wouldn&#x27;t have search results like this. But surely there are some?<p>The point is, as written, it&#x27;s a hit piece.')
