Or set up a downvote bot as others suggested. There are some genuine weirdos here.<p>I haven&#x27;t been here for a few years (green account again, yay), but at least back then, moderators weren&#x27;t know for f...ng with anyone like that. Warning, maybe another warning, shadow ban and good bye.<p>At any rate, posting &quot;@moderators&quot; in the middle of a 4000 comment thread will get you nowhere. There is a contact email at the bottom if you want to ask for investigation.')
