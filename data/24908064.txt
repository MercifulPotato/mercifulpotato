An algorithm on FPGA needs to overcome the 20x worse architectural efficiency just to break even with a CPU or GPU.<p>The big benefit of having FPGA closely attached to CPU is that you can access the memory and internal buses quickly. Transferring stuff over PCIe hurts a lot. So you could make an argument for jobs using small work units requiring fast turnaround; CUDA kernels take milliseconds to launch.<p>I worked with some of the early Xeon+FPGA parts and there just wasn&#x27;t that much we could do with them. There wasn&#x27;t enough fabric to build anything meaningful and we had an abundance of CPU cores, so the best we could do was specialized I&#x2F;O accelerators.')
