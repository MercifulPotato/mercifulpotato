I suppose there&#x27;ll have to be some custom logic to deal with this kind of conflict? E.g.:<p>Alice creates change<p>A: add file &#x2F;README (identified by hash x)<p>Bob creates change<p>B: add file &#x2F;README (identified by hash y)\nC: adds a copyright header to README<p>Now Bob pulls from Alice, and wants Alice&#x27;s README contents (change A). Does pijul notice conflicts between A &amp; B? If Bob records a change resolving the conflict between A &amp; B by keeping A, will it be possible to apply C on top of this?')
