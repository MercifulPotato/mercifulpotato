There&#x27;s no _good_ reason for the US, with our economy and standing, to be ripping itself apart from within -- but, indeed we are.<p>Not only is China growing in power and influence, as you point out, it has been investing in American media and other industries.  They&#x27;re famous for playing their strategic game over a long span of time (the long game).<p>My pet theory is that Hollywood, Silicon Valley and the Left are thoroughly (and probably unwittingly) influenced by the infiltration, and are the medium for memes and messaging that divides us so much.  It&#x27;s as though we&#x27;re about to re-fight the Civil War.  China, the master that it is at cultural revolution and re-education, is playing a shrewd game.<p>I think they&#x27;re about to beat us cold by causing us to implode from within.  If so, it&#x27;s beyond sad -- but in terms of military strategy, a brilliantly played hand by President Xi and the CCP.')
