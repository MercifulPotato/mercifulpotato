A voucher ties you to spending it on more IKEA, and if enough people exchange their used furniture for vouchers instead of selling it themselves, it&#x27;ll discourage people from looking for the used furniture outside of IKEA - seeing second-hand IKEA furniture on sale you&#x27;ll be asking yourself whether it&#x27;s a lemon, because if it wasn&#x27;t, then presumably the owner would sell it back to IKEA instead.<p>&quot;Good business sense&quot; seems to rarely correlate with benefits for society these days, so it&#x27;s wise to be skeptical.')
