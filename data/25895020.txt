It isn’t that hard. NREL has a calculator you can use to estimate annual production, and it’s up to you to figure out what your utility’s rules on net metering are. South is the best aspect, West is next best, but this can be affected by local climate (e.g. frequent afternoon clouds). I think NREL factors climate.<p>If the net metering rules are favorable, skip the battery, forget entirely about your own consumption patterns, and just install as much as you can. The job is almost half fixed costs, so a bigger array pays back much faster.')
