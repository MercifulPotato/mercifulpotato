People will thank you for another &quot;mirror&quot;.<p>create a webpage which hosts existing docs (like man pages or software package documentation)? Totally fine as long as the docs are not modified (so any AUTHOR section is intact)<p>create another &quot;how to get started with ZZZ&quot; website, which is three quarter official docs? Ok as long as license allows remixing. Many do.<p>start a business which took over many project&#x27;s discussion forums and centralized information in one place? And then the said business gets millions from ads and kills many previous forums? People love this, some even say that Stack Overflow is &quot;the best thing that happened to programming&quot;<p>and so on... so for people used to open source model, news aggregators are totally fine, as long as content is not modified and there is a clear attribution. The GP comment mentions &quot;iframes&quot;, so both of those would have been true - it&#x27;s not like you can blank out author name from a third-party iframe.<p>Yes, the journalism is different and the open source rules do not apply to it. But hopefully  you can see where does this &quot;information wants to be free&quot; mindset is coming from.')
