We were on our way out when I saw a door that branched to a room of &quot;deep antiquities&quot;, or words to that effect.<p>One of the exhibits consisted of three gold bracelets - beautiful, modern designs that would have looked at home in a window at Tiffany&#x27;s. They had been excavated from strata with charcoal that dated at ~6,000 - 5,000 BC.<p>That single exhibit imbued in me a feeling of connection to our human past as much as has a lifetime of interest in history.')
