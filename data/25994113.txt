When first deployed, the user tenants (you can create any number of tenants to partition your data) are empty (you start with a clean slate) and ready for you to send any metrics&#x2F;logs to it. You also have to add your own dashboards to interpret the data you&#x27;ve sent.<p>Opstrace does ship with a &quot;system&quot; tenant designed for monitoring the Opstrace system itself. This tenant has built-in dashboards that we&#x27;ve designed to show you the health of the Opstrace system.<p>Incidentally, having sharable &quot;dashboards&quot; across people&#x2F;teams&#x2F;organizations is something we are also working on, so people don&#x27;t have to re-invent dashboards all the time.<p>We also have some guidelines for you to ingest metrics from Kubernetes clusters (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opstrace.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;guides&#x2F;user&#x2F;instrumenting-a-k8s-cluster" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opstrace.com&#x2F;docs&#x2F;guides&#x2F;user&#x2F;instrumenting-a-k8s-cl...</a>) and are building native cloud metrics collection.
