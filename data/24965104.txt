Why not rather<p><pre><code>  #!perl -w -T\n</code></pre>\nI know that not all environments support non-absolute paths to interpreters like this, but it feels to me that adding -S to env is a worse hack than allowing non-absolute paths to interpreters. I’m not sure which platforms support resolving the interpreter by PATH (actually, is supporting it a <i>shell</i> thing?), but it may even be more portable than -S at present, GNU coreutils env only having had it for two years. And even &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;env itself isn’t fully portable, as there are (old) platforms that have env at &#x2F;bin&#x2F;env and not &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;env.')
