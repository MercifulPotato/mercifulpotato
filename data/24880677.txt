And that is ok.<p>It is not. You don&#x27;t choose your parents, just the same way as you don&#x27;t get to choose your sex&#x2F;gender, race&#x2F;ethnicity or caste. If you take &quot;equal chances for everyone&quot; seriously, it is a primary concern for a society to allow children to prosper freely without being impeded by the misfortune or failings of their parents.<p>&gt; Sadly inheritance is looked down upon<p>We&#x27;re totally not on the same page. Not even close.<p>&gt; destroy a millenium of wisdom at their generation by not transmitting all the accumulated knowledge, generally due to some ideological dream (« my ancestors were all wrong! THIS is how you do it! I shall be free to roam! »)<p>I think it doesn&#x27;t take a millennium of wisdom to understand what&#x27;s needed to raise sane, mentally healthy children. Besides, this chain of knowledge-transfer gets interrupted constantly anyway, often due to war, accidents or addictions.<p>&gt; But the failed child is free to start again, marry, work a lot, study success, and he can give his child an excellent life, and his grandson can be CEO of a large company.<p>Why the grandson? Why not the son? (Or daughter, for what it&#x27;s worth.)')
