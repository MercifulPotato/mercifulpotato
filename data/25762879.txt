I&#x27;ve never had a colonoscopy but I had a gastroscopy two months ago and it was fully covered by our single payer insurance.<p>At the same time a friend of mine needed to have a gastroscopy and a colonoscopy. He decided to go the private route and also chose a full anesthesia. That costed him 30.000 serbian dinars (~255 euros).<p>So it seems to me that you could buy a return plane ticket to Serbia, stay here for a few days, do a colonoscopy here and it would still cost less than what you need to pay there.')
