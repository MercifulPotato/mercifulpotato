If the font is known and the size of the rendered text can be inferred that would limit the search space considerably.<p>I do a lot of screencast videos and what I typically do is put a black rectangle well past the point where my secret text really ends.<p>If my secret is:<p><pre><code>    mysupersecretpassword\n</code></pre>\nYou might end up seeing a black bar of:<p><pre><code>    ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n\n</code></pre>\nWhat I&#x27;m most afraid of is accidentally having literally 1 frame of video where the bar isn&#x27;t present. This is super easy to do if you&#x27;re just scrolling through a timeline while editing. You need to really dive in and move frame by frame to ensure you get everything. I usually extend it a few frames in either direction just to be safe too.')
