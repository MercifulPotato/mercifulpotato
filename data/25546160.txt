The excited oxygen if it can become hot enough will dissociate into atomic oxygen and conduct electricity. A gyrotron is a maser so it should be possible to tightly focus a 5mm wave. Gyrotrons have been reported to have output intensity up to 100 megawatts in a pulsed duration. Gyrotrons are fairly efficient compared to lasers and more selective to atmospheric oxygen.<p>A vessel in the stratosphere near the equator over the ocean could send a beam down to the ground at the same time it is being sent above. These are the artificial streamers we wish to create to connect the ground to the upper atmosphere. A massive flow of charge is directed into an expendable cartage containing a filament. Part of the strike energy goes into a solenoid that expels the filament plasma at near relativistic speeds. That is assuming 100 million joules could do that. The typical lightning strike is sometimes 5 gigajoules..<p>Going all the way to ground to the exosphere could draw a lot more than 100 megajoules even on a calm day.<p>Ok, the audacious thing here besides using lightning for propulsion is that this is a non chemical, non nuclear high payload fraction booster propulsion engine which can operate using carbon fiber filament cartridges and carrier planes.')
