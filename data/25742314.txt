WSB prides itself on buying ridiculously OTM weeklies and losing money, except this time there&#x27;s enough collective power to force market makers into buying the underlying and &quot;mooning&quot; is inevitable. Case and point, I bought the furthest OTM TSLA 1&#x2F;15 calls last Thursday and sold on Friday for nearly 1100% returns.<p>Market conditions right now are enabling boundless opportunity. It&#x27;s best to take advantage, before the SEC steps in and puts restrictions on retail options trading. &quot;Make hay while the sun shines&quot;')
