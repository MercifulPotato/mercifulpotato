Item(by='nerdponx', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607774872, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25397693, text='I often use a debugger (PDB++ or PuDB in Python) in my terminal, which I have open alongside Vim. But Vim historically has lacked strong IDE-like features, especially compared with Emacs.<p>This is starting to change with Neovim v0.5, currently only available on Git master building from source. But it&#x27;s worth building from source, because it&#x27;s a completely different text editor. Especially when you use a nice GUI frontend for it like Neovim-QT.<p>With the plugins nvim-lspconfig, nvim-treesitter, and nvim-dap, and plugin manager packer.nvim, you significantly close the gap between Neovim and Pycharm. I used to use Neovim for light duty programming and Pycharm for anything &quot;serious&quot;, but with v0.5 and the plugins above (among others) I just use Neovim for everything.<p>The downside is that, because it&#x27;s all very new and in alpha&#x2F;beta state, the documentation isn&#x27;t too thorough and things occasionally might break. But personally I haven&#x27;t had <i>any</i> trouble with breakage, and the default plugin configurations do mostly what I want with only minimal fiddling. And if you&#x27;re on Mac you don&#x27;t even have to download a tarball and read the build instructions, just `brew install --head neovim`.<p>Neovim v0.5 is leaving Vim in the dust IMO. It&#x27;s more like a Lua-powered LSP&#x2F;DAP&#x2F;Treesitter-based IDE engine than a text editor. Except it&#x27;s <i>also</i> just a text editor and it still opens in less than 1 second.')
