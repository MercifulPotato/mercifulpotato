It&#x27;s a compromise. You could simply not update if you&#x27;re worried about that.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve been considering switching away from Apple hardware, not because of hardware quality, but because of software.<p>I&#x27;m sure software updates long after your device&#x27;s release won&#x27;t be a concern with the competition. You probably simply won&#x27;t receive any.')
