PlayStation games are the most common example. If you&#x27;ve ever tried to copy XA audio or STR video files off of a PlayStation disc in Windows and wondered why you got an error, or why the files copied but were corrupted, that&#x27;s why. Your PC was only copying 2048 out of every 2352 bytes in each sector.<p>The ISO file format for discs can ONLY support 2048 bytes per sector. This is why groups like Redump use bin&#x2F;cue for anything that comes off of a CD. If you convert a bin&#x2F;cue to ISO, you are throwing away a little over 10% of the data in every sector.<p>If you want to learn more about this, read the specs for different types of CDs and CD-ROMs. It&#x27;s a big mess, and I think everyone is happier that the industry standardized down to fewer options in the DVD era.<p>[1] This is in addition to the physical-level redundant data encoded in the pits on the disc itself, but AFAIK almost nothing can read discs at that level.')
