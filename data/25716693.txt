You have to be re-integrated?<p>Have you spoken what you wrote out loud? Do you not understand the message that sends?<p>&gt;It is important for them to express their own concerns in their own words instead of just joining in various egomaniacs&#x27; power fantasies.<p>&gt;As much as they hate the far left, I believe that progressives such as Bernie and AOC are actually far better for them, and everyone they know, than the current GOP leadership.<p>Wow. The self-referential inconsistency is strong with this one. If you truly don&#x27;t grok that what you&#x27;re asserting the right needs re-education to address, and the same devotion you&#x27;re putting into Bernie and AOC are two sides of the same coin, you seriously need to reflect.<p>1) Causes. Not people. \n2) Just because they don&#x27;t like the stuff your team or tribe likes doesn&#x27;t make them any less of a human being. \n3) You win no friends and convince no one by demonizing that which they look up to, then copy pasting in what you like and telling them they&#x27;re sick for liking what they like. Yes, society is full of people who spend a great deal of energy doing just that; but it doesn&#x27;t mean everyone knows what they are doing when they are doing it. The beauty is that things just generally work out in spite of it because people don&#x27;t build up enough momentum to destabilize the overarching social structure. It&#x27;s like Brownian motion writ large. In the case when you&#x27;re doing it correctly, you must have put in the effort to understand what it is you&#x27;re replacing first, why it ended up there, then making your entire pitch readily communicable, and being willing to live and let live genuinely.\n4) It has taken really immersing myself in both liberal and conservative communities to realize how insane most people are, and how little work the average person puts into thinking out the consequences of policy direction. I&#x27;m amazed anything manages to stay working at all.')
