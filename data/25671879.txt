Think about being a liberal&#x2F;left-leaning gun owner and trying to participate in the vast majority of gun forums online.<p>I didn&#x27;t claim this either, and quite frankly your eagerness to put words in my mouth is telling. In any case I&#x27;d be surprised if most gun forums that aren&#x27;t on Reddit will just straight-up ban you for being liberal. But Reddit&#x27;s viewpoint-based moderation goes much deeper than in subreddits that have ancillary ties to politics; for example it&#x27;s very common for regional-based subreddits to have viewpoint-based discrimination that excises conservatives. If this is egregious enough it can cause schisms where you get left-wing&#x2F;right-wing versions of the same sub, but usually that doesn&#x27;t happen.')
