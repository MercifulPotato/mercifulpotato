Add the planes of JS and CSS though and it’s insanely easy to create non-accessible content.<p>Point 2: There is no education about accessibility tech. I don’t just mean about how to create accessible content, I mean about the devices themselves. I’m speaking for myself, I hardly know anything about these devices to be honest. Without an idea of how they work, it’s that much harder to keep them in mind when making design considerations.<p>Point 3: It’s insanely easy to create and host content. With such a low barrier of entry you’re going to get more low quality content. In the real world, there are strict requirements for businesses to make themselves accessible. There is no version of that for web content. Well, for the most part, until you “make it” at which point I believe you CAN actually be fined for having inaccessible web content. Take that with a grain of salt I’m recalling from shaky memory of reading HN comments.<p>So, what do we do about this? Honestly I think the only thing we CAN do is solve the education part. As children we should be required to be exposed to and educated about these amazing technologies that assist people with disabilities. Because all of us should know, not just us people in the software business (though in this case of course, ESPECIALLY people in the software business)<p>There is no way to fix the technology stack itself. It’s just been dug into such a deep hole. We can try to add things to it to make building accessible content easier... but that will add to the problem of there already being a million and one different ways of doing the same thing (where a couple of them are accessible)')
