I mean to YOU it doesn&#x27;t seem rational, but to the faithful it does.<p>I mean one logical, rational argument used is that the universe and life is incredibly complicated, we as &quot;mere&quot; humans cannot create it, and it&#x27;s incredibly unlikely humans would develop like we did. Therefore, there must be intelligent design behind it.<p>See? Rational and logical thought. Dismissing people who think differently as being irrational is just alienating and pushing them away, entrenching them even more if you go in with a judgment and mindset like that. It would make you scoff at &quot;these people&quot;, because they&#x27;re irrational unlike you, the epitome of rationality and logical thought.<p>TL;DR, assume the &quot;other side&quot; is just as smart and rational as you are, they just have different ideas.')
