Item(by='ra7', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607055666, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25298748, text='&gt; I feel investing anything more than the bare minimum to get your assigned work done is worth less than just grinding leetcode and otherwise studying for interviews.<p>I totally see the logic. But the problem with this is on day 1 of the new job where you&#x27;ve moved up a level by successfully completing Leetcode-style interviews, you&#x27;re now expected to do more and know more. And that&#x27;s hard if you&#x27;ve only invested the bare minimum in your previous job and haven&#x27;t maximized your learning.<p>So now you need to not only give more than the bare minimum at your current job, you need to also constantly keep your Leetcode skills up to date.')
