If anything I&#x27;d expect an average(!) person with money to have more meaning than average person without, given that by this only point of evidence, they are better at goal-directed behavior of some sort.<p>2) The 2nd point is the meaning is unnecessary. I am not sure how elaborate the religious life of subsistence farmers was, but I don&#x27;t think they were looking for anything like meaning in a modern sense... Ditto for getting high on plants. It strikes me more of a curiosity motive to explain the unknown, the kind the drives modern science. To the extent that it involved meaning, it was more of a meaning of the person as a cog in the now-explained world, not some transcendence. Even the nobles&#x2F;etc. would see their meaning in advancing the agenda of their city-state or smth like that. Going by modern cosmology, there&#x27;s no inherent meaning in the universe, so any one you choose is just the one you create (arbitrary), or more likely someone else creates for you with their own questionable motives.<p>When I started thinking more of the finite-ness of life given the above, I found that it&#x27;s not the lack of meaning that&#x27;s the problem, it&#x27;s the search itself. In this paradigm, money isn&#x27;t everything, but time and experience is; and you have far more time and better experience in modern society if you have some minimum cashflow. Ideally, you need e.g. $60-80k&#x2F;year (iirc that was the happiness plateau in the studies for the USA), ideally without sacrificing ~50% of your waking hours for it.')
