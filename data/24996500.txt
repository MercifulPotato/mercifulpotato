But people don&#x27;t really get SLAAC and RA. I think, based on my own personal experience and <i>ignorance</i>, this is partly because SLAAC and RA emphasize the adoption of sophisticated prefixing and routing strategies that people (who aren&#x27;t BGP router administrators) aren&#x27;t accustomed to caring about, let alone rigorously thinking about and accommodating, especially on their LANs. Also, neither directly solve the problem of advertising DNS hosts and other options, like NTP hosts, that piggyback on DHCP. I&#x27;m <i>not</i> particularly well versed with all things IPv6, but AFAIU the alternatives arrived belatedly--e.g. RFC 6106 (currently RFC 8106) which extends RA to propagate DNS configuration. I&#x27;m not sure if NTP and other DHCP extensions even have non-DHCPv6 alternatives, yet.<p>I don&#x27;t know if DHCPv6 will win the day, or the vision of a leaner, more distributed addressing and routing infrastructure will prevail. And I don&#x27;t have any opinions on which is better. I just know it&#x27;s all rather confusing and still in flux.')
