For ISPs, the least &quot;socialistic&quot; way is for them to operate like Energy Utilities, but IMO, the would be better off being a single provider, fully publicly provided for free.<p>For payment systems: also easy... everyone has an account at the Federal Reserve offered free as a public service (but with no overdraught or lending services). Payments are processed via SWIFT&#x2F;ACH for the banks right now and that service should be opened up to all Americans without a bank or Card Services intermediary.<p>The progressive left has advocated for things like this for decades. Now it is affecting the right, but it&#x27;s hard to have sympathy as they have been corporate sycophants for decades.')
