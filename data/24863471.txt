If you do it otherwise and you see that it works for you, keep in mind that the compiler is allowed to reorder in that case, which can result in very odd breakage.<p>On x86, sequential consistency isn&#x27;t the implemented memory model, but rather total store ordering. Stores are buffered inside the core and the guarantee provided is that they&#x27;ll appear to other cores in the proper order. On SC designs, all the cores have the same view of coherent memory all the time. In such a design, barriers aren&#x27;t required and are lowered down to NOPs.<p>(only general-purpose processors that I know of that implement sequential consistency are NVIDIA&#x27;s Tegra K1 (64-bit variant) and Tegra Xavier)')
