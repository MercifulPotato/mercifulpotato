Item(by='ubercow13', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605968969, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25169811, text='&gt;There&#x27;s plenty of coworkers I like and some I&#x27;m actually friends with, but also plenty of people who try to use the conditions of our mutual employment to fill in for friendships they didn&#x27;t develop outside of work.<p>That seems an uncharitable way to put it. People only make friends in general by putting themselves out there and making an effort. Is the difference between those two groups merely that the &#x27;actual friends&#x27; are the ones who you ended up liking rather than having to pretend to like?')
