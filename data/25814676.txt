The USB A that goes to either the wall block or your computer to charge only became USB C three months ago. People constantly plug their phones into their MacBooks or other computers in order to charge them. It’s often not convenient to plug the phone into the wall and use it since the outlet may be behind furniture. It’s much more convenient to use the phone while it’s plugged into the laptop you’re already using.<p>It’s not about syncing at all<p>If you don’t understand this use case, then I wouldn’t make bold claims that *most* users never use USB A as it’s certainly false')
