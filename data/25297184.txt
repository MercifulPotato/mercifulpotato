And whilst it’s not the safest drug ever, the vast majority of people who do it are not dying, or have any real long term negative effects.<p>Of course there will always be people who do too much, or become addicted, but that’s the same as alcohol, cigarettes, food, etc.  It should then be a public health issue, not a crime issue.<p>Prohibition has not worked, it seems like it never works.  Drug use has grown exponentially since the War on Drugs started, the costs of policing it are astronomical, and the harm to communities in the supply chain is enormous.<p>Downstream the users are criminalised and are putting themselves at risk because the product they’re consuming doesn’t have any mandated quality control.<p>Everybody loses when prohibition is a strategy.  Well, except the cartel bosses and the organisations paid to enforce these unenforceable laws.<p>Legalisation has a cost too: public healthcare and individuals who may die or suffer because of addiction.  But those people exist now, there isn’t a barrier to entry here, drugs are not hard to get hold of.<p>My personal opinion is that prohibition is immoral.  Legalisation combined with good public education and rehabilitation schemes would help the world to get out of this cycle of death and criminality.')
