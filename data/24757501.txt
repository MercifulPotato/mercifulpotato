I had to take an entry level programming job (and pay).<p>And the opposite is True too. Programmers are not Engineers. In Engineering you are expected to prove everything and there generally is only 1 correct solution(given cost, quality, and time specifications). That&#x27;s generally the scientific method approach.<p>In programming, outside of algorithm efficiency, you are taught to listen to Authority and follow best practices or standard practices. This isn&#x27;t science, it&#x27;s art.<p>Programming pays better and is in higher demand, so I&#x27;m not hating on programming. But these are distinctly different professions and ways of thinking.')
