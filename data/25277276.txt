The US had an amazingly superior navy compared to the Third Reich, which was basically only submarines, even after Pearl Harbor.<p>The US government as a whole did that to make Americans think it was their duty to do that for the government. It was a crock of shit from day one. It was the government looking out for US interests knowing they&#x27;d become a major and dominant global player. The only time you&#x27;d truly get me to &quot;fight&quot; for this country is if there were actual boots on the ground. We&#x27;re far more likely to suffer from civil strife again just because even if a full frontal assault were to happen similar to DDay on US territory, our navy would just cut off naval supply lines from any foreign nation. And yes I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s an invasion from a world power and not any of the Americas performing it.')
