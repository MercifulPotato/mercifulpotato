This can go wrong even at large companies.  At Netflix we once had a billing issue and it took a while to even notice, because no one in the company was paying for it (it was just free for everyone), but it looked like just general attrition, not people slowly having failed payments.<p>After that incident, the company gave everyone a $16&#x2F;mo raise (which is what it cost to have streaming and DVDs at the time) and then asked us all to set up our own payment.  The goal was to have everyone paying and hopefully using different payment methods, so that if something went wrong at least a few employees would be aware of it.')
