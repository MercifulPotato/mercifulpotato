In fact, the latest Vocolinc app has a &quot;Homekit&quot; mode, where it&#x27;s basically just passthrough. Used for updating firmware only, pretty much.<p>I recently added a new Wemo smart-plug and used Homekit, not the app. The plug works fine in Homekit, doesn&#x27;t even appear in the Wemo app. The only downside is no way to update firmware.<p>Biggest downside to Homekit only, is that you lose specific functionality a manufacturer might have. That said, I find Homekit to be better than the vendor stuff anyway, so stick with it.')
