Worldwide, iOS market share is peanuts compared to Android. Depending on the report, the exact amount varies pretty widely, but nothing ever seems to report more than 18-ish percent worldwide. macOS is negligible. Meanwhile, Android’s market share is enormous.<p>Android devices alone—worldwide—could easily account for half of Google’s search traffic, especially when you consider countries like India. But the DOJ wants to argue that:<p>1. Google handles 92% of global search traffic<p>2. Half of Google’s traffic comes from Apple devices<p>If we believe that 92% figure, that places a generous upper limit of Google’s search traffic originating from Apple devices at about 20%, far short of “nearly half.”<p>Look, I hate the monopolistic nature of search just as much as the next person, but can we please double-check that our numbers actually make sense?')
