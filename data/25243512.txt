One day you want to be the quiet nerdy kid who&#x27;s always got my back, that&#x27;s really nice. But the next day you want to please everyone, rearrange all my shit, and gossip about me to all your MLM friends.<p>One moment you want to be predictable, dependable, usable. Then the next day you want to interrupt my work while you do your hair.<p>And I get it, you&#x27;re trying to figure yourself out, you&#x27;ve got bills to pay, that&#x27;s totally fine. However, I just won&#x27;t be able to spend as much time with you anymore, because I&#x27;m trying to get some work done. It&#x27;s not you, it&#x27;s me.<p>Maybe we can still hang out sometimes? I&#x27;ll make some space for you in a VM.')
