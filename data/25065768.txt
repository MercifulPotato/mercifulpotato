Nevertheless, I think that the greatest strength of YouTube is the ease of uploading content. So many people have uploaded so much material on so many topics that just about anything you might want to learn about or enjoy is likely to be covered well on YouTube.<p>Many people have pointed out issues with recommendation algorithms, both on YouTube and elsewhere—particularly the “falling down the rabbit hole” phenomenon of getting deeper and deeper into conspiracy theories. I generally stay away from politics on YouTube, though, and most of my recommendations are actually quite helpful: good videos on topics that I’ve been viewing recently or have searched for.<p>So, for me at least, alternatives to YouTube would have to have those two features at a minimum: seamless uploading with few restrictions, and good recommendations. Whether that would be feasible commercially I have no idea.<p>Oh, one more thing: Hire the HN guys to design the moderation system for the new service&#x27;s comments.
