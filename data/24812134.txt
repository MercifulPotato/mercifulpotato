In fact, it&#x27;s one of the <i>only</i> results that Google returns for that search term, almost certainly because usage of it is practically non-existent (except for your &quot;mis-usages&quot;).<p>A search for &quot;keytab&quot; -- the proper term -- produces the expected results.<p>I&#x27;m not even going to bother responding to your other arguments -- neither the flawed ones nor the one or two that are actually <i>almost</i> borderline legitimate.<p>When you continue to insist on blaming Linux for the inability to flawlessly integrate and co-exist with a closed-source, proprietary system designed by a company who -- at the time it was actively designing and creating that system -- considered Linux a &quot;cancer&quot; which need to be eradicated and wiped out, well, I get the feeling there&#x27;s really no point.<p>Since Microsoft now &quot;loves Linux&quot; so much perhaps they&#x27;ll be motivated to someday publish the technical details of all of their proprietary &quot;extensions&quot; to the standards that everyone else uses.<p>Until then, I&#x27;ll just leave it at &quot;Linux is obviously not for you&quot; and move on.')
