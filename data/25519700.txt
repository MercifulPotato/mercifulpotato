It worked... sorta, but it would get really hot and the screen would sometimes just go blank and require a full reboot of the computer to get back (unless I unplugged it).<p>The other one was mostly okay, but didn&#x27;t have many ports and would also have weird issues when my computer was in clamshell mode â€” the Elgato Thunderbolt 3 Dock. It was mostly okay, but every week or two there would be a weird issue that I just don&#x27;t see using the CalDigit model.')
