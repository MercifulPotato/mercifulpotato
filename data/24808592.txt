C, on the other hand, is pretty obviously low-level. C is honest in what it is and what expectations you can have from it. It won&#x27;t tempt you to rewrite your whole business logic with it â€” instead, you would write a small library or service, that would only take care of the memory and CPU intensive task that you need it for, and leave the rest of business logic written in language that really suits it.')
