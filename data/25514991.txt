You&#x27;re comparing wage to net worth. Zuckerberg&#x27;s net worth is not a function of his replacement cost. It&#x27;s the percentage of his own company that he owns, valued at market price. This happens to be worth $100B at current market levels, but it is independent of whether he continues to work at Facebook or anywhere else. It&#x27;s not compensation for labour.')
