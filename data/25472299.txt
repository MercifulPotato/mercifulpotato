I went to a state school and we had access to a lot of computing resources I likely wouldn&#x27;t have had otherwise. I attended in the 90s and unless you already had a job in the industry, you were unlikely to find a network with hundreds or thousands of computers with different OSes on them. I not only got to use macOS and Windows, but VAX, and just about every flavor of Unix at the time (AIX, HPUX, Apollo, Solaris, A&#x2F;UX, etc.), and even got time on an IBM mainframe to see what that was like.<p>I remember, during my senior year, interviewing with a well-known company that had a grand idea for putting together a new documentation system that would allow cross-linking of documents so you could just click on a word and it would take you the definition of that word or the manual page for it. I asked, &quot;Oh, like HTML?&quot; to which they responded, &quot;What&#x27;s HTML?&quot; This was around 1992-93-ish.
