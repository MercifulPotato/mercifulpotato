The guy has a wikipedia page that was clearly written by a PR agency:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kim_Jung-ju" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kim_Jung-ju</a><p>There&#x27;s way too much detail and it&#x27;s all incredibly flattering, stuff like:<p><i>He is known for strategic investments that aren’t limited to gaming companies, and he has acquired firms and invested in various fields. Being an avid Lego fan throughout his life, in 2013 he purchased Bricklink, the world’s largest online marketplace for Lego toys.</i><p>It sometimes surprises me that wikipedia can be gamed this easily.')
