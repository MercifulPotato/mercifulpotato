So, a distro that replaces half of coreutils with busybox, the other half with toybox or BSD ports or something, the system libc is musl, build tools are patched to randomly switch between using gcc or clang (both of which have `-Werror` enabled by default), user home directories are created like `&#x2F;home&#x2F;First Last&#x2F;` (and if it doesn&#x27;t have a last name for you it&#x27;ll just leave a trailing space in the name), mktemp likewise is patched to stick temporary files somewhere other than `&#x2F;tmp` by default (and always somewhere with a space in the name), &#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh is provided by dash (this isn&#x27;t super rare, but some stuff still assumes that BASH is &#x2F;bin&#x2F;sh), normal programs are all in PATH but &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin is empty (or maybe chmodded 000 or something)...<p>The idea is, if your code builds and works on this system, it&#x27;ll run anywhere, correctly, because the system leaves no room for &quot;oh, everybody does it this way, so it&#x27;s fine to rely on this non-standard behavior&quot;.')
