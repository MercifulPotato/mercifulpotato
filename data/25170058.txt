Have we all been missing something like this in api design?<p>No. It&#x27;s hard to design, maybe harder to design an API and perhaps a misunderstanding when APIs are designed for others or an API just for an API.<p>As others have already commented about the leaking abstractions (The Law of Leaky Abstractions) which is a good description IMHO to make the non-boundary clear even when it was (non-)intended.<p>This can be found as well in Hyrum&#x27;s Law, which IMHO is from a different point of view but reminds as well that the concept to just API for API is conceptually broken.<p>&gt; Sqlite is all like, &quot;yeah but we need to know what you&#x27;re abstracting or everything is terrible.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m wondering where you pick the terrible from, I have not found that in the article. And it&#x27;s absolutely not &quot;all like&quot;. The paper describes common problems with file-systems on what Sqlite does which is standard programming - at least for Sqlite authors.<p>You seem not to be much aware of these kind of problems and with all due respect, this creates the impression that you have not  experienced this much yet. This aligns well with the localization by yours as something &quot;missing in the design&quot; where I&#x27;d like to offer a different view: It&#x27;s missing practice. To keep the colloquial tone:<p>Despite what has been missed in API design, we all haven been missing practising writing software.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2002&#x2F;11&#x2F;11&#x2F;the-law-of-leaky-abstractions&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.joelonsoftware.com&#x2F;2002&#x2F;11&#x2F;11&#x2F;the-law-of-leaky-a...</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hyrumslaw.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hyrumslaw.com&#x2F;</a>')
