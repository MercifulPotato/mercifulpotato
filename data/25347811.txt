Item(by='slfnflctd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607446297, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25346706, text='Reminds me of the &#x27;bass boost&#x27; feature on a lot of consumer audio stuff going back to the 90s (or earlier)-- most of the time, it obfuscates &amp; distorts the original mix and sounds muddier as a result, but people adapt to it and it sounds normal to them.<p>There&#x27;s also the confounding effects of different volume levels producing wildly different mixes, of people&#x27;s ears&#x2F;brains responding to frequency ranges differently, and of different music types revealing shortcomings more than others (as anyone who&#x27;s flinched at pixelated cymbals can attest).  All of which make it <i>seem</i> like a more subjective thing because of the complexity of interacting variables.<p>Regardless, true audio fidelity is something that can be measured to a fairly detailed extent.  The fact is, most speakers at most volume levels aren&#x27;t great at it, just &#x27;good enough&#x27;.  It mostly boils down to: how much can you tell the difference?  Just like with finding that optimal mp3 encoding rate to avoid those damn pixelated cymbals.')
