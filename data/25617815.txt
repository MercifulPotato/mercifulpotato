My town is &lt; 1 square mile, and a population of just 600, so I fired up a speedtest and was astounded... I was getting 560kbps, at 6am, on a Saturday.<p>It is actually very difficult to even send iMessages at those speeds, and forget about sending a photo to someone. If I&#x27;m not on my wifi at home, my phone is almost useless as anything but a phone.')
