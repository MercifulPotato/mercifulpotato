With cache and such, build times shouldn&#x27;t be too long<p>Gitlab CI just runs shell commands, it&#x27;s pretty trivial to pull the same image its using in the job, and run the same commands locally.<p>If you have long CI times, that can hinder development productivity and should be improved as much as possible, or a local replica of the CI needs to be created.')
