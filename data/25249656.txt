It is simply the idea that the legal impact of an enactment is set by the meaning (for the textualist form or originalism) or intent (for the intentionalist form of originalism) of the law when passed (whether you are referring to a statute or the Constitution or anything else.)<p>It has nothing to do with belief about the merits of the Constitution prior to subsequent amendments.')
