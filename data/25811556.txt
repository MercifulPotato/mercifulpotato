Now what % of users go through Gmail, Lumen, or AT&amp;T and what happens when one of those go down? Which of these don&#x27;t have centralized administration&#x2F;regulation bodies? Which of these will a user say they haven&#x27;t had hours of downtime with in the last year?<p>Even in the case you have a very well federated system with users very dispersed and the federation had 100% uptime and no bugs... how does it affect uptime for users? A central server going down 1% of the time for all users is the same as 1,000,000 decentralized servers being down 1% of the time for their 1&#x2F;1,000,000 users. Nobody cares others can use the service during an outage they care they can use the service.<p>Federation capability at the protocol (even if it&#x27;s not used in a truly federated way) provides a lot of great features, uptime for users isn&#x27;t really one though. The most relevant is probably when Signal shuts down intentionally (tomorrow or 1,000 years from now, doesn&#x27;t matter) you can&#x27;t just migrate to a different Signal server without all of your contacts moving to the same one. This is akin to taking your &#x2F;24 with you to your new ISP, porting your phone number to a new phone provider, or taking your custom domain email from Gmail to a different host and the ability to do that on those federated systems is probably why they remain in use today.')
