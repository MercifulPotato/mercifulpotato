Even if you had a single integration, you cannot usually guarantee an atomic switch to the newer API version across all servers, so you either have separate versioned endpoints or your webhook endpoint has to deal with multiple versions.<p>That said, I do agree you should be able to specify the exact version for a webhook in the Stripe admin UI. But I also wouldn&#x27;t worry about trying to track the versions too much, Stripe is great in that your integration from 5 years ago will still work just fine today unless you need the newer payment methods.')
