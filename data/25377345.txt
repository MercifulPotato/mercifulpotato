Item(by='kingnothing', descendants=None, kids=[25377814], score=None, time=1607628058, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25376346, text='I also worked for Uber but on backend systems in the payments flow. Every single piece of app functionality mentioned above has at least one, if not multiple, backend systems and teams supporting it.<p>Like in the app, &quot;payments&quot; sounds like it would be a simple Stripe integration but it isn&#x27;t. For one, that&#x27;s way too expensive at Uber&#x27;s scale. They build their own payment integrations to save fractions of a point that adds up to tens of millions of dollars in saved expenses.<p>There&#x27;s real time systems to facilitate the trip, then the order processing systems to process that raw data, hydrate it, store it in multiple data warehouses, and publish it to Kafka to be consumed by literally hundreds of other services. The main money pipeline involved many services covering things such as rider incentives, driver incentives, rider fraud, driver fraud, tax calculations, rider payments across all of those aforementioned payment methods, receipts, invoices, driver disbursements, rider support, driver support, and more.<p>Then take in to account that almost all of those services were written for a world designed only for taking passengers from point A to point B with Uber Black but have huge added bloat to accommodate:<p>* Uber X<p>* Uber Pool<p>* Uber Eats<p>* Uber Freight<p>* Uber Moto<p>* Lime<p>* Jump<p>and proof of concept work for all sorts of new business ventures like Uber Elevate and ATG. All of that cruft is expensive to maintain and all of those actual product lines started as experiments.<p>When I left in 2019, there were two versions of the vast majority of those systems in production as all were being rewritten to handle the significant changes to Uber&#x27;s business model from inception to now.<p>Additional edit: These services also require massive numbers of server hosts. All of the old stuff was written in Python, all the new stuff is in Go. That alone is saving Uber tens of millions per year just in hosting costs.')
