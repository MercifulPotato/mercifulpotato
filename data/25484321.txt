We need to trust parents to help them and protect them, that is our job. We know them better than anyone, we have experience, we even share DNA with them.<p>I know there are exceptions, but the default state should be to trust parents with their own children. Nobody is perfect and mistakes will be made. That’s life, we try to do our best. And no committee, politician, doctor, even therapist is going to be able to ensure they won’t make mistakes that are worse. And I love my kids much more than they ever could.')
