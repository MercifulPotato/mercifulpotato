They&#x27;ve been fined hundreds of millions of dollars for money laundering (it&#x27;s HSBC). A few years ago I looked in to moving to a more honest bank, but I couldn&#x27;t find one that also met basic criteria like having access to cash points in the UK and having a half decent mobile banking app. Literally every major bank that operates in the UK has stories of doing frankly awful things.<p>Since then I&#x27;ve joined Monzo, who do seem to be genuinely above board, but finding an honest financial institution is <i>really</i> hard.')
