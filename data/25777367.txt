Given enough RAM it&#x27;s usable. The Fossil Gen 5 for example is somewhat fine. The issue is more with Qualcomm releasing garbage CPU. Google releasing a watch would help in the same way the Nexus line helped with phones.<p>What WearOS needs is man power and an easier time getting the fix they need in the Android tree.
