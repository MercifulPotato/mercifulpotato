The current interview process is so bogged down with a high number of applicants and focuses so much on objective accomplishments, that any shortcut to trim applicants is taken. It seemed that only by removing applicants with a lower GPA or perhaps a mismatching degree could the interview pool actually reach a manageable number. This is a real shame because so many good people are most definitely ignored, but it is so much harder to prove character traits versus simply checking for a degree.')
