This asset has the value of the money you borrowed, plus interest, and it can be sold for that. One dollar just became two. (If it&#x27;s a mortgage it&#x27;s called a mortgage-backed security which the Federal Reserve will gladly take off your hands currently. The money they pay is created from nothing.)')
