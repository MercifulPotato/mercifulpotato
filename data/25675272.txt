The truth is it could be called all or none of these things. There was a professor on NPR who also said how each term (terrorism, insurrection, coup) has legal connotations. But I call BS on all of it. Getting people to not say coup is already evidence of damage control against the factual, universal, objective, scientific &quot;coup-ness&quot; nature of it all. Semmantics is always arguable, but I am not lying, I have no agenda, and I am not gaming anything with how I express the situation. Like with most &quot;normal&quot; people with no power or say in the situation.<p>But of course, whether anything crosses legal lines in accordance to legal vocabulary is all these bent politicians are concerned about, because that&#x27;s the only thing that would stop them by landing them in jail. That&#x27;s why most of them are lawyers. The non-lawyers have a hard time surviving. We&#x27;ll see what happens with Trump.<p>Both points apply to both sides.')
