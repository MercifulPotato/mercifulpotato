One can simply get a URL that any browser can go to &amp; start executing the tests. Many of the issues with using WebDriver or DevTools seem to be avoided.<p>Another part of the architecture I&#x27;ve found really useful is that test scripts execute in a nodejs environment outside the browser sandbox and thus have the ability to run external programs, make their own API calls, and so on.')
