It&#x27;s empowering.<p>The GDPR, in my opinion, turned out to be a terrific first step (which does not mean it does not have its issues). It&#x27;s been a rocky two+ years, but most sites are already up to a point where they actually give me a way to express my consent, or (more importantly) to object to processing on grounds of legitimate interest (which is where advertisers come in).<p>And that&#x27;s just one example. The GDPR starts with the following sentence (in recital 1): <i>The protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right.</i> And the EU is living up to it.<p>It&#x27;s empowering to actually have a say in how one&#x27;s own data is being processed, rather than just being the product at someone else&#x27;s mercy.<p>I can only welcome any further steps in this direction. I have no issues with some entity getting rich and powerful, the problem is when they get <i>too</i> powerful.')
