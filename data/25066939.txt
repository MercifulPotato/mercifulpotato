I have never been able to &quot;ask someone out&quot; conventionally in person without making a fool of myself. It&#x27;s a lot easier for me to take lots of rejection (the price everyone pays for being single and looking) when I&#x27;m sitting on the toilet on my phone in the morning than when I&#x27;m face to face with the person I&#x27;m interested in. Much faster turnover between individual rejections as well. All of the most positive relationships in my life, not just in romance or sex, have been off online dating&#x2F;hookup sites&#x2F;apps. Edit: and I never once paid for them')
