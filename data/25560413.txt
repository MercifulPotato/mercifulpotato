WordPress I knew had a free plan without needing to host anything. I was hoping I&#x27;d like it&#x2F;stick with the project and eventually pay and host it either through them or via a self-hosted instance. It was simply to get the project off the ground and started, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to do that all yet.')
