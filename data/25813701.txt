It really hasn&#x27;t been that long in a generational sense that the internet has been around. Society may still be in the honeymoon phase of it&#x27;s relationship with the internet. If building network services was like building houses, we may not be anywhere near drywall.<p>Who is the &quot;we&quot; who can&#x27;t do better, just technologists? Or humanity as a whole? Is it all just a demand side problem, and the people chose centralization, or was centralization a matter of policy for some group of sufficient influence? Is it just a byproduct of unfettered capitalism? A conspiracy to make the internet less &#x27;libre&#x27; by a powerful special interest looking to profit (or a three letter agency looking to snoop) isn&#x27;t outside the realm of possibility, is it?<p>Anyway, I guess my point is that there are a lot of different factors that got us to this moment, and as people say, change is the only constant. I don&#x27;t think anyone should give up on their ideas for the future, even if they&#x27;ve been tried without success before in some form.')
