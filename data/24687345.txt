If a public school is not intended to convert potential to merit, I don&#x27;t know what is.  A school is not actually an &quot;-ocracy&quot; of any kind and this is a weird semantic argument.<p>If one were going to take a fundamentalist view of merit and exclude potential (again, weird choice for a school!) it would be especially important to define what merit it is you think you can measure.  Are you sure the test (+ prep system) do that well?  Does spending money on a specialized prep that improves your score translate to producing the merit you are talking about?  Or are you retroactively defining merit as &quot;the thing you can measure&quot;, because measuring is itself the appealing part?')
