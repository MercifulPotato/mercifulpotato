I mentioned &quot;women in tech&quot; as an example, because those articles are usually political. They tend to be about alleged discrimination and demands for special treatment of women in tech. That is politics (special treatment of a specific group of people is a policy).<p>If you don&#x27;t do any of those things, your person is not a political issue.<p>Also I didn&#x27;t say you shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to post political things like &quot;women in tech&quot;. Hacker News policy says that, and bans people for commenting on such threads under the pretense of the policy.<p>Stop misinterpreting my comments.<p>And nobody is forcing you to use your body for politics. You don&#x27;t have to identify as a feminist, either. Feminism is not synonymous with women.')
