When I was younger (just starting out) I didn&#x27;t have much idea of how much markup others had when I was working for them (as employee or contractor).  I typically thought it might be 20-25% markup.  And... in <i>some</i> cases I know it&#x27;s that, but that has tended to be the low end. It&#x27;s usually more like minimum 50% markup; if you&#x27;re getting $50&#x2F;hr from an agency, they&#x27;re charging <i>at least</i> $75&#x2F;hr, probably more.  If you&#x27;re getting $60&#x2F;hr, they&#x27;re probably charging at least $90&#x2F;hr, and so on.')
