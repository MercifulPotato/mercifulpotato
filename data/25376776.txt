Uber certainly deals with more complexity in mapping than almost anyone. Their scale is massive. That being said: their engineering scale is massive as well. And if you have enough people, they will start adding things just for the sake of being busy. There is certainly someone at Uber writing code that is included in the app bundle that never runs. There are certainly assets being shipped that were relevant in 2016 but have since been forgotten. There is an engineer messing with some low-level powerful API for no real reason other than they find it interesting, and hurting the performance of something or the other by an order of magnitude. For political reasons, there is some non-optimal code shipping somewhere. At extremely large team sizes, it can be very difficult to find and fix these issues. But this is a social, not a technical, problem.')
