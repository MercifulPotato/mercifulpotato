Just freely sketching out ideas and using paper as a place to dump thoughts without concern for quality, formatting, or even having them be cohetent, is probably the most productive way for me to solve problems - so much so that I have switched to using large post-it notes, rather than a notebook. The good notes stick around for a few weeks, and the bad ones go straight into the bin.')
