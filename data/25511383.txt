Article 550bis of the Criminal Code punishes any (attempt) of external hacking, i.e. any attempt to gain access to a computer systems or to maintain such access, by someone who knows he&#x2F;she is not authorized to gain such access.<p>&gt; The preparatory documents to the Act of 28 November 2000, introducing Article 550bis into the Criminal Code, as well as the other provisions on computer criminality, define “computer system” as: “any system which allows the user to store, process or transmit data. This includes, in particular computers, chips, smart cards, networks and their components as well as telecommunications systems and their components which use information technology.”  The 3DS is a “computer system” in the sense of Article 550bis of the Criminal Code.<p>&gt; Further, as explained above, it follows from the notifications made by Nintendo to the users, as well as from the 3DS’s shell and protection measures, that users are not authorized to access the 3DS.<p>&gt; “Neimod”’s statements in the IRC conversations and in relation to the photographs posted on the Internet sufficiently evidence that the defendant has accessed (or at least, has been trying to access) the 3DS. The mere attempt to hack a computer system constitutes a criminal offence under Article 550bis of the Criminal Code.<p>&gt; As this acting involves breaking user licences, physical and technological protection measures, the defendant can only have acted knowingly. This is also confirmed by the vocabulary used by “Neimod”, which includes clear references to “hacking”, “haxx”, etc.<p>&gt; Given the fulfilment of all the requirements set out in Article 550bis (1) and&#x2F;or (4) of the Criminal Code, the offence of “hacking” or “attempt of hacking” must be upheld.')
