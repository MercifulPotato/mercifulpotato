Which is going to hurt since ZFS with buying everything up front is VASTLY more expensive than RAID where you can grow the array as needed - under the assumption that the storage needs grow slowly, which they typically do for home users.<p>your backup pool doesn&#x27;t have to match your working pool. it certainly doesn&#x27;t have to be the same size. it just has to be larger than the data you&#x27;ve got.<p>so you can build a big 64TB pool, and back it up to a set of external USB drives which expand as your actual data expands. similarly you can turn on a bit more compression for the backup pool than you might want on the main one.')
