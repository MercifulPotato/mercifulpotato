Item(by='zenexer', descendants=None, kids=[25648592], score=None, time=1609824858, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25638563, text='The constant rebranding and confusion over Matrix&#x2F;Vector&#x2F;Riot&#x2F;Element is another point of pain for me. It’s incredibly difficult to communicate unambiguously about Matrix with people who haven’t been following it for years.<p>Does Element refer to the ecosystem as a whole, including EMS? The primary client? The core federation? It’s not obvious from a casual visit to element.io. I suppose if I said “Element web app,” that would be fairly clear, but I’m still in the habit of saying “Vector” from the days of Riot.')
