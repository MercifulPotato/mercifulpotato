Unlike Linux xattrs, their maximum size is the same as that of the main stream of the file. (Likewise, on macOS the maximum xattr size is the same as that of a file&#x27;s main stream.)<p>I think if Linux would lift its limit on maximum xattr size then you would have the same basic function across most major operating systems, just with some differences in API. Then if someone could devise a standard API (even as just a portability layer), your problem would be mostly solved. Just also making sure that tools like cp, scp, sftp, zip, tar, etc, know about the xattrs and transport them. (Which is actually already true for some of those tools on some platforms.)')
