STUN is just an IP lookup effectively, so it&#x27;s very cheap to deploy.<p>TURN is of course an entirely different beast because it&#x27;s proxying all the data between clients. It&#x27;s also where some more complex video stuff happens potentially. The good news is that there are solid, open source TURN servers available to run on your own hardware. The downside is that running those servers for non-trivial amounts of clients gets pretty resource intensive pretty quick.')
