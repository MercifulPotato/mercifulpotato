After that, any sort of political discussion on the platform became an inexorable shouting match drawn out over months. Yes, I&#x27;m aware of the fact that left-wingers have learned and employed the same tactics since then. I care less about that problem because they do not have the same institutional support that Donald Trump used to enjoy.<p>Remember: Twitter bent over backwards to make exceptions to their own rules to keep Donald Trump and Donald Trump alone on their platform. Hell, they even exempted him from their repeat infringer policy that the DMCA mandates they have. If January 6th hadn&#x27;t happened, he&#x27;d still be tweeting, and Twitter would still be coming up with new policies and arguments for why Donald Trump should remain on their platform.')
