Item(by='tenpies', descendants=None, kids=[25725334, 25726077, 25725588], score=None, time=1610345966, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25723004, text='&gt; At some point the lies need to stop.<p>Imagine that all the news agencies actually spread the lie.  Imagine that for the next 4 years of Biden&#x27;s presidency, they would talk non-stop about election fraud, how he&#x27;s illegitimate, and how there needs to be an investigation.  Imagine that the opposition party appointed a special investigator who&#x27;s sole mission was to take down Biden by uncovering fraud.<p>Now imagine that after 4 years, it turned out that all the evidence for fraud was actually based on lies, opposition research, or fabricated dossiers.  The investigation found some other issues - but nothing that could take down Biden.  Turns out they tarnished the presidency for four years for no good reason.  You think apologies would be in order right?<p>Yet that&#x27;s exactly what the Russian collusion narrative was.  A lie.  A four year lie perpetrated by the Liberal media, the Democrats - including very prominent leaders who openly lied to people&#x27;s faces - as well as some members of the intelligence agencies.<p>So why didn&#x27;t those lies need to stop?  How would Democrats react if they had to deal with 4 years of fraud investigations, #Resistance, #NotMyPresident?<p>And let me be clear, I think these will be remarkably similar events in a way that&#x27;s going to look almost comical in hindsight.<p>Imagine the outrage Democrats would have had if instead of being investigated, the courts had simply dismissed the Russian collusion narrative?  If they marched, looted, and rioted <i>with the courts entertaining the investigation</i>, how bad would it have gotten if the Republicans of 2016 acted like the Democrats of 2020?')
