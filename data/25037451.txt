The constitution only allows the federal government to do very specific things.  This includes the power to coin money, to regulate commerce, to declare war, to raise and maintain armed forces, and to establish a Post Office.  Everything else is left to the states.<p>How many powers does the federal government have that are above those enumerated powers?  The government we have is not what the constitution defines.  It is what the constitution was designed to prevent.  But, we have slowly marched towards a central government that the founders feared and warned needed to be protected against.  A central government has a much higher risk of tyrannical control.')
