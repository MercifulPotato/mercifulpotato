Audio quality is perhaps fourth on the list of deciding factors.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how good headphones sound if they are painful to wear, have impractical misfeatures or are too expensive.<p>If these fit my head and I can wear them for 12 hours straight, they may be worth the money.  I&#x27;d pay $550 for that.<p>However, this is Apple.  Which means it is likely they will find some clever way of making these headphones obsolete.  Or they will break in some unfixable, or expensive to repair, way.<p>I think I&#x27;ll pass.')
