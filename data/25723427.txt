Or are you trying to point a finger at an unrelated issue and saying, &quot;That is also bad!!&quot;<p>What you are doing is called whataboutism. We need to evaluate situations with their context.<p>Constantly pulling in new examples and &quot;they did X which excuses Y&quot; is a child&#x27;s game. It&#x27;s the rhetorical equivalent to &quot;they started it!&quot;.<p>For example, I might say, &quot;the BLM was responding to threats of violence from the cops&quot; to which you might respond, &quot;the cops were responding to threats of violence from suspected criminals&quot;. We could continue this chain forever, coming up with some other example and historical precedent. It&#x27;s not productive.<p>We&#x27;re here, now in this thread discussing this one event.<p>&gt; Can you quote a specific person saying &quot;go to the capital and break the law and commit violence&quot;?<p>I assume you mean on Bannons show?
