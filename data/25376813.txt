That is another standard feature for smartphones. Of course not, it just needs the ability to support uploading photos to multiple services, and people can build libraries on top of the platform to make it easier. This is notably another thing that is not possible on iOS.<p>&gt; You pointed me to an abandoned codebase.<p>And another one that isn&#x27;t abandoned.<p>&gt; Do you still claim itâ€™s already usable? If not, why did you say it is?<p>No. I assumed it was because they had already announced it. Any developer who would like it can simply finish the library themselves.<p>We seem to be in agreement except for your wacky ideas of how much should be in the platform vs. how much should be built on top of the platform.')
