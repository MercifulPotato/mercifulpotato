Impossible and Beyond are good, but to me they are really, really, really different from meat, to the point that I don&#x27;t even understand why people eat them: Vegetables are delicious. Why try and fail to make them similar to meat, and simultaneously make it harder to understand what is even contained in the thing you&#x27;re eating?')
