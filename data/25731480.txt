They don&#x27;t typically yield to traffic when exiting one.  For pedestrians moving at walking pace, it&#x27;s possible for them to see the pedestrian about to cross and yield since the pedestrian will be very close to the intersection.<p>A cyclist 20 to 30 feet away will not be in view of the motorist who is in the process of accelerating as they exit the intersection.<p>Making intersecton navigation more complex makes it more likely that someone will make a mistake.')
