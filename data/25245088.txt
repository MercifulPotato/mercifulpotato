You cannot compare both theories in isolation from observation. Newtonian theory fails to match observation if high velocities or big masses are involved.<p>In order to &quot;fix&quot; that using just Newtonian physics, we&#x27;re back to figurative epicycles.<p>Taking observations into account, SR is simpler than Newtonian physics in that it has a greater predictive power.<p>Remember that if you come up with something simpler than SR it also has to match observation at least as well as SR.')
