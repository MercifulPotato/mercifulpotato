I paid for 7.1 I think - then yahoo forced an upgrade - ruined it imho - and thier tech support said the only way to get back my old version that I had paid for was to do some registry hacks..<p>And whichever tech had the good visualizations back then - it might have been windows media player - or maybe winamp - but there was a plugin that actually had visualizations that changed in different ways with the beat and sometimes other parts of the various frequencies.<p>Not sure this is my favorite forgotten tech, but first to mind.<p>Seems computers &#x2F; programs &#x2F; OS&#x27;s have needed so many updates and the time it takes - it&#x27;s really ruined what use to be more fun imho.<p>Wish I kept all mu c-64 floppies - archon, jumpman jr, little computer people, MULE..<p>I do want minidiscs back - a new blue ray type version with backwards compat would be nice.<p>Im going to think of more I&#x27;m sure. Oh how progress ruins things.')
