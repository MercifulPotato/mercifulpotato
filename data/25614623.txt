Yes, there are issues that cannot be fixed in WSL1. There are also issues that aren&#x27;t, and quite likely can&#x27;t be, fixed in WSL2, that do work in WSL1. The file system corruption that happens here in WSL2 is a nice example, it is something that could not possibly ever happen with WSL1 because of the way it was designed. WSL2 is not and will never be a full replacement for WSL1; WSL1 and WSL2 are two separate products, both with their own advantages and disadvantages, and I wish Microsoft would treat them as such.<p>&gt; Should Mac Office not be called Office because they completely re-wrote it?<p>I do not know how different Office for Windows and Office for Mac are, but to go with a different example, yes, I do think Visual Studio for Mac and Visual Studio Code should not have carried the Visual Studio name, it causes unnecessary confusion.')
