Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611104315, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25838710, text='&gt; These &quot;marketplace of ideas&quot; zealots don&#x27;t operate on evidence. No exceptions or qualifications to the sanctity of free speech exist. Free speech is a faith, and no such heresies are allowed.<p>I couldn&#x27;t agree more.  They also seem to have pretty extreme tunnel vision, and even seem to discard <i>other First Amendment rights</i>, like freedom of association and freedom of the press.  Freedom of speech also means freedom to <i>not speak</i>, likewise freedom of association means freedom to <i>not associate</i> and freedom of the press means freedom <i>not to publish</i>.  These are rights that aren&#x27;t always in harmony, and need to be balanced if they&#x27;re all to mean anything at all.<p>I think some of the zealotry is caused by something like &quot;knowing just enough to be dangerous.&quot;  It&#x27;s easy to fall into zealotry if you only really know oversimple versions of one or two things.  However, I think at least some of it is bad-faith argumentation, where grand invocations of &quot;freedom of speech&quot; are just rhetorical cover for shitty opinions they&#x27;d like to spread unhindered.')
