Item(by='Izkata', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607127913, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25307263, text='&gt; Uncovered code is actually a much more useful metric, IMO. You can cover code without testing it, but there is no way you could have tested uncovered code.<p>Hurrah, finally I see someone with the same viewpoint I&#x27;ve pushed for some time, though for a different reason.<p>For me, 80% covered isn&#x27;t the same thing as 20% uncovered.  The difference is in the code that has been examined and decided tests for one reason or another aren&#x27;t worth writing.  Could be untestable (elsewhere in these comments is a malloc example), too difficult to reasonably test (API calls abstracted behind a facade; mock the facade in other tests but the facade itself is kept tiny and only tested manually), utilities like python&#x27;s &quot;__repr__&quot;, etc, etc.<p>Having a way to mark such code as &quot;does not need tests&quot; is the key to making this viewpoint useable though, and I&#x27;d also really like it if coverage tools focused on counting uncovered down to 0% rather than covered up to 100%.')
