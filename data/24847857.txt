Or is it because of the change in who&#x27;s getting sick? &quot;<p>No, it&#x27;s likely dropping because the virus is changing.  There were several hundred variants of the virus by May (in the UK, most of which were found worldwide).  It is a completely normal and expected event that a virus new to humans, will evolve to become less likely to either kill the host, or stir up a counter-response from the immune system, since variants that do either of those have a harder time spreading than variants that don&#x27;t (or do them less).<p>John Ioannidis (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;bulletin&#x2F;online_first&#x2F;BLT.20.265892.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.who.int&#x2F;bulletin&#x2F;online_first&#x2F;BLT.20.265892.pdf</a>) has demonstrated that the virus&#x27; mortality rate is around 0.39% among those under 70.  The study here is looking at the mortality rate among those hospitalized, which could be changing simply because those who get sick are more or less willing to go to the hospital, or for half a dozen other reasons that have nothing to do with either who&#x27;s getting sick or how they are being treated.')
