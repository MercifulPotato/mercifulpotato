And the last time I went away from home for about a week, the Wireguard tunnel on my EdgeRouter X broke so bad on the second day that the router interface became completely unreachable, the static host mapping broke and connected clients were having DNS issues. It needed a hard reboot, which was hard since I was hundreds of kilometers away.<p>I can&#x27;t say for sure that it was because of the Wireguard tunnel, but considering how low my Wireguard usage was before without issues, it&#x27;s my main suspect. After I got home, I hard rebooted the EdgeRouter and then migrated my DNS and Wireguard off of it. I&#x27;ve decided that the less things that my EdgeRouter X does, the better it is. I&#x27;ve also decided that if I get a new Raspberry Pi for my Wireguard duties, I&#x27;ll leave the old one as a backup because you just never know.')
