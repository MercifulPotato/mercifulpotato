I also have a rating little over 2000 USCF. New players tend to over-emphasize on openings. To this day I know only names of about 5 openings. I do not know more than a few moves in them. I have generic replies for most of them.<p>Majority of the games of new players are decided by some stupid blunder. Blitz games do not help improve this area much.
