You can adjust sliders to get counterfactuals&#x2F;what-ifs for improving ventilation, decreasing time, etc.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;observablehq.com&#x2F;@chonghorizons&#x2F;covid-individual-event-risk-calculator-v0-2<p>A good risk estimator is very helpful when navigating competing ideas. Some people favor ventilation. Some people better masks. Some, spacing and distancing.<p>It&#x27;s based on the decades old Wells-Riley aerosol disease model. A google sheets risk calculator with a ton of documentation was built by Prof Jose Jimenez of Univ Colorado-Boulder. (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tinyurl.com&#x2F;covid-estimator a complex google sheets workbook).<p>It can help you think about doing A or B.<p>I didn&#x27;t make any of the modeling equations. I just &quot;reskinned&quot; the google sheet as a menu based system with sliders and radio boxes. But it&#x27;s more approachable than the google sheet.<p>Hope this is useful.')
