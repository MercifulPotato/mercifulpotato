I don&#x27;t think people are widely racists and the accusation wasn&#x27;t even underhanded, it was very well perceived. That did cost a lot of votes. Especially since the democrats even wanted to penalize people for allegedly being racist. Like a monarch that went crazy. This is really bad overall advice in my opinion.<p>&gt; that “moderate” voters don’t have moderate views, just ideologically inconsistent ones.<p>Anyone advocating ideologically consistent views should be eyed with suspicion.<p>Perhaps people are interested in how their situation can be improved instead of how their alleged opinions can be bettered. Some of those people hoped for a little less hubris, which was in vain if you read stuff like this.<p>Sorry, but it is really that bad and I wonder how these people became sociologists in the first place.<p>To suggest that you can only win an election while appealing to racist white people is so far removed from reality...')
