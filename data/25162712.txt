Many of these &quot;two steps forward, one step back&quot; advancements happen because a commercial entity has intentionally blocked the tech tree from advancing in a certain direction that would undercut their position. The tree still advances, but it has to grow around the blockade, and that involves a certain amount of seemingly redundant work. It&#x27;s only redundant in the sense of technological novelty, though. It&#x27;s not redundant in the social context.')
