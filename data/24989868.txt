You get a paper ballot, you insert it, you use a touchscreen to make choices, the machine prints the ballot with your choices on it, shows it to you behind plexiglass, you check over it for correctness. If it&#x27;s all good, you hit done and the ballot is pulled in to a hopper. If not, you can redo. You get a machine count instantly at the end of the night, and a paper ballot trail for recounts that are voter-checked.<p>Apparently other locations had some problems with paper jams from the ballots, but at least my operation had 3 machines and could have easily handled our voters with just 2 active without resorting to hand-filled ballots.<p>The only real difficulty is the absentee ballots which were obviously a new effort (at this scale) lacking infrastructure.   And they were prevented from processing any ahead of time. I think calling this &quot;dangerous&quot; or a &quot;disgrace&quot; is, in fact, blatantly disgraceful and dangerous.')
