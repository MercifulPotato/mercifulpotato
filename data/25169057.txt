Modified to up to 140K including webfonts. Notably, this is without images.<p>(This is a flexible target, depending on the complexity of a page. E.g. for a &quot;bloated&quot; page, a fully styled video display for competition winners showing 200+ entries and 280+ individual videos in categorized views is about 250K, including a few images, two and a half font families and the Vimeo Player SDK, but excluding the load of any external video streams. However, with compression we still manage the 140K mark.)<p>Then reality hits: Client insists on a full-width photographic hero image as it&#x27;s still 2014. Usual controversies about a full-size intro video (autoplay, of course), we must have this highly intrusive chat asset installed, etc, etc… – And we easily blow the 1MB limit.')
