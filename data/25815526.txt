It inevitably seeps into things unrelated to doing the actual work (even performance reviews via 360 feedback). People are paid to do a job, and I&#x27;ve found that whether they love computing or not is mostly orthogonal. Sure, there are some that are wiz&#x27;s because of it, but they&#x27;re usually neutralized by those who become ideological and inflexible because of it.<p>Tangentially related: I&#x27;m a Linux guy - it&#x27;s been my primary OS for almost 20 years now. However, at my current company, I prefer roles that don&#x27;t involve Linux. The reason is they typically will not give me my own machine - I&#x27;ll merely get an account on some server, with a poor window manager, and missing a lot of the nicer tools I use on my home machine, and no superuser privileges. In the last job I had, their provided Emacs was a little too old for some of the features I used, and I had to compile my own Emacs from scratch (along with tens of other dependent packages). This was time wasted for me and the company. At least on my Windows machine at work, I have Admin privileges and can make things nicer.<p>Paradoxically, it is <i>because</i> I&#x27;m a &quot;hard core&quot; Linux user that I prefer Windows for work. I&#x27;ve optimized my Linux workflow, and if my work cannot provide me my preferred tools&#x2F;window managers, I might as well just use Windows.<p>I don&#x27;t even use WSL. I use xonsh, which works fairly well on Windows. I have multiple desktops on Windows. And most importantly, I live in Emacs which for the most part works just as it would in Linux :-)<p>(And no, using&#x2F;installing Emacs on Windows is not a pain, despite what you often hear - the last time I did it some months ago, it was literally &quot;Download and unzip into directory and you&#x27;re good to go.&quot;)')
