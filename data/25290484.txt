Item(by='iamspoilt', descendants=None, kids=[25290769, 25292268], score=None, time=1607012623, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25290347, text='Okey, calling it a &quot;long-term gamble&quot; only sounds fair to me.<p>Talking about value, isn&#x27;t blockchain &#x2F; crypto analogous to a medium that enables moving money quickly? If yes, internet would be similar in some sense (we have instant local money transfers these days) but we don&#x27;t have anything that tracks internet as an investment.<p>Coming back to it, I can rationalize myself investing in a money transfer business that is build on blockchain (think Transferwise that uses a mix of technology and banking agreements) and generates some revenue for me. But if that middleman can be removed, I cannot suddenly start considering that piece of technology, an investment.')
