It seems many participants feel they need to pick a side and argue it to death to make their voice heard.<p>The initial demonization of saturated fats is a good example of something that was taken too far to the extremes. However, when the evidence linking saturated fat to heart disease was later found to be <i>weak</i>, many people made the mistake of arguing that saturated fat had <i>no</i> links to heart disease, or even that saturated fat is actually actually good for you. Likewise, the initial exaggeration of the role of LDL cholesterol has led to a small but vocal minority of people who claim that LDL has <i>no</i> connection to heart disease, which doesn&#x27;t agree with the science. Unfortunately, contrarian takes reign supreme when it comes to getting clicks and likes, so that&#x27;s what we see the most of.<p>There are small communities that discuss dietary studies from a neutral, scientific point of view. However, it&#x27;s relatively boring to do so and tends to leave more questions than answers, which doesn&#x27;t make for great headlines or debate fodder. It&#x27;s also difficult to introduce new people to dietary studies because there are so many inconclusive and conflicting studies performed over the past several decades. Someone arguing in bad faith can easily cherry-pick a handful of studies to support nearly any position, while choosing to ignore studies that don&#x27;t reach the conclusions they want to see.<p>From real-world experience, nit-picking minor details like which types of fats are better than others is missing the big picture. In the real world, the difference between healthy and unhealthy diets is usually plainly obvious to anyone paying attention. Excessive portion sizes, excess sugar, constant snacking, alcohol, few or zero vegetables and other such obvious flaws tend to dominate the problems in people&#x27;s diet. Making minor changes like swapping one type of fat for another is futile if someone is over-eating at every meal.')
