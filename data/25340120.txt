The situations are, by their nature, chaotic.<p>In a situation where police are <i>legitimately</i> going in with guns drawn (like, I dunno, arresting actual terrorists known to have actual guns?), they don&#x27;t have the luxury of determining whether someone&#x27;s a child before pointing a gun in their face. If anyone in the house could be armed and firing back, they need to point the gun first.<p>So, there isn&#x27;t a realistic &quot;They shouldn&#x27;t have pointed guns at children, but the rest of it is fine.&quot; Either it&#x27;s okay to point guns at children because the situation demanded it, and the moral culpability of the child&#x27;s trauma (or worse) is on whoever left children with armed outlaws... or they shouldn&#x27;t have gone in with guns at all to the personal residence of someone whose alleged crime involved no violent action of any sort.')
