Lack of curation (focus on including everything rather than being opinionated)<p>2. Lack of updates (tools get out of date fast, especially in long lists that try and include everything).<p>However, THIS list is different. This list is BAD on first publish. Most of the <i>categories</i> are not even remotely security related (&quot;Project Management&quot;) or at least not explicitly so (&quot;Supply Chain Management&quot; &#x2F; &quot;Docker UI&quot; &#x2F; &quot;Configuration Management&quot;). Yeah sure, some of the latter will be useful for blue teams, but noone on any blue team is going to be searching for those tools under the keyword &quot;security&quot;.<p>Beyond the above, things get worse: the formatting is hopeless, many of the tools are not open-source at all, and while including a lot of irrelevant non-security-related stuff, it omits many obvious well-known security tools.<p>Flagged for marketing this as &quot;Open source&quot;')
