But when taxes are high, I see that as an incentive to hide the profits by investing in the future.</i><p>Let me introduce you to how private equity works.  They have figured out how to hide the profits by buying out the original owners!<p>They buy companies by having them borrow heavily to &quot;invest&quot; in buying out the previous owners.  And then try to keep the corpse of the company looking good enough that they can flip to someone else.  The trick is that debt payments count against profits so the new owner saves on taxes.<p>The people who set up the deal get paid in a variety of ways. But in the end what they get paid tends to be roughly proportional to how much money no longer goes to Uncle Sam.  So when you see someone who got rich in private equity, like Mitt Romney, it isn&#x27;t a bad approximation that their personal wealth reflects how much money the US no longer receives in taxes due to the deals that they structured.<p>Note, if you&#x27;re over 50 you may remember the &quot;junk bond kinds&quot; of the 1980s.  That&#x27;s the same thing as private equity.  They just rebranded themselves after their actions gave them a bad name.')
