If you care at all about having an accurate (even if not precise) picture of the world, then correcting these misconceptions matter - they&#x27;re not misconceptions of detail, but of mental models.<p>To take #1, Earth orbiting the Sun. It&#x27;s a fine shorthand, assuming you remember that all matter attracts all other matter gravitationally. If you do, you&#x27;ll not be surprised by learning about how black holes work, or figuring out why planets are spherical, etc. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll probably end up considering gravity a magic glue between objects - which may also point out towards critical epistemological problems, like thinking objects (like &quot;Earth&quot; or &quot;dog&quot;) are first-class in reality (vs. being just convenient boundaries around matter that humans draw, boundary itself not being a real thing).<p>Also, in my experience, response to such &quot;pedantry&quot; varies. I&#x27;ve known people who were grateful for such corrections, and used them as springboards to read up some more. These people ended up being the ones having any kind of clue about how the world (both physical and social) functions, unlike general population. A difference in attitude, perhaps?')
