Item(by='andrewjl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602484963, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24747057, text='&gt; whether we can maintain a stable political environment for the decades&#x2F;hundred years required to responsibly take care of nuclear.<p>And if that&#x27;s not the case then what do you think will happen to the other programs critical in keeping climate change at bay? Taken to its ultimate conclusion this line of thinking leads to analysis paralysis, i.e. to shut down our government and do nothing. Which may sometimes be good thinking; especially for government policy likely full of unintended consequences. But I don&#x27;t think this should stop perfectly good technology from being built out. Or for the government to effectively kneecap it via regulation so restrictive it&#x27;s tantamount to a ban, as the US has done with nuclear power.<p>&gt; Nuclear is amazing and could solve all of our short term energy needs, but it&#x27;s ultimately people and our political structures that I don&#x27;t trust, not the science.<p>I strongly agree with this yet have drawn strikingly different conclusions. Nuclear development should be encouraged to proceed. Safely and with an eye that we should be <i>slightly</i> more aggressive than before given the carbon saving benefits it can give us. Better yet, incentivize the actors to behave safely without kneecapping their ability to do <i>something</i>.')
