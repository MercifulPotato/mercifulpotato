Taken to its ultimate conclusion this line of thinking leads to analysis paralysis, i.e. to shut down our government and do nothing. Which may be good thinking; especially for government policy likely full of unintended consequences. I don&#x27;t think this should stop perfectly good technology from being developed and built out though. Or for the government to effectively kneecap it via regulation so restrictive it&#x27;s tantamount to a ban, as the US has done with nuclear power.<p>&gt; Nuclear is amazing and could solve all of our short term energy needs, but it&#x27;s ultimately people and our political structures that I don&#x27;t trust, not the science.<p>I agree yet have drawn strikingly different conclusions. Nuclear development should be encouraged to proceed. Collectively we need to figure out how to incentivize the actors to behave safely without kneecapping their ability to do <i>something</i>.')
