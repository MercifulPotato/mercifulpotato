It&#x27;s not a complex argument. I don&#x27;t know why you fill it in with nonsense and then disparage your made up nonsense. What a waste of effort!<p>The specific thing that EM fields can do that axons or transistors cannot do is provide  &quot;intrinsic unity&quot;, the seamless cohesion that underpins the unified whole of conscious experience. This is because the EM field is itself a unified whole. The computational aspects of consciousness are still found in the dynamics of neurons.<p>Again, I was very specific in the argument about what property of the EM field I&#x27;m referencing. I&#x27;m not sure why you insist on battling strawmen. But increasingly obtuse and indignant responses do not make an argument. So you should really abandon that shtick.')
