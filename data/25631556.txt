So people will often take a less-than-optimal compensation package because a job today that pays the bills is far more valuable than a job tomorrow that has the &quot;best&quot; compensation package.<p>I&#x27;m not saying collective bargaining is the only -- or even the best -- solution to this, but it&#x27;s not as simple as just saying people should negotiate more.')
