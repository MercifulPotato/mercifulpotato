Item(by='nvarsj', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611231141, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25857874, text='&gt; Most surgery is not like that, it involves some objective condition.<p>Are you sure about that? My impression in the US is that most surgeries are of the subjective nature. And surgeons are far too eager to perform surgery. That was my own experience - I visited an ENT for sleep problems, and the first thing he suggested was surgery, even turning down my suggestion for a sleep study first. I later found out this person lives in a giant mansion, has a nice yacht, etc. and performs a large number of surgeries. I think in the US there are large incentives to perform surgery since it is so profitable.')
