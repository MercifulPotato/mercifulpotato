Now there&#x27;s no draft, no war, an all-volunteer military.<p>Also, back then LSD tended to be used in way higher doses.  So even if there was a relationship between large-dose LSD use and anti-violence or anti-war views, that doesn&#x27;t mean that there&#x27;d be a similar connection when microdosing LSD.<p>Something else to consider is that while in the popular consciousness, LSD is associated with hippies and peacenicks, and psychedelics are also associated with peaceful indigenous peoples around the world, there have been some societies (like the Jivaro) which both used psychedelics and were extremely warlike and violent.<p>So the connection between psychedelics and anti-violent&#x2F;anti-war views is far from established.  That&#x27;s why it&#x27;d make for a very interesting study.')
