So the received power is probably a lot better if you aim closer.<p>On the other hand, the latency penalty might be quite steep. There is probably a latency&#x2F;bandwidth tradeoff that needs to be solved for every packet. I think today&#x27;s internet has the same set of tradeoffs (plus some, like cost). If packets could carry their own metrics, routers could make better-informed choices.')
