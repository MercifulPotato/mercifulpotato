But in the long term apps should all end up using Vulkan&#x2F;DX12&#x2F;Metal themselves directly (or modern derivatives) - so there won&#x27;t be many uses for the old legacy D3D&#x2F;OpenGL stacks left, so these libraries will probably fall out of use too. So, nice for the short&#x2F;medium term, but probably no longer relevant in the long term.')
