Momentum &#x2F; current market share for enterprise and gaming is strongly in the x86 &#x2F; Windows space.<p>Second, the M1 successors have to cover a lot more use cases first. There are certainly use cases where M1 is winning single core performance, and some for parallelism, and nearly absolutely in efficiency and battery life. There are still plenty of cases where software either only works on Windows, or it&#x27;s where many users are currently using it, and accustomed to using it. There are other cases where &quot;M1 for x&quot; doesn&#x27;t exist yet - high-end workstations, for example. We have rumors and expectations for this to come out in over the next two years, and assuming the competition stands still, you might start to see cases where the time savings on heavy computation favors the Apple Silicon options heavily enough to overcome inertia.<p>But I would suggest people look at Intel and AMD in the Windows space for a precedent. AMD multi-core performance has been dominating Intel for about 3 years now... guess who owns the market share? It&#x27;s still Intel. The momentum definitely takes years to overcome. AMD is at something like 20% of Windows notebook share after about one year of having dominate mobile chips.
