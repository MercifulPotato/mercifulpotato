Bonus if the bridges are still sound.  Putting the rails back is trivial and all the other infrastructure (signals, level crossings, safety fences etc) has to be renewed anyway.<p>In the case of disused (bike trail) rail corridors around here (Ottawa) I think the chief concern would be NIMBY pressure.  Going from a quiet bike trail to a busy commuter train route... OMG property values!')
