When you consume input (and transcription is a great way to do it), you are consuming input of a native speaker - or in the case of Jazz, a master player - which is at a much higher quality level than what you could produce yourself. So input drives the learning process.<p>The exception is for motor e.g. pronunciation or playing technique, which do benefit from practice.')
