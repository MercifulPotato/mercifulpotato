So I&#x27;m very happy to see consolidation if that&#x27;s going to make charging more reliable.<p>The mystery for me - why don&#x27;t they <i>all</i> work on contactless payment?  (like Instavolt does)  That way, I don&#x27;t need an app, account, tracking or anything else - just tap my card and start charging.')
