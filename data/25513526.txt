To me the worst offender is a chap who used to go by &#x27;Stephen the Robot&#x27;, but I think he changed the channel name, his actual content is excellent, but I have to sit holding the remote, so that I can skip all his repulsive self-reactions and crash-zooms on his face. It&#x27;s such a shame, he&#x27;s working on an awesome project, it&#x27;s really interesting, (open source scratch built pick and place machine) but the delivery seems to be designed for &#x27;tweenagers&#x27; on TikTok. (For context, I&#x27;m in my 20s, hardly old and grouchy. I actually might not be older than him even, unsure.)')
