A demographic bulge hitting retirement age and a wave of mass incarcerations and a massive surge in higher ed enrollments all can have the same manifestation in LFPP, and all the same as a massive wave of layoffs without replacement opportunities elsewhere in the economy, but I can&#x27;t think of any purpose for which one would look at employment statistics, particularly as a policy guide, where you&#x27;d want to treat all those things as even approximately equivalent.<p>The fact that U-seried generally track together is a good thing, it says that they are indeed different measures related to the same underlying concept. It also makes the points where they do diverge interesting and noteworthy.')
