Another &quot;this is huge, if true&quot; speculation article.<p>So we know nothing about his motives, but &quot;anti-5g&quot; fits the bill, so let&#x27;s write a long thought provoking piece assuming that is fact.<p>Eventually, it won&#x27;t matter what his motives were. If we keep writing speculative pieces like these, they simply become fact in the public eye.<p>&gt; ... If true, it shines a light on the longstanding need for [buzzword buzzword blah blah legislation blah]<p>You don&#x27;t need to understand this guy&#x27;s motives to shine a light on this. Heck, if his motives were, &quot;I really enjoyed Breaking Bad, and thought it was a cool way to go out&quot;, we already have enough justification to shore up infrastructure.<p>Speculating on the motive only serves to spread FUD about &quot;far right extremists&quot;.
