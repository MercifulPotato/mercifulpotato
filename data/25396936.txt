This can be a important signal for others. It also I think is a nice feedback to the author, I always want to try and encourage people — when I receive positive feedback, it makes my day).<p>In some ways it’s a reflection of how the community (at large, not any individual in particular) views itself — to be such stringent guardians of information density, when in fact a large portion of the comments are relatively useless and misinformed (usually the most knowledgeable people speak less as they are busy actually working in their field, although they pop up from time to time).<p>However, when in Rome, do as the romans do.')
