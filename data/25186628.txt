It&#x27;s the sole reason influencers make a living and flaunts the latest products.<p>There certainly is intent: make people desire useless shit, get people spending.<p>Regarding the ad industry and social media in general, I am surprised that people think it is not about control, that the effects we are seeing are not planned. This is not conspiratorial thinking. Behavioral psychology has always been central to advertising. It is manipulation on a vast scale. The problem is it has become so widespread and ingrained in our daily lives and everything we see and hear that most of us now seem completely blind to it. Hey, it is black Friday soon; you will probably buy something you do not need, right? You are practically saving money by buying...<p>The design of social media platforms are even worse (more malicious, with intent) than traditional ad campaigns.')
