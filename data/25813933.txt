At the company I work for everything is native to Linux--I am floored by the number of interns we get who are using Windows (it&#x27;s <i>all</i> of them). We have an intake script for getting them up on WSL2 with our stack on top but man these graduates are CompSci people and they did 4 plus years of CompSci using Windows? I can only imagine the pain. Or rather, I know the pain since I have occasionally dipped my toes back into that world of hurt.<p>A non-WSL2 Windows person doesn&#x27;t get the benefits of Nix, usually doesn&#x27;t live life on the shell (since every Windows program is gui first), doesn&#x27;t do dotfiles management (you can but paths for the git Atlassian method are non-obvious), ssh password protected keys are a PITA...good God I could go on ad nauseum.<p>I work in this industry because I love computing. But these Windows jockeys I dunno I get the feeling they don&#x27;t necessarily love computing? Or in the way that it&#x27;s this mundane tool for the production of money-points that they can then exchange for money. I also am receiving the money-points and it is good. But lemme crack open your head and pour in the <i>magic</i> y&#x27;know?')
