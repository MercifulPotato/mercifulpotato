Nature doesn&#x27;t &quot;solve&quot; anything, those are meanings we humans assign to the various configurations of matter that we see, guided by our understanding of the underlying principles of motion (energy, fields, forces, or however you want to express them).<p>I mean, did nature &quot;solve the problem&quot; of creating human-like consciousness from inanimate matter? I suppose so, since humans are certainly human-like, and it would appear that there is a reasonable path from t=0 to now that includes building up all the structures at every scale to allow us to come enough into existence to talk about it with each other. But this way of speaking implies something that isn&#x27;t there, namely an intention. Humans, to take one example, aren&#x27;t a solution to a problem, we just are. And its the same for all interesting phenomena like, for example, the parabolic shape of a particle being thrown on Earth, or ball packing, or crystal lattices.... The fact that these structures are solutions to a problem is an artifact of the human ability to model the system mathematically in the first place. Nature doesn&#x27;t model, she just <i>is</i>.')
