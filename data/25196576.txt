Some actors want money, some want power. What I was trying to convey was that in the west, most actors want safety and prosperity and peace.<p>For example, these people from my country talk at length about the nitty gritty legal aspects of national security related law and how it is practiced by the Canadian intelligence community:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intrepidpodcast.com&#x2F;podcast" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.intrepidpodcast.com&#x2F;podcast</a><p>Or the overworked RCMP officer I met that spent most of his time trying to find kids being trafficked for pornography.

These people aren&#x27;t using their considerable skills to make money, which they could clearly do on Wall St. They&#x27;re focussed on making the world better and safer.
