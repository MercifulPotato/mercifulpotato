That standard once included homosexuality. It was the basis for eugenics. Also like I mentioned before - Prohibition. It&#x27;s a standard that&#x27;s ultimately subjective and self-deceiving.<p>You&#x27;re arguing that we should outlaw something that&#x27;s vital to human life. Social interaction.<p>Violence, on the other hand, is clearly not necessary or virtuous.<p>Isolation is a form of punishment and I hope you&#x27;re not saying that we all must be punished for the greater good and any dissent is evil. That&#x27;s borderline cultish.')
