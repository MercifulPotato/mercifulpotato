Item(by='xg15', descendants=None, kids=[24821818], score=None, time=1603057383, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24820145, text='&gt; <i>Services are free to rate-limit or ban you if they catch you... but if you can get around that then the information&#x2F;interaction is yours.</i><p>So what you&#x27;re saying is, you&#x27;d like to encourage a technological arms race between intrusion detection systems and hackers, without any legal repercussions for either side - and this should somehow be in the interests of users.<p>I don&#x27;t know why we&#x27;d need a &quot;free market&quot; approach, but this is just lawlessness.<p>The result will be that legitimate users get the worst of both worlds: If I want to download my own Spotify playlist myself, I&#x27;ll be out of luck - because my dead-simple Wget call will be no match for Spotify&#x27;s bot detection.\nThere is nothing I could legally do to make Spotify give me a copy of my own playlist - I&#x27;ll have to pay some third-party service that has the necessary know-how to evade the detection and scrape the data for me.<p>Meanwhile, some hacker could use the same service to impersonate me or steal my data - and I&#x27;d again have no legal recourse because, hey, no protection, what the hacker did was perfectly legal.<p>Why would I want any of this?')
