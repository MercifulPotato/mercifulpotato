I&#x27;m proposing that they be obligated to uphold special restrictions and be subject to public oversight that, in my opinion, goes hand-in-hand with their monopoly or duopoly-like status in many countries. Currently, it seems like they have the best of both worlds: the benefits of existing marketshare (and perhaps governmental legislation that hampers new competitors) in a market that is inherently biased towards the largest players alongside the lack of oversight and social responsibility that we attribute to private entities.')
