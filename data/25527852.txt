Ok now spend 100$ on books, and now you have everything you need to spend 200$ a month and an hour every week on a teacher. And you better practice five hours a week, or don&#x27;t even bother, don&#x27;t you dare soil our beautiful instrument!&quot;<p>It&#x27;s gatekeeping. I don&#x27;t want to be excellent piano, or even all that good. I want to be able to occasionally play a song not very well, and play some chords in a way that pleases me. Mostly, I want to plug chords on a whim into my DAW, where I have control to a level I, as a non savant, will never be able to play to.<p>The OP advice was perfect for someone like me who has learned piano just fine that way.')
