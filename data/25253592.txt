But Crash Bandicoot came in the first year of the console&#x27;s life, and it used non-stop disc access to continuously load data into RAM.

Kelly asked Andy if he understood correctly that any move forward or backward in a level entailed loading in new data, a CD “hit.”  Andy proudly stated that indeed it did.  Kelly asked how many of these CD hits Andy thought a gamer that finished Crash would have.  Andy did some thinking and off the top of his head said “Roughly 120,000.”  Kelly became very silent for a moment and then quietly mumbled “the PlayStation CD drive is ‘rated’ for 70,000.”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;all-things-andy-gavin.com&#x2F;video-games&#x2F;making-crash&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;all-things-andy-gavin.com&#x2F;video-games&#x2F;making-crash&#x2F;</a>')
