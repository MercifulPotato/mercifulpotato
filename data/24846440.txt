Also given that modern medicine is largely based on statistics, I have doubts that the sophistication of statistics in use is really appropriate. I think Physics or Psychology do a lot better in that regard. That said, I think many diseases can be treated or prevented with a high success rate without any invasive procedure. For instance the risk of coronary heart disease can be lowered a lot with good diet and mild exercise. It surprises me that doctors never pro-actively mention how to prevent such lifestyle diseases until it&#x27;s too late. Probably the subject of medicine needs to be broadened a bit.')
