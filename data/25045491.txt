I think it also comes from a time when people considered the source code to be an artifact and creating a source distribution was just checkout+zip. So you&#x27;d make a release commit with a version of the source code where the version is hard coded (the git flow page uses a &quot;bump_version&quot; script). Nowadays most projects can build an artifact (source or binary) from any version of the source code and derive their version number from git at build time.')
