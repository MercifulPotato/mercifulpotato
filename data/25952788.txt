If the design is not validated regularly, these non essential items get worked on by the engineers not knowing that these are not in anybody&#x27;s interest other than the UX designer.<p>This is not solely UX designer&#x27;s fault. This is also the team workflow&#x27;s fault to not accommodate time for validating design.<p>At the other spectrum, from engineering side it can be from the underlying mechanism, such as request of huge data should be made stateful because one http call can&#x27;t handle it, multiple points of hardware failures in a seemingly single operation, etc.<p>These can sometimes change the game and UX design need to be changed so that user information.<p>If these are not well communicated, the initial UX design may not suffice to honestly picture the actual underlying process of the product, causing the users to miss one or two options they should have, e.g. missing retry button where user is supposed to be able to retry an action.<p>Again there should be a period where UX design is validated again and again in the middle of development. A department or a role in the development team that takes care of the big picture of UX design (information architect and interaction design), the big picture of system architecture, and the big picture of project management (to determine which developer works when) might be ideal for it.')
