I&#x27;m so sick of threads like this.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m sorry, this came off as way more aggressive than I intended. I get why people use twitter to share stuff like this, but it&#x27;s much harder to archive, find or reference in the future, not to mention it being much less readable than a simple webpage.<p>To anyone reading this, please consider publishing your findings on a blog as well as on twitter.')
