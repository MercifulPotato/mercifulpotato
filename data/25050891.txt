At Sun I got to be involved peripherally in the effort that created SPARC and it was way more work than I had suspected. So kudos to Apple&#x27;s design, engineering, and QA teams!<p>I am also noting that they have killed the &quot;ARM SoC&#x27;s will never match what Intel can do&quot; story line. That always reminded me of the &quot;Microcomputers will never be able to do what minicomputers can do&quot; story line that everyone except DEC and HP seemed to realize wouldn&#x27;t hold up over time. &quot;Never say never&quot; is a good motto in the computer business.<p>That said, as the integration continues apace re-usability and repairablilty reach all time lows. When you consider that you could take a 1970&#x27;s minicomputer, disassemble it to the component level, and create an entirely different (and functional) computer out of those components, you get a sense of how quaint that notion seems these days. I doubt anyone will ever desolder an M1 chip and put it onto a new board of their own design. And that reminds me more of the IBM &quot;die on substrate&quot; modules that they started using in mainframes which made them basically nothing more than low grade gold ore if they no longer worked as a mainframe.')
