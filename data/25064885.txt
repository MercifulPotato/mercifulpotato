Debian builds a great product with an unpopular&#x2F;impractical ideology (not a judgement). Ubuntu comes along, adds a little on top, throws out the ideological constraint, and achieves great market success!<p>And Debian is great. We might take it for granted now, but 2 decades ago while everyone else was fiddling with their own package dependencies with RPM (pre-Yum) Debian had amazing package management with builds for all sorts of amazing architectures. They were leaders both in thought and execution.<p>I tried (but failed) to influence an employer to invest more in Debian; instead they went with SuSe which eventually caused a few small problems. Now Debian &amp; Ubuntu are booming.')
