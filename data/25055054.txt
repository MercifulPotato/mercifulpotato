Every real-world Python&#x2F;Ruby codebase ends up using magic proxies, metaclasses, method_missing or other such stuff. Scala is the only language where I&#x27;ve been able to find real, enterprise-scale codebases written in 100% plain old code without any AOP-style magic, because the implicits let the language be expressive enough that you can avoid those things without your business logic getting drowned in secondary concerns.')
