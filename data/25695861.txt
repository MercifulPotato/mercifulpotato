The United States is structurally terrible at responding to a pandemic. We have a slow moving, federal republic with (ostensibly) a weak executive. We have open borders between states that is (arguably) constitutionally protected. We have a patchwork of local authorities with differing skills and abilities.<p>The federal republic is an incredible system of government for many things. The balance that it has (in theory) restricts it from doing anything quickly, including responding to a pandemic.<p>Yes, the pandemic caught us with our pants down, so to speak. But I would not trade for authoritarian control for protection against a once-in-a-century pandemic.<p>(I know Aus is not an authoritarian country and is quite like the US culturally. But it is an island. The only non-island nations that have curtailed this are strong authoritarian states)')
