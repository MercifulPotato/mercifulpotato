Basically it&#x27;s an outsourced compliance officer.  Do the same job as the person on the movie set, follow the same regulations, and the business can open.<p>I think customers may be part of the problem, though.  No business has an incentive to say &quot;You&#x27;re not following the COVID protocols, I&#x27;m going to have to ask you to leave&quot;, and businesses that have actually done that get all sorts of abuse from the general public.  Movie sets have a lot more leverage over their employees: if they don&#x27;t follow the rules, they lose their income.')
