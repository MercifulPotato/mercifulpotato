Item(by='pgt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602522581, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24755614, text='The author does not account for the tail risks of driving an unfamiliar rental car long distances, especially in a dangerous country like South Africa where hijackings are super-common, especially in Johanneburg.<p>How certain are you that the brakes won&#x27;t fail and the CV joints won&#x27;t go in the middle of a hijacking or a blockade of burning tyres in the middle of the national highway (a weekly occurrence in ZA)? Or that you&#x27;ll be pelted with rocks by a mob of protesters on your way back from work (common)? Or that an unroadworthy minibus taxi will swerve in front of you without signalling (a daily driving experiience in ZA)?<p>My Subaru Forester is costlier to maintain than a rental, but I know all its faults and limits. I know fast I can corner without sliding and I know I can get out of a sticky situation with all-wheel drive and a 2.5L turbo. I hope I don&#x27;t need to, but I can outrun most hijackers and drunk drivers (there are many).<p>Taleb says only insure against risk of ruin. I regard my SUV as tail-risk insurance in case shit hits the fan.')
