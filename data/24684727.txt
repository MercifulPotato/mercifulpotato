Item(by='price', descendants=None, kids=[24688550], score=None, time=1601874776, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24682632, text='&gt; &gt; but in the US you need an entrance exam to keep the jocks out<p>&gt; This comment is unnecessarily and rudely exclusive.<p>Indeed. It&#x27;s also completely wrong about TJ, just as it is about the school you went to. From my experience (graduating in &#x27;02), lots and lots of TJ students played sports -- and quite a lot of them were very serious about it and quite proud of how well they did. I believe our crew teams, in particular, were nationally competitive.<p>This is counter-intuitive to a lot of people who don&#x27;t expect &quot;nerds&quot; to be interested in sports or &quot;jocks&quot; to be good at math, science, or technology. (Including me when I first got there.)<p>But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a coincidence. It turns out that working hard, showing up, and keeping at it even when things aren&#x27;t easy is a powerful way to get better at something. That&#x27;s just as true for a sport as for an academic subject.')
