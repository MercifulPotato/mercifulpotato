I feel that the author may be biased by the last 7-8 months, during which, the rationale behind having two cars has largely vanished.<p>Another example given is the yard. Interestingly, usage of the yard would have shot up for a family with young children during this period. Here, again, I assume the author knows that a yard is a multipurpose area: playing, lounging, working during parts of the day (laptops make it easy to camp out in the yard for part of the day), swimming (assuming a permanent pool or an above-ground pool). If you use the yard for some combination of the activities above, then you would almost certainly not be able to substitute the neighborhood park for it.<p>On the whole, I do not see how the &#x27;You are not using 95%&#x27; premise itself holds here.')
