DRM is all about restricting what your computer can do (what code it is allowed to run), so it can be trusted by third parties with handling protected information.  Content providers want to be able to trust <i>your</i> computer in not allowing <i>you</i> to have full control of what it does.<p>If users can execute their free software rights (modify software and run modified versions), they can instruct their computers to do anything, thus DRM would not be possible.  Binary blobs like Widivine are not complete DRM solutions on systems where users can still modify their display server or kernel.  As DRM gets more widespread, content providers will require more strictly locked systems, that&#x27;s why mobile devices are shipped with locked bootloaders and PCs have secure boot and TPM â€” most current hardware is ready to support strict DRM.<p>The only approach to DRM is to boycott its use completely, there is no workaround or compromise.')
