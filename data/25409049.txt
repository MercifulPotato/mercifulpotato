It&#x27;s your run of the mill article you find in any publication. What about it struck you as being so special that you just had to sing its praises?<p>&gt; I didn&#x27;t know the author before but after a bit of researchâ€¦ well, I&#x27;d expect nothing less from someone who has been awarded the Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT.<p>What? Is this a real comment? Your comment reads like a mother thinking her child is the next picasso after seeing her child&#x27;s first drawing.
