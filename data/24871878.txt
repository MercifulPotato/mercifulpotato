Item(by='wtallis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603474596, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24871752, text='&gt; Now, do people like me lean one way? &quot;Get out of my face and leave me alone&quot; people might plausibly lean toward Trump, but I wouldn&#x27;t be dogmatic about it. Even more, I wouldn&#x27;t claim that it&#x27;s statistically significant.<p>The &quot;shy Trump voter&quot; hypothesis is not that there are lots of people who won&#x27;t answer polls, but that there&#x27;s a <i>bias</i> in the response rate and truthfulness of the responses received, <i>and</i> that pollsters are not able to accurately correct for that bias. So whether or not <i>you</i> answer polls doesn&#x27;t speak to the validity or plausibility of that hypothesis. What <i>is</i> relevant is only the bit you say &quot;might plausibly lean toward Trump&quot;; clearly, your <i>a priori</i> opinion of that hypothesis is also fairly low.<p>&gt;  We&#x27;ve had four years of the media relentlessly telling us how stupid, evil, and wrong Trump is, and how stupid and racist all his supporters are. We&#x27;ve seen the media twist the facts to support this narrative.<p>You&#x27;re talking specifically about the media that Trump supporters largely avoid watching and do not give any credence to. There&#x27;s plenty of other evidence that Trump voters aren&#x27;t ashamed of publicly expressing their support, and not much reason to believe that they would be much more shy about it when answering polls than when going about their daily lives.')
