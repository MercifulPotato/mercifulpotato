But You have to filter that from  Wim Hof&#x27;s persona &amp; explanation style, which to me often feels very hand-wavy &amp; daresay sometimes even esoteric &amp; his explanations&#x2F;rationalisations are sometimes clearly off. (e.g. he often says that the breathwork&#x2F;hyperventilation increases amount of oxygen delivered to cells, while in reality it is the opposite due to Bohr effect). But he imo definitely is onto something with the practice.')
