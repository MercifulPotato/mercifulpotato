Item(by='technologist2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610466920, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25740434, text='Back through 2008 til I guess 2016, you couldn&#x27;t go more than 2 threads without some diseased brain talking about wanting to murder the president or all the people who approved of him. People selling and making targets with the presidents head in the center were all over. I saw enough fanfics with people hoping that there was a civil war and all the cities full of &quot;those people&quot; are obliterated and we can get on with our happy lives.<p>And that was some of the tamer crap that they admins of the site allowed. It got really bad right around when I got interested in firearms but right around the same time that Obama signed the bill to allow firearms in national parks when threads about what type of optics to get or about some site having a sale on magazines would devolve 5 posts later into someone wanting to plink the skull a libtard. After a few weeks of trying to filter out that crud, I just realized I couldn&#x27;t stand the people and that there was nothing of value to me on that site.')
