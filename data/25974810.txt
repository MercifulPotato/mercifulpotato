I am going to make up number N_life_universes which is the number of universes needed in order for an instance of intelligent life to evolve. Many people seem to assume this much less than one. I think it is much greater than one, meaning most universes you look at will be void of life. I&#x27;d also say there are many universes, one source being the rules of quantum mechanics. But I know some people believe in wave function collapse, and if that is true I am not sure what this means for having mulitple universe.<p>There is a related number, N_hamlet_universes. This is the number of universes needed in order for monkeys to type Hamlet typing as fast as they can, covering every planet spaced 6&#x27; feet apart (in case one gets sick). I think this is also a very large number but I haven&#x27;t figured it out.')
