Nobody should participate in this idiotic attempt of trying to control a virus. It’s impossible. The only way back to normality is herd immunity. It will have to happen sooner or later, through natural immunity, a vaccine or most likely a combination of both. I have it rather sooner than later. Only way back to normality is to start acting normal now. Everything else is madness. Also the people who make 100% of the sacrifices are working age adults and children, basically those who are virtually at no risk of dying from this virus. Feels plain wrong that people have to give up everything for nothing in return.')
