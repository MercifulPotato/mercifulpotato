Item(by='hansvm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604218943, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24957636, text='&gt; A number of states have towing laws that require reporting any towed vehicle to the state within an hour.<p>This is a start but not near enough. In many states the tow company isn&#x27;t required to take photos or produce any kind of proof that the car deserved to be towed. In my experience they just lie to the police about why they stole your car, and the police will vehemently argue that car theft is a civil matter and not a crime.')
