I&#x27;ve spent the last 4 years getting a bootsrapped saas off the ground. It&#x27;s taken every ounce of my being to get us profitable, but we wouldn&#x27;t be close to hitting 1 mil (USD) ARR for at least 2 more years.<p>Every year that passes I suspect it becomes more and more impossible to get anything off the ground without at least a little bit of funding. If I had my time again, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d go bootstrapped. Seed funding seems to be a great compromise between bootstrapped and angel&#x2F;VC. TinySeed are doing some great things on that front.<p>Props to you guys and gals for making it work! It looks like a great product and a great team.')
