Gitter has a very different user experience from Element at the moment.<p>Gitter&#x27;s default layout is clean, information-dense and distraction-free. There is no &quot;x has left&#x2F;joined the room&quot; spam, very little unnecessary whitespace, a bare minimum of icons (no &quot;seen by&quot;, no miniature avatars in quotes and @callouts), and a more subdued color palette (emphasis is provided primarily by bold font rather than by different colors).<p>That&#x27;s not to say that Element is <i>bad</i>, because it isn&#x27;t.  But for focused technical discussions, Gitter is <i>much better</i> in my opinion.<p>I&#x27;ve tried the &quot;modern&quot; compact and IRC layouts, but unfortunately they don&#x27;t really solve these problems. Mostly they are the same amount of distraction packed into a more condensed form.')
