HFT (and market making in general) increases liquidity. Why is liquidity a good thing? Why should it be so easy to quickly buy and sell ownership of companies? To me that seems like a bad thing. I feel like Iâ€™m just missing some fundamental understanding.<p>As a powerful investor, you can buy a large position in a company, lobby for changes that increase the short term value of the stock, sell it, and move on, likely destroying it in the process, leaving all of the people who were actually invested in its success holding the bag. Is that to be seen as a net good? It seems like HFT and other instruments are just taking that concept to ever more extreme levels.')
