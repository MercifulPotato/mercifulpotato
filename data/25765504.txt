Not because of the mileage--I&#x27;ve heard that the Prius hybrid engine is some top-notch engineering.<p>No, I hate my Prius because there are so many little things that make it obnoxious to use.  When I first bought it, after a day I took it back to the dealership and told them to either disable to &quot;beep&quot; that it did when in reverse or take the car back.  They disabled the beep but, speaking of beeps; my god the beeping!  It has a nice feature that when I get out of the car all I need do to lock it is touch the handle and it&#x27;ll lock all the doors.  Except if one door is still open and then it will play a constant beep for about 10 seconds which is, simply put, infuriating.  Doesn&#x27;t help that my son takes forever to get out of a car for some reason.<p>Almost every button on the console is backlit, as one would expect, except for the gear shifter.  No, in order to light that, they put a light on the ceiling of the car that shines down on the shifter so you can see it at night.  Why?  Why not backlight the shifter like all the buttons around it?<p>It&#x27;s for these and many, many other reasons I&#x27;m looking forward to an Apple Car.  Apple&#x27;s attention to detail.  That&#x27;s not to say Apple is perfect in this regard (I&#x27;m thinking of the Podcasts app, as one example)  But it&#x27;s clear that Toyota along with the other old-guard auto manufacturers have somehow gotten lazy or can&#x27;t get out of their own way.<p>It&#x27;s nice to see fresh ideas come out of the likes of Tesla (manufacturing quality notwithstanding) and I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what Apple comes up with.<p>I&#x27;m not, however, looking forward to that inevitable giant price tag.')
