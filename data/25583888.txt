Why not buy a cheap home and&#x2F;or invest regularly?<p>If you&#x27;re strictly thinking &quot;I have X$ and should I invest it in stocks, crypto or real-estate[1]?&quot;, then sure, your arguments make sense. Otherwise, it&#x27;s apples vs oranges.<p>[1] I did not use the word &quot;house&quot; in here, because that implies your main residence, for which, if not buying, you pay rent anyway.')
