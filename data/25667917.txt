This has nothing to do with the military&#x27;s budget or capabilities and everything to do with civilian oversight of it, which is a very good thing. It would be far more embarrassing to have the kind of military that could act on its own accord to secure the capital, which is what a large fraction of &quot;the world&quot; that&#x27;s supposedly looking down their noses at them has.<p>It would sure be nice if these kind of histrionics stayed off of HN.')
