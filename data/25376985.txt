I&#x27;m the guy who got a CS degree a decade ago. I can tell you from personal experience, 100% of tech-related course material in uni fell into one of two categories: either &quot;I know this already&quot; or &quot;this will never be applicable in a real-job scenario&quot;. And I know I&#x27;m just some guy on the internet, but I went to a &quot;good&quot; university, and I&#x27;m director-level at a tech company you&#x27;ve heard of. As you say, &quot;applying a a systematic approach to debugging, algorithms, automata&quot; is absolutely essential in what we do, but I&#x27;m asserting you&#x27;re much better at all of the above by researching, discovering, and applying it for yourself rather than memorizing textbook definitions and answering multiple choice questions.')
