The comment section had a video of Guy Steele talking about growing computer languages, and was trying to make an argument for Computer Science Metanotation being one of them. [1]<p>He started of the talk describing Regex, and how it came to be, and basically showed how that functions have been&#x2F;could be formally described in papers the same way that Regex is used.<p>In the same way regex formalized the notation for string parsing, so too will the next language regular function expression formalize. Perhaps computer meta notation is the source of true no-code solutions? Perhaps instead of reading articles about &quot;The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Regex,&quot; in the future, we&#x27;ll be reading about &quot;The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Computer Science Metanotation.&quot;<p>I also understand that what no-code solutions we are typically talking about is a user interface that is graphical, drag-and drop. But who is to say we don&#x27;t create a tool that does that with CSM?<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qNPlDnX6Mio&amp;ab_channel=ErlangSolutions" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qNPlDnX6Mio&amp;ab_channel=Erlan...</a>')
