They needed to make the car feel premium enough to justify the price, while still cutting costs at every opportunity.  So they made their own seats, branded vinyl as vegan leather, spun a huge center infotainment screen as a feature instead of the cheapest way to get a dashboard in the car, etc.  But competition is heating up, so they will have to stay on their toes.<p>I&#x27;m really pleased to see that Ford actually put forth a good faith effort with the Mach-E.  And one-upped Tesla with the interior at the same time.  The Mach-E isn&#x27;t a compliance car, and we need to see more of this in the market.  The Bolt, despite some protests to the contrary, is absolutely still a compliance car, though I think they executed pretty well all considered.  I agree that at this point CarPlay&#x2F;Android Auto is table stakes.  It&#x27;s more noteworthy not to have it, than to have it.')
