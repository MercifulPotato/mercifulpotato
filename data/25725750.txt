If people use cannabis or alcohol when depressed, consistently, I think it digs a deeper hole. On the other hand, combining drugs with happy moments can create a state dependent memory that allows a &quot;storing up&quot; of positivity. Smoking cannabis at the top of mountains, before going to museums or at concerts -- it builds a state that -- i believe-- can come out during a neutral use. It&#x27;s a key approach to &quot;virtuous drug use&quot;, which I think is important to communicate as a possibility. For a moral society, better to associate drugs with moral behavior than immoral.')
