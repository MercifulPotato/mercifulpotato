Created new fb account, linked to Oculus, bought couple of things, got banned. Asked for review, solved within 2 working days. Not even my real name.<p>Good thing, it&#x27;s a &quot;soft&quot; ban. They do not allow to log in, but if you are logged in, it&#x27;s fine. So i could use my bought items even though I could not log in in browser. But if I would have logged out from Oculus, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use them.')
