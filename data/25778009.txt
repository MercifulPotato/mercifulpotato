Tends to be easier these days now that everything is mobile and web.<p>A lot bigger companies than “Hipster startups” use Macs, this tends to start with the C-suite and people follow suit.<p>My point also wasn’t that everyone was going to switch to Mac.  It was that M1 proves you can build a “better in every way” PC with an ARM architecture.  Linux ARM is also being pushed by AWS heavily from the server side with impressive price&#x2F;performance numbers.<p>Windows ARM has been failing for many years, but I suspect this is going to change.  Microsoft has a talented virtualization group, where the HyperV roots go back to the Connectix Virtual PC team that built PPC&#x2F;x86 emulation for the Mac.  I suspect they can pull off something like Rosetta - they just need a chipmaker to collaborate with.  Might even be Intel!  Pat Gelsinger is an outside of the box thinker.<p>You remind me of folks that thought the iPhone &#x2F; iPad would have no impact on Blackberry sales, as real businesses need keyboards.')
