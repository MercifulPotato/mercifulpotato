That being said, now I look at the groups in more detail, it does seem like there&#x27;s a concentration of messages in March and April on both these topics, and not a whole lot since.<p>What makes it stand out more is that a bunch of the newsgroups I&#x27;ve subscribed to are very inactive, it turns out. I just yanked in anything related to retro computing and gaming and am slowing pruning the list back to include only active groups.<p>The more active groups have spam but they also have self-promotional material that might or might not classify as spam, and I&#x27;m seeing a few mass crossposts as well.<p>Overall it&#x27;s not as bad as I remember it being the last time I looked at getting back into usenet, which was probably 8 or 10 years ago. I think I perhaps gained a slightly skewed impression as the first few groups I went through were all pretty spammy.')
