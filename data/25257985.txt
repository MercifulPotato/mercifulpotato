Very much an artifact of the 80&#x27;s. Even though, truth be told, he&#x27;s never been that good at writing Asian characters. I love his work but dammit for someone who stole so much from Asian aesthetic, he always relegates his Asian characters to stereotypes or the weak and ineffectual^[1].<p>That said, I think the bones of Neuromancer could make a great modern story. Particularly the concept of the Tessier-Ashpools being these incestuous, almost pseudo-deities due to their wealth. The wasps&#x27; nest metaphor and all. I&#x27;d also love to see Wintermute&#x2F;Neuromancer connected with surveillance capitalism and our mass collecting of data.<p>[1]: I haven&#x27;t read all of Gibson&#x27;s novels so please correct me if there&#x27;s a novel out there with better Asian characters.')
