I wonder if NEW MAGIC will be focused on broadcasting real-time updates to the front-end while partial page updates that would normally be server rendered templates could be handled by Turbolinks 6 alone. That would be great news for anyone wanting to create amazing feeling apps with any back-end stack, without going the SPA route.')
