Working with these colleagues has helped a lot with grow my skills, simply through discussions, and other normal work interactions. From their feedback I&#x27;m convinced this goes\nboth ways.<p>Recently, a friend of min asked (read: begged) me to come working at his company, in a kind of CTO-like position. I&#x27;ve done odd jobs for this company, and like working there very much (they have fostered a great atmosphere). Due to the nature of the company, most of the employees are unskilled laborers. The tech team currently consists of 2 college students and the aforementiond friend, a CEO with only limited tech experience. I get to stipulate the terms of me working there, so I could probably add a few team members, but it&#x27;s not likely I&#x27;ll get to add any seniors to the team, as those are hard to find, and may not be in the budget.<p>I&#x27;ve learned that growth is very important to me, and in the past I&#x27;ve always grown by working with people with more or equal experience. If I take this job, that style of growth will no longer be available to me. How do other HN-ers improve their tech skills, when they are not surrounded by experienced collegaues?<p>TLDR; I&#x27;m about to reach the top, and I don&#x27;t know how to grow from there.')
