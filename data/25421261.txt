Item(by='cbozeman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607970906, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25410448, text='&gt;&gt; The simplest answer is that only people who are rich enough to pay the remedies of death by vehicle accidents should drive.<p>This is the <i>duuuummmbest</i> shit I have ever heard, and reeks of someone who has no idea just how large the United States is. I&#x27;m sure this works great in a tiny nation where everything you want to access is within a click or two, but there are parts of the United States where people literally have to drive an hour or more (at 60-70 mph) to get to a grocery store.<p>I have a friend who retired to Wolf Point, Montana. The nearest Walmart is five hours away. The only thing there is an Albertson&#x27;s, which is frequently sold out of items.<p>My favorite thing to do with my European colleagues and friends is drive them around Texas when they arrive. Many of them quickly pick up on an expression that is common across almost all of America - &quot;Oh, its just right down the road.&quot;<p>&quot;Right down the road&quot; in America means &quot;its anywhere from 5-30 miles away&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t mean, &quot;its 600 meters down the street&quot;. And they <i>all</i> pick up on it.<p>Do you know what the problem with &quot;simple&quot; answers are? They&#x27;re childish. There <i>are</i> no simple answers in life. Everything exists in a state of extraordinary complexity and requires significant consideration. Don&#x27;t believe that? Look at how we&#x27;ve handled the maintenance of the National Park Service in America. One environmental disaster after another.')
