The remainder are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs. [..]<p>[..]Whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) are the largest species of shark. Although these animals produce eggs, they don&#x27;t lay them. Instead, the young hatch while still in the female&#x27;s body and are born as miniature adults. This is known as ovoviviparity.[..] In some species, the female will produce unfertilised eggs, which are eaten by embryos. This is known as oophagy (&#x27;egg eating&#x27;) and occurs in species including the shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) and bigeye thresher sharks (Alopias superciliosus).<p>Embryos of other sharks survive by feeding on their smaller siblings. This is called intrauterine cannibalism or sometimes as embryophagy (&#x27;embryo eating&#x27;). This is known to occur in sand tiger sharks (Carcharias taurus).<p>Placental viviparity occurs in some species of shark - once the yolk sac has been depleted, it attaches to the uterine wall, acting as a pseudoplacenta.[..]<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nhm.ac.uk&#x2F;discover&#x2F;do-sharks-lay-eggs.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nhm.ac.uk&#x2F;discover&#x2F;do-sharks-lay-eggs.html</a>')
