The guy is a really good engineer and consultant, he is unorganized as hell and takes forever to log his billable time in the system. This causes billing problems regularly, requiring multiple hours of manual correction by myself (his manager) and has also resulted in clients receiving inaccurate invoices.<p>I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out how to handle it. I really don&#x27;t want to have to micromanage him, because I feel like that would cut into his confidence. But he&#x27;s also pretty terrible when it comes to an important aspect of the job.')
