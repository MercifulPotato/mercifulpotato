Resilient economies are well-balanced economies.<p>You seem to be under the misconception that the stock market somehow reflects the actual economy, in fact you seem to think that the stock market <i>is</i> the economy.<p>Those &quot;top 5&quot; companies taken together are less than 5% of the actual US economy, regardless of whichever way you want to calculate that (revenue&#x2F;profit+wages vs GDP, ...)<p>The ones hurt by an investment failing are just the investors themselves, which is the whole point of investment. You take the risk and reap the rewards.<p>The only exception is when a &quot;too big to fail&quot; whatever (this narrative is complete bs btw) made bad investments again, so the government, and by proxy the taxpayer, steps in to finance the gambling addiction of people who are politician&#x27;s retirement plans. <i>Now</i> you have made a considerable impact on the actual economy.')
