Item(by='noxer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608339133, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25473585, text='welfare is kinda a broad description for a lot of ideas but in general I would say if someone has extreme views on this is most probably due to a lack of understanding the effect it has. I cant imagine that someone who would serious dig into this topic to come out of it on either extreme side. Kinda sounds like the middle ground fallacy but its really just accepting that both extreme sides are utopic.')
