Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=[25759214], score=None, time=1610512070, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25757883, text='&gt; I distinctly remember my childhood when someone once told me that the U.S. civil war was “not about slavery” and how damn good it felt to think that everybody else had it wrong and that I was so smart for my contrarian views.  It does feel good to be an elitist contrarian, but being reality-based is better.<p>Be careful you don&#x27;t get too attached to the good feelings that come along with accepting &quot;reality based&quot; status quo ideas without challenge.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve long held the opinion that most important aspect of Global Climate Change is not climate science, but psychology.<p>From TFA:<p>&gt; P.P.S. At this point you might ask why are we picking on Freakonomics? Nobody cares about them anymore! Shouldn’t we be writing about Al Sharpton or Ted Cruz or whoever else happens to be polluting the public discourse? Or recent Ted talk sensations? Sleep is your superpower! <i>Or we could see what’s been published lately in Perspectives on Psychological Science . . . that’s always always good for a laugh, or a cry.</i><p>For fun, let&#x27;s do a quick search on &quot;climate&quot; in the archives of the <i>hilarious</i> &#x27;Perspectives on Psychological Science&#x27;:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.sagepub.com&#x2F;action&#x2F;doSearch?filterOption=thisJournal&amp;SeriesKey=ppsa&amp;AllField=climate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.sagepub.com&#x2F;action&#x2F;doSearch?filterOption=th...</a><p>Right off the bat, I see at least five articles that seem plausibly interesting and important.  I&#x27;m not sure what keywords one would have to search on, but I reckon the field of psychology might have a few nuggets of useful knowledge about the exciting events of January 6 that everyone seems to have their panties in a bunch about.<p>Continuing on in TFA...<p>&gt; Or maybe the pizzagate guy or the disgraced primatologist are up to no good again? Well, we do pick on all those people too.<p>The tens if not hundreds of thousands of <i>comically deranged</i> (down to the individual person, <i>without exception</i>) members of the conspiracy theory community <i>surely</i> don&#x27;t have <i>any</i> useful knowledge at all that might have any pragmatic use to remedying the ever taller pile of debacles our Serious Intellectuals are stacking up, one on top of the other.  We know this <i>for sure</i> - because....well, why is it again that we all <i>know</i> this, <i>for sure</i>?  I know it&#x27;s a fact, because I read it all the time, but now that I think about it, I can&#x27;t recall the reason.  <i>Oh wait</i>....it&#x27;s because <i>all</i> conspiracy theorists believe that 5G causes covid, and all of their theories are of that quality.  And I know this to be true, because numerous Trustworthy Professional Journalists share this same opinion, and this has been Confirmed by Concensus on places like HN and the front page of Reddit, and I also know that the theories of people like Noam Chomsky and Marshall McLuhan on the questionable trustworthiness of the media (and in turn, <i>mass public perception</i>) have been proven Completely Wrong.  <i>Nothing to see here - case closed</i>.<p>Speaking of &quot;good for a laugh&quot;, we&#x27;re only two weeks into 2021, but I&#x27;m getting a feeling that this year might even be more funny than 2020.  Time will tell I suppose.  What I know we can count on though, is a never ending stream of sarcastic, <i>sneering at our mutual outgroups</i> articles from iamverysmart Right Thinking journalists and bloggers, and the Overton Window constrained circle jerk forum conversations that follow them (nothing noteworthy has ever been accomplished by anyone who had an idea outside of mainstream beliefs, no siree bob).  Rinse repeat, forever.  Fiddle While Rome Burns - <i>it&#x27;s a blast</i>!<p>EDIT:  Speaking of other &quot;edgy contrarian views&quot;, I think one could have quite the &quot;meme field day&quot; with the coordinated full court press of &quot;independent&quot; journalists whipping up a state of public loathing for the &quot;disgraceful <i>attack on Democracy</i>, our &quot;most <i>sacred</i> institution&quot;, if one was to combine it with some of the Greatest Hits from this page:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_involvement_in_regime_change" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;United_States_involvement_in_r...</a><p>I was having dinner with a good friend from Iran last night, he was telling me how there is a fair chunk of the population there who <i>wants</i> the US to invade and overthrow the current government, even if it results in severe destruction to the country.  Is this a crazy idea?  I don&#x27;t even know what that word means anymore.<p>But all of this is little concern to me.  No, feeling like a snack after writing this <i>edgy contrarian rant</i> (and nothing else), I&#x27;ll just wander down to the local corner store (a light hoodie should be more than enough, it&#x27;s so warm out this winter) and pickup 3kg of bananas for $1.99 (they&#x27;re high in Potassium, delicious, and so affordable - <i>how do they do it</i>!!!??)  And after that, I&#x27;ll settle into my cozy bed and sleep like a lamb, knowing when I wake up tomorrow everything will be Just Fine for me and my family.  And isn&#x27;t that all that matters?  I imagine it is, because if it wasn&#x27;t I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d have heard something about it from the man on the Six O&#x27;clock News.  I don&#x27;t know about you, but that&#x27;s where I get my facts from, because they tell us the facts that matter, <i>not like those other guys</i> - and I know this to be true, because they told me this is true, and people on social media overwhelmingly <i>confirmed it to be true</i>.')
