They basically triggered a circuit-breaker when a heavy hit-piece hit their networks.<p>Which is to say &quot;the power of social networks&quot; isn&#x27;t just the power of the owners of the networks but also the power of groups embedded in the networks. Should these providers be fair brockers for all kind of manipulated viral content as well as for individual positions? Should they use their position of the ultimate kill switch to be the ultimate authority? I don&#x27;t know but I don&#x27;t think you put the most recent events as Facebook versus Organic Content - it&#x27;s more Facebook versus Rupert Murdoch.')
