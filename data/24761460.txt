It&#x27;s how I even got my start, back when I was 17. It really does work.<p>But it&#x27;s also more effective when you&#x27;re a young, wide-eyed student. People see in you what they saw in themselves: a young person, eager to learn and to do a good job.<p>The older you get, the more strings that attach. And you lose the charm of being a young ambitious person. People have more history by which to judge you. No one expects a sub-3 GPA student not to have resume gaps, or a degree, or leadership experience, or any of the expectations that come with age. It&#x27;s just a fact of life. Even if it&#x27;s technically ageist, I&#x27;d rather play the game and win, not argue the game isn&#x27;t fair or that it should change.<p>The moment I read bottom-feeder, &quot;bottom-of-the-totem-pole, recruiter,&quot; etc, my recruiter buddy from St Louis immediately popped to mind. We weren&#x27;t friends outside of work, but he placed me at two big financial companies over the course of two or so years. When I was fired from the first one solely due to showing up late (because undiagnosed narcolepsy), I was worried the recruiter&#x27;s firm wouldn&#x27;t want to do business with me anymore.<p>I shouldn&#x27;t have been worried at all; they care about their cut, and I cared about not running out of money.<p>But I probably would have worried a lot more if I had secretly thought of him as some bottom-feeder loser, rather than a key who could open a door that was mutually beneficial. Because (a) business partners can sense when you think poorly of them, unless you&#x27;re really, <i>really</i> good at hiding it, and (b) it would blind me to the fact that I needed him.<p>He was a cool guy on a personal level too. Had a house, dog, family, took me out to lunch a couple times, etc. He was doing better than I was at that point, for sure, even if I was in a stronger position long-term.<p>I guess the takeaway is, do the cold-email thing if you can (twitter DM works shockingly well for this); if not, try to find someone you know who might be looking; then recruiters as a fallback plan. But boy oh boy, if those &quot;bottom-feeder recruiters&quot; weren&#x27;t there for me, I would have been screwed. :)<p>The privilege is simply thinking that you&#x27;re better than the recruiter doing his job, or the woman at the store bagging groceries, or anyone else. A little twist of fate, being born to slightly different parents, not having the right mentor in your life, not having access to a computer when you were young... any of these things could easily have put you in their shoes, <i>almost</i> regardless of inherent ability. So it was just super shocking, I suppose, to hear such &quot;honesty&quot; about my cool recruiter buddy with a dog.')
