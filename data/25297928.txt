My point is instead that the US should act in its own interests. The US is a successful country today in large part due to its companies (a large part of which were founded&#x2F;co-founded by migrants e.g. Google). If the US gives priority to mediocre locals versus good internationals, companies will have access to a weaker talent pool and suffer. Of course, I&#x27;m of course not saying internationals are always better than US candidates (in the obvious case where an American is better than the competition, hire them by all means). \nWould you rather a weaker economy but mediocre people get protected, or the less xenophobic approach: a stronger economy and more competition?')
