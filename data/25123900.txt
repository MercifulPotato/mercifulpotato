Try to put yourself into the shoes of a non-tech person, remembering that &quot;non-tech&quot; is in no way a synonym for &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;lazy&quot;. They may be a doctor, lawyer or professor, a construction worker, service industry person or driver. Maybe they make a reasonable amount of money, or maybe they&#x27;re on minimum wage working multiple jobs to make ends meet.<p>Now please <i>QUANTIFY</i> what &quot;care&quot; means. I&#x27;ll give it a shot: 1 hour a week. I think that a non-tech person is going to need to average putting in at least that much time, consistently over a year or two, to make major advances on defending their privacy in a Digital Wild West environment. We on HN tend to have not merely significant digital system knowledge, but also significant <i>meta</i> knowledge. We don&#x27;t just know answers, we know questions and where to look for answers and how to try to find them, the kinds of keywords to use, the kinds of other people to ask and where to find them. This is of course true in any area, but it&#x27;s easy to take for granted how much of a difference that makes. Someone starting from scratch is going to spend a lot of time even learning that things like firewalls or personal VPNs or the like exist at all, let alone what ones to use and how. They probably won&#x27;t already have their own technical infrastructure either, like owning a a personal domain with email, and understand the various factors involved with that. Which in turn makes it harder to use unique addresses per site (hence services like Apple Sign In stepping in, which itself has concerns). It&#x27;s deep, deep waters.<p>But at $15&#x2F;hr, even just an hour a week is $780 a year. That&#x27;s real money. Maybe they&#x27;d be better off just spending more of that directly. But on what? I think the answer for some is &quot;Apple devices&quot; which they&#x27;ve heard are somewhat more updated and private, which could be some fraction of the premium for those that care. Or maybe it&#x27;d be better to put some into political donations and activism. But how exactly to do that effectively is itself an area of expertise that will take time. Etc etc.<p>A sense of helplessness in the face of seemingly overwhelming force isn&#x27;t the same as &quot;not caring at all&quot;, nor ignorance that improvement is even possible. Contrary to your assertion, we&#x27;ve repeatedly seen the public being quite uncomfortable with mass surveillance. Large percentages polled don&#x27;t like the idea of personalized advertising. Laws trying to enhance it have passed repeatedly, despite overwhelming concentrated interest opposition. The laws sometimes get watered down or are misaimed, but that&#x27;s not surprising for technical things pushed by the public. But the <i>desire</i> is certainly there for a majority, even if many have given up, or are merely quietly getting more angry about it.<p>So please be careful about blithely ascribing motivations to swaths of hundreds of millions to billions of people from our perch of expertise. Life is more complicated than that, and furthermore it&#x27;s self-defeating. We, people who care a lot about this <i>and</i> have some idea of what to do about it, need large numbers of regular people who care but <i>don&#x27;t</i> know what to do. Writing them off instead is stupid. Of course, that means we also need to care about satisfying their needs on the reverse too.')
