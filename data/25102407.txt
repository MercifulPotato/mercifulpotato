If you find yourself wondering what Bunny is talking about here, they are discussing what are called &quot;aggregates&quot;.<p>Aggregates are formations of thoughts, which <i>typically</i> manifest as visual elements, such as &quot;seeing&quot; things &quot;in mind&quot;. Not necessarily &quot;visualizing&quot;, but more like &quot;visual historic recall&quot; or &quot;predictive recall of future events&quot;.<p>Unfortunately (perhaps), I don&#x27;t do this thing with images or sound. But I am aware others do. I do it with thoughts and feelings.<p>Although imagery is typical, audio aggregates, feeling aggregates, smell aggregates and more are also possible. Thinking mind aggregates are the worst because they spawn other aggregates! :) Like other types of aggregates (gravel for example) there is usually a good mix of emotion, images, sounds and other sense bases manifesting, in mind.<p>What Buddha taught was that, in order to &quot;see&quot; these things for what they are, one must sit and focus on &quot;noting&quot; the events&#x2F;aggregates as they pass our awareness filters. This would give a sense of &quot;causality&quot; to the mediator. By noting these aggregates, over time and with attention, they (the aggregates) will eventually liberate themselves from the mind.<p>Try sitting until you think of something and then ask yourself internally and very clearly and precisely &quot;Who is it that cares about this?&quot; This is a good technique for bringing thinking mind to a halt for a moment, at least in most.<p>Anything we do that is repetitive in nature, which does not improve us, is a type of &quot;ill being&quot;. Following a recommended path of &quot;well being&quot; will allow us to escape the day to day suffering (assault by aggregates) most experience.')
