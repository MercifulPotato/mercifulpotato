You really need to make sure you’re doing a good amount of stretching into the forearms, wrists, and all the way up into the fingers. The cat-cow variation with wrists flipped can help a lot with this — once this version feels good you can even advance into down dog with wrists flipped to keep opening further into the forearms. Gomukhasana arms help as well.<p>But for sure, the most important advice is to pay attention to your body and go easy on it when appropriate, injuries are no fun!')
