Keep in mind that &quot;violation of the code of conduct&quot; sounds much worse than &quot;this person offended me&#x2F;made me uncomfortable&quot; even though in most cases they are used to refer to the same thing.<p>People for the most part know how to behave themselves, disagreements can be resolved in private between the involved parties and if someone keeps being a dick you just don&#x27;t engage with them (note that a CoC will not change anything if the person intends to keep harassing their victim). We&#x27;ve been working fine like that, both online and in the real world without any <i>CoC</i> (the law is enough to deal with actually serious cases).<p>A CoC doesn&#x27;t add anything to people already acting in good faith (other than being a thing they can be &quot;cancelled&quot; about), but does nothing against a dedicated malicious actor who couldn&#x27;t care less about it anyway.<p>Someone wanting to instigate drama and intentionally get offended must&#x27;ve said something about &quot;inclusivity&quot;, everyone jumped on it as a virtue-signalling tool and now here we are.')
