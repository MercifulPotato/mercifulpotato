Their cost of living went down tremendously.  By their own standards they lost nothing compared to Boston (food&#x2F;services&#x2F;entertainment actually got better) except that they had to deal with people on the Coast saying how boring it must be.<p>Not understanding that other people might not want to live exactly the way you do is probably the most stereotypical Massachusetts thing ever.')
