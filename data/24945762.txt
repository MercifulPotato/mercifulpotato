The hashing part is quite critical for correctness and any collisions will cause it to generate incorrect. Initially I used SHA256 and was thinking about ways to speed it up. One experiment I did was to tweak it to use 256 bits internally, but then only output 64 bits. This turned out to help quite a lot. Of course, later I got a bit anxious about only using 64 bits so I increased it to 128 bits: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sanity-io&#x2F;mendoza&#x2F;commit&#x2F;42c7dee4b42bfb4c2447eede689d40ea111d03a7" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;sanity-io&#x2F;mendoza&#x2F;commit&#x2F;42c7dee4b42bfb4c...</a><p>At this point all of this is probably completely moot.')
