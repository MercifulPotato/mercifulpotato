Seems like the opposite, no?<p>If your password is properly salted, it can&#x27;t be used to guess passwords on other sites, that&#x27;s the whole point of salt and hash.<p>The fact that RSA is being used means that your plain-text password is going to appear on their servers. Maybe it won&#x27;t get cracked in the SSL layer, but it is still there.<p>&gt; Are you sure this is what it&#x27;s guarding against? A sophisticated application architecture might involve a load balancer decrypting and doing the initial routing, several sets of data handoffs, and then the application that needs it handling the password. Any one of them could mishandle or leak the password, but only the one at the end actually needs it in the clear.<p>Do you realize that if an adversary even only has read access to the SSL layer, they can just copy the cookie and steal the account that way?')
