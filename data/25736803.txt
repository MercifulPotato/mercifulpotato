It was deleted because of AWS customers that threatened to leave.  Last thing large enterprise customers want is to be caught up in is a controversy.   Amazon made a business decision.   No tech executive wants to explain to their CEO that they got boycotted due to a tech vendor choice.  If AWs didn’t kick off Parler,  the boycott of AWS based customers was coming.<p>No company should be forced to lose money.')
