It&#x27;s like a Renault near a Mercedes when comapred with these ones (buld quality) or near BO n95. Depends what you want. My right earcup (right where it pivots) broke 2 weeks in. 100% plastic. ANC is good though I give them that. Also, &quot;much cheaper&quot; is only a feature when all other aspects match.')
