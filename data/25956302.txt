If a stock trades for 10 bid 11 offer then the market maker makes 1 every time they buy at 10 and sell at 11. They do this a very large number of times a day.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this still happens, but Marketmakers (and broker dealers) also used to earn rebates from new venues to incentivise them to trade on MTFs (multilateral trading facilities or alternative execution venues).<p>You&#x27;ll hear a lot of people talking about market makers (eg Citadel) paying for flow. The common opinion is that this is because that flow contains information that the marketmaker can profit from.  This is almost never the case, and in fact if the flow has alpha (positive or negative) or is overly directional that&#x27;s not great for the marketmaker as they are forced to temporarily take the other side of that trade and try to find unwinds. Marketmakers want more flow because that makes it easier for them to do their job of hedging their inventory and unwinding positions with minimal impact. They are betting on the underlying math that if the flow gets large enough it becomes zero alpha by definition and they can just earn the spread.')
