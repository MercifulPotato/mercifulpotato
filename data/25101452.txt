There&#x27;s no way to tell which one is the &quot;real&quot; Devin Cow.  One that I clicked on had the following content:<p><pre><code>  I have a confession... my boss, @devinnunes is a closet computer geek. He just bought his first domain!\n  \n  www.loser.com\n</code></pre>\nNot really the most stellar example of insightful and meaningful content, but it&#x27;s not been censored, at least not yet in the past three days. It doesn&#x27;t violate the terms of service, though it&#x27;s hardly content that most Parler users would be interested in.  Maybe on Twitter they find it worthwhile.')
