This is something that I think you need a sizable open source community to build and maintain. This platform is not close to something you can rely on to build your new startup &#x2F; business. I don&#x27;t want to denigrate the efforts of the founders &#x2F; devs but this is just an <i>insanely huge</i> amount of effort. Entire companies are built to just to provide a small subset of what Dark is trying to accomplish. The employees must be super stressed out! I would focus on maybe just the IDE and deployment. I don&#x27;t see why you need an entire <i>new language</i>. I could see this being an advanced IDE to churn out server-less APIs plus some closed-source packages to provide magic. But this is just... woah!')
