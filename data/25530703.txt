If they are trading with that information themselves it would lose effectiveness by sharing.  If it’s truly valuable information but they aren’t using it then they are selling it, not giving it away.  The only free stuff on Seeking Alpha either has no value or the author is attempting some variation of a pump and dump scheme.<p>Edit: I’ll acknowledge that a motivation for giving away information is to push your “premium service” but this just doesn’t work with financial stuff.  You can’t give away free “alpha” because once it’s out there it isn’t alpha, so anyone trying it isn’t going to make any more money than anyone else.  So it’s a terrible way to sell your service except to people that are too dumb to realize it.  Plus, buying calls to protect a short isn’t some novel information worth paying for.  Only chumps are paying for premium advice from someone that uses that as their taster.')
