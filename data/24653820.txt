Our limited recordings of the recent past make it hard for us to understand that it wasn’t that long ago and things weren’t that and people weren’t that different. By 1911, the railroad I used to get to from Westchester NY to Manhattan was already electrified, thanks to an investment from JP Morgan, where my brother works today. By 1910 the subway line running down Lexington Ave I’d take all the time had already been built. So had the Grand Central Post Office, on top of which the office building I used to work at was later built. By 1910, all of Manhattan had been electrified for decades, and you had electric refrigerators and curling irons and stoves. By 1910, vaccines had been developed and the first antibiotics were coming out.<p>It’s important not to forget how close in time we are to history. Imagine if, instead of always seeing black and white pictures of Martin Luther King Jr., people saw him in 4K color. Maybe they’d remember he was shot for his civil rights activism when Bill Gates was already a teenager, just a couple of heads before Unix and C.')
