EVERYTHING has a tradeoff, and it concerns me how often that pro vs con analysis is just never done.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in all the flavors here:<p>* Well designed, easy to use interfaces in a massive monolith<p>* Poorly designed monoliths with litanies of gotchas and edge cases<p>* Super fast microservices that &quot;just work&quot;<p>* Garbage applications tightly coupled across a network layer<p>What it all comes down to is the strength and ability of the design phase. Good engineers = good products.<p>This shouldn&#x27;t need to be said but the comments also appear to sidestep that problem with a few proclaiming &quot;golden solutions&quot;.<p>Be weary :)')
