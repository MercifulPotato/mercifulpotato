Nice to have while they don&#x27;t find a new location.<p>It also showcases a marvelous advantage of using git as a VCS, they automatically have multiple backups and can easily transport the project. And it showcases that all the other project info, like issues and comments should also be under version control and downloaded in developers machines. You can&#x27;t depend on an external service for your project.<p>BTW, is it possible to use GitHub features in a distribute way? E.g.: create issues in my machine and pushing it to the server?')
