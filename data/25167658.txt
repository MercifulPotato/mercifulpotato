A truly massive comparison.\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;496jiLf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;496jiLf</a><p>I also designed my own font by taking another font in OTF format and opening it in fontforge and tweaking various random elements. I didn&#x27;t present it here but it was also somewhat more legible than the original font. I think a font comprised of your choice of how each letter is done stolen from across a dozen or so fonts without regard for license and then averaged would make for a pretty nice personal font. Maybe i&#x27;ll look into doing that one of these days. The fact that different fonts have slightly different heights and widths for characters makes that a little bit more difficult..')
