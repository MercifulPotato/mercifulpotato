By changing the default, the majority of people will likely use “main” for new projects because there’s not much incentive to override it besides the attitude you’ve expressed here (and most people are probably not motivated by that attitude), but you’re still free to have that attitude, to use the word, and to override the default trivially.<p>Language evolves. One of the ways it evolves is that certain expressions become understood as hurtful or impolite... and people with empathy learn to use other expressions in their stead out of respect. That’s not “banning” those expressions, it’s choosing to adapt for the benefit of a broader subset of society.<p>A great deal of social expectations are the consequence of this kind of process of empathy and adaptation, and they make living on the planet with other people more joyful and safer. Sometimes in small ways, other times in big ways. But <i>you don’t have to meet those expectations</i> if you value the symbolic freedom of using language that’s gone out of vogue for these reasons... you just have to accept that people may view you as inconsiderate as a consequence.')
