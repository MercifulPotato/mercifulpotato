For example, a few years ago in my city a supermarket roof caved in during reconstruction, killing 54 people; one cause of the event was an after-project underspecced change to a single key component, and the responsibility for that fact was quite important (I believe the civil engineer who signed off that change was sentenced to 6 years prison for manslaughter) - and arguably we <i>do</i> want everyone involved to consider that responsibility and not just &quot;make the call&quot; that seems sensible without going into detail, since not going into detail kills people.')
