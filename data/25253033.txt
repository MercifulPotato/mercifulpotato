That doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>Well, I speed-read code all the time.. it&#x27;s a necessity in my role as independent consultant. Clients have a lot of half-baked&#x2F;unfinished projects, and I&#x27;m called in to get it progressing. Speed-reading enables me to assess the state of the existing code and suggest a way to move forward, without breaking the bank up front.<p>That said, for me column width is irrelevant for speed-reading. The typical time-killer is lacking separation of concerns and poor naming conventions (God classes, or worse, God files with 20 classes)')
