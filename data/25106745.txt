Some even have openly asked &quot;why do Americans find it so hard not to be racist? It&#x27;s not that hard.&quot; ... And without fail, countless Italians warned me to steer clear of the Roma because &quot;they are all liars and thieves&quot;...<p>Many of the replies to your comment are from Europeans defending their prejudice likewise as &quot;oh but you don&#x27;t understand, in Europe it&#x27;s different because you may be surrounded by a gang of people that are clearly gypsy and they rob you, so it&#x27;s easy to see why!&quot;.<p>But that&#x27;s the exact same thing with X race in Y country. Such as blacks in America. It&#x27;s a broad brush stroke based on an experience or group of experiences that eventually paints the whole race that way.')
