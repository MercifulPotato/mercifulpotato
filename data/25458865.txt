I&#x27;m from one of those full-on democracies without a monarch, so take this opinion with some salt.<p>The king isn&#x27;t an infections disease expert, but he&#x27;s not an idiot, and he can get any experts he want to tell him what&#x27;s going on.  He&#x27;s also the one person &quot;in government&quot; who can speak truth about the prime minister without fearing the prime minister&#x27;s wrath.  This lets the king be the one who can say what needs to be said when nobody else will say it.')
