That toxic and insane worldview just goes uncommented upon as it is &quot;impolite&quot; to point it out as such. Same with the &quot;algorithims are the root of all evil&quot; willfully ignorant memes.<p>To be fair many of the common arguments to counter are really just assinine drivel like the history retconning &quot;fake news began with the internet&quot; and in the same breath demanding that they fix it and stating that technology can never fix social problems. Which is wrong on so many levels.<p>Saying to operate based on values instead of metrics? Metrics often are bad and epistimologically incoherent in practice but done right they have real power. Values are fuzzy things often clung to as tautologies - we are free because we say so and the king protects us while he sends us to war.<p>Look at the fashionable cliched practically indistinguishable from markov chain generator output about &quot;involvement of the community and minorities&quot; and low key calling experimentalists racist by claiming without evidence &quot;minorities often bare the brunt of move fast and break things&quot;. There is no intellectual substance there - just using the downtrodden as sword and shield. The demand for &quot;examination&quot; and ethics are laughably stupid.<p>Yes just go ahead of time and understand the entire ill defined community and minority experience. That will be really useful when creating a new encrypted messaging service.<p>Yes more ethics committees that have proven worthless at promoting ethics - cynically it looks like their entire field is a shakedown of &quot;hire us for bullshit jobs or else we will continually defame you with logically incoherent rhetoric that says nothing remotely disprovable!&quot;<p>The whole thing infurates me that so much mental effort is wasted on more complex incoherent bullshit and that it is widely believed.')
