Read up on how the modern Republican party was reformed and various reactionary movements within the party.  It’s fascinating from a strategic and political standpoint.<p>A striking example is the libertarian party acts like a third axis drawing from both the republican and democratic voters, where the Green Party attracts almost exclusively from the Democrats.  That represents a fundamental split in the left and a more fluid political makeup.  The Green Party is tiny but actually had a significant impact on several elections.<p>Though this is mostly looking back, I don’t really follow recent politics that much.<p>PS: Personally, I vote more for the candidate than the party.    A young and living George H. W. Bush for example would have easily gotten by vote last election over Hillary, but was never going to vote for Trump.  It’s like both sides looked at their primary and thought, what’s the worst option?')
