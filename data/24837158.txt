Just like how empty acreage and dessert wouldn&#x27;t stop US cities from building decent public transport.<p>What matters is not the average density of the country, but the layouts of the cities.<p>A good example is NYC. According to your statement it shouldn&#x27;t have public transport because the average of the country is too sparsely populated, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter. Just like how the empty tundra in Russia doesn&#x27;t prevent Moscow or St Peterburg from building public transport.')
