I never personally saw a 20% time project turn into a product and I never felt comfortable taking 20% time. However, I did feel comfortable taking on what I saw as important work but which wasn&#x27;t part of my job description --training myself up on it and becoming the go-to person for that work.<p>That part of the culture WAS consciously cultivated and I found it very valuable. It drew me up and made me more than I was. It  was bound up with a culture of open sharing of ideas and cross-training. A notion that you could find compelling work at the company and shift your focus to that work&#x2F;team.<p>There was also an effort to encourage new projects and ideas but they didn&#x27;t go far enough. If I could give one piece of advice it&#x27;s to create explicit approval and some serious financial incentives for people who start new products at your company. Treat projects like this in the way you&#x27;d treat an acquisition of the company making that product. E.G. if your company adopts a side project as a product, give the creators cash, respect, authority, and support to grow it into something great.')
