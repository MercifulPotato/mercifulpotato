Satoshi created Bitcoin as a (particularly ineffective) act of insurrection, and the only reason why governments haven&#x27;t responded to it like so is a matter of political and judicial economy. Existing money-laundering and securities laws likely already ban Bitcoin, we just haven&#x27;t seen them fully enforced. Using Bitcoin is inherently a political statement (which I don&#x27;t entirely agree with); the apolitical choice would be to wind down Coinbase as an ongoing concern.')
