(even though n30 is still laughably low, and id prefer n3000)<p>It depends on the size of the effect, among other things. Maybe you are thinking about student-t distributions being approximated by normal distributions?<p>&gt; Insulin is released in response to blood sugar.<p>This is true, but is only part of the picture. There are other hormones like incretins. There is even what they call the cephalic phase insulin response that occurs before blood glucose concentrations increase. I think it even can occur just from imagining eating food.')
