The crowd trying to out-sing the German soldiers with the French national anthem, and the sheer raw emotion of the scene. Amazing character moments from Ricky, Victor, and Illsa.<p>I haven&#x27;t looked into the veracity, but the legend around the scene is that most of the extras in the bar were French refuges - and the emotion of the scene was very much present on set. Casablanca was filmed during the height of WW2, and came out in 1942, so it does seem plausible.<p>Louis&#x27;s brief &quot;I&#x27;m shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!&quot; - Handed a pile of his winnings by the croupier - &quot;Oh, thank you very much.&quot; exchange [2] is also a fantastically memorable comedic exchange.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=cOeFhSzoTuc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=cOeFhSzoTuc</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SjbPi00k_ME" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SjbPi00k_ME</a>')
