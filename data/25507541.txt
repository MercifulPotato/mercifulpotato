Because suppressing NSO using legal means will not make the vulnerabilities go away -- it will still be there, waiting to be exploited by someone else.<p>Microsoft for example has 30+ year old C&#x2F;C++ code in Office applications that customers install on their machines. This is an attack vector. Adobe Acrobat is another well known attack vector. These products should be rewritten in a safer language, like Rust.<p>Roughly 70% of the security issues seen by Microsoft are memory safety issues. This means that if that software had been written in Rust, 70% of these security issues would most likely have been eliminated.
