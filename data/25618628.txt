Item(by='viraptor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609638976, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25616945, text='1) full remote (been doing that for the last 10 years)<p>2) ~250km<p>3) I enjoy it quite a bit, but I&#x27;m not a super social person. Doing 1 day of coworking space every week or two helps maintain sanity, as do animals at home.<p>4) Pro: No commute, quality office space, view on a green garden. Con: Distractions are present and easy to find, as is the fridge...<p>5) It&#x27;s much easier when you have a house with a dedicated room.<p>6) People have very different ideas about remote work. I&#x27;d recommend trying it. There are those who love it, and those who will feel miserable in that setting. We all have different needs and preferences, who knew? It&#x27;s also good for people who can&#x27;t stand working at home to realise that others feel that way about coming to the office.')
