That program let you type in a bunch of hex characters with a CRC and would tell you if you typed a line wrong.  The rest of the programs in the book while still just BASIC programs were printed all encoded as a bunch of hex digit lines.  It was great, once you got it typed in you knew there weren&#x27;t any typos.  Then you could list or save or run it just like any other BASIC program.')
