None of which are <i>offered</i> in Manyverse, for good or bad.  (definitely un-ideal for first-time users, but it does at least avoid overloading or over-promoting some)<p>The &quot;get started&quot; docs on the website do walk you through it though, e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scuttlebutt.nz&#x2F;get-started&#x2F;#step-3-get-connected" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scuttlebutt.nz&#x2F;get-started&#x2F;#step-3-get-connected</a> -&gt; this smallish list of pubs: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ssbc&#x2F;ssb-server&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pub-Servers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ssbc&#x2F;ssb-server&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pub-Servers</a> .  You&#x27;ll automatically discover more as you pull other people&#x27;s content.<p>---<p>I did join yours via Manyverse, but tbh I&#x27;m surprised that viewing your pub doesn&#x27;t show member join&#x2F;leaves, and I haven&#x27;t seen any posts yet (I&#x27;ve made one).  Have you made any?  Could it be having problems perhaps?<p>(edit: and shortly after posting this, now I see some stuff, after around 45m.  So my initial minorish-complaint about Manyverse from a year or so ago is still around: it doesn&#x27;t tell you what it&#x27;s doing.  Patchwork was much better about that, though it kinda looked like constant thrashing.)')
