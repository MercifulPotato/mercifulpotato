I am a (very happy) user of Stadia. If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you really should...it&#x27;s an amazing piece of tech. I can find myself with 20-30 minutes worth of downtime during the day, fire up Cyberpunk 2077 or Hitman or Assassin&#x27;s Creed in moments <i>from my browser</i> *on a macbook* and play at high settings with no noticeable lag.<p>Obviously you need a strong, steady internet connection for Stadia to shine, but I&#x27;d guess that the HN crowd skews towards that.<p>If you&#x27;re an old gamer who wants to play newer games but doesn&#x27;t have a ton of time and don&#x27;t want to drop $1k+ on a gaming rig, check out Stadia.<p>The game library does leave a lot to be desired, no question about that.
