If there is someone behind this running a pump &amp; dump scam they absolutely should be prosecuted as normal, but falling victim to a financial scam on the stock market is one of those properties capitalist libertarians always hold up and they can&#x27;t change their mind just because this one instance ended up screwing them over instead.')
