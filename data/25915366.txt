Norway is a part of the treaty, so is Iceland for example. Some EU countries still don&#x27;t meet the criteria to join, e.g. Romania, Bulgaria. Ireland and the UK are&#x2F;were outside (voluntarily) of the treaty as well - which is one of the weirdest parts of the Brexit with the UK actually checking its own borders more than most of the rest of the EU.<p>For example traveling from Poland to Norway by car (and ferry Tallinn - Helsinki) requires zero passport&#x2F;id card checks. (id cards are a valid traveling document within the EU and Schengen)<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Schengen_Area" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Schengen_Area</a>')
