No one was &quot;suffering&quot; under Javascript until Node and compile-to-js languages and the Byzantine nightmare of a development environment that they created came along. No one was shouting &quot;Javascript Delenda Est&quot; when all you needed was an FTP account and a text editor to configure a JQuery plugin.<p>I mean, Javascript development used to be reasonably simple, straightforward and fun. It&#x27;s Silicon Valley&#x27;s fault that it no longer is, not the language.')
