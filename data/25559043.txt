In electrical engineering there is no such thing as a generic component. There are only implementations of them and you have to pick among the company provided implementations. Imagine if you had to specifically choose a 4Ghz grade if statement in your programming language or make sure your while loop supports 1.3V on the CPU. You need to have a good mental model of how the statement are implemented to choose the right one.<p>That&#x27;s how bad electrical engineering is. Programming is bliss in comparison. You can do the dumbest things and it still works out. Your computer will never go up in flames even in the most bug ridden C code base. RISC-V will bring this to a lesser extent to software development. There will be no &quot;general&quot; RISC-V CPU. Instead you have to constantly worry about whether your CPU supports these instructions. Implementing fallbacks will just cause very inconsistent performance drops among CPU manufacturers. Think of things like the Intel compiler disabling SIMD on AMD cpus except this time it&#x27;s because the manufacturer didn&#x27;t bother to implement a &quot;bloated extension&quot; where only one instruction is actually used but when it is used it&#x27;s in Fortnite or some other popular game so you do extremely poorly in benchmarks.')
