Due to the way licensing works, Nintendo could be using OSS library A that they shower their largess upon with free switches, but library A uses library B, which uses library C, which uses safe-buffer. Safe-buffer would still have to have their license published in that manner, but it isn&#x27;t really clear that nintendo is exploiting that party. Hell, it could even be the case that the author&#x27;s code is never actually executed on the switch, if for example it was bundled in but is part of a feature that is never called, because Nintendo wanted to use other parts of the same library that happened to include safe-buffer.<p>By the way, I just checked Nintendo&#x27;s open source switch library, and there are at least 36,000 copyright notices present in the archive. That&#x27;s a lot of free switches!')
