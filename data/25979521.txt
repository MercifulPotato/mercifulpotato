Every suggested edit you&#x27;ve made to the comment completely alters the meaning of the text: you&#x27;re basically saying that if you&#x27;re not looking to learn and completely disregard the veracity of your own experience in every statement you do, you&#x27;re better off not saying anything at all.<p>It strikes me as exceedingly dishonest to pretend that you&#x27;re genuinely interested in someone&#x27;s opinion if you already know you strongly disagree with it, and it&#x27;s by no means a requirement to lack an opinion to have a respectful debate. Telling someone that you believe they&#x27;re wrong is not an insult.<p>People have subjective opinions and experiences, this does not necessarily make their statements true. This should be obvious and I don&#x27;t see why it&#x27;s the sender&#x27;s responsibility to preface everything they say with that fact to avoid stepping on the toes of whoever reads it. Opinions don&#x27;t kill debate, it furthers it.')
