I am in med devices working on CE mark regulatory filings, and so ZK kinda fits well with my job,  which is essentially to find product&#x2F;process information, know stuff, and communicate it.<p>I think ZK works very well in team environment. I make &quot;issue logs&quot; - when something goes wrong, or there is a particular detail to understand,  I force myself to write out the issue and resolution into ZK. (Force, because it is so much easier to just solve and move on without documenting)<p>If you can maintain some discipline in writing summaries and updating for yourself,  this solves &quot;we discussed x issue 2 months ago, but don&#x27;t remember {some, all} details now&quot;<p>I keep sublime text open to my Kasten at all times so using full text search in a database of curated notes is <i>so</i> much quicker than trying to find the right project folder, or searching outlook.<p>I don&#x27;t worry about one file - one idea, I just break things up how they make sense to me. The &quot;rules&quot; for ZK don&#x27;t entirely make sense for engineering work and must be bent to your needs.<p>My only lament with plain text is difficulty in using figures &#x2F; images in discussions with myself.')
