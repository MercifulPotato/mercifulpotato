Stalebot is a <i>sanity saver</i>. Users are always welcome to trigger the bot to reopen. I won&#x27;t presume your experience on open source projects of a big size, but when you&#x27;re dealing with dozens of new issues daily, and have hundreds of issues that go back five years with no activity, the stalebot saves the day.<p>That speaks to another issue of open source - it&#x27;s more common than not for a user to report an issue with no intention of following up, nor helping to triage (let alone contributing). Drive-by issues are noise and take precious time away from maintainers. There again, stalebot steps in to help. YMMV but my personal experience is that we don&#x27;t get too many reopens, and we don&#x27;t get too many duplicates from closed issues.')
