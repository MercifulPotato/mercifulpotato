But the primary reason they are successful and have been able to make this step is because of the rich inheritance available to the researchers.<p>Most jobs under Capitalism today are soul crushing and exploitative. In my journey of going upstream to try to seek to understand the root of this dysfunction, I came to see that it is due to 1) the Intellectual Property system that creates contrived&#x2F;artificial scarcity due to outdated economics, and 2) the credit monopoly [the way we are forced to mediate our interactions through capitalist debt protocols&#x2F;agreements ($, â‚¬, etc)]. Our current system is truly the elephant in the room. [1]<p>I really don&#x27;t think an Intellectual Property Monopoly is the only way creativity can happen. I think if we switched to FLOSS-everything we&#x27;d still have all the same tech. In fact I think we&#x27;d have more innovation than ever before. More chances for more people to work on things means more experimentation and results, could mean safer and more sustainable developments - and thus more sustainable technologies.<p>Silicon Valley isn&#x27;t special. I am on here with you other technology enthusiasts and experts because the discussions on innovation <i>do</i> happen here currently. But it&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s unique. It&#x27;s because Silicon Valley and American investors exert power over everyone else in the world through through it&#x27;s IP system and agreements like TRIPS, together with the US-based money system and US-influenced &#x27;development&#x27; organizations like the IMF and the World Bank.
