There is value in people being able to say what they want, even if it is baseless, or disturbed, or hateful.  One example that comes to my mind is the Rotterham child rape scandal[1], which, were it not printed in the most reputable newspapers world wide, would sound like something out of the QAnon fantasy. Even worse than this scandal itself, which is saying something given that this scandal describes an organization of men raping children for decades with the tacit knowledge of local police and city government, is the fact that there are many similar occurrences in the UK.  That is, this is not a one off horrific event, but part of a terrible and disturbing pattern.<p>Why I bring this up as an example, is, that it seems to me part of the problem the UK has in getting the organized rape of children under control, is an unwillingness to speak about it and be open about it.  The UK is so determined to control speech and avoid offending people that they kept secret the organized rape of hundreds if not thousands of children across their country for decades.  I would much rather err on the side of allowing people to indulge in dark, even if absurd, fantasies (e.g. QAnon) than forbid or punish people for going public with imperfectly firm accusations (as happened in Rotterham - victims and their families reported the ongoing sexual abuse and rape to the authorities through the many years it was ongoing and the authorities ignored them for fear of being offensive[2]).<p>The organized sexual abuse of children clearly does happen.  Sometimes the government is intimately involved.  For example the case with Jeffrey Epstein.  It&#x27;s worth it to let people talk about it and make accusations.  Sometimes disturbed people will go too far and make baseless claims.  That&#x27;s not ideal, but preventing people from making anything but perfect accusations leads to a culture where horrible crimes are covered up for fear of not having enough evidence.  I think it is a better balance to let mean people say mean things and expose whatever evidence there may be of things as soon as possible.<p>1 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rotherham_child_sexual_exploit...</a><p>2 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mirror.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk-news&#x2F;police-ignored-child-sex-abuse-21305529" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mirror.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;uk-news&#x2F;police-ignored-child-s...</a>')
