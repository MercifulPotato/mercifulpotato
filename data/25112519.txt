Thus when at rest physically we progress though the time dimension at the speed of light. Conversely if two points are separated by an interval equal to C, their distance in the time dimension is zero.<p>The latter result isn&#x27;t really a surprise, we all know time doesn&#x27;t pass if you&#x27;re traveling at light speed, but IMHO it&#x27;s interesting to see how it arises from the geometry.')
