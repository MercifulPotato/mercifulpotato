Item(by='kodah', descendants=None, kids=[25129520], score=None, time=1605644386, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25129021, text='&gt; Perhaps one can make the case that conglomerates inevitably leads to monopolies, and on that basis one can argue against the development of conglomerates.<p>You are right and this is precisely my line of thinking. All the parts you need to make a monopoly are already there, so then they either go full tilt or they try to engineer the economy so key businesses don&#x27;t go down so they can continue to claim a monopoly doesn&#x27;t exist <i>yet</i>.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting I originally referred to it as &quot;monopoly law&quot; but it&#x27;s actually anti-trust law, which could make some room for conglomerate making.')
