That&#x27;s a terrible narrative.  All that&#x27;s being illustrated here is that being low-status is the default, and success is a matter of luck, not of merit or hard work.<p>Capitalism doesn&#x27;t care how hard you work.  It doesn&#x27;t even care if you deserve the status you have (high or low).  It cares about money above all else, even more than you.')
