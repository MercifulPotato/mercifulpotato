It was good - not terribly faster than what I get here, or at least ... not faster such that I&#x27;d notice.  I suspect the price was cheaper, although unsure what the &#x27;big mac price&#x27; might be for people who live there day to day.<p>I have a 200 down &#x2F; 20 up connection at my office for $80&#x2F;month - roughly the same at home for ~$50&#x2F;month.  At home, we don&#x27;t normally get that unless actually wired in, as the wifi stuff around the house is bad (boosters don&#x27;t help much).  At the office, even over wifi, it can often be over the 200 - the wifi is probably a bottleneck there.<p>The town where the office is is offering &#x27;gigabit to the home&#x27;, but only in new construction homes.  The downtown spot I&#x27;m in won&#x27;t get upgrades for a while, from what I&#x27;m hearing.<p>I&#x27;m in the suburbs of a moderately large tech area, and almost rural by some measures.  That said, I know some friends a bit further out aren&#x27;t served very well at all, and are struggling with satellite connections as their last hope for &#x27;fast&#x27; internet (6-10m from what I remember).<p>&gt; I am surprised there&#x27;s not more backlash about this.<p>FWIW, we (USA) get hosed around on so many things (healthcare, net, etc) and are also fed a patriotic diet of &quot;America is the best&quot; growing up.  Because we&#x27;re so large and isolated, many folks never travel, and a couple generations ago, most didn&#x27;t have access to international publications&#x2F;media like we do today.  All that combines to give many of my fellow citizens a somewhat distorted view of our own standing and quality of life.  There&#x27;s little reason to &#x27;backlash&#x27; when you think you&#x27;re already &quot;the best&quot;.')
