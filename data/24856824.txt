I care about the spec to deny them forcing me to disclose the data.<p>I once tried to sign-up with Google an it asked me to allow (with no option to deny but continue) to share my specific personal details. I&#x27;ve cancelled and never used this technology ever since. I didn&#x27;t have to specify the same details (which Google was going to share) when signing-up with an e-mail address.<p>The spec should discourage sharing details beyond necessary, prevent any details from being shared silently and ensure user can always deny and continue.')
