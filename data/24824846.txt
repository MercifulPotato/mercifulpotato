Item(by='fogihujy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603101888, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24824579, text='&gt; Have you thought about the consequences if everyone bought furniture like that? There&#x27;s a reason why solid wood furniture is more expensive, it&#x27;s a LOT more resource intensive and wasteful during manufacturing. Imagine if everyone started buying all solid wood furniture tomorrow? How many more trees would be cut down? How much wood fiber left over from making other products would be wasted because people wouldn&#x27;t want it for furniture anymore?<p>What if I turn that argument around? What if people started buying solid wood furniture? It would result in an increased amount of wood being used in items where the carbon will remain in place for a very long time. The trees would be replaced with newly planted ones that sequester even more carbon, and so we end up with less carbon in the atmosphere.<p>Now, this obviously assumes that we can make the solid wood furniture with a small enough carbon footprint for this to work, but the general idea isn&#x27;t bad.')
