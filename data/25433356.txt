Prom queries can get somewhat complex and it&#x27;s not rare at all IME to have a dashboard making several multi-second queries per load (whether that falls into &quot;you&#x27;re using Prometheus wrong&quot; being a separate discussion of course)<p>Edit: The example from their pricing page:<p>&gt; We will assume you have 1 end user monitoring a dashboard for an average of 2 hours per day refreshing it every 60 seconds with 20 chart widgets per dashboard (assuming 1 PromQL query per widget)... assuming 18ms per query for this example.<p>Comes out to over $3 per month in query costs. Replace this 1 person with a TV showing the dashboard all day, and the cost jumps to $36, for just one dashboard and (again IME) overly fast query estimates... o.O')
