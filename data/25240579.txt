Independent research used to be much more common (with pretty great results: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Independent_scientist" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Independent_scientist</a>), and I think with the internet and remote work, there’s no reason it can’t make a comeback. To that end, I’ve been working on a platform to connect independent ML researchers to independent backers who can provide ongoing funding on a monthly basis (similar to a Substack or Patreon model). This is definitely a platform I’ll be interested in using myself, but I’m curious to see if others would be as well and to hear any feedback.')
