I think I was mildly depressed up until the start of this fall (I&#x27;m a college student). I go to U of I and we&#x27;ve got a pretty good covid testing setup which basically means we can hang out with small groups of friends like pre-covid times. I think the catalyst for coming out of depression might have been acid, but most likely it was being able to meet with friends again. I saw this effect in my friends too, and they noticed it as well. I&#x27;m not saying acid is some miracle cure or something but I have a strong suspicion that it contributed in some small way.')
