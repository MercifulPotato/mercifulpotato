Is there any material impact on the company finances? Currently it does not seem that it&#x27;s going to destroy their future sales and ongoing licencing revenue, and it does not seem that they are going to have any huge liabilities for negligence.<p>If anything, the consequences (or lack of them) to SolarWind  and other historical breaches are a good illustration that in the current business environment intentionally cutting corners on security is a smart move as it saves you money but if you get used to harm many others then you just shrug, do some apologetic PR and move on, and the impact of reputation damage is small and fleeting.')
