These can be very frustrating to anyone who is trying to clean their dataset in a reasonable amount of time.<p>There is a principle that I recently learnt about: It is called the 1-10-100 principle and it states that you will spend $1 to verify the quality of your dataset, $10 to clean each item in it and $100 to store each item that is not cleaned.\nWith this in mind, the task of having to manually work through the aforementioned irregularities become more than just a frustrating task; it becomes very expensive!<p>To help our clients combat this, we decided to introduce the power of fuzzy matching to the task of highlighting duplicates. Unlike most tools online, Flookup can work through the dirty data and shave off many hours from your workweek.\nWhen we &quot;tasted our own medicine&quot;, we reduced our task time from a week to 30 minutes and, ever since we released Flookup publicly, many users have reported experiencing the same benefits.<p>HOW WE DO IT: \nFlookup is a Google Sheets add-on&#x2F;toolkit for data cleaning by using advanced fuzzy matching and lookup techniques.\nIt can be used to highlight duplicates in 2 modes: by percentage similarity and by sound similarity.\nThe former calculates the percentage similarity between text in the dataset and then highlights those that satisfy the parameters set by the user. The latter uses the SOUNDEX algorithm to determine which text is similar.<p>HOW TO HIGHLIGHT DUPLICATES BY PERCENTAGE SIMILARITY: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getflookup.com&#x2F;documentation#h.p_ISj-lgqVN94u<p>HOW TO HIGHLIGHT DUPLICATES BY SOUND SIMILARITY: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.getflookup.com&#x2F;documentation#h.p_jWhuAaUhYZSk<p>Highlighting duplicates this way is much better than assuming that the dataset will be kind to you or your business. I invite you install Flookup today and try it for yourself; you will not be disappointed.')
