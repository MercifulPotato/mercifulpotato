I feel that no matter how they are planning to protect their brain-computer-interfaces, they will eventually fail at it (like it happens with any sufficiently complex technology). Once that happens, any dictator, autocrat or the &#x27;ethically-challenged tech bro du jour&#x27; will use them to gain unfettered access to the minds of people and wreak havoc on what makes people themselves. And good luck working against this once they can read your thoughts.')
