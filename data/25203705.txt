That would be Jesus and it&#x27;s surprising that they are so often confused.</i><p>Yep, that&#x27;s a good point.<p>But ... the thing about this, the article raises things to think about in the reader. But the fact selection and the approach is essentially a standard hit piece. I&#x27;m pretty sure the OP doesn&#x27;t know precisely the point you raise, that Marx and Engels didn&#x27;t pretend to be Jesus. And the author is writing to other assuming that showing Engels as Hedonist will sink his appeal.<p>But yes, the actual facts are more interesting than OP intends. But, as someone who other contexts moderates discussion, I think this has the problem of setting a bad example. People start to ask: &quot;If this 100% bad faith article results in good discussion, why can&#x27;t we do more of it? Why can&#x27;t I do it? Now everything from Turning Point USA and such is OK to post&quot; etc.<p>Which is to say, you&#x27;ve gotten some benefits and you&#x27;ve paid some costs. The benefits are some OK but not extraordinary discussions of Marx and Engels, the costs are confusing your moderation policy. Even though I&#x27;m sympathetic to generally positive discussion of Engels, I don&#x27;t think this is worth the cost. Just my rough calculation.')
