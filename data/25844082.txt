The very purpose why it was adopted by white supremacists is this confusion - this has been explicitly researched by human rights groups.<p>Of course, the symbol itself carries no white supremacist overtones, just like the swastika in itself does not carry any nazi symbolism (as opposed to, say, a crosssed out star of David, which would be an explicitly anti-semite symbol). However, it&#x27;s association with and repeated use by Nazi Germany is what gave it a nazi symbolism. Even for such a widely reviled symbol, there are still non-taboo uses. In particular, a left-facing swastika (sauwastika) is a common Buddhist symbol, found often in Asian media with no Nazi connotation. That means that a bald person waving a swastika flag could either be a nazi skin head, or a buddhist monk - context will usually tell you which.<p>This is similar to &quot;states rights&quot; rhetoric - it has both its literal sense, the discussion of the amount of power states should have vs the federal government; but it also refers more specifically to the &quot;right&quot; to slavery the civil war was fought over. When you hear someone speak about it, you need more context to know which sense is being used.<p>Human language is complicated like this.')
