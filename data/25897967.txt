The community solar sells S units to somebody else, credits me with the monetary proceeds of the sale (and possibly a share of the associated Renewable Energy Credit proceeds), and charges me 90% of that &quot;accounting fiction&quot;. They make money off the difference between the rates they invoice me for and the wholesale rates they actually sell the energy for (via a PPA or something).<p>I still argue that (N+S) units of energy are actually generated. The original generator of N units has no knowledge of the community solar arrangement, and is producing the N units of energy. Unless the community solar is lying about producing S units of energy -- remember, they are never disclosing S, only the associated monetary amount -- they too are selling S units to somebody else at a wholesale rate but getting their cash flow augmented by invoicing me. \nWhat a tangled web of cashflows!<p>I think that a PV array on the roof is preferable in situations where a purchaser is able to do that. Less financial engineering, and more physics! YMMV.')
