One day was Disney costumes, one day was &quot;Sports&quot; one day was superheros, another day was animals, final day was scary costumes.  Each daughter ran a department and both had personal shoppers and stylists on call who procured all of their costumes.  Meanwhile the rank and file was all complaining what a pain it was to come in with different costumes for 5 days in a row.  One of the days I &quot;won&quot; the daily costume contest and my prize was a used 1st generation iPad that one of the founders family members no longer needed because they got the newest version.  It still had their old data on it, they didn&#x27;t even wipe it.')
