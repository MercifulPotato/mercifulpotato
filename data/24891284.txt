In either case, the information is being released now for the explicit goal of altering the outcome of the election in favor of those who are releasing it.<p>We haven&#x27;t had this issue in history before: it&#x27;s never been so easy to reach so many people with such bad information. This places intermediaries, including Twitter, in an awkward situation: they can &quot;censor&quot; by restricting access to intentionally misleading information; or they can release it, and thereby become pawns of the bad actors who propagate it.<p>As has been pointed out, this is a moral issue. We should step pretending that all censorship is bad, and that compelling intermediaries to publish literally everything is a moral good.')
