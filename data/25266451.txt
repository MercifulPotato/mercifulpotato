Alternatively, a company who needed them only a handful of days a year for some reason I canâ€™t immediately think of.<p>Otherwise I agree. 24 hour minimum removes immediate scaling as an option, and for anyone who already has their own infrastructure the cost is prohibitively high. My hope would be that with time, at the very least the 24 hour minimum would eventually be removed, and ideally the price will come down too.')
