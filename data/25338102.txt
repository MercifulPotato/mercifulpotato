Presumably at least partially due to previous handouts of the universal service fund being used for broadband. So I assume the higher tier rollouts are in similar situations.<p>For example there is a rural co-op that covers a number of the towns just west of where I live. The towns actually have better service than I do (cheaper, and faster) because the entire town is a mile or two along a major highway, and a few rows of residential streets. The density is at least as good as the suburban area I live in for a square mile or so.<p>Drive a few miles out of town though, and your on some kind of wireless or sat service.')
