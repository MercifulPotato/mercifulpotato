My point isn&#x27;t that these tools can get the job done, but that I see too many people praising them because they can get the job done. There is a difference between done and useful. I can throw together a market model in excel quite fast and easily, its &quot;done&quot;. It might even be useful in your case, but please don&#x27;t give high praise to it because no real world task has ever ended with that task. Everything you will create, especially software will be reused. That&#x27;s the whole point and power of software. These tools make it incredibly hard to reuse anything. I think we should have higher standards for our tools, especially when whole companies are being built on it (don&#x27;t think google here, think portfolio management companies and Excel).<p>Edit: I would like to include an example of a spoon. I can bash in a small nail using it, it will not be good, but it will be done. It will stick one piece of wood to another. but would you praise the spoon as a hammer replacement?')
