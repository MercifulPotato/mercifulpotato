You can use them both to build chat systems; you can use them both to build pubsub systems; each comes with different tradeoffs. Matrix has a deliberately extensive &#x27;kitchen sink&#x27; baseline of functionality; XMPP has a deliberately minimal baseline set of functionality. If XMPP does what you need it to do, then we&#x27;re genuinely happy for you! Meanwhile, rather than competing, an XMPP Bridge like Skaverat&#x27;s xmpptrix beta or jfred&#x27;s matrix-xmpp-bridge or Matrix.org&#x27;s own purple-matrix has potential to let both environments coexist and make the most of each other&#x27;s benefits.<p>The whole area of XMPP vs Matrix is quite subjective. Rather than fighting over which open interoperable communication standard works the best, we should just collaborate and bridge everything together. The more federation and interoperability the better.')
