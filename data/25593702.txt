This article assumes that if you are doing this in a corporate or datacenter environment, that all of your engineers have vast experience.  Even then, some of the tweaks mentioned will require making changes and rebooting to debug some problems.<p>Not only should people read up on and understand the implications of each change, but also do &quot;battle testing&quot; before doing this in production.  That means going beyond functional testing you might get from a CI&#x2F;CD environment and instead letting this bake in a staging environment for a few months first.  It needs to be an environment with real traffic, real workloads, but low service level agreement and low revenue impact for an extended period of time.<p>As an aside, I can tell they have not tested some of the things they are suggesting.  The first obvious one that pops out is the changes to &#x2F;proc in fstab.  That won&#x27;t do anything on 100% of linux distros, as &#x2F;proc gets mounted by the init process.  That has to be done in a init script as a &quot;remount&quot;.  Also, the &quot;ipv6.disable=1&quot; in the kernel options is not advised.  Do this in sysctl and in the network scripts, or some things may break depending on how your system is being used.  The ipv6 module is used for more than ipv6.  There are also some kernel options that change in kernel 5.x that this article does not mention.  The ulimit settings will not apply to systemd processes and will not apply to root.  They mention disabling debugfs, but not binfmt.  If I had to pick a more dangerous thing to disable it would be binfmt, which brings in dangerous concepts from Windows 95&#x2F;98.  I need to stop reading this or I will spend all day writing notes on the gotchas.')
