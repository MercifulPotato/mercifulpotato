If our ideas are good, don&#x27;t we want the most number of people to know them?<p>What if PL research isn&#x27;t getting the population of people and ideas it desires? Look to organizations that have been around longer with even more inscrutable forms of knowledge, how well do they age and evolve?<p>I think there is a lot more at play here when it comes to optimizing for beginners. Imagine if we had metalanguages for conveying knowledge and that we could distill common subjects from 6 years -&gt; 6 weeks -&gt; 6 hours -&gt; 6 minutes.  Or tooling that allowed us to write in both the Simple English Wikpedia, the standard and at the expert level at the same time? Or refactored our writing so it was in the Inverted Pyramid [1], automatically generating tl;drs and keeping our long winded posts on track?<p>Wouldn&#x27;t that be amazing.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Inverted_pyramid_(journalism)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Inverted_pyramid_(journalism)</a>')
