Item(by='dastx', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610755870, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25797070, text='Previously the only way I&#x27;ve had of keeping in touch with family back home was Facebook, in addition, most of my university life (late 00s&#x2F;early 10s) was done through Facebook. I got rid of Facebook for a couple years, and nothing fell apart. People were still able to stay in touch with me (through WhatsApp, email and text messages), and maybe I didn&#x27;t go to as many parties as before, but I still went to more than enough.<p>Later on, I signed up to Facebook again (for all the wrong reasons), and not much changed in that communication was mostly off Facebook because that&#x27;s what my acquaintances and I had established.<p>I got rid of Facebook again not long after. Then a few years ago I moved into a new property where, just like you, the first thing they asked me is if I had Facebook so I can be added to building&#x27;s group. I politely told them I do not, and what do you know, the landlord was still able to keep us up to date with announcements and everything else.<p>I&#x27;m sure my situations isn&#x27;t the same as yours, and I do believe that you&#x27;re in a worse situation than I was in that sense. Certainly, I don&#x27;t disagree that it&#x27;s hard to leave a service when everyone else is on it.<p>However, something has to give.<p>Your utility provider will find a way to tell you that you owe them money. The movers will find a way to talk to you to get his business. When they ask for a location, and you send the address instead anyway, they&#x27;ll copy and paste it.<p>Maybe I have an oversimplified view of the world, because quite frankly, here in the UK, there is a lot of convenience and professionalism.<p>Regardless, I&#x27;ve messed up a lot when it comes to privacy in the past, and I&#x27;d rather not continue those same mistakes. I&#x27;ve come to learn to value my privacy, and I encourage everyone around me to value theirs, so I lead by example. I implore you to do the same, because your privacy is important. It&#x27;ll be hard, but it&#x27;ll be worth it.')
