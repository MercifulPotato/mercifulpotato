It is a free and open universal standard identifier we built so that data pertaining to places can be shared across organizations easily.<p>A Placekey is a short identifier that has Address and POI sections detailing What is at a place and a section describing Where on the globe the place is. Eventually, there will be a Placekey for every place in the world, even those without postal addresses. US geospatial data from a large array of partners https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.placekey.io&#x2F;partners can already be associated and cross-referenced using Placekey. By allowing every place to be represented by a canonical string, data scientists and researchers can easily join datasets and share geospatial information with each other.<p>Generating a Placekey will always be free, whether you do so using https:&#x2F;&#x2F;placekey.io or the API available at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.placekey.io. And storing a Placekey is permitted for any reason, whether you want to cache it, use it to exchange information with someone else, or to fulfill any other purpose you can think of.<p>Finally, any requests you make to the Placekey API are completely private. They will be used to improve Placekey&#x27;s matching and resolution, but will never be shared with or sold to third parties.<p>Some more details are in our:<p>* FAQ - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;placekey.io&#x2F;faq<p>* API Documentation - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.placekey.io&#x2F;<p>Try generating one at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;placekey.io&#x2F;  No signup required.\nLet us know your thoughts!')
