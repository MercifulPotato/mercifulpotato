But now without evidence of any measurable improvement Unilever suddenly feels like Facebook is &quot;fixed&quot;.<p>More likely is Unilever thinks with the US presidential election over and Trump out there won&#x27;t be such a big &quot;hate for profit&quot; backlash anymore. They probably don&#x27;t want to miss out on the revenue the Facebook ad&#x27;s generated.')
