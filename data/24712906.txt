It&#x27;s one of the things that has always confused me a little about Subaru, since they seem like they&#x27;ve been really well-placed to take advantage of the transition to electric vehicles. A lot of their customer base cares about things like the environment, usually has some degree of disposable income (they&#x27;re not the cheapest car on the market) and places a high value on areas like reliability and simple functionality. Electric cars already are supposed to require less maintenance than your average ICE vehicle, and the four-cylinder boxer engine&#x2F;CVT combo isn&#x27;t exactly known as a hotrod combo either, so it&#x27;s not as if the need to satisfy their customer base on 0-60mph time anway (for that type of car, ignore the WRX for a moment).<p>If they made a Crosstrek&#x2F;Forester-type vehicle with 300-400 miles of all-electric range, kept the ground clearance, roof rack, and usual interiors, I&#x27;ve always imagined that those vehicles would sell like hotcakes. I know I&#x27;d be interested in immediately trading up, in a way that I probably won&#x27;t be otherwise for a long time.')
