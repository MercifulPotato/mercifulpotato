I think it&#x27;s simpler to do this kind of backup in case things go wrong (which, honestly, is not that often. Twice in 5 years that I can think of off the top of my head) than it is to set up kubernetes, manage kubernetes, and convert our applications to work correctly in kubernetes. All of that is required so that your single line edit becomes a possibility. That&#x27;s a lot of work to enable that workflow versus copying 5 directories to one location, zipping it, slapping a version tag on the zip file, storing it in a couple of places.')
