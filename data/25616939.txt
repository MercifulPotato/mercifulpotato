This is a left-over memory of when GPUs weren’t using IEEE 754 compatible floating point. That changed a long time ago, and today all GPUs are absolutely up to par with the IEEE standards. GPUs even took the lead for a while with the FMA instruction that was more accurate than what CPUs had, and Intel and other have since added FMA instructions to their CPUs.')
