Item(by='manfredo', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609959709, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25659262, text='What sort of &quot;quirks&quot; are we talking about?<p>&gt; interrupting me&#x2F;talking over me, talking down to me, comparing their last junior position to being Steve Jobs, being sing-songy, inappropriate jokes in any way&#x2F;shape&#x2F;form, getting in arguments with themselves... etc etc.<p>Besides being &quot;sing-songy&quot;, none of these things are quirks, they&#x27;re ineffective communication or untruthfulness of their past positions.<p>As far as dress and &quot;sing-songy&quot; go, I would agree with the above poster: software development tends to be much more inclusive of these sorts of characteristics. Jeans and a T-shirt is perfectly acceptable attire for an interview. Do your software devs wear suits 5 days a week? Why expect a candidate to do so, either? A candidate I interviewed going, &quot;uh-oh sphaghetti-oh!&quot; when they hit a segfault when running their interviewing solution was kind of ridiculous, but ultimately has no impact on their contributions as a developer. Factoring in these kinds of thins into the hiring decisions is ultimately about including people from a culture similar to your own. Different cultures have different definitions of &quot;weirdness&quot; so selecting based on the ability of the candidate to identify what is &quot;weirdness&quot; is ultimately a cultural litmus test. And expecting male candidates to be shaved, as per your other comment, is just blatant cultural discrimination - some demographics like Sikhs could even sue you for illegal discrimination over this. This cuts both ways, both the case where a candidate in a T-shirt and jeans gets rejected for not wearing a suit and when a suited up candidate gets rejected for being too formal. Both ultimately hurt the company by excluding effective workers.')
