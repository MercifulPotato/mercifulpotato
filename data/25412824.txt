Item(by='bnj', descendants=None, kids=[25412974], score=None, time=1607912540, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25412034, text='It seems to me that the purpose of numbers over character codes is to constrain the available identifiers to force you to define a fairly small set of broad areas (you only have ten) and drill down within that. When we release that restriction and go with categories I think that would lead to making more and more categories with fuzzy overlap -- and that overlap is precisely what you don&#x27;t want in a filing system where (unlike labels or tags) each item must have one and only one location.<p>You went on to mention labels and tags as a solution there -- but the point here is to implement the structure in a common filing system, isn&#x27;t it? Your point works fine for email, but for documents on my drive tags don&#x27;t seem like a great approach because at least on my machine even though tagging is an option, it&#x27;s not robust and reliable.<p>It didn&#x27;t feel totally fair to say that the author needed to address search more; the ability to search doesn&#x27;t go away when you implement a system like this, it&#x27;s still a powerful tool available to you if you know what you&#x27;re searching for. If you don&#x27;t know, then a system like this is a good way to explore the topics and assets in your file tree in a way that allows you to discover collections of related files.<p>Lastly, true that you can assign a unique ID -- but again, isn&#x27;t that introducing and solving a different problem? Uniquely addressing every file might be a really useful thing, but as you mentioned, there&#x27;s no context clue to help you decode B75AE2 -- you would need a lookup table. Even then, presumably you would want to know which categories and families that file should belong to.<p>Overall, everything you listed here is thought provoking and I think points out some of the limitations of the way our digital file systems emulate physical ones, but this collection of objections isn&#x27;t persuasive that the Johnny decimal system isn&#x27;t a good idea.')
