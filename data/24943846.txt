I just think it&#x27;s not so useful to compare jet to non-divergent colormaps. Any divergent colormap would look bad on a photograph of a human, which seems to be the main evidence provided in this paper.<p>In a deleted reply to my comment, a user referenced a paper by Borkin [1], that actually compares the quality of decisions made using jet vs other divergent colormaps. Jet loses. It&#x27;s a shame this sort of argument wasn&#x27;t included in the ncomms article, because imo it would do a much better job of convincing people who like jet.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eecs.harvard.edu&#x2F;~kgajos&#x2F;papers&#x2F;2011&#x2F;borkin11-infoviz.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eecs.harvard.edu&#x2F;~kgajos&#x2F;papers&#x2F;2011&#x2F;borkin11-in...</a>')
