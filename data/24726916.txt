A process patent is a form of utility patent that covers methods of changing the functionality or characteristics of a material during a particular use. The patent-holder is granted exclusive protections and rights to that process for 20 years.<p>When one patents a business method or, in some cases, a computer program, this is a form of patenting a process. It&#x27;s now possible to patent subscription-based services, targeted advertising networks, online auction sites, portal sites, email systems, and even discussion forums.<p>As our society has evolved, intellectual property (IP) issues have evolved along with it. What constitutes IP these days is so much more than the newest machine or physical invention. Today we have genetically modified seeds, new strands of DNA, computer software, chemical formulae, and more. As these issues become more complex, patent law has to evolve to address new concerns. For example, one can now patent business models and software through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).&quot;<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.upcounsel.com&#x2F;can-you-patent-a-process" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.upcounsel.com&#x2F;can-you-patent-a-process</a>')
