You are also limited to the APIs Apple provides. And if you want to publish that code, you have to get it approved by Apple. Otherwise you are stuck distributing source code that other people have to pay X$ for a dev account and resign every 7 days.<p>All of this is not applicable to other platforms (maybe to consoles but I already commented about them on this thread).')
