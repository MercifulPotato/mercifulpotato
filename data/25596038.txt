Item(by='ipython', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609442119, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25594851, text='The US based companies will make the argument that they aren&#x27;t liable for the infringement made by the third-party &quot;lead generation&quot; companies that they employ. They will argue that they have no way to police their actions, and therefore should not be held liable for any illegal activity.<p>What&#x27;s worse are the scammers who call from the &quot;social security administration&quot; trying to get you to wire them thousands and thousands of $$. They are quite insidious, sophisticated, and can sniff out even the slightest misstep you make when you try to string them along. I have heard stories, second-hand, of senior citizens who were scammed out of tens of thousands of dollars through schemes like this. It&#x27;s abhorrent.<p>Source: I sued a home security company who made the above argument re: using a third-party lead generation company in person with me at the local courthouse during settlement talks. I did manage to get him to settle for several thousand $$ anyway, plus he had to travel several hundred miles to make an 8am Monday court appointment, so I figure that&#x27;s a win.')
