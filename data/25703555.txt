Item(by='Timpy', descendants=None, kids=[25704708], score=None, time=1610219781, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25702881, text='&quot;o-nii-chan&quot; is a great example of translation difficulty because it&#x27;s very natural in Japanese to refer to your older brother as &quot;o-nii-chan&quot; and it sounds like bad exposition writing in English.')
