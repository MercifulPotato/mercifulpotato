Thank you for sharing your project with the open source community.<p>I just starred it, it does seem like it&#x27;d alleviate a some of the pain. Another similar (more end to end) project I had come across is: geckos.io. This previous HN thread[1] discusses some of the (at least perceived) difficulty with using WebRTC as a &quot;WebSockets but UDP&quot; solution.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I follow the concern about congestion control. UDP doesn&#x27;t have it either, presumably since if you&#x27;re building an application that requires such latency sensitivity, you don&#x27;t mind rolling your own congestion control algorithm that makes most sense given your application&#x27;s specific needs, right? Pretty much all FPS games do this, as far as I understand.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;geckosio&#x2F;geckos.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;geckosio&#x2F;geckos.io</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23666679" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=23666679</a>')
