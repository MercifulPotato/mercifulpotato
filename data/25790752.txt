I think a lot of them think in terms of &quot;if spend X amount I have to work Y more days before retirement&quot;. At least I try to do that. The problem is I don&#x27;t really know how to calculate Y, if your plugin could translate the dollar amount on the checkout page to the number of days I have to work extra that would be really cool.<p>This of course depends on my savings rate, current assets and expected return on investments.<p>Either way, cool stuff!')
