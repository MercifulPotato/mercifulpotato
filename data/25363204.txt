Hear me out. So many categories of books (business, psychology) could more effectively communicate their core thesis to a lay audience via 40-90 pages[0]. A long article. But the economics basically require the author to format as a 200-400 page book, resulting in the kinds of filler this post suggests.<p>I realize I could read a summary online, but that takes the interpreted benefit without directly rewarding the actual author. I am paying for the ideas, not the length, and would love to reward the most efficient way to deliver that.<p>[0] Obviously I realize there are many great exceptions to this tongue-in-cheek take on the market.')
