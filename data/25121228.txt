I am super excited to be here and share what we have been working on.<p>Hashnode helps developers start a personal blog on their own domain for free and find readership from an active dev community.<p>We realized that traditional publishing platforms offer visibility and engagement at the cost of content ownership. On the other hand if you go with a self hosted solution, your articles don&#x27;t get proper visibility and reach. Hashnode combines the best of both worlds. It lets you map a custom domain and publish articles under your own branding and also distributes them to a built in developer community.<p>We launched in June this year and have been growing 30% in different KPIs month over month. So, it has been a crazy ride so far.<p>Seeing strong word of mouth and traction! We have curated some of the testimonials here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hashnode.com&#x2F;testimonials" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hashnode.com&#x2F;testimonials</a><p>I would love to know what you think!')
