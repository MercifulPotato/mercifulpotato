What is being lumped in as part of rationalism and why? Are we talking post Renaissance? Post Enlightenment? Contemporary? The Greeks were not reasoning people? Of the architecture that is praised here, what makes these pieces so irrational, and what makes the critiqued pieces rational? We could talk about the literal 18th century Age of “Reason“ to start, but the art there was quite Neoclassical (and aesthetic per the criteria of this essay I suppose) and Realist. Le Corbusier and the modernists had some peculiar ideas against decoration yes, but surely we’re about a century past that? So much of the postmodern world has been critiqued, on the contrary, for being shallow and image obsessed and post-truth. A lot of art now is permitted to be non-aesthetic and that’s a whole separate concept. What happened to the arguably recent developments that are in between the extremes of modern Brutalism and say, the tedium of Medieval religious art (if we really want a reference point for pre-reason): art for art’s sake, beauty is truth, pure formalism, maximalism? Beauty and wonder did not suddenly die when reason was “discovered” (whenever that was). Let’s not romanticize ye olden days.')
