Financial health and personal health are both important.<p>I&#x27;ve been programming for 43 years (since I was kid) and worked as a programmer for about 20 years. In the last 17 years, I&#x27;ve seen the switch from <i>exploration, creativity, open-ended thinking</i> to this new thing called &quot;tech.&quot; I am not a &quot;tech.&quot; I guess I&#x27;ve <i>quit tech</i>, and won&#x27;t become a &quot;tech.&quot; I miss working as a programmer - I had pretty good jobs. Beware as workplaces in other industries can be much more toxic.<p>From what I gather, no one is hiring programmers:  &quot;the programming part is easy&quot;, &quot;solo programmers need not apply&quot;, &quot;scrum&quot;, buzzwords, horrible marketing, bad management, and worse.  I have a day job not in &quot;tech&quot;, and not as a programmer.  On the side, I program for me.  I read and post what&#x27;s interesting to me on Hacker News and other programming sites.')
