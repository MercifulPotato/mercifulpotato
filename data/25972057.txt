Then there are 1x engineers using the rare skill of actually trying reasonably hard and having discipline. (These 1x engineers may eventually experience a significant life disruption, mental or physical illness, or simply lose the feeling of meaning from the work, and subsequently become 0.1x engineers temporarily or permanently.) There may be actual 10x engineers for short stretches. I may have been something like this for a short period in grad school when I was obsessed, skilled, healthy and knowledgeable all at the same time. But Iâ€™m certainly not anymore.')
