People by and large don&#x27;t get into unrecoverable student loan debt because they are low performers. Many of them achieve excellent grades. Their work is simply not compensated. So here in your metaphor, you have made a demon out of the victim.<p>&gt; How about we run that again the next 2 weeks. What are you going to do?<p>Again, this metaphor has strayed from the reality it is meant to compare to. Student loan forgiveness isn&#x27;t a perpetual system. It&#x27;s an N time deal. N increases during the time it takes to overhaul our failed higher education system. Because we are motivated to keep N low, we are motivated to quickly overhaul our failed higher education system.<p>&gt; Your boss, at the delivery meeting, says, actually, this was just a motivational exercise to get us to practice coding and teamwork<p>Notice how even in your metaphor, you are victimizing your teammate when it is clearly your boss who is at fault. That part of the metaphor tracts quite well with reality. In reality, you are blaming the student when the universities and stagnant wages are to blame.<p>&gt; And that they be called &quot;selfish&quot; for thinking so.<p>Indeed it might be.')
