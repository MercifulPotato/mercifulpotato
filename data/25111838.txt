No genetic vaccine has ever been widely deployed. As a young healthy person who could yet have more children, I’d rather get covid than take a genetic vaccine that might affect me or my offspring.<p>DNA vaccines have never been deployed because of serious concerns about the patient’s genes being modified by the vaccine. Scientists are saying they’re “sure” that mRNA vaccines can’t do that, but that seems overly sanguine. There is still so much we don’t know about genetics. How can you possibly have that certainty when observed epigenetic effects, for example, challenge many of our preconceived notions about the body’s genetic machinery but are so poorly understood. It seems that at least some processes currently thought to be “one-way” are actually not.')
