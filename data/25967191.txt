This is basic research that could potentially lead to a therapy, or it could merely lead to a marginal improvement. Most of science is like this, massive Deep Learning style leaps are relatively uncommon.<p>2) The research is about a group of chemical structures called <i>Porphyrins</i>, commonly found as part of a human proteins. They are apparently a good fit as delivery vehicles to send anti cancer drugs into cells. Apparently these particular chemical structures have inherent anti-cancer properties too. This is a very simplified explanation and I have not read the paper itself. This is a chemistry&#x2F;biochemistry paper as much as it is a biology paper.')
