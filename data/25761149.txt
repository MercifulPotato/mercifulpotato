Add a group equal to 33% of representatives and senators to both congressional chambers that are filled via a jury-pool like system of common people with a term of one congressional session. Participants would earn equal pay as other representatives and service would be equivalent to national guard duty, where employers have to hold your position open for your return. Would need to apply at state level as well for full effect. Participants can serve only once and must not have an active affiliation with one of the other political parties. It eliminates majority party leadership as the entire body has to vote on a leader they all can get behind, which allows for a less obstructive path for legislation and fair debate for all policy and spending.<p>Such a change would force traditional parties and this neutral group of citizens to compromise on all legislation removing extreme policies from the equation. Because legislation has a direct effect on this neutral body and there terms are short, career politician agendas and &quot;loss of connection&quot; to the common needs of citizens is virtually eliminated. It would also eliminate the us vs them ideology, as common citizens become an actual party to the governmental process and have skin in the game from their own participation in the process.<p>The 33% solution provides the biggest bang for the buck with the least impact to current government structures and election processes.')
