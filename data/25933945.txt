I saw 4 powerful combative &quot;investors&quot; holding ordinary folks in their fists, playing with their lives, and sometimes even verbally abusing them. The show offers a lottery ticket on top of the lottery ticket out of day-to-day work that is creating a new business. What invention the participants bring is commodified a second time, a double grotesquerie. I absolutely can&#x27;t stand it, and the show, in teaching viewers to hold unsuccessful contestants in contempt, also promotes a sort of circus-like misanthropy.')
