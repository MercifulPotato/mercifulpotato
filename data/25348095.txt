Filesystems are databases, MongoDB is a database. LevelDB is a database. Postgres and MySQL are databases. Kafka is a database. They are all very different in features and functionality though.<p>What the authors mean is that kafka is not a traditional database and doesn&#x27;t solve the same problems that traditional databases solve. Which is a useful distinction to make but is not the distinction they make.<p>The reality is that database is now a very general term and for many usecases you can choose to special purpose databases for what you need.')
