We stopped doing that with version 0.7 as we realized we could not introduce any breaking changes without risking to break the websites of all users that were using the &quot;latest&quot; version. So what we do know is that we only automatically update minor releases, i.e. we have a &quot;0.7&quot; tag in the CDN that will receive patch releases (0.7.1, 0.7.2 , ...) and which users can safely embed in their websites.<p>That said we always recommend users to self-host their scripts as well and to use integrity tags whenever possible, it&#x27;s usually better from a security and privacy perspective as well.<p>Like most JS libraries Klaro is quite small (45 kB compressed), so the loading time is dominated by the connection roundtrip time, which again is dominated by the TLS handshake time. For our main servers in Germany we have a roundtrip ping of around 20 ms (for most connections from Germany), and with the TLS negotiation it takes about 60-100 ms to serve the script file from our server. If the server connection is already open that time reduces to 20-40 ms. So the benefit of hosting small scripts with your main website content is that your browser doesn&#x27;t have to do another TLS handshake with the CDN, which for small scripts can dominate the transfer time. If you then use modern HTTP &amp; TLS versions you can reduce the transfer time quite a bit.')
