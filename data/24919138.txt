I don&#x27;t do a lot of maker&#x2F;tinkering stuff so having the chip loose or on a breadboard wouldn&#x27;t work for me in most situations. But I do sometimes have a need for an oscilloscope or multimeter, and would gladly pay ~$50 for one that had a case and some basic&#x2F;standard connections, especially if it&#x27;s supported by open software like yours.<p>Edit: I still bought one as is, lol.')
