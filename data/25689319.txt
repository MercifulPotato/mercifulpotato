What happened to the tether issued on bitcoin cash blockchain through omni after the fork of bitcoin?<p>A tether fork can be &#x27;backed by tether.&#x27; The issuer of forked tether would accept 1 tether for one new tether fork. this issuer immediately sells tether to get the risk off their books through an exchange while liquidity exists. When redeeming the tether fork ppl can either get back tether or ~ 1 us dollar. So you effectively have front running the inevitable tether bank run. Sure they have to put trust in this new tether fork. \nYou can steal tether&#x27;s customers that are worried and since the feds seem to have a blind eye towards a company that isn&#x27;t a bank and is most likely practicing fractional reserve lending, you let the free market &#x27;regulate&#x27; tether.')
