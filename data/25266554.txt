Drive from California to Texas some time, and count the windmills.  Those were subsidized at about the same time as solyndra.<p>From what I could tell from reading placards on the sides of the (many) convoys that deliver more on a daily basis, they’re mostly made by GE.<p>Similarly, rooftop solar was bootstrapped on top of those subsidies (though the Chinese won the panel manufacturing part of that industry, the US did well on battery technology).<p>Also, this hasn’t been so much a brief push as a sporadic push.  The three blade giant windmill design was invented during California’s big wind power push in the early eighties.')
