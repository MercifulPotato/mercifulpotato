All of things in that list are off-topic or outright against the law; nobody wants to receive those things.  The topic is and always was removal of unpopular speech that is<p>1) on-topic<p>2) between consenting parties who consciously wanted to send and receive those messages<p>3) mostly not illegal.  (Yes, of course, the illegal parts should have been prosecuted.)<p>The fact that the discussion being deplatformed is unpopular or deplorable still doesn&#x27;t justify a uninvolved third-party stepping in to disrupt it.')
