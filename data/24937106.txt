It has four flourescent tubes tuned to optimally emit UVB for vitamin D creation.  It comes with safety goggles that have to be worn when using it.  You have to stay 17&quot; away from the lamp when it is on.  Sperti says it is the only FDA approved vitamin D lamp in the USA.\nIt&#x27;s expensive but apparently the only one of its kind at the moment, until the UVB LED&#x27;s take over the market.')
