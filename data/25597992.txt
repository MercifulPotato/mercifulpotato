A lot of the focus is on visual programming, end user programming, esoteric languages and no code&#x2F;low code. Lobster.rs as suggested is pretty good for general technical discussion but graphics on a non-surface level rarely comes up.<p>For graphics and C++ Twitter is probably the best option, follow some important graphics folks (say Peter Shirley, Angelo Pesce or John Carmack) and you&#x27;ll get some interesting threads. There are also some good graphics programming Reddits. A lot of the best discussion happens in invite only places for me now, having some contacts in the industry helps there.')
