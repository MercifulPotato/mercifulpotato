It is a great framework, but I&#x27;ve found much more productivity with Elixir after just 1 year of using it. C# still suffers from statefulness, null references, and boilerplate code, even after newer versions of the language provide some tools to reduce those.<p>F# is a good alternative to C# if you want to stay in the .NET ecosystem and reap the benefits of functional programming, but I found the compiler to be very slow, 3rd libraries poorly documented, the language excessively complex, and 3rd party IDE support to be limited (as of version 2.0 anyway).<p>Is developer productivity still a focus of .NET?')
