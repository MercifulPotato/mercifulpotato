It&#x27;s a form of conspiratorial thinking.<p>Getting your product to the front page of HN &quot;organically&quot; has gotta be worth a lot, and it would be pretty strange if nothing on the front page was there via some less organic association.<p>It&#x27;s not about disagreement or conspiracies, just that everyone talks like they&#x27;re selling you things now even if they just own the thing and aren&#x27;t being paid or intentionally &#x27;influencing&#x27;. And I remember when it wasn&#x27;t like that - even on reddit. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an intentional thing (which would be your conspiratorial  thinking) so much as an emergent property of large, anonymous, loosely connected groups of people where some of the people are <i>only</i> there to sell stuff, which just so happens to be convenient if you&#x27;re there to sell.')
