Item(by='sdwolfz', descendants=None, kids=[25026061], score=None, time=1604842575, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25025588, text='I live in the UK and have used 5 banking apps so far (not all of them at the same time):<p>- Barclays (App won&#x27;t work with LineageOS, website is horrible).<p>- Monzo (App only, no website, works with LineageOS).<p>- Revolut (App only, no website, works with LineageOS).<p>- TransferWise (Web and App, both work well, but never tried it on LineageOS).<p>- ING Home Bank (App won&#x27;t work with LineageOS, website is manageable, but still a pain compared to the app).<p>Of course I don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to use any of these, but there are clear advantages to using any of them, depending on the situation (you wouldn&#x27;t take a mortgage from TransferWise, split bills with Barclays, and hold foreign currency in Monzo, mainly because they don&#x27;t support that). Also you don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to use a phone, just walk around without one, make people email you instead of calling, and ask people for directions instead of looking at a GPS map.<p>My point is, I paid for my phone (me alone, nobody else chipped in) so I want to use every feature it provides without restrictions, as it is my property. That goes for both taking screenshots and using apps. And when it&#x27;s not possible, I look for alternatives. Right now none are practical, nor feasible, so all I got left are tricks like scrcpy and rants on forums ;).')
