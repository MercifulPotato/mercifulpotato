(This is a bit like saying &quot;Just learn vim!&quot; in terms of learning curve, since the curve is basically a wall, but it&#x27;s well worth it.)<p>E.g. I was curious how TPUs actually work -- the low-level protocol, built on protobufs. But burp suite is only good for analyzing HTTP. No worries, a couple plugins later and I was good to go: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;theshawwn&#x2F;status&#x2F;1315638127772405761" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;theshawwn&#x2F;status&#x2F;1315638127772405761</a><p>You&#x27;d be shocked the amount of information you get when you merely look at the traffic. Chrome devtools is nice, of course, but it&#x27;s not an intercepting proxy; you can&#x27;t (easily) capture every request, modify it, replay it, see how the webserver responds to malformed input, etc. Burp repeater makes all of that super easy.<p>Unfortunately the power is hidden behind a rather unfriendly UI, with some unfriendly defaults (the very first thing everyone wonders is, &quot;why did burp cause my website to freeze?&quot; answer: it starts up in intercept mode, so that&#x27;s actually a sign that things are working; but you have to turn off intercept mode to actually get it to do useful things &#x2F; see a bunch of requests).<p>Emacs users might feel at home, at least. :)')
