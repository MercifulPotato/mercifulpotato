So we can throw those out.  They&#x27;re irrelevant to the platform problem if the platform didn&#x27;t create them (amplification is not relevant either in my mind).<p>So then, did users &quot;choose&quot; censored, algorithmic ones.  Technically... but I think the nature of the censoring and the algorithms changed.  It went from pulling spam and porn to pulling &quot;harmful&quot; content.  The algorithm went from &quot;WHERE user_id IN ...&quot; to &quot;curation&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t think those things are necessarily bad or evil.  But these things started as open platforms to connect everyone.  Now they&#x27;re reverting to &quot;communities&quot; and people are adapting.  People are forming &quot;communities&quot; on different &quot;platforms&quot;.<p>The whole social media marketplace is so muddled and ripe for disruption.  Network effects are bogus.
