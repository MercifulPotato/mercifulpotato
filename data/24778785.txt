It was easier back then, especially since I was moving to Gmail, which was miles ahead of Yahoo&#x27;s interface at the time. I don&#x27;t even remember when I stopped checking my Yahoo account, nor when it was automatically disabled because I didn&#x27;t log in for too long.<p>About two years ago I started moving away from Gmail, and that was a lot harder. I kept checking but eventually had to just set up a vacation responder. I still check it about once every couple months, but to truly move away from an email address, you have to <i>really</i> stop using it.')
