We&#x27;re two engineers who started this project ~6 months ago because we love good APIs and good toolkits that boost overall productivity. We&#x27;ll be around here to answer questions.\nAt this point, the product is still in a very early alpha stage, but we are eagerly looking forward to your feedback on technical features as well as on a scalable business model.<p>Our short term goal is to get involved in a paid project that would require a GUI frontend and where we could make use of this project. If you have any recommendations, or if you know of any such project, we would be happy to hear from you.')
