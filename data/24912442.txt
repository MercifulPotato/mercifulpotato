ReactDOMServer.renderToNodeStream is to support <i>HTML streaming</i>, which can allow the browser to start rendering the (as far as it knows, static HTML) document before it receives all the HTML. This is nice, but probably is not a huge factor if you&#x27;re using HTTP caching via a CDN or a static site generator (since the CDN will likely support HTML streaming).')
