Item(by='npunt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608867153, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25519492, text='Homicides nationwide are well off of historic highs [1].<p>The Vox link you previously posted shows the large spike (+~30%) being 2020 related.<p>The 21.8&#x2F;100k you cite for St Louis in 2003 was also abnormally and suspiciously low, as 2002 and 2004 were in the 30s&#x2F;100k. I wouldn&#x27;t baseline anything off a single local outlier that&#x27;s 50% off from other years. Perhaps a statistical &#x2F; data collection anomaly? You can see in 2004 the rate was about 35&#x2F;100k, while in 2013 it was 38&#x2F;100k, a scant change.<p>You can see that data in context within a chart in this NYT article from 2015 [2] which discusses some possible factors in St Louis&#x27; persistently high crime. 2014 and onwards is likely skewed considerably by the Ferguson unrest, and it sounds like St Louis might still be dealing with that alongside other factors.<p>Outside the local context, none of this data at a macro scale looks like the trend we see in the 70s-80s that the lead-crime hypothesis seeks to describe though. Crime nationwide has indeed been growing slightly since 2015... to hypothesize about why we&#x27;re seeing this, I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s largely due to loss of opportunity and rising income inequality leading to poverty and desperation, which our recent economic policies have only been worsening. But I&#x27;m absolutely no expert in the subject, just trying to figure things out like you are.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrotrends.net&#x2F;countries&#x2F;USA&#x2F;united-states&#x2F;murder-homicide-rate" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.macrotrends.net&#x2F;countries&#x2F;USA&#x2F;united-states&#x2F;murd...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;02&#x2F;11&#x2F;us&#x2F;st-louis-puzzles-over-stubbornly-high-murder-rate.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;02&#x2F;11&#x2F;us&#x2F;st-louis-puzzles-over-...</a>')
