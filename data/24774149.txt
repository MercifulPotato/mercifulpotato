It&#x27;s usually easier to add microservices later <i>if</i> they&#x27;re needed than to go the other way.<p>Your point about the Go binary reminds me of a related problem. We so often come up with solutions (like microservices) to performance problems that just add more complexity, when often the performance problems can be solved by reducing complexity. Then as you say it becomes so complex that it&#x27;s more difficult to fix later problems.')
