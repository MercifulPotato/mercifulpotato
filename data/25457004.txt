Also CDPR has a market cap of over $8bn so I&#x27;m not sure where you&#x27;re getting your information from.<p>Also comparing them to other companies is completely pointless and besides the point. Everything you are saying holds no value, and adds nothing to the conversation. You are defending CDPR using illogical and tangentially related arguments.<p>CDPR saying they worked to reduce crunch means literally nothing. Just because a company produces a product you like does not mean you have to turn a blind eye to horrible practices. Witcher 3 had horrible crunch, it was reported and CDPR didn&#x27;t address it. It happens again with 2077, they admit it and now I&#x27;m your eyes they&#x27;re the misunderstood good guys? Laughable.')
