The distance between CS abstractions has widened to the point where the lower level abstractions are only relevant to the people who build them.<p>There&#x27;s a close and obvious relationship between C statements and the PDP-11 instruction set. And at least one PDP-11 series processor was implemented with gate-level logic with no microcoding. So anyone with time to spare could copy that. It&#x27;s not a trivial job, and it&#x27;s probably more time than it&#x27;s worth. But it&#x27;s not unimaginably hard either.<p>There&#x27;s no obvious relationship at all between (say) Python and the gate-level internals of any mainstream modern CPU. There are at least four (five? six?) levels of abstractions between them.<p>It&#x27;s useful to build a generic gate-level processor to have some notional idea of what a computer is. And of course it&#x27;s essential if you go into processor design. But ÂµArch details are a graduate-level topic and not something most developers need to worry about.')
