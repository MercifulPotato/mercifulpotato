Item(by='austincheney', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608429994, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25480713, text='&gt; There seem to be a lot of people who live at a level of abstraction where they perceive every interaction as being about dominance and submission. In my humble opinion it is a very limited mindset.<p>That is sociopathic so it isn’t always easy to identify but it’s easy to disregard.<p>Kindness is generally a default. At a minimum it’s called mutual respect and at an absence it’s called being an asshole. It hardly takes any courage to be better than that. I cannot imagine the amount of medication people require if that is their definition of courage, as there isn’t any challenge there. Perhaps it’s a cultural difference.')
