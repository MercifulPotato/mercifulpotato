Consolidating farming and relying on monocultures certainly has economic benefits but it also creates an increasingly fragile system.<p>A new parasite or disease could easily destroy enough of a years harvest (or more) and now the nation has a food shortage. Because so much of our food is derived from or reliant on the monoculture it would have cascading effects. It would be a disaster on many levels.<p>Of course this is preventable but who has the courage to stand up for something that <i>could</i> happen when the political capital is won dealing with the cleanup. Food diversity isn’t just a “feels good” thing or an “ought to be” thing - it’s very much important in creating a resilient food supply which in my opinion is a matter of national security.')
