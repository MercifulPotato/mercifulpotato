You find it fun. This is the major reason. People like doing the experimentation and work.<p>2. You <i>really</i> need that tiny bit of extra performance but can&#x27;t upgrade your hardware, because you can&#x27;t afford it or some other reason (compatibility, company won&#x27;t approve upgrades, etc.).<p>I&#x27;ve done overclocking in the past because of the first reason. Only know one person who did it because of the second. It&#x27;s become much less common now, what with modern PC components being so powerful.')
