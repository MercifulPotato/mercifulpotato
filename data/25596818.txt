While by no means an expert, I&#x27;m inclined to respectfully disagree with the assessment of &#x2F;u&#x2F;scythmic_waves. The Reddit roadmap is total overkill as a pre-req for ESL and Bishop (Analysis, Topology, and proof-based Linear Algebra are certainly not needed for them).<p>I think the only hard pre-req would be a solid understanding of non-axiomatic probability up through the Law of large numbers. For the rest, I&#x27;m of the, perhaps naive, school of thought that one ought to jump in the deep end, and consult a variety of sources as need be. iirc, most of Munkres, and Hoffman &amp; Kunze are not needed for these books. Granted, you might find yourself picking these books up as your focus narrows, but for these books, you don&#x27;t need them.<p>With that out of the way, I&#x27;d highly, highly recommend Bishop as reading, after ISLR.<p>Edit: In response to your other comment, I also disagree: proofs, especially for regression problems, are important for understanding why we use them.')
