In the South (US), the plan is literally to shut everything down and wait a few days for it to melt. There are no stockpiles of salt or sand to use on the roads, and even Northerners who “know how to handle themselves in the snow” can’t navigate it as easily as they think.<p>Also, this is the story of climate change. It doesn’t really matter if something is common in another part of the planet— if it’s a new thing somewhere else, then it actually is news. Droughts, fires, flooding, and tornadoes are all going to start showing up in places they didn’t used to before.')
