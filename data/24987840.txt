If you see something like &quot;arr.map(_.nonEmpty).filter(a =&gt; a % 2)&quot; in the standard library, you can use that syntax yourself too.<p>E.g. &quot;arr.customlyFiltered()&quot; is easy to do. Or even easier &quot;arr.filter(myCustomFilter)&quot;. If something doesn&#x27;t work out for you, please feel free to use e.g. scalafiddle.io and make it example, then you will be helped! :)<p>Scala is indeed not a high performant language. It is as fast as Java and compiles as fast as Java if you only use Java&#x27;s features. However, then why use Scala in the beginning?<p>Scala is great for writing very maintainable and reusable code, especially with a big team and a lot of business logic. It is also great to &quot;glue&quot; things together like you can do it with Python. For these things it has more than sufficient performance in my opinion.')
