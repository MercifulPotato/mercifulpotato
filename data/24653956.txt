I travel a lot and invested a few new devices and even upgraded a few devices to USB-C (you can find small boards on aliexpress which provide a usb-c port and output 5, 9, 12, 15 or 20V). Even my shaver charges by USB-C.<p>However it takes some research, and I wish the spec was pared down more. Others mentioned that Nintendo switch can be damaged by a bad charger. They also chose to implement HDMI out using displayport converted to HDMI, so very few HDMI adapters are compatible.<p>Thunderbolt vs USB is confusing.<p>Hubs are confusing. USB-C hubs are basically impossible. USB2 or 3 hubs work well but share the speed and power with multiple devices. Easy to understand. USB-C (3.2) can supply up to 100W and 20Gbps. But one device can use up to 100W, and one 4k@60fps HDMI signal can use up to 20Gbps (even more in fact). So it&#x27;s not possible to make a usb-c hub without a lot of limitations. Not to mention it&#x27;s not trivial to set each device as a power sink or source. That&#x27;s why hubs generally have usb-c on one side and usb-a 2.0 or 3.1 on the other side.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the solution could be, you can&#x27;t keep the versatility without removing functionality.')
