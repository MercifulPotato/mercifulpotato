I thought I had unstructured data and I had no real need for relational data. But oh boy I was wrong. Want a customer list, billing, emails, linked accounts with those users, etc. All of this was such a pain in mongo and remnants of messy schema still lurk in our codebase. Reminds me alot coding in typed languages like C vs. python or JS. But in the case of mongo I think I was getting the worst of everything ;)')
