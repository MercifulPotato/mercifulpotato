Google hires kilotons of developers and pays them gigadollars every year, then makes them work in dumbed-down languages because they can&#x27;t be trusted with power tools.<p>How has our industry gone so far astray that we pay people hundreds of thousands of dollars a year when they can&#x27;t even understand generics? In what universe does it make sense to design an entire new language rather than offering new hires two months of training? Why are we pretending programming is a skilled trade when the things people actually wind up doing are so easy they can be learned in three months at a boot camp?<p>Rob Pike is a legend. He is the man who brought us Plan 9. How is <i>this</i> what he wound up working on?')
