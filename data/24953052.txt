They by definition apply equally to everyone, everywhere, at all times.<p>I&#x27;m all for respecting cultures and traditions, right until it gets in conflict with the above. We live in a global world and it is a good thing that some basic fundamental values should be expected from everyone.<p>I would cite Japan&#x27;s &quot;tradition&quot; of cutting kids from one of their parents after a divorce, thus not respecting the UN&#x27;s Child Rights Convention, as an sallient case in point that it&#x27;s not OK to just let circumventions go on the basis of &quot;it&#x27;s their culture&quot;.')
