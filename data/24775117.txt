They also suggest the compelling possibility that the WHM\nmight allow practitioners to develop higher level of control over key components of the\nautonomous system, with implications for lifestyle interventions that might ameliorate\nmultiple clinical syndromes.&quot;<p>I was doing cold exposure for a while, plunging palms and heels into water with ice. At first I could hold it a little there, but the duration was increasing with time. It&#x27;s comfy to do while using laptop, mind doesn&#x27;t focus on the hell going below :)')
