Figuring out what to do with yourself in that circumstance is the story driver.<p>The Neil Gaiman run of Miracleman is about the Utopia constructed by Miracleman during the Alan Moore run of Utopia. Presumably the next series is about how that goes tragically wrong, but it has never been published. But the Golden Age (Gaiman run) is pretty interesting. People living in a Utopia are still people.')
