One request:  could you add the date&#x2F;time to the post, preferably near the title?<p>I do see a `&lt;time&gt;` tag in the HTML, but it doesn&#x27;t render any human readable text.  The datetime is also part of the URL which is &quot;good enough,&quot; but it always takes me a minute to remember that and Ctrl+F won&#x27;t find it.<p>I&#x27;m a little ADD about knowing when things were published, so far from an average person.  If you like it the way it is, then don&#x27;t worry about me.  I just wanted to throw it out there.')
