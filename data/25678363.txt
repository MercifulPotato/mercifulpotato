You don&#x27;t usually need more than that as there are ideally other ways to recover your account (printed recovery keys etc).<p>If your laptop gets stolen with key inserted, and you didn&#x27;t have time to invalidate the key, one still has to access your local account, and find out saved login information in order to leverage that key, and that&#x27;s until you notice that your computer&#x27;s stolen and invalidated your key everywhere. Otherwise, it&#x27;s just another random key for the thief.<p>I don&#x27;t find that part of my threat model, and I&#x27;ve got my laptop stolen before with key plugged in.')
