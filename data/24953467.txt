And it’s that time again, because the comment about name conflicts was confusing as I could’ve sworn that during couple times I’ve had to actually poke around PHP code I saw it had namespaces. After some quick googling though, I was able to confirm a) PHP has “namespaces” and b) they seem to work like most other “features” (i.e. not like you’d expect if you’ve programmed in anything but PHP) [1].<p>However, C has the a similar convention [2] (though the convention is — as far as I’m aware — for the sake of maintainability&#x2F;readability as the compiler has no problem telling the difference between to things named the same, the person reading it probably will. While, as I understand it, PHP will just overwrite anything with the same name in the file&#x2F;lib you include).<p>It seems like PHP is heading in the right direction, but I have no idea why anyone would pick it up or start anything new with it these days, I don’t care how well done and the nice and new stuff is, it’s the decade of utter mess it’s built on top of that has uninterested me. Don’t get me wrong, since “acquiring” the Wordpress sites I’ve gone from a blind PHP hater, to at least understanding&#x2F;appreciating it (but still won’t actually touch it with a 10ft pole). PHP is brain dead easy to deploy and scale up, compared to ruby&#x2F;python&#x2F;node (which aren’t _that_ difficult to deploy), PHP is basically the web equivalent of a static binary, in that you can just drop in and it’s basically ready to go. PHP also actually really fast, it’s seriously impressive how fast it can render WP pages especially when you consider the absolute spaghetti&#x2F;thrown together&#x2F;clusterfuck code it’s running — Wordpress itself is pretty yikes from the code I’ve seen, but the plugins, Christ, the 50 million sloppy buggy poorly coded plugins — PHP can absolutely run laps around other a decently coded site in other languages  (at the cost of having to use PHP I guess  ).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kornel.ski&#x2F;en&#x2F;phpns" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;kornel.ski&#x2F;en&#x2F;phpns</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softwareengineering.stackexchange.com&#x2F;q&#x2F;404613" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softwareengineering.stackexchange.com&#x2F;q&#x2F;404613</a>')
