I didn&#x27;t see book opening as fun as might as well just set the game up that way and play from there.  So I kinda did my own thing and if I played anybody who would template play book openings (many do) then going against that start and busting it would see them out of their comfort zone and me having a fun enjoyable game.  I did win fair few and chess tournaments in my youth but been decades since played that it&#x27;s almost a crime.  Sadly finding people to play who don&#x27;t get into a hissy fit if you don&#x27;t do the book-opening they want to play was always an issue.')
