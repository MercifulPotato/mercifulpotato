Including contracts with both AWS and Azure.<p>If your business gets to a certain size and you are still on the generic ToS and paying by credit card you have a big risk on your hands. You could be terminated at any point.<p>With a private contract you can negotiate things like a termination notice. You can put in place a grace period before things are shut off. You can implement dispute procedures that are unique to your business needs so that when you and the vendor disagree it doesn&#x27;t immediately disrupt your business.<p>None of this is easy. But if your business absolutely depends on public cloud hosting you&#x27;d be stupid not to call up your vendor and negotiate.<p>If you are unwilling to do that, then you need to make sure you diversify your cloud. It&#x27;s much less likely that two competing cloud vendors would shut you off at exactly the same time.')
