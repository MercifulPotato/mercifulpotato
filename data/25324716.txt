Who is going to enforce some random African country that is in the middle of a civil war to have those?<p>&gt; This is meant to be a completely different ecosystem, no? An ecosystem not controlled with the US. This isn&#x27;t a normal financal service, it&#x27;s not banking, it&#x27;s outside of banking hence why it&#x27;s aimed and people without banks.<p>Last I checked, Facebook is a US company, with a US headquarters, publicly traded on a US stock market, and with an American CEO and controlling shareholder.  So, unless they all want to relocate permanently to &quot;some random African country that is in the middle of a civil war&quot;, they&#x27;re going to have to deal with US regulations.')
