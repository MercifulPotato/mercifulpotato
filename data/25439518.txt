Tools are extremely important. They don&#x27;t work on their own, of course, but are definitively part of the equation.<p>I&#x27;ve attended a lot of photo meets, and if I had a dollar for every shooter who showed up with the latest and greatest gear, only to post poorly composed, poorly lit, overprocessed dreck weeks later...<p>I think a better analogy is bicycles. You can have the fanciest, lightest racing bike in the world, but if you&#x27;re not a trained athlete it&#x27;s not going to help you much.
