I have a Google-Mail I am only using for Android related stuff. I did buy some apps for mobile but have stopped it completely and I don&#x27;t think I want to ever get back to it.<p>I am never logged in while searching or on YouTube, which they don&#x27;t like given the newest message that pops up randomly with a prompt to sign in. Mobile and PC are completely compartmentalized, I don&#x27;t need to sync anything.<p>I use duckduckgo, since I can just add +g to get Google results and otherwise it uses Bing. Perfect for privacy and convenience.<p>I use Chrome and FF at work, but I vastly prefer FF. I use their services if useful, but I certainly try to minimize data exposure. Not too strict, but I think it helps.')
