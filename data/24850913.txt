Item(by='munk-a', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603306811, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24850582, text='Just a note - in Canada there is a party generally called the Liberal party and another called the Conservative party - I&#x27;ve been careful in the text below to differential Liberal from liberal and Conservative from conservative - it can get a bit confusing (especially when the Liberals aren&#x27;t liberal) but that&#x27;s just Canada being confusing.<p>As a Canadian - Canada is slipping into a two party system.  There are, weirdly, regional variations of parties - that tends to lead toward the appearance of wider representation.  I&#x27;m in BC and our conservative party is the Liberals while our liberal party is the NDP - with the greens eeking out a few seats on the sunshine coast and occasionally vancouver island in most elections - it&#x27;s basically a two horse race provincially between the Liberals and the NDP.  Since the Conservatives have essentially no chance of winning all their voters jumped on the Liberal bandwagon and made that party conservative (as evidenced by the pro-life Liberal candidate who recently described contraception as a form of eugenics).<p>BQ is an interesting party that mostly exists because QC still kinda wants to be independent, and the greens essentially don&#x27;t exist.  The same is essentially true of the NDP when it comes to the national elections - please just look at these results[1] with the Liberal party at 157, the conservatives at 121 and the next most represented party at 32 (up 22 seats over the last election) - Canadian elections are essentially a two horse race and a lot of Canadians that aren&#x27;t already in &quot;safe&quot; NDP, BQ or Green districts end up voting strategically for Conservatives or Liberals - whichever they hate less.<p>Oh also there&#x27;s the PPC but honestly they&#x27;re a joke - I still think they should have a few MPs though (technically, five seats) - they did carry 1.62% of the national vote in a country where an MP represents .3% of the country.  Here&#x27;s a graphic demonstrating the full skew of voting in Canada, it&#x27;s not nearly as minor as you might think[2].<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2019_Canadian_federal_election" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2019_Canadian_federal_election</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fairvote.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;Canada-votes-2019-website-square-box.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fairvote.ca&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;Canada-vo...</a>')
