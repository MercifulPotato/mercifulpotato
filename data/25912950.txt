The Arizona case was tossed because the evidence was not reliable.  Most of the 50+ lawsuits claimed procedural issues and not fraud. Claiming mail-in ballots violated the equal protection clause was brought up heavily even though they&#x27;ve been used for over a hundred years and the Giuliani voted by mail in 2020 election.<p>The supreme court case brought by other state AGs claimed PA violated their own state constitution.  I still don&#x27;t understand how an AG from another state can sue another state for issues pertaining their own constitution in federal court.    Federal court doesn&#x27;t have jurisdiction to rule if an act violates a states constitution.')
