Would also be difficult to retrofit unless you had a wetroom already. Also the failure modes are quite bad; what happens when the drains clog? You&#x27;d need the whole thing sunken to prevent water egress to the rest of the house.<p>Definitely not saying it&#x27;s impossible, or even impractical, but it wouldn&#x27;t be cheap.')
