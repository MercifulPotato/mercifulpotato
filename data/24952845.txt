Are your problems also related to elevated Prolactin levels, Hyperprolactinemia?\nBromocriptine would be cheaper than Dostinex&#x2F;Cabergoline.<p>I do not recommend anything in this comment.\nIf you benefit from a fight-or-flight state, the extra focus and pain filtering, then Atomoxetine&#x2F;Strattera or Vyvanse&#x2F;Amphetamine could be worth it for the extra Norepinephrine (and Dopamine).<p>Emsam (Irreversible MAOI, transdermal administration) and Moclobemide (Reversible MAOI) are also interesting in general.\nDO NOT combine these MAOIs with Cabergoline or the other drugs mentioned above. You could die from the drug interaction!\nBesides that, the benefit and side effect profiles are excellent.\nThe dietary restrictions are not as severe as with the classic MAOIs.\nI do not recommend anything in this comment.')
