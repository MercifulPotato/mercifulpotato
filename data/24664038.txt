I absolutely value having almost everything built from source and the control I get from that through use-flags.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean I enjoy compiling some incarnation of webkit every few weeks for multiple hours on a laptop, in particular if it&#x27;s just for a single application (in this case: Nextcloud client). Same for 32bit stuff, I have absolutely zero use for these libraries outside of closed-source games, so I&#x27;d rather have them just work than full control over them.')
