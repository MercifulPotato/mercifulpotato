Good for them.<p>Poland is a sovereign country — Twitter doesn’t get to tell them how to act. That’s “tail wags dog”.<p>Social media companies blatantly exerted themselves as political entities — and now they’re facing “common carrier” regulation from existing political entities who don’t like that.<p>Again, if Twitter is uncomfortable being a common carrier for Polish social media — they’re free to exit the market and offer their services elsewhere.')
