It&#x27;s also the fact that a disease is a graph phenomenon, and gatherings will connect parts of the graph that are normally separate. This means that infections will lead to more than average amounts of secondary, tertiary infections.<p>But on the other hand this may not matter as much anymore since we are in a late stage of the epidemic, and the disease is everywhere already.<p>Also I don&#x27;t mean to dissuade anyone from attending with this.')
