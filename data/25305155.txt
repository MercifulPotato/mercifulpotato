Most of the people who make this argument really do seem to see it as a group of Good and Bad people, and are arguing that all billionaires are in the Bad group. People like Bernie Sanders and AOC have said that repeatedly in no uncertain terms. And I think this PG essay addresses that form of the argument pretty directly.<p>What you&#x27;re talking is a much more interesting conversation to be having. How can we tweak the rules to avoid misaligned incentives? And would it actually be better to end the so-called &quot;exploitation&quot; if it would mean killing most of these jobs altogether, when the allegedly exploited people actually have an ok quality of life and are doing this work because they like it better than their alternatives?')
