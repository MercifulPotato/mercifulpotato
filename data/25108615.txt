It is true that the overwhelming majority of Apple users won&#x27;t ever know enough of the technical details to make an informed decision about this, nor should they <i>need</i> to know.<p>Where Apple went wrong, IMHO, is: \n1) not giving people a way to opt out (not just for OCSP, but so many power user-hostile decisions they&#x27;re making recently), and \n2) programming it in a poor way where slow responses ground the machine to a halt (it did mine in the middle of the work day, stopping my work completely for 30-45 minutes).<p>I don&#x27;t think malice (i.e. greed) was involved in how this whole thing turned out. As Hanlon&#x27;s Razor states:<p><pre><code>    Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by incompetence.</code></pre>')
