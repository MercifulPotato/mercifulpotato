Good reasoning for the use case you have in mind.<p>Cloud stuff makes sense when you have some combo of the following imho:<p>* Need for scalability - at one place I worked high-load was 3x low-load so going up and down saved a lot of time<p>* Rare need for powerful resources (sort of the same as above) - I provisioned a real fatboi on AWS the other day to do some file processing. Worked like a charm and gone in the hour<p>* Ability to use higher-level primitives - lambda vs. EC2 instances, databricks vs. EMR, IAM&#x2F;Kinesis all that<p>* Need for exploration - I could not afford the peak ElasticSearch + Redis + Postgresql that I had but I can trial it<p>* Need for resilience - If you need to preserve the data&#x2F;compute for whatever reason, AWS is way easier to get to a good place<p>* Lack of knowledge on top-tier ops - I&#x27;ve run long-term dedicated servers for almost two decades now, with top uptime in a decade. I have fuck-all knowledge of doing smart colo ops. If you want to keep your team lean and you don&#x27;t have this to lean on, it&#x27;s going to sink you.<p>If you&#x27;re using hardware as hardware and it isn&#x27;t changing that much and you have the skillset, you can get a long way with a colo even today.')
