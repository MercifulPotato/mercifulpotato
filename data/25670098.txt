I&#x27;m aware that we still disagree, that&#x27;s because of a variety of factors including the fact that we both, as humans, suffer from cognitive biases. But assuming that I can&#x27;t be reasoned with merely because you&#x27;ve been unable to respond to my arguments isn&#x27;t getting either of us closer to understanding each other.<p>&gt; We could argue about the specifics all day, but I think you should ask yourself why you want it to be true.<p>I don&#x27;t want it to be true, I don&#x27;t want any of this crap to be true, the candidates we had are horrible (not speaking ill of Professor Jorgenson, mind you). I&#x27;d prefer that there was a reasonable explanation but the problem with this where there&#x27;s evidence that raises suspicions but no reasonable response is that the losing side feels disenfranchised and that&#x27;s bad for the country. We want everyone to feel as though their voice was heard.<p>&gt; Do you seek community?<p>No I have a decent social life.<p>&gt; Are you angry inside and need an outlet?<p>No, I&#x27;m fine.<p>&gt; Of course from your perspective, your position makes perfect sense and isn’t extreme,<p>Thanks for the video, watching it now.')
