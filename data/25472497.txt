I don’t find Go being “too boring” to be a rational reason to not use it; it’s an accessible and convenient language that works well for applications without a lot of shared state among threads. Boring is <i>good</i> for security. Some would argue Go is not boring enough due to edges with CSP.<p>Rust is an accomplishment, but it’s also a very complicated language. It has a harsh learning curve and simply put, not all software written will benefit as much from the guarantees Rust provides. For a lot of software that will benefit the most, people are already experimenting with it.<p>seL4’s approach also seems interesting. It is doing C with proofs, which in theory should be able to offer stronger guarantees than even Rust if done correctly.')
