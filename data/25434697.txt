So many of the AWS services are effectively abandoned and missing critical features that makes them completely unfit for production usage, and it can be really hard to find this out before you run into the problems yourself. And then out of nowhere 3 years later they&#x27;ll pick up development on an old thing again and finally fix that critical issue and make it much better. So I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d call that being way ahead.<p>My impression is that the stuff that GCP does have tends to be more capable and production ready (although I&#x27;m curious if others would disagree with that).')
