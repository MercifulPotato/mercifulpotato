When we switched to other ways to transport goods and power, we never stopped that tradition and I wonder how harshly future generations are going to judge us for doing so.<p>We aren&#x27;t using the river, but the river is still the same form of transportation it ever was. We don&#x27;t barge away the goods, but the river will still happily carry any toxic materials that leave the factory by malice, incompetence, human error, or a series of unfortunate events (Fukushima).<p>I mean at this point, building a factory where you <i>swear</i> not to pollute next to a geographical feature that makes it easy to pollute without getting caught or where any honest mistake is magnified... it feels like a teenager hovering by the display of expensive stuff and saying they are just looking, or playing catch in the living room. You won&#x27;t be the least surprised when you find out there is something missing&#x2F;broken. The solution isn&#x27;t more yelling, it&#x27;s taking away the temptation to misbehave, and&#x2F;or reducing the consequences of doing so.<p>We need public policy to build a proverbial glass cabinet around our core watersheds. Build highways, train and powerlines and zone for factories at a slight separation, along on the route between Here and There, where nothing we care about is directly downwind or downhill.<p>Tennessee Valley Authority lost a dam and dumped years of fly ash into a tributary of the Mississippi. It&#x27;s just a matter of time until deferred maintenance takes out this dam, and the lake remembers it was a river once.')
