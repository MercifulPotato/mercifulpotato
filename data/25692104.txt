Item(by='CyberRabbi', descendants=None, kids=[25692737], score=None, time=1610148675, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25691604, text='&gt; Your original question was whether OP was scared of the Women’s March murdering them.<p>Yes the point of the question was to tease out what concrete differences there were between the two to justify fear of murder in the second case. It seems like his fear is more based on narrative and assumption of bad faith than any direct evidence of intent to “take the capital” violently. The violence was perpetrated against the protestors, not by them.<p>&gt; But signs point to him being killed by one of the terrorists, so I’ll continue to describe it as murder until evidence arises to the contrary.<p>You should assume innocence until proof of wrongdoing. Anything else is illiberal.')
