Too many independent variables to consider. Take the example of grep vs Ripgrep. Is it fair to compare the compile times of grep written in C with ripgrep? I can see arguments both ways.<p>What I can say with confidence is that Rust build times have improved continuously in the last 2 years. It’s now 30-50% faster on common programs. The future is bright too, a new debug back end out in 2021 promises a further 50% improvement.')
