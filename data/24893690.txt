The market is that location and you have to pay a rate expected in that area &#x2F; market.<p>But in the case of remote, isn&#x27;t the market the whole area to which you&#x27;re open? If a company is open to hiring from the entire US, the market becomes the whole country. So if you decide on hiring engineer E, why would you pay more if E decides to live in SF instead of [low COL city]? E is the same exact person and whatever work they do is not dependent on where they happen to be.<p>The only variation I could see as &quot;fair&quot; would be dependent on how taxation varies. I&#x27;m not familiar with how these things work in the US, but if there&#x27;s variation in payroll or income tax due to the state where the employee actually works, I can understand that for a given cost the company, the employee&#x27;s after tax salary may vary.')
