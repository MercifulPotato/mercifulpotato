The two examples in statically typed languages I can think of is rust and zig; in dynamically typed languages I think of elixir (which assigns it to an atom, and is a crash-fast language), and ruby (nil is it&#x27;s own class)<p>Of the languages I have experience with, it&#x27;s a major problem in C, java, and javascript.<p>For javascript specifically there is also the issue of falsey discipline; there are a ton of falsey values so you could get tripped up in ways you forgot about when doing a null check.')
