Immensely readable.<p>Siddhartha, is a fascinating take on advaita vedanta, Sramana, and Buddhism. As someone familiar with these 3 philosophies, I liked Hesse&#x27;s take on them. The story is really simple and can be finished in 2-3 sittings.<p>Letters from a stoic is full to the brim of wisdom and I&#x27;ve never filled a book with so many bookmarks and notes before. Seneca writes like a straight arrow and doesn&#x27;t mince words. No wonder the book is still around, one of the best examples of Lindy effect.')
