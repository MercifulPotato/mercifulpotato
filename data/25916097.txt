Housing was extremely affordable. Very low debt from trade school. Women wanted to have kids and settle earlier. Women today care about their careers. People don&#x27;t want to get into relationships with people saddled with debt and making no money.<p>While materially there are a lot of benefits to our modern world, no one is really free. To get sex nowadays, you better be attractive. Because on Tinder there are thousands competing with you instead of 20 in that one bar. Most people get very little likes, get depressed, and give up. I don&#x27;t blame them. It&#x27;s soul crushing.')
