I  was pegging them at $249 to $399 max. $549 shocked the daylights out of me! This is beyond too expensive for me to consider. Maybe it will come down over the years but there must be a very slim market of people who can pay that. I’m not usually shocked by an Apple price but that’s nuts. Few hundred dollars more and you can get a state of the art M1 MacBook Air and some amazing non-Apple headphones to go with it.')
