Seems like you can&#x27;t just view an entire thread, you have to look at it in a newsfeed type stream of other threads&#x2F;stories, and when you want to drill down to a particular branch of discussion it has to reload the page and you lose visibility of the rest of it, all the while being blasted with obnoxiously large adverts for offensive stuff like Borat. The web just gets worse and worse... how did we get here?')
