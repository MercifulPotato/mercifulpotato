Everything would be compiled with `-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections` and the final shared library linked with `-Wl,--gc-sections`. I&#x27;d call `strip` on the `.so` as well.<p>This worked well because the JVM code only ever called the native API I exposed and did not need to access the dependencies&#x27; APIs.')
