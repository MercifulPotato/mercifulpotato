I store some annotated snippets in Joplin (could probably use org-mode or similar). I also collect programming ebooks and PDF&#x27;ed docs: sometimes you can still find them, sometimes you can &#x27;print to PDF&#x27;. No idea how one would do it with javadoc for example.<p>The problem is interface for searching this stuff locally and reading. I use recoll for full text search and qpdfview for PDF viewing (the main reason is that it has tabs). Admittedly, this is not completely satisfying. Simple text search doesn&#x27;t have the sophistication, PDF&#x27;s feel less pleasant than web pages. Maybe something I could get used to if I went fully that route, but for now I don&#x27;t feel compelled to do that (besides some experimentation).<p>My guess is that <i>if</i> you use a small language&#x2F;libraries, or have a self-contained codebase, or do fairly rote things, it&#x27;s possible to go without searching documentation. Otherwise... no?<p>[1] Or you could use bookmarks, but then, why not archive.')
