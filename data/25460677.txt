The same is true for fruits. If you travel to particular developing countries or even just to Hawaii (where native varieties are protected), you&#x27;ll see how different their fruits and vegetables are - both in variety but also smell and taste. I&#x27;m sure that has nutritional implications that simplistic reductionist nutrition approaches can&#x27;t capture.')
