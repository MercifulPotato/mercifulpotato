Everything but the initial page load is slower. The main web app has extensive latency-hiding features that are key to Gmail&#x27;s overall performance story. The basic HTML UI has none of these features. Every action in the basic UI takes half a second or more because it&#x27;s a server round trip.<p>Example: load the basic HTML and enter a thread then return to the thread list. Returning to the thread list takes about 1 second. In the full gmail return to thread list takes no remote time, only local event handler CPU time, it&#x27;s almost instantaneous.<p>Example 2: Open a thread in the basic UI and use &quot;newer&quot; or &quot;older&quot; to navigate to other threads. Every click takes ~1s. In the full Gmail UI navigate to adjacent thread takes almost no time, because the app pre-loads these threads in anticipation of you visiting them.<p>TL;DR the basic HTML gmail is good if your device is severely resource-poor and you just need to see if you have mail. For every other purpose it&#x27;s worse.')
