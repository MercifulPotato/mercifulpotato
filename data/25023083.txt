There will be a big current spike every half cycle when the rectifier starts conducting.  The power factor will be awful, and I can easily imagine 120 Hz and its harmonics coupling somewhere you donâ€™t want them.  Not to mention that you might be able to hear the power supply buzzing.<p>Get a nice AC-DC converter brick and call it a day. If you want to be fancy, stick a linear regulator on the output.')
