I&#x27;ve had a few sessions already and it feels really special out in the cold night looking up at Mars and other planets whiz by. It does need some preparation though. I&#x27;ve got my site on a hill selected with no obstructions, the telescope has been collimated (calibrated), red dot finder is alligned, I&#x27;ve learnt how to setup the equatorial mount and polar align it, and I have my blue filter for clearer visuals of Saturn and Jupiter. Meanwhile I&#x27;m out in the back garden checking for clear skies any chance I get.<p>One thing to know though, you won&#x27;t see the planets as they often appear in pictures, those are usually made from hundreds of long exposure shots stacked and processed to bring out the detail. You pretty much just see small bright spots in the sky with a little surface detail if your optics are good enough. There is something about seeing far away planets with your own eyes however which feels magic and photos can&#x27;t compare to the experience.')
