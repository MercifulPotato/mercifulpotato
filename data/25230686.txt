Item(by='queeerkopf', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606498473, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25229194, text='&gt; Since COVID-19 mainly affects the elderly, experts expected an increase in the percentage of deaths in older age groups. However, this increase is not seen from the CDC data. In fact, the percentages of deaths among all age groups remain relatively the same.<p>This directly contradicts the excess mortality data published by CDC itself. [1] From the article it&#x27;s unclear to me what evidence led to the claims presented. So far the article seems very unconvincing. Seems like John Hopkins has good reasons to take it down.<p>Also bear in mind that the excess mortality we&#x27;ve seen so far is with all the measures to limit the impact of the pandemic. It&#x27;s fair to assume that excess mortality would be a lot higher without those. Our World In Data has a well explained international overview and analysis.
