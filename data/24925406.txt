Bitcoin&#x27;s high variability over the years shows that speculator demand can last for years but there&#x27;s no lock-in and many competing options. There are a few people who&#x27;ve put large amounts of money into it but statistically almost nobody uses it so there&#x27;s little defense against a competitor because most people have no sunk cost and most of the percentage who do have only a small holding at risk.')
