Item(by='DoreenMichele', descendants=None, kids=[25192787], score=None, time=1606168004, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25191327, text='<i>I consider myself a fan</i><p>Thank you. That&#x27;s nice to hear.<p>I don&#x27;t think HN borders on perfection and I don&#x27;t think I said anything of the sort anywhere. I said stuff like: <i>HN does a much better job than most platforms of allowing people to genuinely express a minority view.</i><p>That&#x27;s still a relative rating, not an absolute one. It does a better job <i>than average.</i> Your remark seems to generally agree with that, so I&#x27;m not sure I understand what the issue here is.<p>I have not had an easy time here and at one point I left for 18 months in part because I felt it was too rough for me here. But I was also really sick at the time and homeless and &quot;wherever you go, there you are.&quot; My primary reasons for taking a break were not, per se, &quot;HN is a shit show and everyone there is mean to me!&quot;<p>I&#x27;m quite open about the fact that posting here as openly female was only &quot;a bed of roses&quot; if you are thinking of it in terms of the thorns. That opinion isn&#x27;t one that is very welcome here. It gets a lot of push back.<p>I&#x27;ve had college classes in things like Social Psychology and Negotiation and Conflict Management. I know something about best practices for dealing with difficult group dynamics.<p>I&#x27;m not claiming there is no bias here. I&#x27;m not claiming things are always rosy and I used the word &quot;hubbub&quot; in my remark, above.<p>I don&#x27;t really understand why you think I am engaging in hyperbole and attributing some kind of perfection to the site. My very first comment was basically a recipe for how to weather the downvote storm and wait and see where it goes after that.<p>And in my experience and opinion, it will go better if you actually follow the guidelines and don&#x27;t start complaining about downvotes. As someone who attracts a lot of negative reactions on HN, my firsthand experience is that if you <i>actually follow the guidelines</i> and <i>say nothing</i> about the voting and wait and see, things will be less negative and a few hours later you may feel differently about how people are perceiving your comment because it may no longer be in the negatives and there may even be constructive engagement.<p>And you are less likely to experience that if you start complaining about bias and about downvotes and about people disagreeing with you.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with you that I can&#x27;t know what I know without spreadsheets full of data. I think I do know what I know based on having studied how social stuff works and having participated on a variety of forums over the years.<p>Metafilter is not the only forum where I had really negative experiences and was ultimately banned. It&#x27;s just the only one I happened to use as an example to try to illustrate my point in one particular remark.')
