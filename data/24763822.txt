My code runs in docker on pretty much any server I can get my hands on. Some of my code runs on a ThinkPad stashed behind my desk, on DigitalOcean, on my Macbook. I could deploy to a Raspberry Pi and it would run just the same. It takes 10 minutes to deploy an exact copy to a new environment.<p>None of that requires OS maintenance. My house plants require far more maintenance than my software. I sometimes forget where some things run because I haven&#x27;t touched them in years.<p>Serverless code runs on the cloud you built it for. I don&#x27;t want that. I don&#x27;t want to invest years of my life becoming an Amazon developer, writing Amazon code for Amazon servers.<p>That&#x27;s without delving into the extra work serverless requires. There isn&#x27;t a dollar amount tied to my import statements. I don&#x27;t need software to help me graph and make sense of my infrastructure. I can run my code on my computer and debug it, even offline.')
