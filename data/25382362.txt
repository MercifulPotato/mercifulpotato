I’ve had a trans-metatarsal amputation on one foot and the little toe and the bone behind it on the other. My balance is way off and I move like I’m 20 years older than I am. Yet, I hesitate to say I’m disabled because I can still move (not run at all, but I can still walk). I don’t <i>think</i> disabled, I guess, at least not in public.<p>It’s a kind of personal question to be asking.')
