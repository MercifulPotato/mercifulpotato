I’m thinking it means you get security updates but don’t have to change api versions that might break your app?<p>For example, my app compiles with Qt 6 and I wrote it as such. But I’m guessing when 6.1 comes around, there may be a chance that something will break.<p>I guess I’m wondering if bigger projects avoid trying to update because it makes for complicated debugging if something does need to be changed, or if maybe something else contributes to it.')
