I didn’t find there to ever be any payoff. And when things went badly I didn’t have a shield to keep it from overflowing the rest of my life. I can still enjoy my workmates even if in my heart I know work is bs we all have to do to survive. I still find enjoyment in the craft of programming too.<p>&gt; but what the hell are you living for?<p>Good question, B2B SaaS or spending the days wandering in the woods with my kids?')
