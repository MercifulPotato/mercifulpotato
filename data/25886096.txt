Furthermore, as a resident in an area which saw destruction by left-leaning groups, I believe those individuals should also be prosecuted.<p>I don’t think this has anything to do with “right” or “left”, it has to do with illegally breaking into the Capitol, especially while congress was present. A group of left leaning trespassers would likely have seen, and deserved, a similar response.')
