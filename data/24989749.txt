All large retailers do this, I&#x27;ve worked on this problem, but there are lots of things that reduce the accuracy of the data-driven approach:<p>• Theft<p>• Spoiled&#x2F;broken products<p>• Customers taking a product then browsing for another hour before checking out<p>• Customers buying multiple flavours of a product with the same price but different UPCs, which the cashier rings up by scanning the first product then hitting &quot;times 10&quot;<p>• There is stock on the shelf, but it&#x27;s hidden behind something else or out of reach<p>• There is stock in the store, but not on the shelf (many retailers don&#x27;t track backroom → shelf stocking)<p>• Product is stocked in multiple locations in the store, one of which is empty<p>• Plus all the usual data issues caused by wrong barcode scanned, data entry error, out-of-date information about units per box, etc<p>Those issues are all small, but still significant:<p>• For slow-moving products, being a few units off can mean the difference between out of stock and 1 month stock remaining.<p>• Even for fast-moving products these errors add up over time, you never really get a ground-truth event to reset the error drift. Stocktake and out-of-stock help but are infrequent and not a perfect reflection of reality.<p>There&#x27;s a big unsexy industry working on this problem with data and human checks. The economics of robots, drones, smart shelves, and smart carts don&#x27;t seem competitive right now. When you have 10k stores in the US, the expense is massive.')
