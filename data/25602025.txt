Item(by='Izkata', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609493954, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25600964, text='Believe it or not, there&#x27;s some weird ways for it to happen; this is the scenario that I can remember offhand, but I think there&#x27;s one or two more:<p>It sounds like Pence is the one that counts (or doesn&#x27;t) the electoral votes, so depending on the circumstances it could result in neither candidate getting 270, which results in a &quot;contingent election&quot; - one vote per state, from the House of Representatives, which would be majority Republican, for the president.  The Senate would choose the vice-president in the same way - so if this actually happens, it&#x27;s apparently possible (if absurdly unlikely) to get a Trump&#x2F;Harris or Biden&#x2F;Pence outcome.<p>One possible reason Pence could do that is if the contested states send two sets of electors - one certified by the governor (how we usually do it) and one by the (Republican) legislature.  My understanding is that if both groups of electors are correctly certified, either Pence would have to choose which to count, ignore both, or the Supreme Court would get involved.  Key phrase for finding more on this is &quot;dueling electors&quot;; a lot of places are saying the legislature-certified ones wouldn&#x27;t be valid, but a handful say it&#x27;s possible.')
