Pandora&#x27;s discovery, recommendations, and shuffle algorithms are objectively superior to Spotify - yet, everyone still seems to use Spotify none-the-less.<p>Discovery, recommendations and shuffle are at the heart of what made Pandora a thing... it&#x27;s literally what Pandora was built on back when it was purely a seeded radio of sorts. Whereas Spotify more-or-less bolted on these features later in the product life... and it shows.<p>The &quot;shuffle&quot; alone on Spotify was enough to send me running. Have a playlist with 200 songs from 80 different artists? Well, we&#x27;ll just play this one artist - the same album even! - back to back to back until you&#x27;re annoyed enough to manually select the next song!<p>I understood people flocking to Spotify back when it was the only game in town that allowed you to play specific songs, make playlists, and &quot;download&quot; songs for offline (airplane) playback. But now Pandora does all this too - and has for the past several years. The two services are even priced about the same...<p>So, if Spotify is so bad, as would seem evidenced by all these HN threads that pop up from time-to-time, why do people continue to use it?')
