The whole post I linked you to was about why Workers does not allow forged Host headers.<p>What Workers does allow is for you to send a request to a different hostname. In this case, the Host header matches the DNS lookup. So if the third party is on Cloudflare, the request will go through their Cloudflare security settings.<p>It also allows, via the `resolveOverride` option, for you to do DNS lookup that doesn&#x27;t match the Host header, as long as the Host header specifies a hostname within your domain. You can&#x27;t forge a Host header specifying someone else&#x27;s domain.')
