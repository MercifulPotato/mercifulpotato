Basically you know how much filament you&#x27;re going to feed into a print, so you can back compute what part of the filament would be in what part of the print, and then construct a filament with the right materials in the right places. That it works as well as it does is pretty neat.<p>I expect it also makes for some interesting print failures when you&#x27;re print&#x2F;filament registration is messed up. :-).<p>If this becomes a &#x27;thing&#x27; then you could design a filament making machine that would make a custom spool of filament. Even if you had a printer with a &#x27;belt&#x27; for the bed, then you could make as much filament as you wanted.')
