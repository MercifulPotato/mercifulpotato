Oxygen production, timber cultivation, ecosystem support? If the first, phytoplankton in our oceans produce WAY more oxygen than all the trees on earth combined -- which is one of a billion reasons why we absolutely need to stop polluting our oceans (and land for that matter). If the second, sowing hemp plants takes up less land and resources while producing more usable material for even more applications than do trees. If the third, then yeah trees are definitely required to sustain entire ecosystems so I can&#x27;t make an argument against that. It is extremely unfortunate that entire naturally-occuring forests get completely decimated just for the wood or other for-profit ventures, regardless of the impact to the entire planet&#x27;s balance between all of nature...including but not limited to us as human beings.')
