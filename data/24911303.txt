I get you.<p><i>How should I proceed? Just suck it up until I find a new job?</i><p>You really don&#x27;t have a choice about staying on until you find a new job, it seems.  What you <i>do</i> have a (very significant) choice in -- is to what extent you continue to internalize and play along with this person&#x27;s (and really, by extension, his boss&#x27;s and the company&#x27;s) attempts to make you feel inferior.<p>Which, to be clear - you absolutely do not have to &quot;suck it up&quot;, or otherwise play along, even if it looks like you will have to stay on the job for a while until something else comes long.  Not that this means confronting the bully and letting him know you&#x27;re not going to take it anymore (which in a way plays into his game).  But rather, you may want to look into strategies for &quot;radical detachment&quot;.<p>Meaning first: understand, and keep reminding yourself that the nasty things he&#x27;s saying <i>have nothing to do with you</i> (and are ultimately about his own feelings of inferiority).<p>Ditto for all the other stuff (apart from the outright nastiness) -- the credit whoring, finger pointing, etc -- or even what other people in the company think of you,  You just have to keep reminding yourself that <i>none of this stuff matters</i>.  It may even help to say this to yourself every morning over coffee before you log on (or otherwise &quot;go to work&quot;).<p>Second - consider investing in a few hours of emergency counseling (with a professional therapist), to help you solidify the above strategy.  Should only cost a couple of hundred bucks, but if it helps you earn a few extra thousand in padding until you&#x27;ve pulled yourself out of that place, it will definitely be worth it.<p>Finally, here&#x27;s a useful mental model I&#x27;ve come up with when having to deal with toxic work environments:  &quot;Paid job search&quot;.  Your employer has failed you, pure and simple.  At this point you owe them absolutely <i>nothing</i> -- and if you need to dip into their till, by holding onto your salary while you look for another job (whilst doing the bare minimum of work as necessary - really, just forget about writing code with any eye towards long-term maintainability from now on) -- then so be it.<p>Their fault, their loss.  Nothing to do at this point but stand up for Number One (that&#x27;s you of course) -- and get out of that situation, as soon as convenient and comfortable for you to do so.')
