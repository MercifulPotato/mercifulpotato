Try maybe seated dumbbell curls (leaning 45 degrees towards the back). Also cable curls, leaning slightly forward, with a low pulley.<p>For triceps, the overhead triceps extension (again with a low pulley) is a great exercise, very underrated - and one of the very few that works all three heads of the muscle.<p>For chest, cable flies also offer a very good resistance curve.')
