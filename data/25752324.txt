As a user, if a hardware vendor can choose to &quot;ban&quot; users from running certain software (after they have paid for the hardware), I do not see that as progressive.  Maybe it is a clever &quot;business model&quot; but as a user I like to choose software based on personal preferences rather than delegate the process to someone else, e.g., a trillion dollar company.')
