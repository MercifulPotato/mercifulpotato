For a software, which take shared libraries - usually written in C - as plugins, I wrote such a plugin in Go. This was a very good experience. It took only little work to set up the C compatible Go functions realizing the API, but the rest I could implement in Go which made the life so nice. I also ended up calling back into some of the applications APIs from Go, that worked seamlessly.<p>Go has good facilities interfacing with C, the only attention you need to pay is properly handling C pointers (manual memory management) vs. Go pointers (automatically managed via the GC). But with very little care this is not a big issue. The Go part of the code is however much nicer than if you had to implement the functionality in C. (Yes, I do think that Go is a great C replacement)')
