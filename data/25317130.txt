Free speech as  a causal factor may enable an unfortunate causal path, but we can weaken this path by attenuating or removing its enabling antecedents, or by adding or amplifying its mitigating decedents. As such, multiple solutions to a problem that corresponds to a causal path exist.<p>Our values and understanding decide what solutions we seek. If a person doesn&#x27;t recognize or underestimate the benefits of free speech, this person may accept or prefer a large degree of censorship as the straightforward solution.<p>Of course, finding an alternative solution needs insight and broad knowledge, which perhaps isn&#x27;t that commonplace, even in academia.')
