Ammo is not dangerous in a fire: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3SlOXowwC4c" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=3SlOXowwC4c</a><p>As for humidity, I think you would be surprised. Much of Appalachia and the East Coast have high humidity levels (typically 70-90% during summer IIRC) and I&#x27;ve never found ammo damaged by humidity there. I&#x27;ve shot 25 year old ammo that was put in an ammo can and dumped in a hiding spot near a pond (so, very high humidity) and had no issues shooting with it. Even if the ammo is stored in the manufacturer&#x27;s cardboard box, I wouldn&#x27;t worry about humidity damage unless average levels are over 85 or 90%. Water damage is a different matter, but I don&#x27;t have any experience with that.')
