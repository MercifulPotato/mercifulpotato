In particular, is it almost certainly going to be due to whatever carries the mRNA, or could the mRNA itself be the problem?<p>If it is the carrier in which potential safety issues lie, does that mean that once we have one successful safe mRNA vaccine for virus A, then when some new virus B comes along an mRNA vaccine for B that uses the same carrier is going to be as safe as the vaccine for virus A?<p>If so, does that mean for future new viruses, the mRNA approach will let us go right into effectiveness testing, skipping phase 1 safety testing?')
