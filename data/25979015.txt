But it doesn&#x27;t look that AstraZeneca is acting in bad faith. The UK invested 3 months sooner and that enabled AstraZeneca to solve manufacturing issues sooner. The same issues happened in the EU sites but those were started later, so unfortunately nothing can be done about this.<p>Politicians have a magic thinking that because they will demand fulfilment of the contract, the extra doses will miraculously appear. It&#x27;s not how it works, the only way to get them is to take them away from the UK. It might or might not be fair to share UK doses with EU considering that this is a global pandemic but that is completely different discussion unrelated to the signed contracts.<p>Looking is at this from legal perspective only is not helpful. The following events, like the EU backtracking on North Ireland export ban, clearly show this. We need cooler heads prevailing.')
