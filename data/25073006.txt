I&#x27;m sitting on a J5005 based home built NAS (ITX system with 6x 3.5&quot; drive slots) and a 6500T uSFF PC as a hypervisor. I don&#x27;t need the CPU core count of teh author, sure, but I&#x27;m running at maybe 150w under full load and about 50w idle between both systems.<p>My whole stack is, on average, less costly to run than 1x Xeon V3 CPU standalone. But power cost is also a priority for me vs more cores.')
