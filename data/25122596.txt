They seem to think that there is somehow a &quot;legitimate interest&quot; for unnamed third parties to &quot;Create a personalised ads profile&quot;  (and many more things) when I read an article on their website.<p>These &quot;ad choices&quot; screens conflate the legalese beyond recognition to make you give in to unlawful demands, which is their real purpose.<p>And undoubtedly my Apple advertising ID gets passed to these  unnamed third parties in the process.<p>It needs to stop. And I don&#x27;t care that companies might not be able to exist without it. Good riddance.<p>Good luck Max Schrems fighting this, and please add all these web publishers with their &quot;Ad Choices&quot; scam to your target list.')
