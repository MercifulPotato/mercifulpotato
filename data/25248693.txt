Ok, let&#x27;s find another way of saying that? BTW, it probably isn&#x27;t an important question, and it&#x27;s up to the company to set the culture around work hours.<p>However, I will say that for many companies, hiring people who give a shit, doesn&#x27;t have to mean hiring for people who give a shit about your grand vision. A QA engineer doesn&#x27;t need to be passionate about what the product does for a customer (though it&#x27;s nice), but you want them to be passionate about QA.<p>We should all be passionate about the craft&#x2F;task we do. The nice thing is, even if you find something you would absolutely hate doing, there are people out there who would love that very thing.<p>I learned this when I was younger, working in the event space, and a guy who was working for me was a housekeeper at a hotel as his main job. He loved it. I couldn&#x27;t understand how, and he explained that he went into the room knowing the task, he had 10 things he needed to check off the list, if each of those 10 things was done perfectly, he was confident the guests would be happy with the cleanliness of the room. It&#x27;s as if the thought of what he was cleaning or the things he was going to run into never crossed his mind. This is the task, focus on the task, love the process.<p>I actually was the same when I was a busser (clearing plates at a restaurant). I guess I was somewhat passionate about the mission of the joint, which was that we wanted patrons to have a good time. Part of that means clearing up the dishes promptly, with a smile, and have fund with the guests. I don&#x27;t ever remember thinking about that constant mess I was cleaning up, wiping left over food into the bin, etc etc. I gave a shit because...well, it was easy to give a shit.<p>Maybe there&#x27;s something to that, make it easy for people to give a shit. If they&#x27;re not into YOUR mission, help them find or work on THEIR mission.')
