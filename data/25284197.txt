It was grounded, returned to service, crashed again. Eventually, it became safe. And eventually the public forgot about the issues.<p>The bigger problem is that you have a company that decided that a single sensor driving a safety-critical system was sufficient, even though they have two (and even that is not enough, such systems should have three).<p>For a new system that was introduced and not explained to pilots, because that was the goal. It even made the &quot;AOA disagree&quot; warning _an optional feature_. Or, more specifically, it made the AOA indicator an optional feature, and the AOA disagree feature was tied to that. They knew about it, but didn&#x27;t inform anyone. Including the FAA.<p>So now we trust that same company to make the plane safe. Why?')
