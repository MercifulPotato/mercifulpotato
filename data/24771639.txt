This would avoid you the need of a CLA because you can use MIT to incorporate the contribution to your cloud solution and&#x2F;or to sell a license to a corporation that would like to keep their modifications closed.\nThis would also lower the barrier to contributors due they don&#x27;t need to sign the CLA.')
