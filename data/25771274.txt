Considering the unprecedented bitcoin rally, the fact that Tether &#x27;printed&#x27; 2 billion coins last week, and the rapidly approaching court date with the New York Attorney General, I found this article very informative.<p>I think the writing is good quality, nice to read. And it provides a detailed overview of the whole situation, and the history of how Tether came to this point.')
