Licence plates in the UK can be scanned by automated machines owned by private companies, that&#x27;s been established many times before. To request the owner data from the DVLA you need their permission - but that&#x27;s not necessary here, BMW doesn&#x27;t need to know anything about the owner, so no such request would be made to the DVLA.<p>Then on the other side, they have a database of cars that they sold and which are still under warranty - again, nothing about owners, none of the silo&#x27;ed personal information needs to be accessed at all. If the car is not on the &quot;warranty==true&quot; list, then they show the ad. I assume the ad doesn&#x27;t display anything like &quot;hey john smith, your warranty is expired!&quot;.')
