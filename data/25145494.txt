My personal classification of it is that it&#x27;s used by the same generation that uses &quot;bae&quot;, &quot;cray&quot;, &quot;totes&quot;, &quot;YOLO&quot;, and terms of similar vintage.<p>I have no idea if that&#x27;s true or I&#x27;m just out of touch, but that&#x27;s my impression of the phrase.  Basically I feel like I tend to see it in titles of thinkpieces about newly popular things from people who are around 30.')
