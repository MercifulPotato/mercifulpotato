Any displacement of labor came from firms that did not adopt robots. These non-adopting firms actually lost their competitiveness â€” and they had to lay off workers.&quot;</i><p>I don&#x27;t find this very compelling. How many workers were lost by companies that didn&#x27;t automate vs companies that did? It&#x27;s entirely possible for Amazon (or another company with heavy automation) to add 50,000 jobs, while their competitors cut 75,000 jobs, meaning a net loss for workers.')
