As someone who started in CS but went for a degree in Mathematics I held on to the idea of some sort of test suite that newer mathematicians (who have tend to come up with already existing or already disproven proofs for fun while thinking they’re on to something) could run to determine if they’re wasting their time and it not have to be a class mate making fun of them (sadly I’ve done this to kids who were just excited to try and learn, as if I had any room to talk.)<p>And it would only scale from there, hell we could run such a test suite against all known proofs and who knows how many ancient theorems we could disprove.  I don’t think this is the test suite but something like it and the ANN that OpenAI build to check proofs is a good start.')
