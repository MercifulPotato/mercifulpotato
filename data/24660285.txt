The Vedas mention castes in that of division of labour, not division of importance.<p>I don&#x27;t believe the British introduced the caste system in its current form (division of importance) to India - more likely it was a very normal evolution during the phase just before the Mughals took India over. Having huge inequality weakens countries and allows people to target oppressed demographics.<p>The sadness of India being unable to get rid of the system now is that it leaves us open to being attacked again for such a stupid reason when Vedic&#x2F;Hindu scripture doesn&#x27;t condone this.<p>And this is what is happening in the West and especially in the US now. We don&#x27;t have the caste system in the West per-se, but we&#x27;ve left many people behind. This has become our weakness as they can be easily provoked and guided elsewhere, away from our founding principles. I can only imagine how gleeful enemies of the West feel when they see what we&#x27;ve done to ourselves and how easy we&#x27;ve become to manipulate.')
