Effective - yes. Safe? We won’t know for a while.<p>Pandemrix, a flu vaccine, caused a notable uptick in narcolepsy in Sweden, Finland and likely the UK. This was not (and could not) be seen in smaller trial populations.<p>It is not a given that any of the covid vaccines is safe enough. Historically, two cases of rushed vaccines (cutter polio and Gullah barre) were worse than the disease - and these were for diseases worse than covid. Those were 50-60 years ago. Pandemrix was 10-20. I’m not sure we’re that much better on safety now to rush vaccines.')
