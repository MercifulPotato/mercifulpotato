If a particular action the driver didn&#x27;t take would lead to results that didn&#x27;t happen, then shadow mode will have a lot of trouble knowing that. In general it&#x27;s a problem called &quot;off policy evaluation&quot; and it&#x27;s really hard. Tesla has to estimate what would have happened counterfactually, had the bot been driving, instead of seeing what happens with the bot driving. A million miles of this shadow mode evaluation isn&#x27;t worth nearly as many miles of actual self driving.')
