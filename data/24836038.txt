FTTC would not fit most people&#x27;s definition of being &quot;wired for fibre&quot;.<p>Describing 80Mbps for FTTC as realistic is also a bit of a stretch. If you live in an area with modern phone lines and happen to be close to the local cabinet, this may be your experience but isn&#x27;t that representative of the population as a whole.
