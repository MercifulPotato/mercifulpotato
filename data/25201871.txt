Item(by='ikeboy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606244961, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25201488, text='Turner is about a content-neutral regulation. The proposal in OP doesn&#x27;t appear to be content-neutral. It&#x27;s also weaker than Turner in that no compelling government interest is identified. Being charitable doesn&#x27;t mean I need to assume that every censorship proposal written by a non-lawyer somehow complies with the 1st Amendment if I add enough epicycles.<p>The author is critiquing Section 230, not the DMCA. They&#x27;re making some extremely strong claims, and in particular saying certain things are obvious or extremely likely. It doesn&#x27;t cite any cases and each of its examples appear wrong. The core argument is dead wrong. 230(c)(2) is barely even cited in court, most cases cite (c)(1) because the good faith standard is difficult to establish.<p>I&#x27;ll note that you&#x27;re mainly nitpicking one of my three critiques and haven&#x27;t addressed the other two.')
