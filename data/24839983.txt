It&#x27;s just much more complex and can not really be understood as a single number - people can be out of workforce because they are retired, because they are sick, because they are wealthy, because they can&#x27;t find work, because they are in prison, because they rely on somebody else to supply their income, etc. etc. Probably too complex for an average newspaper headline.')
