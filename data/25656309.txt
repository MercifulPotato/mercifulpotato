It&#x27;s not something we do as a hobby or for fun in our spare time, because we don&#x27;t really have spare time.<p>Btw, it&#x27;s quite common to have Syrians working on projects for US and Europe and avoid sanctions by VPN and registering their business in Dubai. I know a Syrian company that is a GitHub and AWS partner.')
