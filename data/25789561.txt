Even lions on the African savannah have been documented to engage in same-sex sexual acts. Worse, you&#x27;re using that imagined &quot;law&quot; to disparage a whole class of people that do not fit your imagined world order. Even worse, you&#x27;re then claiming that you should have the right to disparage these other people, and that not being allowed to spread your intolerance is somehow equal to you not tolerating these other people. And to top it off, in order to justify your position, you&#x27;re claiming a universal concept (love), giving it your own spin, and claiming that any other interpretation than yours is invalid.<p>So let me give you a counterexample: the Ancient Greeks had four main words for love: eros, philia, storge, agape. The latter one has been narrowed by Thomas Aquinas into the definition you just gave, but even in the language of the Bible, that does not preclude the other instances of love.<p>So please, get off your high horse and stop imposing your narrow worldview on the rest of us.')
