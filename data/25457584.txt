Or do you mean the ability for developers to write their own policies for their own apps?<p>For the former, I can see that it might be important and informative to show how the various roles and their relationships relate to access, and we should write a blog post soon explaining how we interact with the platform to create ShareWith!<p>For the latter, we plan to open up the platform to developers as quickly as we can, so stay tuned!')
