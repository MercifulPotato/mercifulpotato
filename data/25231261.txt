What is the most simple representation of the idea? What in the MVP (minimal viable product)? How can you reduce this to it&#x27;s simplest form?<p>2. What sub-problems or sub-ideas need to be tackled in order to realize this larger project? Try to figure out which ones must be solved first and which ones can be solved independently.<p>3. Try to find existing solutions to your abstractions - there&#x27;s a good chance you&#x27;re not the first to ask these questions. If there isn&#x27;t something existing, repeat from step 1.<p>A ridiculously important part to solving these smaller tasks is to figure out how they can be tested. You don&#x27;t want to get to the end and figure out some part doesn&#x27;t work as it needs to.')
