As we grew I hired account managers, sales, etc and he hired devs.     We chose to start a company together but never really worked together.<p>Now 4 years later I&#x27;m working in the backend for the first time.  I wish I would&#x27;ve spent more time pair coding with him and discussing architecture together.   We worked at 3 other companies together and went to university together and I think we missed our opportunity to truly work together on something <i>WE</i> want to build.')
