No parties are perceived as the exact opposite of the other. Friends and family often vote for different parties, and loyalty changes over time. And this is how it is across almost the entire continent, with the UK as the major exception (with their voting process favoring a two-party system).<p>If Americans could somehow get a taste of this freedom of choice, I&#x27;m certain many of them would demand the same things at home. I&#x27;m amazed that there&#x27;s often 10s of kinds of peanut butter in an American super market, but only two political parties. Could it be done with tech? I&#x27;m not sure, but I would like to see someone give it a go.')
