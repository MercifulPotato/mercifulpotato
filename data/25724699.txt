Item(by='nobody9999', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610340879, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25722882, text='Facebook, Twitter, et al are <i>not</i> public squares.<p>You can speak all you want in public spaces, on your own property (whether that be your home, your blog or your mastodon instance) mostly without limit.<p>But Facebook, Twitter, Google, HN or any other <i>private</i> organization is under no obligation to host or amplify your speech.<p>The government can&#x27;t censor you and you may speak your mind in public spaces.  You <i>may</i> also do so in private spaces, with the permission of the owners of those spaces.<p>You seem to be under the misapprehension that certain private actors are <i>required</i> to allow your speech.  That&#x27;s not true.  They are responsible only to their shareholders and to a lesser extent, their customers -- and in this case their customers are <i>advertisers</i> and not you.  You are the product being sold.<p>If you don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s right or fair, then don&#x27;t interact with those private actors.  If enough people chose not to deal with them, they would lose their power and influence.<p>I voted with my feet years ago.  If you haven&#x27;t, then you&#x27;re part of the problem and not the solution.')
