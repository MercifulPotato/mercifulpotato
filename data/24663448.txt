I&#x27;m a Korean American in my thirties, and most of my East Asian American friends lived with their parents until they got married, or they had to move a very long distance away for work. Several of my friends who are now entering their early 40s and are still unmarried continue to live with their parents. All are doing at least above average financially and could easily afford to move out, but they (myself included) don&#x27;t see the point.<p>In contrast, my non Asian friends are shocked when the hear about stuff like this. It&#x27;s like they cannot possibly imagine living with your parents beyond college. It&#x27;s tantamount to admitting you are a failure at life.<p>I once lived on my own for two years in my twenties just to see what it was like. My apartment was barely 15 minutes away from my parents home. After two years, I came to the conclusion it was pointless because all I did at my place was sleep, so I moved back in. I didn&#x27;t move back out until I got married many years later.<p>I will admit, I was not exactly a big hit with women and at least part of the reason I chose to move out back then was to see if it would improve my love life. It did not. YMMV, but many of my aforementioned Asian friends who are happily living with their parents today at an &quot;advanced age&quot; are also happily dating. For that matter, I was completely dateless&#x2F;loveless when I was living on my own, but it ironically improved significantly after I had moved back in with my parents, culminating in my marriage.')
