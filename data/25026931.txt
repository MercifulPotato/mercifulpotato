This bias has been created in their minds by university professors who have never been to these parts of the country themselves.  The bias manifest in things like a coworker being afraid to accompany me on a business trip to Walmart headquarters in Northwest Arkansas thinking it was dangerously racist.  I had to explain to him that there are multiple cricket leagues in the area in that racism is not nearly as prevalent in the south as Hollywood would have him believe.  He ended up enjoying it so much there that he later relocated there from Fremont.  \nLiving near Boulder I routinely encounter the exact same ideological brainwashing amongst people who came to the US as students.  \nI say this is someone that is done extensive volunteer consulting work for the Democratic party including my last gig in 2014 for the midterm elections.  I agree with the vast majority of the Democratic party platform but have become very dismayed at them overemphasizing race as a motivating factor for their opposition.  I can promise you that for most southern Americans that vote Republican abortion is a much bigger factor in their vote than race.  and economics is much bigger than either those categories.')
