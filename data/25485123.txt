You&#x27;re missing the point, I&#x27;m <i>not</i> addressing that.<p>Instead you seem to agree people name things in the same (irrational according to you) way both in English and Python.\nWhich is exactly my point and what you previously claimed <i>not</i> to be the case.<p>Once again I am addressing this comment:<p><pre><code>    A function that finds the x y coordinates of dogs cats and baboons in a picture.</code></pre>\n&gt; This is perfectly ok, but only because it&#x27;s english.<p>No, it&#x27;s not ok <i>only</i> because it&#x27;s English. It&#x27;s ok because it&#x27;s a definition, it is <i>not</i> a name.\nIn English as in Python we tend to prefer more concise names.<p>A function&#x27;s name is...a name (duh), the comparison to prose makes no sense. Once you actually compare English and Python <i>names</i> you&#x27;ll see they both tend to be more concise.<p>&gt; See past your bias and ignore pointless aesthetics.<p>Ironically I find your style more poetic (we really have opposite tastes :P). But as you saw we both keep the same preferences independently of the language. No incoherence&#x2F;bias there. That&#x27;s the only point I&#x27;m making.')
