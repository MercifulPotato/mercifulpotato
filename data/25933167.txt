Gamestop is a mall&#x2F;strip mall operation which already means they are suffering from the massive over buildout of retail that ran wild until the crash of &#x27;08. They have a huge shopping mall presence, which means even for retail they are suffering more than most due to the cratering value of mall space in the US.<p>A large portion of their profit came from buying used game discs and reselling at a healthy markup. Digital distribution was already hurting that in a major way and COVID is only accelerating the decline of physical media.<p>Their plan has been the same as several other desperate mall-based stores like barnes and noble: keep the core product to draw people in, but pack the shelves with cheap high-margin &quot;lifestyle&quot; items like t-shirts and toys. I predict in 5 years they will be a corpse that&#x27;s been picked clean by venture capital, existing as nothing more than a brand that can be slapped on some online game store.')
