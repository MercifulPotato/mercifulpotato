I call my family via Facebook Messenger or Zoom etc... I&#x27;m surprised that more more companies don&#x27;t let me call them via these services or that some new startup hasn&#x27;t starting selling the intergration so a customer can click &quot;connect via Whatsapp&quot; to our customer service.<p>I&#x27;m also somewhat surprised there isn&#x27;t a standard for this (maybe one is being worked on) so that all services and register for the standard to let me connect.<p>Further, I&#x27;m surprised there isn&#x27;t work to let me register some contact info in a global way. As it is, when I move, I have to contact 15-30 companies and update my address. Why I can&#x27;t I just do that in one place and the companies can use the info live?<p>Yes, I get here are all kinds of privacy issues. Still, there must be some solution. For example, id service providers let me login, change my address, and then select which companies that I&#x27;ve registered to that id get my new address, etc.... I&#x27;m going to tell them anyway, just make it less tedious to do it.')
