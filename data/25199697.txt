Yet, the local barkeep could still have a shotgun under the counter. Town was the public square, where the local bar, while a public establishment, was a private proprietorship.&quot;<p>I wish people had a better sense of this earlier social arrangement.<p>It was the <i>most conservative</i> of approaches to gun possession and was imposed by the town elders who wanted to <i>regulate</i> and order behavior in the public sphere.<p>Now we find ourselves in bizarro world where firearms politics are exactly flipped:  a free wheeling &quot;let-do&quot; policy is championed by &quot;conservatives&quot; and a highly regulated policy is championed by &quot;liberals&quot;.<p>In reality, a historical perspective shows us that the ownership of modern weapons by average citizens is <i>off the charts</i> liberal.  That is absolutely where it sits on a political spectrum of rights.  It is, historically, the prerogative of the most conservative and reactionary interests to prohibit&#x2F;restrict arms.<p>All that to say:  I prefer the conservative approach.  I, too, was very young once and very excited to exercise my rights and privileges ... I open-carried regularly, had a CCW, etc., and the result was a lot of discomfort and bad feelings.  Carrying a firearm is a provocative act and it makes sense that <i>conservative</i> actors in a community would try to keep that at bay.')
