We should be able to support a very large number of people working on human development: scientists and technologists, medical professionals and even wide-spread service jobs, especially if better paid.<p>But &quot;just having food and shelter&quot; is by no means the thing to be overcome. Or do you think that food and shelter just appears like magic in front of everyone?\nWe need people to grow the food, collect it, distribute it, arrange it on shelves or serve it in restaurants. We need people to build homes (and implicitly the materials that need to be dug up or obtained from somewhere), sell them, renovate them, maintain them. And what about the huge infrastructure that goes around doing all this, the roads, the water treatment plants, the garbage collection? Who&#x27;s gonna do all that? Oh, right, we have food and shelter, that&#x27;s enough, I forgot.<p>If the proportion of people who want to do science&#x2F;progressive stuff is larger than what is sustainable to do all that I was listing above as well, wouldn&#x27;t you say that becomes a problem?')
