This forces any user that wants both HTTP and another network protocol (SSH, for instance) to stay on the older version.<p>However, we can&#x27;t all keep waiting on Hyper. Pijul&#x27;s solution is to push the same bugfixes to two different channels, one of which includes an extra patch for transitioning to Tokio-0.3 (the newer version). Since the identity of patches is preserved, no rebase is needed, and conflicts solved once are solved forever (no rerere).')
