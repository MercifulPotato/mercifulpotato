My partner is a resident since birth and want&#x27;s to stay, I&#x27;ve been here a few years, don&#x27;t mind it but see it as a tech backwater.<p>Searching LinkedIn I get no jobs, searching overseas I&#x27;m getting hundreds. Local being Sydney Australia and overseas being London. Things that interest me being Scala, functional programing, work that isn&#x27;t big data with large corporations trying to fuck over their customers and doing bad things collecting&#x2F;using data and not crypto currency.<p>The only options I have is go in to management. Not my skill set at all and I&#x27;d be &#x2F; am a terrible manager as dislike the politics being a blunt straight talking person. My partner also jokes saying I show autistic tendencies with my bluntness not being able to read the situation.<p>I can change careers then I&#x27;d be taking a 4x paycut at the least and that&#x27;s after 3-4 years of re-training. I&#x27;d be struggling to live even though I have a modest life style driving a 10year old toyota corolla in a cheap rented house. I love manual labor I find it more re-warding than sat in endless meetings with people talking gibberish avoiding giving a straight answer or avoiding just getting the work done but i&#x27;d be silly to make the switch.<p>So right now I am stuck in a job I&#x27;m bored with, dealing with stuff I don&#x27;t want to deal with for a company who staff are great and some of the best people i&#x27;ve worked with but owner is a text book psychopath, and the contracts dull all for the pay check.')
