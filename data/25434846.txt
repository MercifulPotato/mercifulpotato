And, I occasionally hear from people who attended in the past that quality has dropped over the years and its not as good anymore.<p>How many people here have participated in an OU program recently? Where were you from and what sort of degree did you pursue. Was it worth it given the price and quality?<p>Additionally how is the credential viewed in general? I understand it s a legitimate university in the UK, but something about a degree with very little to no academic admission requirements seems like a bad idea.')
