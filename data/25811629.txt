On the other hand, O(n^2) and it’s supersets can be problematic when applied blindly. \nI don’t remember the exact situation but I recall a GUI app that listed some options in a drop-down menu. But on each click, they managed to call a function with O(n^2) complexity and you don’t need many elements to get a big number that way, so the drop-down visibly froze the UI (I guess it was an older framework with no separate thread&#x2F;just bad code that worked on the main thread).<p>Of cource relax and enjoy programming, but I think reading up on algorithms can be fun and useful for the long term!')
