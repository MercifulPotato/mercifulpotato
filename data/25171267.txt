I paid off my loans through a combination of hard work and luck. I&#x27;d love to say it was all me, but it wasn&#x27;t, I had great role models, I am lucky enough to be born into a country with amazing infrastructure, and many other reasons that have very little to do with me...<p>My question for you is do you want a stronger country?<p>Or, just a stronger you?<p>As a country are we just a bunch of people out for themselves, or are we a community?<p>I am a firm believer that the more Americans who are doing well in life, the better off we all are. The more Americans who are secure financially the better off we all are. The more Americans who can afford additional services and products the better off we all are. The more Americans who have a little bit of financial freedom to start a company and create jobs for other Americans the better off we all are. Repeat, repeat, repeat.<p>A little selfishness is good, but too much and everyone starts to view everyone as competition and &quot;success&quot; as a zero sum game. I want the kid down the street from me to be doing as well as my kid.<p>What do you think?')
