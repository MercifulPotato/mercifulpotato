It seems we have no real election auditing in our country, which frankly should be something that&#x27;s done automatically at least on a spot-check basis.  One large category of fraud that it would prevent would be illegal immigrant voting.  In my state you can register by having someone that is already registered vouch for you.  That&#x27;s it.  No other identification needed.<p>I&#x27;d honestly like to know what voter suppression tactics are happening in America.  From what I&#x27;ve heard from Europeans they tend to be pretty amazed at how lax our process is.')
