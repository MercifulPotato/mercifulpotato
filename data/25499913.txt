GM is a legacy business with a legacy business model selling dozens of indistinguishable cars via multiple competing dealerships.   Its both terrible for customers and not compatible with Apple.  The reason GM is priced so low is because its half obligations and dead weight.  I would not personally want to bail out the doubtlessly billions of dollars of unfunded pension obligations of GM <i>as an investment</i> (ie, why should apple pay for the people who last worked at GM a decade ago?).  Cleaning up that mess would take serious, distracting, decade long effort if its even possible.<p>Apple should poach the best employees from the industry, not the companies.  They could probably straight up double everyone&#x27;s salary and still pay less than SV engineers.  I&#x27;d also look to buy out some manufacturers in the supply chain.')
