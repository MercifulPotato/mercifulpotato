And no, Fedora really doesn’t count.<p>Ubuntu’s big thing back in 2004 was that it was a well-heeled founder (and company), coming in to actually put time and money into the desktop experience on Linux in an opinionated way (obv. not everyone agrees with those opinions, but I would argue that being as opinionated as commercial&#x2F;proprietary software was Ubuntu’s biggest strength in the beginning). Over the last 16 years, nearly all of the big bets on desktop development have failed. Ubuntu One (the cloud personal cloud service)? Failed (though in retrospect it was a really good idea. Too bad users didn’t pay.). Ubuntu Software Center? Failed and discontinued. Unity? Failed and discontinued. Ubuntu Phone&#x2F;Touch (and Canonical had invested massively into mobile)? Failed and given to the community. Mir? Failed, probably for good reasons, but failed.<p>Where has Canonical made money? Enterprise and in the cloud.<p>I totally understand the attraction to Linux on the desktop, but every company that has approached it in a way that is focused on end-users and not the enterprise in a way that isn’t either volunteer driven or as a very small company has failed to make it any money off of it. I imagine Canonical will continue to deemphasize the desktop even more as time goes on.')
