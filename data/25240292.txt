It&#x27;s just that Western History is West-centric. In general that makes sense because an arbitrary human life has value approximately zero. For instance, 2 million people died in a famine in India under British rule but no one knows about that.<p>If it weren&#x27;t for Hotel Rwanda, the Rwandan genocide might go unnoticed. The Khmer Rouge are barely known. And everyone might joke that &quot;Haha the North Koreans have no food&quot; on the edgier parts of the Internet but ultimately, 3.5 million could have died there and we would barely have noticed.<p>That&#x27;s not even because of some evil ignorance - it&#x27;s just that people always see things from their reference point (and not even big vs small). American Independence was a big deal to America but not a big deal to the UK. Brexit is a big deal to the UK but no one outside really gives that much of a damn. And think about the Vietnam War - it&#x27;s this massive moment in American history but to the Vietnamese it is one massive moment sandwiched between their wars with two other superpowers.')
