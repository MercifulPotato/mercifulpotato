Why would anyone run closed-source clients for federated networks when there are open-source clients readily available?<p>One could imagine a scheme where endpoints run some kind of zksnark-wrapped computation against a hash-list of &quot;unlawful&quot; content, proving with mathematical certainty that one is not transmitting contents that are on the list. But this mountains of effort both because of complexity (protocol needs to be structured in some other way) and limitations of snarks - they do not handle this amount of computation well.')
