And also, this was written by some journalist and approved by the paper&#x27;s editor, so it could very well be a fringe opinion since only few people were implicated. We don&#x27;t know that this opinion is shared by many people. Contrast this with Twitter, where it appears that &quot;a lot of different people&quot; seem to be holding this or that opinion. People who aren&#x27;t overtly belonging to the same group or organization. Which means the opinion isn&#x27;t just some random group making things up, there must actually be something to it.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this works every time and &quot;despicable rumors or partisan rhetoric&quot; in the press never worked. I&#x27;m sure they did. But I think it worked on fewer people, and in order for those rumors to take hold in society they would have to spread through the people, not through newspapers, which must have been slower at the time.<p>Or the newspapers would have to be very convincing in order to influence many people directly, just writing a 140 character blurb wouldn&#x27;t have done it.')
