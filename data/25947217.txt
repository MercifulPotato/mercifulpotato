I&#x27;ve not read RH&#x27;s terms of service, but I&#x27;d be surprised if whatever terms it laid out didn&#x27;t basically have a fuck-you clause in it that would throw out any contract violation suit. Additionally, I&#x27;m not sure if there is actually a private cause of action to sue someone for alleged market manipulation (not that I believe the allegations here).')
