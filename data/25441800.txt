I don&#x27;t even read them.<p>This year i decided to do &quot;something&quot; about it, so every mailing list mail received in my inbox that i don&#x27;t want&#x2F;care for gets an unsubscribe. It has already reduced my daily mails by a somewhat large amount. It&#x27;s hard to say exactly how much, but i estimate around 10 emails less every day.<p>Most of the unsubscribed lists are from companies where i&#x27;ve purchased something andthe seller took the liberty of subscribing me to their mailing list. Those are mostly pre-GDPR that i&#x27;ve just never gotten around to dealing with.<p>The execption is of course obvious spam mails, to which unbsubscribing will probably do more harm than good.')
