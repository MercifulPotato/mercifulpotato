By far the easiest method of making an IP address appear to come from somewhere else would be a proxy, but it&#x27;s never precisely claimed, because that&#x27;s not how rules of evidence work. The burden of proof is on the prosecutor, and we don&#x27;t know exactly what is being alleged, nor how it will be defended. I assume that the search warrant is somewhere on the Internet, but without at least the warrant to add context, we fart into the wind.')
