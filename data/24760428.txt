When some people think &quot;park&quot; they see green grass.  When they think &#x27;walk the dog&#x27; they mean go to a fenced acre with sections for small&#x2F;medium dogs.  Such people are urban dwellers who probably shouldn&#x27;t venture past city limits.<p>But some of us own labradors, huskies or even wolfhounds.   Walking them means a car ride to a river with a few miles to run.  When we think &quot;park&quot; we think Zion or Jasper ... not Central.  Some people like to rollerblade to the corner starbucks with their Havanese dog on a retractable leash.  I prefer to save my coffee money and spend it on a proper car to haul me, my canoe and my chocolate lab to a river beside a mountain.<p>Remember the old Nissan commercials: Dogs_love_trucks.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_aYZrvG5BkY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_aYZrvG5BkY</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1XCKSXvhbQU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=1XCKSXvhbQU</a>')
