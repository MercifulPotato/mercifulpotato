Originally my idea was to use SSE for signalling but in version 2 it becomes a relay between peers. This approach will make it portable to mobile (native, Flutter, RN) which is difficult to do with WebRTC. The added throughput and latency should be similar to using TURN server with WebRTC. Websockets are the more common choice for signalling but HTTP&#x2F;2.0 brings a new life to SSE.')
