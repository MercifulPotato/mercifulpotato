It was a complete debacle.<p>I’m also pretty impressed with XBox game pass- it has changed my relationship with gaming. I’ve been gaming with my XBox than my Switch because its reduced the friction of accessing high quality console games, and I’ve been trying more indie games because they are just there.<p>Not the sort of hardware innovation you are talking about, nor is Microsoft a first mover in the game subscription space, but still important I think.<p>Disclaimer- I’m a Microsoft employee, but not working on anything near gaming, and my opinions are my own.')
