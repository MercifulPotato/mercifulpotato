Item(by='runarberg', descendants=None, kids=[25879122], score=None, time=1611369524, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25878907, text='&gt; Saying that climate change will have &quot;untold cost&quot; is problematic because it makes you believe that mitigation strategies that will have massive costs will be justified to avoid climate change damages<p>I’m not aware of any existing technology capable that will mitigate the harm that the current trajectory of the climate disaster is projected to cause.<p>Hoping for new technology that can save us from the harm 30 year from now is naive. Thirty years ago we had quantum computers, microwaves, GMO, lithium-ion batteries, etc. VTVL rockets are a 25 year old technology already. Hoping for something that doesn’t exist already will save us is simply a disillusion.<p>In honesty “shutting down the economy” is still a better option then “business as usual”. Although, honestly, I thing there is a better option: <i>Investing in green infrastructure</i>, along with <i>International agreements</i>, and <i>carbon taxes</i>, which we could integrate into existing societal systems to at least slow down the harm until technology is available that can save us from this catastrophe.')
