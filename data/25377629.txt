He would be the first to explain that the average of two false statements is not necessarily true. The referenced &quot;inference as to what really happened&quot; does not proceed by the method you assume it to do. Indeed, the false-balance problem, where it occurs, is merely another way in which his maxim, &quot;everything in newspapers is more or less untrue&quot; is realized!')
