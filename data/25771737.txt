SQL is already a DSL and I can&#x27;t see how creating another language isn&#x27;t just adding more overhead without actually getting you to usable objects.<p>The only reason objects are the &quot;wrong&quot; abstraction is because they don&#x27;t match relational models exactly. That impedance mismatch is the entire reason for the object-to-relational mapping, otherwise you can use things like document-stores and just serialize your objects directly.')
