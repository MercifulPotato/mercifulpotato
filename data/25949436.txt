This is a good walk through for the display portion of the project. It would be a local status app slideshow instead of the web page. I am planning on getting a wall mount that allows me to easily charge and have it in a central location while still being able to take it off of the wall to do admin on the setup. I was originally leaning towards making it a quasi-dedicated ereader but between the boox note air and the remarkable tablets, the extra money to get writing functions is well worth it to me.')
