FDI in China is actually up, even American investment in China.[1] under the current administration no less. Number of foreign students in China has steadily risen, and only slowed somewhat down but it&#x27;s still the fifth most popular country for foreign students[2]. I personally plan to return in the next few years in all likelihood. (I don&#x27;t have family in the country, and I&#x27;m not Chinese for what it&#x27;s worth, and I rarely had problems).<p>I see absolutely no evidence in the numbers, or personal experience, but only in narrative that China has become a worse place for foreigners. Business climate is way better than it was mostly due to rule of law improvements. I have no idea to what extent the corruption reforms purged antagonistic party members or whatever, but it wasn&#x27;t just a stunt, it actually did help private businesses.<p>I also find the elevation of Deng over Xi odd, given that Deng all his economic reforms aside, also used to roll tanks over students. The current administration doesn&#x27;t even seem close to go back to the old methods.<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;188629&#x2F;united-states-direct-investments-in-china-since-2000&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;188629&#x2F;united-states-dir...</a><p>[2]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;monitor.icef.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;chinas-foreign-enrolment-growth-flattened-out-in-2018&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;monitor.icef.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;chinas-foreign-enrolment-gr...</a>')
