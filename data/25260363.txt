Even at that time the proctoring&#x2F;anti-cheat software was a nightmare.  I was semi-accused of cheating because of &quot;anomalies&quot; during one of my tests.  It was quickly cleared up by talking to the professor.<p>The software is a privacy disaster and any computer that has had any of this spyware installed should be considered compromised.  I kept a separate hard drive and would swap it in to take tests.<p>To fix the problem, grading measures need to be changed to accommodate the new world of online classes rather than trying to shoehorn old test proctoring into a remote space.  This software only stops bad cheaters anyway.<p>I&#x27;m already imagining the fights I&#x27;m going to have with my daughter&#x27;s schools in the future when they ask us to install this malware.')
