Include wild openings like the Kings Gambit and Danish Gambit, as well as strategic openings like the Queen&#x27;s Gambit.  You will be out of &#x27;the book&#x27; very quickly, and that&#x27;s actually good.  You&#x27;ll be learning to play, rather than recall.<p>Another piece of advice: Study endgames before openings.  Learn about K + P vs K, the elementary mates, (K + 2B vs K, and K + N + B vs K). Then keep going. I have had to &#x27;finish off&#x27; opponents in tournament conditions with these combinations of pieces.<p>Lastly: Best chess book ever: <i>Winning Chess</i> by Fred Reinfeld and Irving Chernev.  Of the dozens of chess books I&#x27;ve owned, this one is head and shoulders above the rest.  All about middle game tactics, and mating patterns.')
