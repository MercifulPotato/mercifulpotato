Everyone has an opinion. Most are convinced they know what’s going on, despite the fact that they lack the skills and knowledge necessary to evaluate the subject matter (math, science, medicine, law, business, economics, etc.) and absolutely refuse to do the research necessary to have anything approximating a valid opinion.  It’s D-K at it’s worst.<p>I went through a phase of deeply researching topics in an attempt to communicate the realities and facets of many issues.  After a year of nothing but frustration (and worse) I stopped caring.  People take sides on these issues like picking colors.  It’s crazy.  It’s amazing to see just how attached they are to their chosen perspective while knowing so little and making no effort at all to research and understand.<p>One of my favorites is Climate Change.  Both deniers and supporters are engulfed and fully invested in their respective delusions. This means the reality of the matter is in the hands of a minority with no voice.<p>The same brain that allowed us to survive in the wild is now driving mass delusion.  We are still cavemen.')
