That&#x27;s where there&#x27;s a clear argument for geothermal, hydro, and hydrogen. Maybe natural gas with carbon sequestration. If nuclear wants to join these options, it needs to prove itself as something that can be built. And as somebody who doesn&#x27;t believe that we are close at all to natural gas with carbon sequestration, I think we are a <i>lot</i> closer to making that work than we are to having the managerial and technical skill capacity to build new nuclear.<p>Nuclear is not the only option, we have so many more.')
