If it has an &quot;accident&quot; it&#x27;s good to know that there is actually a Starship SN9  that has just been completed at the manufacturing base a couple km from the launch site, standing by to take its place and try again.<p>Then there are two more vehicles abou 50% done - just join the tanks and add the pointy part in the front.<p>And parts have been spotted assigned up to SN16!<p>So this is really no ordinary space program where you prepare for years to launch a single super expensive rocket and then deliberate for months or years what went wrong and how to fix it.<p>No, they built the best rocket engine ever, attach it to glamurous 50s SF rocket built from stainless steel (and random Falcon 9&#x2F;Dragon&#x2F;Tesla parts) in a marsh and then launch and make more until it can go to space cheaply and reliably.')
