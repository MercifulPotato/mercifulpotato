Item(by='breck', descendants=None, kids=[25211561, 25211301], score=None, time=1606321283, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25209926, text='I make them all the time (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jtree.treenotation.org&#x2F;designer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jtree.treenotation.org&#x2F;designer&#x2F;</a>), and track many thousands of DSLs.<p>IMO, the problem is our languages are unnecessarily complicated. they are all linearly parsed BNFs, and you don&#x27;t need any of that. I think things will start changing big time.<p>That being said, my favorite ecosystem in the traditional DSL world is ANTLR, and I&#x27;d highly recommend Terence Parr&#x27;s books on the field if you are interested.')
