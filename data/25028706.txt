The people who are actually creating and sharing being forced out by finger waving moralistic censors who somehow manage to take over leadership positions is a trope that threatens open source communities. I&#x27;ve abandoned projects already because of this pattern, and have seen many friends do the same.<p>Watching a community that has stood for freedom be destroyed by petty authoritarians is incredibly depressing, but I think that very freedom and openness is what makes it vulnerable to these manipulations.<p>It seems a lot of these people exist, and a lot of their supporters do too. I&#x27;d be perfectly live-and-let-live, and just stay out of their projects, but it seems like they intentionally move into and hijack existing projects as well. I&#x27;d really like to see a clear method of letting these people know they are not welcome in a project without giving up the very freedom and openness they&#x27;re founded on.')
