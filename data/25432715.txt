I couldn&#x27;t stand staying in on Friday night. Fear of missing out, even if I didn&#x27;t even know what was I exactly missing out would burn too strong.\nNow in my 30s I love being alone. I can even go camping by myself in the wilderness alone, or hit a bar (pre-covid of course) by myself and not only be happy that way, but prefer it too. Sometimes I would go out by myself a few hours beforehand before meeting up with friends, to get that &quot;I am doing things alone&quot; fix.<p>I am not sure what changed and I became this way. I didn&#x27;t work towards it or strive for it, I just grew older I guess. So I came up with a theory. Not even a theory, more like an opinion...<p>That when we are younger we rely on society to survive. Without a support cycle, the elements will overtake us, and our animalistic instincts light up. Our identity is tied to our social circle.\nBut as we get more confident and more comfortable with who we are, that deep fear of loneliness decreases. I am more alone now but less lonely.')
