The number &amp; genealogy of all the forks confused me to no end (well, at least for a few hours).<p>Tacking on two more software pointers:<p>- The mikenye collection of docker packages is well maintained, well documented, and a very easy way to get started feeding. Example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mikenye&#x2F;docker-readsb" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mikenye&#x2F;docker-readsb</a><p>- I made a little CLI &quot;gui&quot; to monitor&#x2F;visualize the SBS1 stream from dump1090 and clones. It was just a little excuse to understand the telemetry&#x2F;protocol better.
