Based on that and your web activity, ACME Micropayments determines a per ad amount and starts bidding on advertisement space (but only to show to you). In the sense of GDPR this is one of the few things that might make sense to opt into tracking for.<p>Anyways, if you win the ad space you don&#x27;t see an ad and if you don&#x27;t win the ad space the site you are visiting still gets paid. If you pay enough monthly to outbid everyone, you are paying for an ad free experience. If you low ball it you still see a bunch of ads (until the end of your year&#x2F;subscription period where with a surplus of money the bidding can go up).')
