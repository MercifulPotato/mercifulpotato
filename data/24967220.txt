Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604319044, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24965890, text='&gt; One of the uses of certs is to sign test builds with a different cert from the production release, so that you can ask Apple to disable them after release. So Apple gets requests to revoke certs for this, and other reasons all the time. In this case HP had used a different cert for these drivers as against other drivers, showing that they used different certs for different purposes, that&#x27;s all.<p>Where in the world are you getting this information? Citation please.<p>Apple Product Security does <i>not talk</i>. About anything. So any claims about what Apple receives are dubious at best.<p>&gt; you can ask Apple to disable them after release<p>There are very strict limits on how many Developer ID certs you can generate. You can&#x27;t generate them willy-nilly. So this claim is also dubious at best. I have a developer friend who ran into this limit, and it took him months to resolve this issue with Apple Product Security. He was stuck.<p>Again, you just seem to be inventing things in your own mind with no first hand knowledge. Are you even a Mac developer? Can I download one of your Developer ID signed apps?')
