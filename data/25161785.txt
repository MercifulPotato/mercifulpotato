Go back just a few years and even basic multimedia tasks like playing music or decoding a JPEG require some amount of accelerator support. Go forward a few years and hardware accelerators are suddenly crucial to energy efficiency. Ergo, everything in Flash Player is done in software. Vector rendering &amp; compositing? Software. Video decoding &amp; playback? Software. This wasn&#x27;t at all exclusive to Flash, of course, but Adobe was uniquely unsuited to realize this problem.<p>Apple realized very early on that you needed hardware acceleration for common computing tasks in order to have laptops that last more than an hour on a single charge. It took Adobe several years after the launch of the iPhone to actually support <i>some amount</i> of hardware accelerated video decode, and as far as I&#x27;m aware vector rendering (the core of the platform) was never meaningfully accelerated. As far as I&#x27;m aware, pre-iPhone efforts to get onto phones involved a special cut-down Flash runtime that was perpetually out-of-date and was only really popular on early-2000s Japanese handsets. This wasn&#x27;t at all built for the &quot;computer in your pocket&quot; that Jobs wanted.')
