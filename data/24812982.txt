They hire a few well known OpenSource people but its clown-town the rest of the way down. This is mostly because they are stingy and risk averse. Exhibit A: Who headquarters in San Antonio? Maybe once IBM or HP hit their heads a few more times one of them will buy up Rackspace and be done with it.')
