It&#x27;s also not a lot of money in Google&#x27;s security budget.<p>Apple&#x27;s payout seems rather low to me.  If I had a vuln like that and knew they were only paying $100k, I would probably seek to monetize it elsewhere.<p>$3k is almost insulting for something like this, given Google&#x27;s scale. $31,337 might be more appropriate to at least avoid insult.')
