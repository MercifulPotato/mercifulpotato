For products that we just buy and sell rather make ourselves we have about a 40% margin. This is all quite normal.<p>Additionally in my industry about 80% of the value chain is taken by the retail outlets. 30% would be pretty awesome for us.<p>30% is way less than a lot of other industries pay to have their products distributed to a market full of waiting buyers. I’ve read that writers of books only get about 10%.')
