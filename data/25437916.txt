But the task at hand is still problem solving, not language processing (at least not in the capacity of a typical conversation). I think a good example of this is the popularity of code visualizers. The only thing stopping Brainfck from solving your problems as easily as Python is the ease of human understanding, not some fundamental property of Python being more “language-like.”')
