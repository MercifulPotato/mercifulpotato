For example, it is very difficult if not impossible to install Linux on the most recent Macbooks. Previously when Apple stopped supporting a Mac, you could install Linux on it. I suspect with the ARM systems going forward, that will become even more difficult.<p>In other words, it is not just about better performance. It is also about Apple removing your freedoms with your own hardware in the name of &#x27;security&#x27;. (I am not saying that there isn&#x27;t increased security, but at what price?)')
