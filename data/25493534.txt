But, like with every other manufacturing method: it is complementary, there are applications for all of these.<p>And yes, I&#x27;ve stepped into factories, and worked with&#x2F;for them, beside that I had a metal workshop and was partner in an early CAD&#x2F;CAM company. So FWIW I think I understand the limitations of the tech quite well, and I think that if 3D printing could be sped up by a factor of 100 or so (which is definitely in the realm of the possible) that the other disadvantages would matter a lot less than they do today.')
