I don&#x27;t trust that Apple is acting in my best interests over GNU software, for example, not by a long shot.</i><p>Well, this is half-thought though.<p>First, most people don&#x27;t use any GNU software or even know what GNU is. And they can and do trust all kinds of BS that they shouldn&#x27;t (that&#x27;s how computers get filled with malware crap).<p>Second, GNU in this context means nothing. GNU is an organization and an assorted set of licenses, not a program, and a program being associated with GNU says nothing about the safety of the program or not. The programs themselves could still be maliciously polluted with malware as have happened time and again, unbeknownst to the authors of the programs and those running the repositories.<p>&gt;<i>Is our best shot at trusting one another to delegate that trust to a notoriously non-transparent corporation with a laundry list of conflicts of interest, obfuscated closed-source software</i><p>Well, if you&#x27;re against closed-source software you shouldn&#x27;t be using macOS or Windows in the first place.<p>&gt;<i>and that&#x27;s operated out of a country well-known for surveilling its citizens and citizens of other countries?</i><p>The latter is a political issue, and best solved at the political level. You don&#x27;t get out of a surveillance situation just by using different programs, when the whole state apparatus, sites you visit, even ISPs, etc, is used for surveillance.')
