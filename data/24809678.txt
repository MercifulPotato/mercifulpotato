Eg that they take a cut of each food item on top of their delivery fee. I always assumed the delivery fee was their cut. It was only when my wife mentioned she chatted to a local store who we ordered regularly from, that they mentioned they make crap all money on Uber&#x2F;Deliveroo&#x2F;etc orders.<p>Weâ€™ve deleted their apps and now just call ahead for pickup and go grab it ourselves. I feel shit for not looking into it sooner.')
