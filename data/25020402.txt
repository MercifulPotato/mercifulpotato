The quoting rules for CSV are just bizarre, and also make it impossible to skip records without parsing every single field.  TSV does the right thing:  only three characters are special (line feed, tab, backslash) and to include them in fields, you escape them.  This is totally unlike the mess that is CSV!<p>I also don&#x27;t get why TSVs aren&#x27;t more popular.<p>Ironically, even the only reason why CSV exists at all, MS Excel, likes TSV better.  The only format that can be exported and imported without trouble is TSV, encoded in UTF-16 with a BOM.  But everybody uses CSV anyway.  Weird.')
