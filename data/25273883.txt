It&#x27;s always really annoying to have to tell people that they&#x27;re making up my entire point.<p>Secondly, how is condemning Scott Atlas for his <i>calls for an insurrection against the elected governor of Michigan</i> a &quot;personal attack&quot; against him? I&#x27;ll remind you that the governor of Michigan was already the target of a plan to kidnap her and <i>execute her on television</i>; having someone in the White House calling for an uprising against her is no small thing.<p>And if &quot;don&#x27;t call for uprisings&quot; is your definition of &quot;political wokeness&quot;, then I think that you&#x27;ve watered down the idea of &quot;woke&quot; to the point of uselessness.')
