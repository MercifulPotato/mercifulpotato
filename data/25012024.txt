I actually see this move as a good sign that Chinese governance is still very functional. They&#x27;re putting the health of the financial system ahead of their image as the new finance superstar, it would have been easy to just let it go through to show off China&#x27;s financial independence.<p>Letting unregulated finance run rampart isn&#x27;t a signal of achieving your full potential. It&#x27;s a fairly new development maybe from the 80s onward.')
