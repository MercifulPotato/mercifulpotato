Let&#x27;s say, I&#x27;ve put about 20h in it and I expect it takes me 3 times that. Just counting the time put in that kind of project, the outcome itself isn&#x27;t worth it.<p>Considering this is a 10 years old android tablet that cost at the time ~300$. I probably could have bought directly a more modern one which is known to be flashable with linux.<p>The sentence I cited resonate for me as I often dive in a project and follow in the rabbit holes even though I know it&#x27;s a bit irrational to do it.<p>About how to do it:\n - you first have to find every git repo that may have relevant patches for this or similar device. There&#x27;s the one open-sourced from the manufacturer, Google has one dedicated to the Tegra chipset, with more recent stuff but without any specifics about that device.\n - determine what parts are relevant: definitely the board definition, the drivers. But then, that file weirdly named which appears to handle interrupts? Well better take it.\n - adapt to changes in kernel interfaces: I&#x27;ve only come across name changes for now, but you can imagine it gets more complex\n - finally: compile, flash, test! And probably keep doing that for a few cycles.')
