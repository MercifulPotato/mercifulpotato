Checked a number of possible 1000km routes [0], most were over 10h. Found just one that took 8h, Paris - Berlin. And these are not night trains. The night train for Paris Berlin seems to take 12 hours.<p>I traveled a relatively short distance by plane recently and the airport time+location overhead was just about 1 hour (got from one house to my other house in 2 hours with a 1h flight). And the train would have about 20 mins of overhead. So the effective overhead was more like 40 mins in this specific case. Of course it could be much worse for many routes. But probably mostly under 2h even under very unfavorable conditions. So you&#x27;re looking at 3-4h by plane.<p>[0] and was being pretty generous by only checking western europe too. In many parts of Europe buses can be faster than trains.')
