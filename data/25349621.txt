I don&#x27;t know.<p>I shipped a laptop to a new employee, paid $250 for shipping. It got there three days after it was supposed to. It sucks to pay so much for weak service, and like no visibility into what&#x27;s happening. I&#x27;m honestly surprised at this point none of the carriers haven&#x27;t introduced some sort of estimate based on ML rather than their delivery standards. It seems like they should have enough data points by now.')
