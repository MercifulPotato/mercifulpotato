That alignment is far from perfect, but it&#x27;s a lot better than it would be with a Democrat, especially a progressive Democrat.<p>That&#x27;s why I typically vote Republican, sometimes begrudgingly.  Has nothing to do with belonging to a community.  In fact, the communities I am a part of rarely discuss politics.  We discuss values that inform our politics, but the politics themselves are secondary.<p>I have absolutely no fear of social disconnection due to my political views.  If I was to suddenly start voting democratic, no one in my closest circles would even need to know.<p>And I care nothing about whether progressives accept me.  I simply have very different values and don&#x27;t believe where they want our culture and country to move is healthy.  So, I don&#x27;t support them in elections.  How they feel about me is irrelevant.')
