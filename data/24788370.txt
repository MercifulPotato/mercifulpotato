There are a lot of tools out there, so apologies if I am misinformed.<p>Okay. From my quick reading, BuildBot is a nice way to run your tests in parallel. It also has Jenkins-like dependencies, where a successful build can trigger another build.<p>In Conducto, these parallel and serial steps aren&#x27;t broken apart, they are combined into a single tree. The tree lets you compose these steps to do bigger and more sophisticated tasks, all within a single build. Check out <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;conducto&#x2F;cant-teach-an-old-dag-new-tricks-16eee4a8fe62" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;conducto&#x2F;cant-teach-an-old-dag-new-tricks...</a> for more details.<p>This makes it easy to chain together steps like &quot;Build my artifacts&quot;, then &quot;Test them&quot;, then &quot;Deploy my app&quot;, where each of the steps has more detail.<p>Also, Conducto has a big focus on debugging that I don&#x27;t see in BuildBot. In my experience, debugging new features is a major productivity bottleneck for developers, and we built Conducto to make it easy to reproduce errors and solve them quickly, even in long-running pipelines.<p>I&#x27;ll keep reading, these are my first thoughts.')
