However the point stands that string theory has made more accurate empirical predictions than any other theory of quantum gravity. That doesn&#x27;t mean no other theory of quantum gravity will ever beat it, just that the focus on string theory among people and funders who are precomitted to studying quantum gravity is rational.')
