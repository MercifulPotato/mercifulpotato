Since I don&#x27;t have a mac anymore, I couldn&#x27;t confirm or deny; and since I don&#x27;t have any equipment with the bad equipment in the path, I couldn&#x27;t get a tcpdump, and I hadn&#x27;t seen any on twitter.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t have expected Apple to purposefully break the checksum, just like they I don&#x27;t think they purposefully have no synflood protection because they pulled the TCP&#x2F;IP stack at the turn of the century and never pulled it to get the many many many upgrades from upstream (although, they did add on MP-TCP, so there&#x27;s that). I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if tcp checksums had stopped working ages ago, possibly because of a aggressive driver, and nobody noticed. Kind of like how if you spawn a few thousand threads that just sit around sleeping, it will delay watchdog kicks and the kernel will panic. (also, from reports on here, not personal experience)')
