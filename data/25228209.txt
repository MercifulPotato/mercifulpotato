We use CAPTCHA to accessing a service. Imagine the &quot;worst case scenario&quot;: you don&#x27;t use Google services but a paid service has Google&#x27;s CAPTCHA. It may seem like you are paying for training Google&#x27;s AIs and you get nothing in return... but:<p>- Bots cause trouble to the service<p>- The service has to find some mitigation<p>- Mitigations cost money, and that cost will be passed down to the customer in some way<p>- Google offers a free solution, maybe not the best, but it will not cost the service anything (or close)<p>- So you are training Google&#x27;s AI in exchange for cheaper service<p>Of course, you may disagree with it, you may think that a paid service shouldn&#x27;t use Google&#x27;s CAPTCHA, that you already pay too much, etc... But you are free to go elsewhere, and the rest is just market considerations, not something governments generally mess with, at least not governments that support free markets.<p>You could do lawsuits based on specific terms and conditions, but I guess large companies, Google first, have lawyers who know they stuff and get the company covered.')
