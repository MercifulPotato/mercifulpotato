Any useful analysis would have to reckon with that fact: look at the law, identify what it was that Californians found so appealing, and suggest ways to deliver those appealing parts while still improving the lives of workers. Doubling down on the idea that it&#x27;s a transparently bad law written by VCs to oppress people might be emotionally satisfying, but it seems very unlikely to either accomplish the author&#x27;s goals or help us understand the situation.')
