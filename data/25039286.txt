It&#x27;s beco0me clear to me that large corporations like Microsoft have jumped into open source whole heartedly in a big part because they get tons of free labor. Not only that, I had a bad experience contributing to an open source project in which the author snidely told me I should have searched the code base because the bug was fixed when it wasn&#x27;t, closed my bug report out and denied my pull request. So it seems to me a negative deal situation on both fronts. I&#x27;m know there are great open source projects, but I&#x27;ll need to be very selective about them.')
