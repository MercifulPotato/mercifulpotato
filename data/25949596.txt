Only the writers of utopian libertarian science fiction think that.<p>The question is how you manage that lack of freedom and to whose benefit you try to manage it. I prefer it be managed towards the general stability of society. Of course it will be managed in an imperfect way but I prefer the goal be a stable society.<p>edit: The government intervening will never really make the market more free but it wasn&#x27;t free to begin with (see robinhood today). So you lose a bit more freedom but you shift the benefit of the overall loss of freedom from &quot;a bunch of rich people get richer&quot; to &quot;society as a whole get&#x27;s richer and more stable.&quot; Not fully but a bit further.')
