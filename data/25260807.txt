Broadly, those who enjoy reading, and those who don&#x27;t, but endure it as a means to obtain information.<p>I&#x27;m in the former camp, and enjoyed your writeup quite a bit.<p>The latter camp will reliably show up when writing is any more long-winded than it absolutely must be, and will a) summarize (good) and b) complain (annoying).<p>It is what it is.
