You can have an entire message that&#x27;s 6 bytes, but you can also have a header that&#x27;s 14 bytes.<p>I&#x27;m curious why they added support for massive messages (2^32+1). And I&#x27;m curious how much bandwidth would be &quot;wasted&quot; if instead of supporting a 6 byte header (for messages 0 - 125 bytes) and 10 byte header (for messages 126-2^32) they just made it fixed for 0-2^32 with a 9 byte header.')
