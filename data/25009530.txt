Can be done much cheaper going with used parts from wrecked cars. Cheaper still if one has the resources to do their own fitment fabrication work.<p>It&#x27;s nice though to see an outfit with the kind of reputation that Swindon has earned in ICE motorsports jumping into the EV game. This is bound to be a straightforward and high quality kit for those with the means and not the patience or ability to spend a year of weekends tinkering - that&#x27;s a section of the EV conversion market that&#x27;s always been missing.<p>For those who care about the cost and enjoy long tinkering projects, the hobbyist market&#x27;s already been around for decades, and now the used production parts market is becoming well established.')
