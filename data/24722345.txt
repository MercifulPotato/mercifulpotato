It&#x27;s also meaningless, because nobody is saying that <i>nothing</i> should be done to inhibit spread.<p>The question is, <i>what</i> should be done? How many people-years can we realistically save, and at what cost? Every year, almost 3 million Americans will die of any cause. If we take a CFR of 0.4%, and a &quot;herd immunity&quot; threshold of 70%, the upper bound of deaths in the US from COVID-19 is under a million. The average age of a COVID-19 fatality is higher than life expectancy, which means that half of these deaths would&#x27;ve occured under any circumstance, in the near future. We can see high excess mortality right now, but we haven&#x27;t seen how that translates into lowered mortality in the future.')
