They can just as easily attach branded labels to standard jars, right?<p>Or even just standard mason-jar size threads and diameters so at least the lids and bands are interchangeable. Washing and re-using jars is so much easier when the lid doesn&#x27;t have to be paired with the exact jar it came with. (I know that proper mason jars use tempered glass, but I&#x27;m just talking about containers to hold leftovers in the fridge or dry goods on the shelf.)<p>My best guess is that they&#x27;re worried about liability and so intentionally make the threads incompatible so people can&#x27;t use them for canning, but I have no evidence this is actually true.')
