Till this day is easily in my top 10 favourite books. And oddly enough almost 20 years later the same copy is sitting right besides me on the shelf. I am very interested in getting a copy in another language and reading it just to see how I feel about it(sadly Japanese is out of the question): I&#x27;ve been surprised how different books feel in different languages. On the subject of Mishima, his biography really shocked me when I first read it. Most notably how the book and his life ended - incredibly similar, yet incredibly different. It&#x27;s really hard to describe it but for anyone who hasn&#x27;t read the book, I highly recommend it.')
