Object storage is a commodity, and Docker images are objects, so <i>shrug</i>. It would be cool if Cloudflare supported container registry primitives backed by user provided Backblaze B2 bucket config info, for example (maybe you can do this with workers?).<p>Properly parameterize your build&#x2F;CI scripts (in this case, your container registry host and how to auth against it) for portability. Portability is your insurance against poor service provider behavior.')
