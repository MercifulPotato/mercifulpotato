Doubtful the only person involved would be the &quot;pilot&quot;. Probably some ground support. I could imagine ground support listening to ATC for the inevitable report. Similar to bank robbers. Once the call goes out, you know how long it will take for a response. However, calls to the police about a bank robbery are guaranteed to get an immediate response. Calls to the police to investigate a UFO are probably not going to see the same response. So once you hear the ATC report, you radio your buddy in the jetpack to land, pack up in an SUV, and drive away. Depending on the size of the jetpack, the pilot might even be able to climb into the back of the SUV without taking anything off. It could be feasible even if it was a call to a more motivated FBI. LA traffic sucks.')
