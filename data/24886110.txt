He uses it as synonym for tyranny, dictatorship, authoritarianism.<p>Fascism is reactionary phenomenon that emerges from democracy failing. You should look signs of it in democracies like the US, not stable authoritarian regime like China. They don&#x27;t become fascist just because they  do ethnic genocide.<p>Chinese are firmly suppressed under the thumb of communist party and Xi. There is no energetic mass movement and energy of fascism.<p>Paxtons five stages of fascism:<p>1. Intellectual exploration, where disillusionment with popular democracy manifests itself in discussions of lost national vigor<p>2. Rooting, where a fascist movement, aided by political deadlock and polarization, becomes a player on the national stage<p>3. Arrival to power, where conservatives seeking to control rising leftist opposition invite fascists to share power<p>4. Exercise of power, where the movement and its charismatic leader control the state in balance with state institutions such as the police and traditional elites such as the clergy and business magnates.<p>5. Radicalization or entropy, where the state either becomes increasingly radical, as did Nazi Germany, or slips into traditional authoritarian rule, as did Fascist Italy.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Definitions_of_fascism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Definitions_of_fascism</a>')
