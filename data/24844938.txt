So many people seem to forget their apple ID password but remember their screen unlock password. I saw a case recently where someone had an attacker get access to their apple account as well as everything else. I was able to do a fresh install of their windows laptop but I was unable to reset the persons iphone because the attacker had changed the apple id password.<p>I have also seen many android devices bricked by the same anti theft protections.')
