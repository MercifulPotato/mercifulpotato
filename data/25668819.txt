Arguably they&#x27;ve made a new space - governed by nothing but their own corporate policies.<p>I mean, if conversations on twitter are akin to conversations in a public park in the USA, then you would expect the same social &#x2F; legal conventions to hold on twitter as in public spaces. If I incited violence in the local park, there are norms and laws that come into play. Arguably the same laws should hold on twitter. From that perspective, its weird that a tech company acts as the judge and jury - rather than the police and the courts. And complaints about censorship make total sense.<p>But if you think of twitter, google, facebook etc as corporate serfdoms, then there&#x27;s no problem with twitter&#x27;s enforcement. Twitter is a space owned and ruled by a tech company. You rent your twitter account, but own nothing. Twitter can set any rules they like, or set no rules and act entirely capriciously. The interesting question is whether or not we want the internet to work like a weird echo of the middle ages. And what (if anything) we should do about it.')
