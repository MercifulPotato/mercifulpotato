Maybe a bit thicker. For example it could assume US dollar look. Note is blank until you &quot;upload&quot; BTC to it, then it will look like e.g. $100 note. You could only &quot;cash&quot; the cash by downloading it back to your wallet. Then it becomes blank again. It could also split if you wanted to &quot;cash&quot; only half.')
