The hiring managers could be interviewing dozens if not hundreds of candidates - sometimes they are genuinely busy and they literally cannot spend countless hours to respond to every candidate they&#x27;ve spoken to tell them &quot;No, we&#x27;ve passed on you&quot;.<p>Ghosting also happens in both way - as a hiring manager, I&#x27;ve had a many times where I had to reach out to the candidate patiently waiting for their response to the next round or getting back to me for a coding exercise with no response (the bad ones) or a &quot;sorry, I forgot to tell you that I got the job already.&quot;<p>Finding a job is a lot like dating, it takes 2 parties to make it work. So just like ghosting in dating scene, ghosting in hiring process will always exist, it&#x27;s not a technology problem but it&#x27;s a human behavior problem. By the way, anonymously calling out the other party of ghosting is even worse IMO.')
