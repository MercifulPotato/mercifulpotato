Vendee Globe had a number of UFO causalities, with a number of boats having to retire, one even breaking in half and sinking (the skipper was saved by one of the other competitors). There is the Jules Verne Trophy going on right now, hitting a container at 40 knots is not going to be pretty and these guys have no support boats around to help (the JVT is a single boat trying to go around the world as fast as possible). Even commercial powered boats are not going to be really happy about hitting a container.<p>Remember all the talk about how disused satellites might cause problems due to debris? That already happens on the sea.')
