The question with intermittent fasting is really just &quot;is it better than plain old calorie restriction&quot;. Seems like there&#x27;s some evidence that points to &quot;yes&quot; and some evidence that points to &quot;not really&quot;.<p>EDIT: To be clear, by &quot;is it better&quot; I meant aside from just adherence. I&#x27;ve used IF quite a bit myself and I find it much easier than eating frequent, small meals throughout the day if I want to be hypocaloric. There are a lot of claims around autophagy, a more favorable metabolic adaptation, better body composition, and in this case actual cancer treatment. <i>That</i> is what I would like to see evidence for.')
