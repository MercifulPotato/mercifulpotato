The former sets a trend early on and doesn&#x27;t deviate from it (it&#x27;s like reading a slow motion train wreck), the latter fails to make the characters relatable and the end revelation is lame.<p>If you haven&#x27;t, I recommend picking up some of the later books in the series. They can be read in any order. It&#x27;s unfortunate mr. Banks isn&#x27;t around to write any more, because it seemed that his work was showing considerable improvement towards the end.')
