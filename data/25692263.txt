I said they wouldn&#x27;t have entered with a dozen officers there, which is completely different. The situation wouldn&#x27;t have escalated that much.<p>Apologist:<p>a person who offers an argument in defense of something controversial.<p>You&#x27;re literally trying to defend the honor of the mob right now. At least you&#x27;re shifting your argument as I present video footage, so you&#x27;re smarter than most. But yes, you&#x27;re an apologist at this point. I only hope you&#x27;re playing &quot;Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; right now in the interest of spurring discussion.<p>-----<p>For your actual discussion point:<p>They killed an officer and injured dozens more. They were taking the barricades and shoving them against officers. 12 cops sitting at the front asking them to be nice would have done jack diddly squat.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jtPmi4BShNM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jtPmi4BShNM</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcdfw.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;national-international&#x2F;watch-pro-trump-rioters-smash-glass-in-attempt-to-break-into-us-capitol&#x2F;2521229&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcdfw.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;national-international&#x2F;watch-pro...</a><p>These people were willing to steal the riot-shields from the officers stationed there, and then use them to break windows elsewhere. They were scaling the building, attacking from multiple floors simultaneously.<p>There&#x27;s more than 12-windows in the US Capitol. They needed tons of officers at every entrance, on the top floor, on the base floor, covering all windows and doors. US Capitol police simply didn&#x27;t have the resources to defend the building.<p>All of this would be obvious if you spent 30 minutes looking at a few livestream videos. Seriously: look them up. They&#x27;re still all over Youtube and Twitch. The mob literally livestreamed themselves invading the Capitol. All this information is out there for you to see yourself.')
