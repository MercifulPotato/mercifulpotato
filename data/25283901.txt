Vegans eat more animals than someone drinking milk or eating a steak. They just eat parts smaller animals like insects, rodents, etc ground up during harvesting.<p>Instead of getting your information from silly &quot;documentaries&quot; or vegans who&#x27;ve lived their privileged lives in cities, try going out to a farm.<p>Is it moral to spray insecticide to kill a gazillion insects? Set up traps to kill&#x2F;hurt&#x2F;shock animals from your vegetation? Is it moral to kill a gazillion rodents, insects, etc to harvest vegetation? Keep in mind that no vegan meal is devoid of animals. Everything from spaghetti to salads have animals parts in it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;04&#x2F;health&#x2F;insect-rodent-filth-in-food-wellness&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;10&#x2F;04&#x2F;health&#x2F;insect-rodent-filth-in...</a><p>I know it&#x27;s counterintuitive, but a person eating a steak is eating less animals than a vegan eating a salad. A salad contains thousands of animals parts in it.<p>&gt; Our eating habits are deep cultural traditions that don&#x27;t budge in the face of even the most agreeable arguments to change them.<p>Our eating habits are derived from our biology and environment.<p>&gt; &quot;But it just feels too good to give up! XD&quot; or &quot;But if I stop, everyone else is still going to do it, so why stop!&quot; aren&#x27;t arguments we&#x27;d level at the carnal pleasures of rap<p>It&#x27;s not only that it feels good, it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s the optimal diet for humans. A vegan diet is a suicide diet. No human being can survive, let alone thrive on it. That&#x27;s why all vegan diets is supplemented by pills.<p>The best diet for humans, animals and the environment is the  hunterer gatherer diet. Unfortunately, that isn&#x27;t possible with modern civilization. So the current industrialized omnivore diet is the best we can do. If you truly want to destroy the environment and animals, then industrialized veganism will do that.')
