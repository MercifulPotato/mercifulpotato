Item(by='hodgesrm', descendants=None, kids=[25875455], score=None, time=1611292389, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25868123, text='&gt; What has shifted is that, where before, there was a &quot;code of honor&quot; that companies could use FOSS software and Elastic would benefit from the uptick in adoption via support contracts, community building libs + writing docs, and encouraging &quot;network effects&quot; for them.<p>I&#x27;ve run a couple of COSS companies and have a few arrows in the back on this subject. The &#x27;code of honor&#x27; is not enough to float even a small company. I don&#x27;t think it ever was.<p>Most people simply won&#x27;t pay if they don&#x27;t have to. It&#x27;s not just a matter of money. Buying software in established companies can be a head-exploding hassle--as in 6 months of fighting procurement. Plus those do-a-good-deed contracts have a habit of disappearing as soon as there&#x27;s a budget crunch or the enlightened manager who pushed it through moves to something else.<p>I&#x27;m not knocking such contracts in any way. They are kind of like crowdfunding for OSS and can be lifesavers.  But it&#x27;s naive to build a company on them.<p>To have a profitable COSS business you need to sell something sticky that customers need and can&#x27;t get elsewhere, so there&#x27;s a real exchange of value.')
