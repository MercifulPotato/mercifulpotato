The first Dragonfly was my 18th birthday present to myself. I am now somewhat older and have only been in woodworking seriously for a 5ish years.<p>Mostly I like not having to go looking for a knife when I need one. In most situations there&#x27;s one around somewhere, but if it&#x27;s in my pocket, I don&#x27;t have to interrupt what I&#x27;m doing to find it. Context switches and all that.')
