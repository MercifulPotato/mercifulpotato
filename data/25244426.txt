To my surprise, the vast majorities of predictions made by experts did not come true. I remember back in April-May-June media would predict that cases will skyrocket in two-three weeks and everything will go to hell. But it did not; in &quot;two-three weeks&quot; someone else would again say &quot;we are two-three weeks away from disaster&quot;. No one ever retracted their pieces or issued a correction, everyone just forgotten about predictions that never came true. Most of my friends are happy to keep on listening to such experts. The media are happy to promote the experts further.<p>So how am I supposed to not be... heavily sceptical when we don&#x27;t held opinion makers accountable for what they say?<p>(I know what I&#x27;m saying is not 100% related to article, but I just want to see through media bullshit, and need to vent somewhere.)')
