Somehow, antiquity, immensely cruel and violent as it was, understood cultural&#x2F;religious tolerance as an administrative principle better than a number of governments do today<p>Grouping Xi and Ghengis Khan is also an affront to the way in which modern state violence is exacted, we&#x27;re comparing a confederation of nomadic horse warriors already habituated to raiding as a lifestyle vs a rational state organizing targeted cultural purgation')
