A “mono repo” codebase, because clearly a Git repository per function in your system would be too much, a large deployment descriptor per fine-grained component, which Spring maybe called “Controller” but is now called “Function”, and instead of combining them all on your desktop, you send them off to someone else’s mega-mainframe [AKA &quot;the cloud&quot;]. You deploy, get an error message, and login to CloudWatch to see what actually happened - it’s all batch-driven, just like the bad old days, so progress is slow. At least we’re not having to walk to the printer on every try, but that pretty much sums up the progress of the last half century. Oh, and a “Function” will be able to handle a single request concurrently, so here’s your AWS hosting bill, we needed a lot of instances, I hope you won’t have a heart attack. Yes, we run workloads that your nephew can run on his Raspberry Pi 4, but this is the future of enterprise.<p>I&#x27;ve mentioned as much to several C-suite executives and professional venture investors I know who tend to wax philosophical about &quot;exponential growth in cloud services and big data&quot; and whatnot. Invariably, their response has been to tell me that I just don&#x27;t get it, or that I make no sense. They give me puzzled looks and maybe even get a bit exasperated with me.<p>Surely others here on HN have run into similarly minded individuals too. They&#x27;re not hard to find.<p><i>Plus ça change, plus c&#x27;est la même chose.</i>')
