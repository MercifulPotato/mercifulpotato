Long, painful (still-ongoing) story short, they shipped me a Pixel 4a that had no cell service. I went back and forth with support for ten days. Then they shipped me a replacement phone. I confirmed my current address. They sent me a shipping notification for my current address. FedEx ended up delivering the package, no signature required, to a town I used to live in five years ago. I double checked and my current address is the only one on the account.<p>Going back and forth with support has been useless. I paid for a phone that doesn&#x27;t work, and I&#x27;m being charged for service that I can&#x27;t use. My last recourse is to refute the payments with my CC company....but that also seems like the quickest way to get my entire Google&#x2F;YT&#x2F;Google Fi account locked up because it&#x27;s all tied together.')
