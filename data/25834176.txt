Cant hurt.<p>&gt;(in terms of cost, though, you can get a decent editor for closer to the ~$300 mark for up ~60k-70k words, but of course if you&#x27;re not intending on putting in a lot of effort - and more money - to market and sell it, that may well be too much too)<p>Lets say there was a magical machine learning perfect editor for free. I input my trash and I get an amazing copy out.<p>I might try marketing and selling it. I have put lots of effort into the book. Afterall just getting 75,000 words down is good effort by itself.<p>The problem is that I put this in grammarly or prowriting aid it finds thousands of problems. You fix them. Then put it in another grammar thing and it finds thousands more.')
