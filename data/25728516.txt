Item(by='CrLf', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610371315, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25714719, text='It&#x27;s easy to attribute the interest in retrocomputing to nostalgia, and it&#x27;s certainly a part of the appeal, but I believe that there&#x27;s something else much more important for many of us(1): an escape from the overwhelming complexity and neverending change in modern tech.<p>With an old computer, you can invest your time fixing it, learning about it, and generally tinkering with it, while being sure it won&#x27;t become obsolete over night rendering all your efforts null. It ALREADY is obsolete and you already set goals that are completely independent of that status.<p>I think it is something that&#x27;s part of the appeal of anything historical: the immutability of the past. Every discovery you make can only be made obsolete by your own incomplete understanding of the subject, not by the subject itself becoming irrelevant under your feet.<p>(1) I don&#x27;t personally own any item that could be considered retrocomputing, but I enjoy learning about it (I&#x27;m an avid consumer of RMC and 8bitguy videos, or Xboxahoy for the retrogaming bits, for example) for the history, mostly. I&#x27;d like to own a few old machines though, but I don&#x27;t have the time to give them the love they&#x27;d deserve.')
