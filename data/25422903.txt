Because we need video calls to just &quot;pop up&quot; for her, expecting her to accept an invite from her email (which she forgot exists...) or open a new tab for a new chat app (which she won&#x27;t remember either...), isn&#x27;t an option.<p>My aunt is pretty locked to Google platforms, she is the person who trains their platforms at her work... and you know what, the idea that she could &quot;just use Skype&quot; didn&#x27;t even strike her mind:<p>It&#x27;s already installed on my grandma&#x27;s Windows PC, she already has a Microsoft account anyways, and it &quot;just works&quot;, popping up a &quot;[aunt] is calling] dialog when she gets a call. Skype worked great, and it&#x27;s available on every platform.<p>It really starts to amaze me that Google doesn&#x27;t understand the importance of that level of integration and simplicity considering their supposed market being &quot;everyone&quot;. My aunt had been considering buying a Google Home&#x2F;Nest&#x2F;whatever it is today or an Android tablet, <i>just to use one app to call my grandmother</i>.<p>But my grandmother already has her PC open, and Skype &quot;just works&quot;. It rings like a phone and it has a big green button to answer it.')
