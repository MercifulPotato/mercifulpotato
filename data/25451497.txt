Having everything you&#x27;re doing recorded isn&#x27;t a very good feeling. It really takes away freedoms of judgement and latitude.<p>Whether or not you think police <i>should</i> have any freedom of latitude is a debate in and of itself, I suppose. I come from a city that has an apparently unusually strong track record with traditionally disadvantaged peoples (POC, homeless, immigrants, etc.) so I have very different gut reactions about police than most of the internet.')
