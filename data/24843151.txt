If all the wealth currently currently squirreled away in places that banks can&#x27;t trivially lend out (art, real estate, etc.) were instead cash in the hands of the lower and middle classes, I would expect a lot more money to be chasing those goods and services against which we measure inflation. This demand-pull inflation against the goods and services we use to measure inflation would cause the measure of inflation to rise and everything that indexes against this measure would adjust.<p>A change in the savings ratio could also cause demand-pull inflation without an increase in printing money. As could a change in reserve requirements.<p>There are also cost-push inflation from things like oil supply shocks, poor farm yields or changes in exchange rates.<p>I would also expect changes in the aggregate balance of payments between a country and all its trading partners to impact inflation experienced by people in that country.')
