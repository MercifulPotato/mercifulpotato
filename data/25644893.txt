Or if it&#x27;s too similar, there could be patent issues. I&#x27;ll give you two examples from when I was a kid.<p>I saw one of those geometric balls that expand and contract at the gift shop of the Smithsonian. I thought, what if they use something like that in a transmission instead of multiple gears? You could have one like that which expands and contracts with a smaller one that varies much less but just changes the pitch of the teeth to fit the big one. The next decade they came out with CVTs which objectively were a better design using (very basically) two rollers that change geometry.<p>In middle school, I created an invention for that young inventor program run by Sears. I made a device that would slide up and down on the side of an extension ladder. It was a basket to hold paint or tools. I couldn&#x27;t find anything like it back then. 20 years later and I see an infomercial one. Perhaps this was my best idea I ever had. Sadly I was just a kid and never patented or sold them. I didn&#x27;t even win the competition.')
