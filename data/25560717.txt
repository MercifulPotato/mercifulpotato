Non-stick is super forgiving because you can cook anything too hot&#x2F;too cold with too much&#x2F;too little oil and get approximately the same result. With stainless, cast iron, etc. it actually takes some thought to make sure you have adequate time to preheat and are actually using the right heat in the first place, but by the end of it you end up being a lot more precise in the kitchen. Once you get the hang of proper temperature control it seems like your results get way more consistent. Plus you&#x27;re spot on with the satisfaction thing, it&#x27;s definitely more work to cook without non-stick but it just feels better for some reason.')
