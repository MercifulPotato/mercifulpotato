They&#x27;re so caught up in their GitHub-integrated value-add that if you try to follow the docs to do a straightforward &quot;deploy&quot; from a directory with a simple &quot;hello world&quot; index.html, there are multiple failure conditions.  The dumbest one being that if it&#x27;s a Git repo and it encounters a remote that it doesn&#x27;t recognize, it will shit the bed.  I&#x27;m not talking about error output; the CLI itself will straight up fail, throw an exception, and terminate.<p>That&#x27;s before we even mention the experience of successful use of the CLI.  The cacophony of color and the volume of output makes for a sensory overload that&#x27;s akin to watching a Safdie brothers film.')
