A physical tool is a tool.  A software tool is a tool.  But if I&#x27;m trying to ship something, FedEx and UPS are tools (in this larger sense).<p>So an abstraction, a way of thinking, a way of writing code, is also a tool.  I can use FP for the problems that it fits well, and use other ways of programming on other problems.  &quot;It&#x27;s just a tool&quot; means &quot;it&#x27;s not The One Right Way&quot;.  Use it when it fits.  Don&#x27;t use it when it doesn&#x27;t.')
