Item(by='bartread', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607164901, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25313280, text='&gt; the interesting bit is that publication such as Nikkei or the FT are still top-notch, but these are niches, not general audience publications. (also my FT subscription is £30&#x2F;month and that’s a lot of money if you’re not in that niche)<p>Indeed. £30&#x2F;mo sounds like quite a lot of money in an era where a teenager doesn&#x27;t come to your house every morning and shove the newspaper through your door (as I used to many years ago) but, adjusted for inflation, it&#x27;s probably less than the cost of that older delivery mechanism.<p>It&#x27;s hard to persuade people of that point of view though so they stick with free, ad-supported &quot;news&quot;. Not that paid news wasn&#x27;t historically ad supported as well, but at least they had more diversified revenue streams.<p>And you are, of course, correct: it&#x27;s all about the clicks and ad revenue. And, given most peoples&#x27; preference for free over paid news, I don&#x27;t have any great ideas on how to fix that.')
