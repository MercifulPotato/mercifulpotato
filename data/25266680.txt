Item(by='kgantchev', descendants=None, kids=[25266849], score=None, time=1606840385, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25265012, text='&gt; Macstadium competes against other short-term rental companies but also against real Macs, Hackintoshes on physical machines, Hackintoshes on virtual machines (inc EC2), and non-consumption.<p>MacStadium isn&#x27;t doing short-term rentals not because it can&#x27;t but because the EULA doesn&#x27;t allow it. Anybody doing short-term rentals is doing it on Mac hardware so they can just as easily sell long-term rentals. Aside from MacStadium being a major player in this field, I see absolutely nothing that favors them compared to their competition. In fact, it seems to have created Amazon as a competitor.<p>And the Hackintosh thing is the reason a Mac hosting companies exist in the first place. If Hackintoshes were allowed, there would be no companies offering Mac hosted hardware. I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s related to this particular situation tho. Apple created the need for Mac hosted hardware so blaming Mac hardware hosting companies for this is a bit backward.<p>&gt; Hacks on VMs are a pretty direct competitor Iâ€™d think.<p>The VMs have to run on Mac hardware as well.')
