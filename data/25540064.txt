This is also used as the image alt text, but then appended with a bunch of keywords.<p>They also link to other people&#x27;s boards which have names related to the images so it looks like &quot;tags&quot;, but I have the feeling it is probably a mix of keyword stuffing&#x2F;linking to other content for Google to follow.<p>The page title is also adjusted to include something like, &quot;237 Best ________ images in 2020&quot; followed by the board name.”')
