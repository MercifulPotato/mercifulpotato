If there is someone is pitched as a potential hire, I have higher expectations vs. someone who is pitched as an intern. I know we will need to train up interns - that is the whole point. But to fill an open role on the team, these folks will be compared with every other applicant, and odds are we will choose someone who we know can hit the ground running and contribute.<p>The term &quot;Fellow&quot; also reminds me of the title given to the top engineers in large established companies - it implies they are the cream of the crop from the entire industry, not a recent bootcamp grad.<p>In short, I&#x27;d just call this an internship to avoid setting incorrect expectations.')
