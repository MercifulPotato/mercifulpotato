In _2015_ I bought a tablet PC (!) which had 16GB of RAM. I&#x27;ve been having 16GB of RAM as standard&#x2F;minimum for at least 5 years already. And it was on the same pricing that these 2020 machines which have 16GB of RAM _as a maximum_.<p>I am not willing the entertain the idea &quot;more RAM is no longer possible nor necessary&quot;, either. Software keeps creeping up as usual (MS Teams _by itself_ uses &gt;2GB, and I have already complained dearly -- Teams is basically a glorified IRC client!). \nAnd next year if not this year already it&#x27;s highly likely my phone will have 16GB of RAM. My phone! On my pocket!<p>It&#x27;s just ridiculous that a $1200 laptop has 8 GB, and it is just unbelievable it maxes out at 16GB. Looks designed to be thrown away next year.')
