The system they&#x27;re trying to convey is such a logistical and dev nightmare. Plus, it&#x27;s also funny how the media likes to portray US and Israel intel agencies are either completely incompetent or omnipotent when it suits their own personal narrative. Pick one and stick with it. Here&#x27;s the logical setup that&#x27;s been tried and true for anyone that&#x27;s ever read a military history book on clandestine ops. It&#x27;s far easier and cheaper just to have 3 guys in an SUV armed with mp5s. One driver, one shooter and one look out. A second or third vehicle as overwatch&#x2F;backup as well within eyeshot. Wait&#x2F;follow and shoot, drive away. Essentially the Iranians are embarrassed as hell because have zero clues to how it happened and who did it. So they&#x27;re fabricating a scifi story to try saving some face. They were far better off just saying, &quot;well, we fucked up protecting this guy.&quot; But the general public needs to stop believing James Bond and Jason Borne are historical figures and read some actual history books. Both the media and public are becoming a pathetic host&#x2F;parasite entity of just spouting bullshit.')
