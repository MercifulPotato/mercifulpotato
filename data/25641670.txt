Understanding the threat model is incredibly important to understanding how and what to defend against. It sounds like you&#x27;re just chucking &quot;security ideas&quot; over the fence in the hopes that one might protect you.<p>Protection against cyber criminals and other net denizens? You&#x27;re probably overkill and also not helpful in some circumstances. Tor is generally for anonymizing internet traffic, but using a financial institution is the exact opposite of anonymity.<p>ISP? Maybe? Depends on what you&#x27;re doing and why. With DPI and other tools it&#x27;s not clear cut.<p>Nation state? Not much you can do. Very little can protect you if Russia decides you&#x27;re a person of interest.')
