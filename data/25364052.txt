In particular, Facebook allegedly has made key APIs available to third-party applications only on the condition that they refrain from developing competing functionalities, and from connecting with or promoting other social networking services.<p>On one hand, forcing Facebook to open up its social graph would have serious privacy implications.<p>On the other, it would provide an incredible boost to any new social network, which could quickly bootstrap off your existing friends. That&#x27;s what Instagram did with Twitter and what Vine did with Facebook.<p>The most important feature of a social network has always been whether your friends&#x2F;family use it. If any new social network can take advantage of Facebook&#x27;s social graph via API, that neutralizes this advantage. Now Facebook is forced to compete by being a better social network, not just a bigger one.')
