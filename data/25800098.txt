Item(by='dmlerner', descendants=None, kids=[25800155], score=None, time=1610772059, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25799825, text='I like short variable names - for variables used in only a short block of code. I like long variable names - for e.g. a field on a struct used all over a file, and certainly exported ones.<p>I think &quot;Go uses single letter variable names&quot; is not so true in practice. There&#x27;s a balance, in every language, between when to use short and long names. Go&#x27;s balance is tilted (a good bit) more towards short, but it&#x27;s not a hard rule.<p>There&#x27;s significant mental overhead in reading `numberOfSubprotosOnProto`, as well as time hearing it in my head. I&#x27;d rather see `n` declared, used a few times in the next &lt;10 lines, and then disappear. If there&#x27;s two similar concepts in the same function, use slightly longer names, sure. Certainly not m and n.<p>I think that&#x27;s the same reason math tends to use single letter variables. &quot;Taylor series are easy! Just memorize: &#x27;f_series_degree(evaluation_point, expansion_point) = sum(derivative_order=0..series_degree, (evaluation_point - expansion_point)^derivative_order * f^{derivative_order}(expansion_point) &#x2F; derivative_order!)&#x27;<p>No thanks, I&#x27;ll take f_n(x, a) = sum(i=0..n, f^n(a)(x-a)^n&#x2F;n!).')
