Item(by='Rapzid', descendants=None, kids=[25382685], score=None, time=1607660055, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25382006, text='I&#x27;ve had a lot of success with selenium-webdriver and Jest as the test runner. Use it with Async&#x2F;Await, write some custom framework around it for stuff like before&#x2F;after image capture and upload to s3(or wherever), and Bob&#x27;s your uncle. ffmpeg can also be used to record the xvfb apparently so I may have a play with adding video capture soon. Debugging in VsCode is nice.<p>It&#x27;s a shame 4.0 has been in beta forever and people keep taking from the project and not giving back, and that async stacks got broke(but I created a proxy that creates a nested stack and preserves the original test code call site), but it works very well in general.')
