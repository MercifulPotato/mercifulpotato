They decided they want a big cut and were brazen to think they owned enough mindshare to draw all the eyeballs. Always pursue dominance. Sow, sow, sow, and more sow. Then reap. Amazon was already an object lesson for them, but they ignored it.<p>In hindsight, of course it went that way. Have you seen the culture deck?<p>They&#x27;ve been on AWS forever haven&#x27;t they? Long before prime video. I very much doubt that it reduces their cost, even at the pricing they must get. It lets them focus their effort.<p>Ok lastly you&#x27;re wrong on their longevity. Yes some people will cancel but the vast majority will not, and they will see more revenue. I don&#x27;t &#x27;get&#x27; Netflix (the content sucks and they are like Google -- your favorite show is likely to get canned, simply because the very best shows are almost by definition &quot;uniquely&quot; appealing and TV, er streaming content is too expensive to generate many such shows) but every remote has a NFLX button. In the end there will be netflix and disney.')
