Unfortunately, since for now I am navigating through my keyboard <i>only</i> (not using a mouse because of lack of batteries) I can&#x27;t really use it.<p>I am using linux and chrome with vimium and when I press f (to reveal the links) it doesn&#x27;t &quot;capture&quot; any links for the books. I also tried it using tab to go to the books and it just jumped over them (!)<p>I presume you are doing some fancy JS things in the frontend that&#x27;s why it can&#x27;t understand the links, however \n I think it&#x27;s a little ironic to not be able to use a practice typing site with only your keyboard :)<p>PS I am not trying to to be the &quot;smart-ass&quot; with my comment, it is honest; if the comment does not seem nice please forgive me, english ain&#x27;t my primary language :|')
