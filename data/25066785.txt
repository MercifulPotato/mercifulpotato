This would make the app kind of useless for anyone who is not paying and is not hot enough to be ranked at top.<p>Sidenote: I wonder why OkCupid deleted their old posts. I loved posts like these and others like Race and reply rate. If it was because of not wanting to offend someone, it is even worse that we are pushing things like these under the rug.')
