Item(by='anon9001', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607104641, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25305360, text='&gt; Play this forward ten years with a family to support and a mortgage which committed you to personal inflation and a track record of ...?<p>Being an excellent employee?<p>I understand your point, but I actually have been doing this for about 10 years now, and I consistently have improved my &quot;career trajectory&quot; by switching jobs when I start to feel that my coworkers are overachieving and throwing me under the bus.  I look at it like a forcing function to switch jobs and get a raise.<p>I already had a decade of pre-work experience just from being a lifelong hacker, so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m relying on my job to learn new technology.  I don&#x27;t have a fear of falling behind.  If anything, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge decrease in SWE competence over my time in industry.<p>Some of my most &quot;successful&quot; friends at FAANGs are bad developers that just devote more time to playing the system than I am willing to do.  I find the social con-man stuff to be really draining and I hate doing it.  I also hate interviewing, which limited my career more than I&#x27;d care to admit.<p>Also, I&#x27;ve opted to not support a family or carry a mortgage.  I&#x27;m doing something similar to FIRE.  I&#x27;m hoping to be FI with a total of 15 years as a tech employee.<p>&quot;But do you really hate working so much that you would sacrifice having children!?&quot;.  Yes.  Very yes.<p>It&#x27;s also likely that tech workers are &quot;overpaid&quot; right now, as we&#x27;re compartmentalizing more work, lowering the skills required to join tech companies, and remote work is now the norm.  It&#x27;s a race to the bottom, and I want out as soon as possible.')
