(Not a rhetorical question, I&#x27;m actually wondering if it&#x27;s the case.)<p>Let&#x27;s say your scenario is a little different: you deposit $100, buy $300 of stock, and the stock goes up to $600, then drops to $400.  Then the broker sells your shares at $400 to &quot;protect themselves&quot;.  If that&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on here, that seems wrong.  On the other hand, if it&#x27;s as you describe that seems reasonable.')
