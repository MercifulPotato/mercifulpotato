What is happening is similar to what happened in 2008 with residential housing, all be it the reasons for the occurrence are very different.<p>Probably the worst consequence from a failed commercial real estate market will be the collapse of the economy that services and depends on these spaces. Restaurants, trasport, maintenance workers and so on will inevitably fail. This will lead to loan defaults, bankruptcies and eventually this trickles down to every citizen in the community if not the country.<p>For a historical view of this type of collapse, look into any resource based boom to bust city or town. The sad part is those that can leave, get out long before the SHTF and it&#x27;s only the middle class to poor left holding the bag. Then when the Fed steps up with a bailout the parasitic rich start showing up again to ride the recovery, lining their pockets once again.')
