But ok, are there vice versa examples?<p>What I&#x27;m getting at is, I understand Parler is generally a right-leaning platform, and therefore the types of &quot;hate&quot; will be right-leaning. Twitter is a generally left-leaning platform, so I would expect their type of hate to be generally left-leaning. So I think a tweet about e.g. storming the Capitol being banned on Twitter but not Parler isn&#x27;t good evidence that Twitter is better. Because, for example, perhaps a violent Antifa tweet would be left alone on Twitter but censored on Parler. Perhaps some ML bot can quantity sentiment of tweets. That&#x27;s the kind of evidence I would like to see.')
