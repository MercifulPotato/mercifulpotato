People use patterns to divide up code with duplication and interfaces. This makes the code more complex, but has some merit as the code is more testable and extendable. The second part is the use of object orientation to reduce code duplication. I am not a fan of this. It leads to deep stacks of inheritance where the code is smeared out in many layers. Modular code is much better in my opinion.')
