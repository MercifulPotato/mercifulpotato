If we had 80% renewables today then climate change wouldn&#x27;t be as big of a problem as it is right now, so the next best thing is to build more renewables until we actually hit bottlenecks.<p>Nuclear power has always been a government funded energy source so unless government policy changes and UK orders 50-100 of these power plants by 2050 then nuclear power is not going to make any difference. Convincing all governments on the planet to invest into nuclear power is extremely unlikely. Without the introduction of a CO2 tax nuclear power will always look bad vs coal and coal will always look bad vs renewables and from what I can tell the vast majority of people don&#x27;t want a CO2 tax even though it would be the best solution for climate change.')
