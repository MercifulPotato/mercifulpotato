Looks like a seasonal outbreak starting mid-September (infection date).\nParameters of the curve look like the first wave (Gompertz-Exponent ~0,06) with less force.<p>Start is hidden under other smaller outbreaks, so it&#x27;s not so easy to measure it exactly. But soon it should peak (if it hasn&#x27;t already...).<p>If they don&#x27;t do any nonsense that changes the mathematics of COVID-19 completely Sweden will be fine.
