I&#x27;m not a scientist, but I can&#x27;t imagine an acre of crops having the same effect as an acre of trees. Also, crops are only around for however many months they take to produce their product, then they are harvested, and the ground is tilled under again leaving the land with scratched earth. Trees in a forest keep doing their thing year round.<p>I&#x27;m also ignoring any of the chemicals that farms use on the land, but it is something to also consider.')
