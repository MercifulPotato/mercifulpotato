Whereas any React tutorial starts with code. You don&#x27;t really start by laying things out and connecting the dots as such, you start by typing.<p>It wasn&#x27;t so much about art-driven games (I found Gris super boring which would be a prime example, though many loved it), but more about people from different backgrounds bringing new ideas. There are all kinds of programmers, or course, but as a whole I&#x27;d say artists or musicians or writers are into different things. As someone who has played games for a long time I usually appreciate something fresh or interesting. IIRC Stardew Valley and Undertale are two examples by people who didn&#x27;t identify as programmers.<p>&gt; But it&#x27;s absolutely true that you can teach artists to code - within the limited domain<p>I think this is the promise of computing that we&#x27;ve failed to reach yet. Any person has a problem, and with a little effort, they can code up a fix. Coding as a skill like putting up some shelves, rather than engineering an entire house. Some tools get some of the way there (like Zapier, IFTTT, or AutoHotKey) but I&#x27;d love to see how far we can go.')
