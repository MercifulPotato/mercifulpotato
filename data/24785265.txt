Windows printing is still a pretty awful experience; the print queue gets jammed and windows is really slow to unclog. The worst part is finding and updating drivers. MacOS printing does a lot better with drivers and clogged queues but it too could still use some work.<p>It&#x27;s too bad there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much industry support for a common, open driver system. PS was a good try but seems Adobe licenses killed that one. Similar with PCL and HP. There was a glimmer of hope with XPS years ago but that quickly fizzled.')
