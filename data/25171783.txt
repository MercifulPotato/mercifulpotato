I worked at a place with around ... ~20 IT folks.  New CEO came in, and within 9 months, 8 of the 20 had left or were leaving (I was one of them).  I&#x27;d reached out to the previous CEO (who still owned the company, had interviewed me, and was one of the reasons I&#x27;d taken the job) and said &quot;something&#x27;s wrong here&quot;.  &quot;I don&#x27;t want to hear it - talk to New CEO&quot;.  &quot;New CEO is the problem...&quot;  &quot;Don&#x27;t want to hear it...&quot;.  So...  loads of people left.  It wasn&#x27;t until New CEO tried to get rid of one person in particular did alarm bells finally go off, and owner&#x2F;CEO came back and booted New CEO.  So... change happened eventually, but not in reaction to 40% of the IT staff leaving in less than a year.')
