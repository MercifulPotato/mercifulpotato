A market maker is a market participant, just like me or you (well, sort of). They buy things and sell things, they don&#x27;t have magical powers.<p>People get confused, but most hft firms utilize market making strategies. A market maker is just someone who puts limit orders on the book (making) vs taking liquidity off of the book (takeout). Anyone can be a market maker, and many firms do both market making and taking.')
