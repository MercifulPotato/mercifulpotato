But one should be able to discuss and support gay agendas - as long as there&#x27;s no specific party endorsement. Stick to specifics like bathrooms (for example) but don&#x27;t mention &quot;democrats support this too&quot; or whatever.<p>Another example would be to around climate change. It&#x27;s okay to discuss ways to reduce pollution, just don&#x27;t endorse candidate or party X as the way that&#x27;s going to happen.<p>So stop mentioning parties or candidates and shit - just issues.')
