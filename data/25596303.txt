The author defines a computer as any device that has transistors, RAM, etc that is, the computing substrate. But there were devices that didn&#x27;t use transistors, but used vacuum tubes or mechanical gears (like Babbage&#x27;s Analytical engine), which I think are still computers. We have some good theoretical model of computers: like Turing machines. One possible definition of a computer is any device that is Turing complete.<p>I wonder what such a theoretical model of life would look like.')
