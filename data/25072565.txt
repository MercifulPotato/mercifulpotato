But there was a showstopper for us with the replication: If the cluster leader fails, _every read replica will force a restart_ to elect a new leader, resulting in minimum ~30s complete cluster downtime. In our situation we have no problem with a short downtime in write availability, but the fact that we can&#x27;t maintain read availability via replicas is a deal breaker.')
