You can see examples of phrase structure and dependency diagrams e.g. here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dependency_grammar" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Dependency_grammar</a><p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I agree with OP, and have a very &quot;language-oriented&quot; thinking style. I certainly don&#x27;t visualize anything while programming or doing math (except for geometry and the like). My thinking feels like it&#x27;s more based on constraint solving and seeing analogies between domains.')
