Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission. Any state legislature (or perhaps even any state legislator) that wanted to challenge their state&#x27;s initiative-back election laws could sue. I&#x27;m not that well versed in election law, but it&#x27;s also possible any state citizen could do it as well.
