I mean that overusing the term &quot;AI&quot; is kinda bad and annoying but I think it&#x27;s not doing the heavy lifting in the rapid adoption of these technologies and the buzz it creates.<p>Even if we just talked about large-scale high-performance statistical data processing, or &quot;algorithmic automation&quot; (AA) it would still be used everywhere, it would just be more difficult for laypeople to come to grips with it.<p>It&#x27;s a bit as if people around 2000 were saying it&#x27;s stupid to talk about &quot;cyberspace&quot;, it&#x27;s not some new space out there, it&#x27;s just people sitting behind their computers connected by wires! But that term was not the reason for the hype.<p>Now, sure the label AI does contribute its share to the hype, but this stuff is so good that whatever way you call it (as long as it&#x27;s not too many syllables), it will become a buzzword just for that reason. It&#x27;s like euphemism treadmills. You can rename the concept, but it will re-acquire the same meanings. I mean &quot;convolutional&quot; managed to become quite a buzzword itself (even though it&#x27;s a well defined technical term), as it appeared so often alongside really sexy stories.')
