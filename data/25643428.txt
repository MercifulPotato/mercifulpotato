The author can surely let us know how they&#x27;re using Pinterest? Because if you just do some search on Google Images, then however many results you load and however many of those results are from Pinterest, you&#x27;re not gonna connect to Pinterest at all, as all images are proxied through gstatic.com. You have to actually visit a Pinterest property to make a connection. (Edit: or some other site that pulls in Pinterest resources. If that site has caused you to unwittingly download 1.2GB of data in 17 connections from Pinterest, you should also complain about that site, and that complaint would likely be more interesting.)<p>I just tried visiting some pages on Pinterest (from Google Images results for &quot;cat pinterest&quot;, &quot;dog pinterest&quot;, etc.). I scrolled all the way down until I&#x27;m not allowed to scroll anymore (until I create an account?). Each time it&#x27;s around 7MB data transferred. Assuming one connection per visit, that&#x27;s still nowhere near 1GB in 17 connections.<p>So, maybe you have a Pinterest app installed that&#x27;s doing stuff in the background? Or maybe you visit Pinterest signed in and can scroll indefinitely, loading thousands upon thousands of images? Or maybe you&#x27;re infested by some malware that&#x27;s secretly connecting to Pinterest for god knows what reason?<p>In any case, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re gonna lose data to Pinterest if you&#x27;re only seeing some Pinterest results on Google properties.')
