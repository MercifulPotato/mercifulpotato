He&#x27;s one of the longest time Google employees and a key part of the company&#x27;s success. He&#x27;s one of the chief engineers behind MapReduce, BigTable, Spanner, the re-awakening of neural network research and many other incredible achievements. At one point inside Google there was a website called &quot;Jeff Dean Facts&quot; similar to the Chuck Norris facts. The guys reputation is out of this world.<p>He&#x27;s also a rather mild mannered and very nice man. When I worked there I never heard anyone say anything bad about Dean. He rarely expressed strong opinions even on engineering topics; the sort of guy who prefers to win debates by simply coding up the best solution.<p>The name Timnit Gebru also rings bells for me. Last time this name came up she was busy chasing Yann LeCun off Twitter with pitchforks. LeCun! One of the other major luminaries of AI research. In fact she stirred up so much trouble and made so many outrageous accusations he quit Twitter altogether. She appears to be a serious troublemaker, far more interested in identity politics than AI. She was an embarrassment to Google before and it&#x27;s good for them they finally canned her, but seriously, why did it take this long? And who will hire her next? I&#x27;m sure someone will be dumb enough to do that but hardly any companies have openings for &quot;ethical AI researchers&quot;, and she already burned her bridges at Facebook.')
