People who supported violent protestors and people who didn’t. Like any other society some support govt and some do not.<p>People who support govt and not protestors their shops, restaurants, businesses vandalised and were constantly harassed. It became politically impossible to voice against the protestors due to fear of violence, know this first hand not by talking but living through it.<p>Please read the Basic Law and also the extradition bill [1]. Extradition being better was still opposed and ultimately National security law was passed to give teeth to administration to stop violent protests.<p>It’s the vehement majority of Hong Kong people who gave rights to reinterpret Basic Law to stem the flow of people from mainland China (since court of final appeal was going to allow spouses and children of Hong Kong residents from other parts of China to settle in HK). This is the same provision used for implementing National security law. So in HK people got what they asked for and also majority Chinese supported this action on HK. So like any democracy like USA and India a law which appease majority pass easily same happened here.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.legco.gov.hk&#x2F;yr18-19&#x2F;english&#x2F;bills&#x2F;b201903291.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.legco.gov.hk&#x2F;yr18-19&#x2F;english&#x2F;bills&#x2F;b201903291.pd...</a>')
