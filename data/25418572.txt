Personally, I&#x27;d eat some bad press by just making it a policy to always have opt-in changes across the board, or offer dissatisfied students refunds.  And saying &quot;everyone agreed such changes were possible&quot; when you&#x27;re essentially talking about the fine text of a contract only one side has the opportunity to define the terms of seems questionable.  We aren&#x27;t talking about two sides in a negotiation coming to a meeting of the minds.  You created a contract with those terms, on top of an already questionably structured ISA.  You can change the contract to make it more  explicitly favorable to your students.')
