It, like so many other products of its kind, are for numbers! Yet I would be hard-pressed to find someone actually using it for numbers. People absolutely insist on using it as a generic table system for holding non-number data.<p>I recently had to show a 20+ year Excel-using fanatic how to import data from a CSV file so that they could select as type Text columns that contain leading zeros.
