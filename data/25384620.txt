If I follow people who tweet about math I will see tweets about math. Facebook relationships are based on real-life relationships so the topics in my news feed will be more heterogeneous.<p>- In Twitter don&#x27;t see as many content from people I don&#x27;t follow directly. Sometimes I will see tweets that other of my followed liked or replied to, but it&#x27;s a minority. In Facebook I end up seeing a lot of comments of people I follow in other publications.<p>- The suggestion engine of Twitter is not as aggresive as Facebook&#x27;s. Right now I have three suggestions of profiles to follow (people who follow me or profiles I&#x27;ve visited before), a few trending topics which can be mostly ignored, and that&#x27;s it. Facebook is constantly suggesting me pages to follow and friends to add (people I don&#x27;t know at all) and groups to join.<p>- Twitter is more straightforward in the content you get shown. Yeah, they changed things with the inclusion of tweets liked by other people and replies, but most of the time you see tweets of people you follow. Facebook, however, does this weird thing where it shows you only the content you&#x27;re more likely to engage with. If that content is conspiracy theories, so be it, even if that means you don&#x27;t see innocent updates from your friends.<p>- Privacy controls on Twitter feel easier. Make your account private and that&#x27;s it, instead of five different controls for each thing you might or might not do on Facebook. Muting and blocking accounts, notifications and keywords also feels easier.')
