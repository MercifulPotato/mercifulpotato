Item(by='unishark', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609358853, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25581250, text='&gt; It’s not because a subject is interesting only a small niche that there is no freedom of “debate”.<p>Did I suggest otherwise?<p>It may be hard to do accurately, but that doesn&#x27;t make it hopeless. If both sides want to exclude &quot;crackpots&quot; and people who&#x27;s contributions lack technical quality, that is simply accounted for in the estimate. Whether you think that&#x27;s fair to therefore characterize everyone as &quot;intolerant&quot; is another matter . I certainly wouldn&#x27;t characterize them that way, though I get the impression the parent poster might, though perhaps only as a way to claim moral equivalence between all sides. I would expect there to remain quantifiable differences between those who claim they want a &quot;healthy debate from all sides&quot; and those who want to achieve social progress by limiting access to the debate.')
