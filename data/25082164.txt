I think my argument is the most charitable. &#x27;It costs money to store things. They&#x27;re asking you to pay for it&#x27;. Seems most charitable, reasonable, and simplest explanation.<p>Your interpretation is &#x27;each byte costs nothing so a hundred million dollar data centre also costs nothing&#x27; which is an uncharitable interpretation of what they&#x27;re doing.<p>At the end of the day &#x27;storing a billion photos is free&#x27; - your argument - is simply a provably false statement, as everyone in these threads keeps trying to explain to you.')
