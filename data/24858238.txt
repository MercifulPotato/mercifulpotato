One had the lower part of his colon removed, which he had to live with for decades afterwards. The recommendations for colonoscopies are not a joke or get-rich scheme - they save lives.<p>As for this comment:<p><i>What people miss is that these treatments are invented by out of work surgeons.</i><p>The technology was actually invented by a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan in the 1950s based on pioneering research of Narinder Singh Kapany on fiber optics.
