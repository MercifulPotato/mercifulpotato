But I&#x27;m pretty sure a large fraction of people who build companies (like Bezos or Musk) are doing it to build an enterprise, and not for the cash.  Otherwise they&#x27;d just stop and have fun with their private jets at a certain point.  So if a wealth tax were not going to let them keep control of their enterprise beyond the first decade, they probably would opt not to waste their time building it at all.<p>And maybe that&#x27;s fine, but I&#x27;m not sure what society looks like in a world where people don&#x27;t want to build companies.')
