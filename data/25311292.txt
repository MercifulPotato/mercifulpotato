Even though cracksmoking by itself wouldn&#x27;t have harmed anybody else, unlike say a nepotic and malevolent pandemic response that killed hundreds of thousands of Americans.<p>Second, even continuing in your celebrity framing, there is a huge difference between introducing establishment legislation decades ago that disproportionately affected minorities and overtly encouraging racist militias as part of one&#x27;s ongoing campaign. The correct answer when a racist militia expresses their support is condemnation, not acceptance. That newly inflamed distributed bigotry will haunt us for decades.<p>For context I&#x27;m a libertarian and shy away from ascribing racial motivations because racism begets more racism (aka &quot;identity politics&quot;) and it&#x27;s all just a form of collectivism. I see Breonna Taylor&#x27;s murder as a failure to apply the rule of law to the police themselves, and not racism per se. But that bullshit about Harris&#x27;s &quot;birth certificate&quot; was the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back for me, and I&#x27;m done steelmanning Republican talking points to explain away the elephant in the room as just some fading contingent. You too can either admit that and move forward, or be part of the problem dragging us back 50 years.')
