Item(by='fakedang', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611383969, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25879831, text='Not OP, but we have a farm in India. Mostly we let it remain stagnant for a few years, so it&#x27;s just been giving us coconuts.<p>Now we are starting an integrated fish farm + jackfruit farm + subsistence farm + livestock (goats only) approach. We have the fish farm because there&#x27;s a nice irrigation stream that passes right by the side, wholly part of the farm (most farms of a certain land size will have some irrigation arrangement of the sort). The jackfruit is grown to sort of cater to the export demand for jackfruit abroad (especially with the whole &quot;jackfruit as a meat trend&quot;). Jackfruit trees grow thickly, so they provide a nice shade for any agriculture under the canopy at a reduced temperature (for stuff like spinach, tomatoes, pumpkins, etc) but that&#x27;s mostly subsistence scale unless you go inorganic. Jackfruit leaves are really good as a feed for goats, which are the only animals that eat them and actually love eating them. The goats are sold for mutton to caterers for weddings and other functions.<p>Government gives electricity on the cheap as long as you show proof of agriculture (you cannot use it for your homes - they connect it separately and check it very often). The only issues have been theft of fish, for which we fit a bunch of security cameras around the place, so we were able to nab a couple of bastards. The main issue has been the semi-manual irrigation system, but I tested a prototype irrigation system using a Raspberry Pi for our small garden here, so I might try something similar for the farm back home.')
