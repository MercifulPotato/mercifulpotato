There&#x27;s an implied assumption here that &quot;command X&quot; was never tested and must therefore crash for everyone. In 99% of cases, &quot;command X&quot; runs without issue and has been tested on multiple configurations. If it turns out that &quot;command X&quot; crashes <i>for you</i> because your company&#x27;s IT department misconfigured the certificate authorities on a particular Windows build image, you end up wasting massive amounts of everyone&#x27;s time. After maintainers get burned by these kind of bug reports tens of times, they understandably get hostile to such low effort bug reporting.')
