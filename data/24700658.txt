By design, once you have a key you can just pass it around. It isn&#x27;t encoded to you or anything. So as you&#x27;ve appended a placekey to more of your datasets you become more independent from Placekey since you really don&#x27;t need the API anymore.<p>As for the cost, our objective is to just run this for free for small users and at-cost for anyone who has substantial usage. We&#x27;re still in the early stages here so we haven&#x27;t provided explicit numbers or commitments here but I&#x27;m curious to hear what you think. What would reassure you as to our intent?<p>And for what it&#x27;s worth, one of our aims is stability so if you want to cache responses for long periods of time, that would be A-OK.')
