They just hire people who can code and program from set recipes. Once you hire such people you can not expect them to do non-recipe work. If you don&#x27;t want recipe work, don&#x27;t hire people will recipe skills. Do not have job interviews that select for recipe people. But, that is exactly what most companies do.')
