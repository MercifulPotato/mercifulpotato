But I first heard of these guys last year around this time when they announced their &quot;NAWACap Ultracapacitors&quot; where you could get a 1000F capacitor with a .1 mOhm ESR @ 1kHz. That was when they announced they were in production. So I reached out to the various distributors I used and put in cash-ok sample request[1] for one. Not a peep in 10 months. It is entirely possible that someone came in and said, &quot;We will buy every capacitor you can make for the foreseeable future.&quot; but that generally results in causing the manufacturer to ramp up capacity to maximize revenue until there is excess capacity :-).<p>So what is the deal? Can they build stuff or are they a bunch of scientists who can get something working in the lab or one-off and fail miserably at making it a product? (They would be in good company to be sure if this were the case, just it helps to be a bit more forthright about.) The other argument against the hypothesis that someone is buying everything they build is that they have yet to show up in the Thomas register[2]. If their entire capacity was booked they would have quite the revenue stream.<p>You can of course buy carbon nanotube arrays[3] made to order, the last time I checked (about 2 years ago) they were over $5,000 qty 1. So not something I&#x27;d make into a general availability product. But if the NAWA guys can actually print these sheets with no trouble at all maybe Aldrich could use them as a supplier and get the price down to something more accessible?<p>I&#x27;m really interested in a reasonably high voltage (say 48V+ super capacitor in the 800 - 1000F range) even better if it weighs less than 50 lbs. But I&#x27;ve got a railgun out back that doesn&#x27;t do squat without a 500kW power source.<p>[1] Basically this is saying you&#x27;re willing to pay list price for quantity 1 to get a sample, as opposed to demanding a free sample which involves lying about market opportunity :-)<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thomasnet.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;top-suppliers&#x2F;capacitor-manufacturers-suppliers&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thomasnet.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;top-suppliers&#x2F;capacitor-m...</a> These guys basically have teams of people trying to figure out where to get stuff, so they usually know who is actually shipping.<p>[3] Get your own carbon nanotube array, 1 x 1 cm <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sigmaaldrich.com&#x2F;catalog&#x2F;product&#x2F;aldrich&#x2F;687812?lang=en" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sigmaaldrich.com&#x2F;catalog&#x2F;product&#x2F;aldrich&#x2F;687812?...</a>')
