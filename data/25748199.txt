Twitter didn&#x27;t jail the President for inciting violence. They said he wasn&#x27;t allowed to Tweet anymore.<p>Could the publisher of Catcher in the Rye have decided to stop publishing it based on that? Yes, they could.<p>You&#x27;re also willfully ignoring the fact that _just before_ those tweets the President had incited a violent insurrection that attacked Congress and then praised them saying: &quot;we love you&quot; and &quot;you&#x27;re special&quot;. As I said before, we don&#x27;t have to be blind to the prior context. This reductionist thinking that we must take these two tweets entirely on their own and devoid of context isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;m going to participate in.')
