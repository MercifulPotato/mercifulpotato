I had cleared my schedule for six months so I could work on an ambitious animation project mixing 2D and 3D. As I got started, I figured I’d need to write some scripts for a 3D application I was using (Softimage). Looking deeper, I came to the conclusion my needs were complex enough that I should write a small separate application rather than scripts. Then I realized my application would need a little compositing engine to mirror what existed in Softimage. To make that work fast enough, I needed to learn about GPU shaders (brand new at the era). Also I needed to learn about YUV pixel formats and media containers...<p>Flash forward 18 years, I’m still at the bottom of this rabbit hole, sometimes halfheartedly looking for the door to go back up but just finding more glimpses into weirder wonderlands. I wrote another YUV compositor just a couple of months ago, but haven’t made a serious attempt at animation in probably 15 years.<p>I wonder if other people have this kind of experience, and whether there’s some kind of law of “tech stack career gravity” in evidence here. When you become expert in something lower level, it increases the “career delta-v” to move back up.')
