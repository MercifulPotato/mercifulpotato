Item(by='heleninboodler', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606156240, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25179304, text='&gt; there&#x27;s a lot of &quot;I think the DSL ends up a hinderance&quot; in this [thread] from people that (perhaps) haven&#x27;t tried it and judge from the looks<p>As unfair as this seems to you, I think it&#x27;s also unfair to dismiss them as not having tried it, since I&#x27;ve personally tried many (I can remember encountering them in 2008 on my first ruby project and many times in the interim) and never had a good experience.  It feels like a novelty that doesn&#x27;t really add anything except a disconnect between what I have to write and what I mean, when &quot;what I mean&quot; is actually really simple and not hard to write.  Your mileage may vary, but the &quot;DSL hate&quot; is actually rooted in experience for many people.<p>But you&#x27;re right, I definitely haven&#x27;t tried it, and I don&#x27;t intend to, so I could be missing out.  I just really don&#x27;t think so.  More power to everyone who likes this sort of thing. :)')
