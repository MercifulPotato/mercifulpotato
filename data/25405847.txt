Item(by='627467', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607859311, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25404575, text='Most ideas in this article are not new (criticism of yarvin&#x27;s ideas and how they are embedded in urbit), the article itself is from May 4th 2019 which may warrants us to ask whether all facts stated are still up to date (ie. does yarvin still in fact own sizeable address space in urbit?).<p>The central idea here seems to be that, regardless of the project goal and merits, help improving urbit means benefiting Yarvin directly due to his stake in the address space. Seems like a too lengthy post for an idea that could have fitted a tweet.<p>There are so many others involved in building urbit today (and for the past 2-3 years, even before yarvin left the project). Maybe someone can write about the aspects of Urbit that drive these other people.')
