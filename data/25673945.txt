It is common for a RAID 5 array to be running in a degraded state during “normal” operation without the operator’s knowledge. Then, when one drive fails, rebuilding the array is impossible; you have already lost data.<p>This is common because there is often no good way to repair a RAID 5 system which is running in degraded state, and there is often no monitoring to respond to array degradation (if you can’t fix it, why monitor it?)<p>In other words, RAID 5 does not protect very well against drive failures. RAID 6 is more durable but inefficient (there are systems which are both more durable and more efficient than RAID 6). RAID is generally optimized for implementation simplicity over other concerns.')
