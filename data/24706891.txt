Maybe someone in the US can confirm that?<p>I&#x27;ve lived in the US. Your taxes are withheld from your pay. Unlike in the UK, everyone has to fill in a tax return - even if all of their income comes from a regular job. You might be due a small refund or owe a small amount at the end of each tax year, but fundamentally you&#x27;re taxed as you go throughout the year.')
