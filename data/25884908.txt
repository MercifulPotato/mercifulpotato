I have a suggestion which you may not like: switch away from Moleskines.<p>I have a stack of used Moleskines. For years I used them exclusively, buying them in bulk. Honestly, I gritted my teeth a little each time I picked one up. I love the ergonomics and the size, but the paper is awful.<p>I&#x27;m not alone in this opinion[0]; an unopinionated Google search turns up plenty of similar criticism. The surface is too slick and hard to absorb ink well, so nearly everything smears. It&#x27;s also oddly prone to ghosting through to the other side, especially with felt tip pens. It&#x27;s hard to win.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=moleskine+paper+quality" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?q=moleskine+paper+quality</a><p>I tried everything with them: fountain pens, gel ink, liquid rollerballs, fat and fine felt tips, space pens. What worked best were cheap-ass Bics, but only because the ink is basically colored glue, and they&#x27;re punishing to write with.<p>I&#x27;ve since switched to artist sketch books, like Pentalic Nature Sketch[1]. I don&#x27;t care about the brand. I just go to my local art supply store and buy something in the right size with good-feeling paper. There are some ergonomic compromises (e.g., maybe you don&#x27;t like spirals), but the paper is first-class, and that&#x27;s become my priority. I get my Hi-Tec-C refills from JetPens, and they have some good notebook advice[2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pentalic.com&#x2F;nature-sketch&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pentalic.com&#x2F;nature-sketch&#x2F;</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jetpens.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-best-notebooks-for-every-use&#x2F;pt&#x2F;647" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jetpens.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;the-best-notebooks-for-every-us...</a>')
