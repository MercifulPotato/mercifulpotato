I went to an allergy doctor about perfume allergy.  They told me it was incurable and probably won&#x27;t get better, just avoid perfume.  I started doing my own research.  I found a study result that showed that perfume allergy is psycho-somatic.  Then I learned stress reduction techniques and used them to cure myself.')
