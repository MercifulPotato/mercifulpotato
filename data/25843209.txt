Second thing... what&#x27;s the story when it comes to Truffle licensing? :-)<p>Would Oracle control the implementation of a particular language that used Truffle? Could they decide to &quot;deplatform&quot; that language? (&quot;we don&#x27;t authorize the use of Truffle in language implementation X for Y reasons&quot;) Or charge for licenses for users of that language? Or other somber scenarios... according to current licensing or in a hypothetical future ...<p>Compare with, say, LLVM infrastructure, were it seems more certain that a language can be implemented as free software and with less restrictions or caveats.')
