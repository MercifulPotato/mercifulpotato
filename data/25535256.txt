They are iterative, convergent processes, and so they are subtractive: you work until you have converged, and then you stop.<p>Subtractive implies few, if any, unknowns.<p>If you are chiseling away at a well-defined spec along a well-trodden implementation path as part of a large team (as creative as such an endeavor might be), maybe.<p>The smaller the team, the less charted your territory is, the more it becomes about jigsaw pieces fitting together despite individual irregularities.
