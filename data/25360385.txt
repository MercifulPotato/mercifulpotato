The times I&#x27;ve worked with hour based estimates, we were assigning tickets to people up front and there always had to be a bit of a scaling factor based on who was doing the work. (mostly relative to their skill level and how familiar they were with a particular piece of code). There are at least a couple of no-nos for scrum style processes in there. Still, I find it more useful to look at the number of tickets and what&#x27;s actually being done in them and ignore the point&#x2F;hour values when trying to come up with what&#x27;s a good break down of work for a sprint. The point values are just too opaque to convey anything that can be substantively predictive. (At least for me..)')
