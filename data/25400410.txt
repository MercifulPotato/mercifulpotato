Censorship is about power, and the scale of power can tilt towards either side pretty soon. What if later the country moves towards the right, and the left gets censored for legitimate discussions on election fairness, on health care, on tax reform, on education, or on corruption of politicians? Would you left feel happy if your questions were labeled disinformation? The left did read history about how an entire nation got silenced, right?<p>What a world.')
