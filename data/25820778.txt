From what I&#x27;ve seen there is no advantage size, weight or waterproofing-wise for foregoing it.<p>The side effect is that I can&#x27;t buy the flagship models anymore since they usually don&#x27;t have headphone jacks. Oh well. Also, yes I have bluetooth headphones. One of which also supports 3.5mm input. I use both. With my phone I primarily use the bluetooth, with my laptop and tablet I use the 3.5mm jack and if I am in a car without bluetooth or a friend&#x27;s house, I can hook up the 3.5mm cable to my phone.')
