I&#x27;m using a time tracker app, sometimes in conjunction with a pomodoro timer (TimeCube Plus, red model with 5&#x2F;10&#x2F;20&#x2F;25 min sides).<p>Since I&#x27;m only tracking my time at home, the categories are: gaming, tv&#x2F;movies, music instrument, foreign language, exercise (that I can do indoors, such as weight training or flexibility: yoga, stretching), computer (email, my time right now on HN, general web surfing... anything not work related), and reading.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to account for house cleaning, sleeping, any outdoor activity, cooking, working, etc. I just want to get a better idea of how I spend my &quot;free&quot; time at home, and maybe make some changes after gathering at least 3 months of data.')
