I mean, say there wasn&#x27;t a CoC, then couldn&#x27;t the accused still have written a blog post about how they were kicked out for merely saying that someone else was &quot;<i>wrong</i>&quot;?<p>I think the concern is about a formal system being properly implemented.  For example, say that we add a formal control mechanism to a door that wasn&#x27;t previously automated.  This has two advantages: (1) the door&#x27;s now automatic; (2) we can ensure that the door is completely safe, never accidentally closing on anyone.  Awesome, right?<p>But, if the door&#x27;s automation-logic is faulty, then it&#x27;s not fully safe.  In fact, it can now falsely close on people in situations where it couldn&#x27;t before.<p>I think that&#x27;s what people are worried about here: the CoC appears to have enabled a destructive interaction that, absent the CoC, may&#x27;ve not occurred.<p>In real life, we usually save legal battles for the big issues because working out formal rule systems can be so cumbersome.  People dread going to court because of what a hassle it is!  But I don&#x27;t think that the legal system is malicious; it just takes a lot of effort to analyze things.  Cheaper versions of the legal system could be scary, potentially enabling all sorts of faulty, undesirable behaviors.  And that&#x27;s what I think folks fear in CoC&#x27;s: a naively implemented formal system running amok.  They&#x27;d rather have to manually open a door every time than risk an automatic door mistakenly closing on them sometimes.')
