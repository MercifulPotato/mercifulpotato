That&#x27;s a big reason they&#x27;re sitting on so much cash, they can&#x27;t really spend it on anything in a sane &#x2F; responsible manner. About the only thing they can safely, legally do with it is toss it back to shareholders.<p>Intel for example would never have been allowed to buy TSMC while they were a lot smaller than Intel. Intel isn&#x27;t allowed to buy ARM or AMD. Intel wasn&#x27;t allowed to buy Nvidia when Nvidia was a lot smaller. Intel has had the dominance and cash for a very long time to eat all competing semiconductor companies globally, and they would never have been allowed to do that (thus they didn&#x27;t; they would have loved to do so). Intel has been under heavy government observation regarding competition for decades now, they&#x27;re half crippled.<p>Microsoft wouldn&#x27;t have been allowed to acquire Apple circa 1998-2000, even though they trivially could have done so. And dozens of other tech companies are on the: may not be acquired by Microsoft list.<p>Facebook isn&#x27;t allowed to buy TikTok or Twitter or Pinterest or Snapchat.<p>Google wouldn&#x27;t be allowed to buy Bing from Microsoft. Google wouldn&#x27;t have been allowed to acquire Yahoo.<p>Amazon wouldn&#x27;t be allowed to acquire Netflix or Walmart or Target.<p>Juniper has been sitting out there forever because Cisco isn&#x27;t allowed to acquire them, along with several other prominent competing companies. And simultaneously, since Cisco isn&#x27;t allowed to acquire such companies under our economic system in the first place, they then also benefit from having Juniper out there as a competition prop to point to.')
