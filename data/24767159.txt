Disney can afford to charge this premium because their content is so differentiated. For aggregators with commoditized content, it will always be a race to the bottom for pricing to reach maximum users and spread the high fixed cost of content across them.<p>I would look to other content providers rather than other streaming services to anticipate who might follow Disney&#x27;s pricing model. And even though this was probably just a strategy they took to deal with the circumstances created by COVID, if it works, they may stick with it. I could see theater and early access on Disney+ being released at the same time, and you can choose to go spend $30 at the movie theater or $30 in the comfort of your home.')
