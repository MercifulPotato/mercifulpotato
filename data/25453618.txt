Item(by='asiachick', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608192212, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25439490, text='I love Love LOVE VR!!!<p>I&#x27;m unfortunately not convinced it will ever &quot;take off&quot;. At least not in its current incarnation of HMDs and controllers. There are just too any limitations.<p>1) You usually need a 10x10sqft open space to use it. Sure there are examples of experiences or tools that you can sit in chair but they are very limiting.<p>2) You&#x27;re isolated. Watching TV or playing a video game you can be in the same room as others but standing in the same room as other playing VR is kind of off putting (maybe that&#x27;s just me)<p>3) People get sick from motion so more limits on what you can actually do. I generally don&#x27;t get sick and have played a few games 5-8hrs a day though I have experiences serious debilitating sick for 3 hours nausea in 2 &quot;VR hacked into a not designed for VR&quot; games<p>Other issues are chicken and egg.<p>* You can&#x27;t show people what it&#x27;s like to be in VR without them being in VR. If you stand out of VR and look at the screen it looks just like a standard video game. The feeling of presence is not something you can show in video so the user who doesn&#x27;t have VR equipment will never get excited about it from videos of what the experience is like<p>* The audience is too small so there isn&#x27;t enough content. There&#x27;s a ton of tiny indie games but there are very few well made AAA VR games. Some AAA games have a VR mode but the game wasn&#x27;t designed for VR and so is usually poor. I&#x27;m sure this will be controversial if you&#x27;re a fan but for example Eve Valkyrie fails for me because none of the controls are in VR. You need to sit at a keyboard where as I just want to reach out and touch the controls that I see on the control panels of the ship I&#x27;m in. No Man&#x27;s Sky did some of this better with it&#x27;s VR control stick and thrust stick and the exit handle but failed everywhere else where all the inventory screens are designed for joypads, not VR.<p>* This is more of the same but many interfaces are bad or to put it another way they are kind of like &quot;by gamers for gamers&quot;  I almost wish valve&#x2F;oculus had shipped controllers with no buttons or at most one button per controller to force the devs to put the controls in VR.  In VR they are usually intuitive where as most games it&#x27;s press one of the 18 buttons on both controllers (Oculus has A,B,X,Y,Left Trigger, Left Grab, Right Trigger, Right Grab, Left stick Up, Left Stick down, Left stick left, Left stick up, Left stick press, right stuck up, right stick down, right stick left, right stick right, right stick press and there&#x27;s actually to more, left menu button and right menu button.<p>I realize that 1 button per controller would be limiting, I just wish more games&#x2F;tools&#x2F;software embraced VR more<p>* Inside out tracking of controllers and Quest level smartphone hardware are very limited. I know many owners of Quest are enthralled with it but for me it&#x27;s a step back. The fact that it can&#x27;t track your hands in all directions at all times breaks many experiences. Designing around that limitation basically means giving up on many experiences. Similarly a smartphone GPU is just not up to providing the top level experiences. It&#x27;s like Switch vs PS4. Sure there are wonderful experiences on a Switch but there are also 100s of PS4 experiences that are just not possible on a Switch. Same with Quest. It&#x27;s underpowered so Beat Saber, great! HL2: Alyx, not going to happen. (even with the link which you can go read reviews of blurriness and latency. People make due but it&#x27;s not compelling the same way high powered VR is)')
