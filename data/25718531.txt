I cannot say the same of this one. Now obviously the sample size and statistics of the studies are not identical, but it seems to me we&#x27;re seeing significantly more &#x27;critical thinking&#x27; in this thread than that one. I would love to drill into this further and see if this trend holds in further comment threads, but I&#x27;m late for a hike.')
