It would also be terribly useful to me to be able to zoom anywhere in the frames and get the precise color values and location of any pixel.<p>From an implementation standpoint, this is not that complicated to implement. I will add it to my todo list, but very likely sometime in the future. I need to know people want this, since it will definitely take a while to implement.<p>Also, it would not play nice with a lot of optimizations I&#x27;ve done so far - but that is a different issue ;) If there&#x27;s need for it, I&#x27;ll do it :D<p>&gt; A fast way to open two frames of the same file or of two different files side by side to compare would also be extremely useful!<p>This is also doable. I&#x27;m curious why you want this, and how you&#x27;d like to visualize the differences.<p>&gt; It is terribly painful to compare two images :)<p>I know :D A looong time ago, I implemented a very advanced zoom on images, so I know :D')
