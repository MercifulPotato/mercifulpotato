Nature is of no consideration whatsoever in some fields of maths.  But nature or applications to it are the primary focus in many other fields of maths.  In still others, nature would be a source of analogies, or applications of a few special cases, etc.   Muddying the waters, some mathematicians would expand the definition of &quot;nature&quot; to include completely abstract ideas - anything that feels &quot;discovered&quot;, for example.<p>Mathematics is the study of patterns.  Any kind of pattern you can imagine, in anything, including relationships between things.  What things?  <i>Any</i> things.  That covers a lot!')
