But even now Dell&#x27;s lowest-end desktop is $350, and that&#x27;s with an i3.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if that&#x27;s an engineered price point because lesser hardware at lower prices can&#x27;t even be <i>shipped</i> and make a profit. And frankly, if I remember back 10-15 years, there were $350 boxes back then, too, so maybe it&#x27;s a minimum price&#x2F;rule of thumb that was calculated a long time ago.')
