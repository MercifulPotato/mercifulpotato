When I was living in Austria I could get them almost anywhere.  Now that I don&#x27;t, I&#x27;ve never seen them except with one exception.  My local Aldi store had them one Christmas except they were made in Germany and not original Salzburger Mozartkugeln.<p>Despite that, those who I gave some to try loved them to the extent that they whinged that Aldi only had them as its once-off special deals, so again they quickly became unavailable.')
