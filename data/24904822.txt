I see no discourse on how the industry can step up and improve their security practices. I see no significant update to regulation in response to any of this.<p>If your industry cannot move fast enough with the consumer tech industry then you should not be basing your tech stack on a OS like XP in the first place , XP always was going to have limited window of mainline support.<p>Core banking is perfectly happy using COBOL and zOS for the last 50 years.
