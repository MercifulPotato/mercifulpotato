Being near the train station only has benefit to those that use the train.<p>Reduced congestion on the road benefits everyone.<p>As does the reduction in air pollution, and pm2.5 from break and tire dust.<p>If proper rezoning takes place around train stations, then everyone benefits from denser housing available for those who desire it, reducing upwards pressure on housing elsewhere in the city.<p>Businesses all along the entire train line benefit from an increase in customer volume that doesn&#x27;t require a corresponding increase in parking requirements.<p>The decrease in parking means land is more efficiently used, actual buildings can be constructed which increase tax revenue for the city, and provide more jobs.<p>Mass transit is <i>awesome</i>.')
