Kinda hard though to fully get this in the abstract. I struggled with the same questions. All I can say is SICP, all of Rich Hickey&#x27;s videos, redux, elm, resources listed on haskel.com all helped.<p>Also putting it all together in writing here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softwarefordays.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;functional-programming-and-identity-state-and-time&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;softwarefordays.com&#x2F;post&#x2F;functional-programming-and-...</a>.<p>In this^ blog I&#x27;ve included an interactive user interface that can be seen as purely functional, even though it&#x27;s a stateful ATM program. I&#x27;m actually hoping that this blog could help teach someone what took me 2 years to finally realize. I think it could be worthwhile given your questions - if you take a look, please let me know what you think!')
