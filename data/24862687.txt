So as an example, take a company that returns 5% of their share price and an investor pays a 20% tax rate allowing them to reinvest 4% after tax money to buy more shares.  After 40 years, they&#x27;d have 1.04^40=4.8 times the proportion of the company.  If the same company spent all of its money buying back shares, you&#x27;d have 1.05^40=7.039 times the company.  Now you still have to pay that 20% on gains once you sell so after you&#x27;d have (1.05^40-1)*.8+1=5.83 after selling but that is still a 21% benefit for share buybacks in that example.')
