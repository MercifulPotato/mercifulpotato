Item(by='krussell', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605226034, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25076404, text='Interesting, looks like the wikipedia title spells it Betteridge&#x27;s with an apostrophe. %27 is the url encoding for the apostrophe and %25 is the url encoding for the %. So it looks like the link somehow got url encoded twice before it was shared resulting in the apostrophe becoming %27 and then the %27 becoming %2527 and producing a bad link.<p>Some common method of people finding and sharing that url must have had an issue where it incorrectly encoded the url twice. I wonder what it was :) .<p>Or perhaps the scraper has a bug where it is double url encoding the en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines link?')
