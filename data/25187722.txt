I think these are primarily recovered cases that still have trace amounts of non-infectious viral RNA.<p>The originally linked Lancet paper makes a distinction between &quot;viral shedding&quot; and &quot;viral RNA shedding&quot;. I think the unanswered question involves individuals in the first week of their newly acquired infection (EDIT: after the incubation period). I hope that doesn&#x27;t come across as nit picking; the scale and scope of the Wuhan study is impressive but an equivalent study is needed in an area with ongoing community transmission.')
