Item(by='wolverine876', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607377689, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25333694, text='It&#x27;s depressing to see yet another intellectual &#x27;bubble&#x27; sweep through the Internet and the educated parts of society, especially one that falls apart so easily under a little scrutiny (as they all do).<p>The cost of living in the Bay Area reflects extremely high demand for living there. Other than some people becoming more comfortable with remote work, what will have changed when the pandemic ends?<p>You can&#x27;t visit SF and not see that it&#x27;s a special place. An amazingly dynamic, exciting city filled with creativity, culture, beauty, resources (including two elite universities and many others), natural resources, etc. People LOVE San Francisco (and many other cities).<p>Cities in general are well-documented and researched as the great economic and cultural engines of our societies. It&#x27;s not hard to see why or how that would be. We all knew it well; then suddenly it became trendy to forget it.<p>We know well the subtext of the new anti-urbanism: Reactionary politics. The reactionaries in the US (primarily the Republican Party and sympathizers) have been trying to denigrate cities for many years because, despite the facts on their success, cities are strongly liberal, ethnically diverse, and pro-Democratic. As an example, Trump tried to make it the focus of his campaign over the summer and a&#x2F;the major focus of the Republican convention, though that fizzled.<p>Taxes are bad (by definition!), liberalism is bad, protestors are bad, college education is bad, homeless people are bad ... it&#x27;s a highly conservative perspective - conservative as in, &#x27;protect existing interests&#x27; - rather one that reflects a belief in progress, knowledge, change, and in the potential in every person (not just the wealthy ones) to do great things. Cities are inherently optimistic and reactionaryism is inherently pessimistic - why choose the latter, other than that is where the social herd is running? How will that turn out?<p>The IT industry didn&#x27;t discover remote work in the last year; it might have been forced on reluctant managers in some industries, but we knew it very well. Companies tried it years ago, and then walked it back (I remember them telling employees they had to come back to the office). Nothing replaces the dynamism of meeting people in the hallway, seeing people face-to-face, etc. Remember everything SV companies invested to keep their employees at work and having fun? Now they think it&#x27;s the same if they are home and isolated from each other?<p>Bubbles in finance are about ideas, not money. People feel compelled by the normalization of a social tide. If you think you&#x27;re too smart for it, you are a prime target.')
