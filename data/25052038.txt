It is perfectly usable. The hardware support is not great. In particular, resuming from suspend is very slow, and I haven&#x27;t gotten the built-in mic to work. And getting the system to work did require using a patched Linux kernel installed from Github. So not easy, but possible.<p>Your claims about &quot;dismal then and only got worse&quot; are unfounded. The repository you refer to is still active. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Dunedan&#x2F;mbp-2016-linux" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Dunedan&#x2F;mbp-2016-linux</a> If anything, activity has slowed down in these threads because it was figured out how to make it work.<p>Even among people who run Linux on these MacBooks, the general recommendation is to keep a macOS partition around for stability.
