It seems like people mostly vote because they&#x27;ve been told the party they&#x27;re voting against is evil[1], not because they actually support the policies.<p>[1] Of course those of us who think they&#x27;re both evil are not left with much motivation to vote for either, which partly explains (along with voter suppression, gerrymandering making voting less effective, etc) why half the country doesn&#x27;t bother to vote at all.')
