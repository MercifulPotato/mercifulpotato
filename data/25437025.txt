I can&#x27;t think of a AAA game I&#x27;ve played on PC in the last 5 years that was locked to 60fps and had crappy controlsâ€”All the big AAA ports like Tomb Raider and Assassin&#x27;s Creed have all been fine recently.<p>And yeah, the PS4 and Xbox One are long in the tooth, but there are plenty of games that look absolutely stellar on them. I&#x27;m going to only give some PS4 examples here, since that is the one I have, but Horizon Zero Dawn, Ghost of Tsushima, Spiderman, and The Last of Us Part 2 all came out recently and look _really_ good even on a 7 year old console. And 3 of those are open world.<p>It&#x27;s definitely possible to make a base PS4&#x2F;Xbox one game that looks really good, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s out of the realm of possibility for CDPR to have taken those consoles into account from the beginning. If so, they might have had a chance of them being fine on day one. I just hope people on a PS4&#x2F;Xbox One that bought the game will eventually get a patch that make it run reasonably, since apparently refunds aren&#x27;t really happening.')
