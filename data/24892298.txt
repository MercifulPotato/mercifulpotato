Super glad I did it.  Ended up surprised at just how much can do with a Note type phone and optional keyboard &#x2F; track pad.<p>But, I never did replace fast and responsive.  Just kind of coped and the other benefits made the whole thing worth it.<p>This pandemic has me rethinking some things and yeah, I want to build a nice machine.  Want that workstation type feel and performance.<p>The closed computing argument holds more water every quarter too.<p>What we need is a reasonable battery pack, and software to throttle the machine down on an interruption.  Make this package a couple hundred bucks, or something a person can just load their own cells into and it&#x27;s bound to be a winner.')
