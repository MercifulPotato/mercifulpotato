DOI: 10.1177&#x2F;0075424207307780<p>Abstract<p>This study provides the first detailed account of perceptual dialectology within California (as well as one of the first accounts of perceptual dialectology within any single state). Quantitative  analysis of a map-labeling task carried  out in Southern  California reveals that  Californiaâ€™s  most  salient linguistic  boundary is between  the  northern and southern regions of the state. Whereas studies of the perceptual dialectology of the United States as a whole have focused almost exclusively on regional dialect differences, respondents associated particular regions of California less with distinctive dialects than with differences in language (English  versus  Spanish), slang  use, and  social  groups. The diverse socio linguistic situation of California is reflected in the emphasis both on highly salient social groups thought to be stereotypical of California by residents and nonresidents alike (e.g., surfers) and on groups that, though prominent in the cultural landscape of the state, remain largely unrecognized by outsiders (e.g., hicks).')
