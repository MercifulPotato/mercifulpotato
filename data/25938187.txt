Even if you assume that is true, and you can somehow push this <i>already $25B cap</i> company high enough, there isn&#x27;t enough money in that $13B to allow all shares of GME to sell at the current price.<p>If the entire premise here is &quot;Melvin is screwed, we have him by the balls, and he has $13B&quot;, then it seems that the max would be... $13B. Past that, you&#x27;re no longer &quot;taking from Melvin&quot;; you&#x27;re taking from the people who don&#x27;t get out before you do.<p>There is no bankrupcy judge in the world that will say &quot;Okay Melvin, sorry, but you owe WSB a thousand trillion dollars&quot;.')
