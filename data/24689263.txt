On top of that they get revenue from supplying engines to other teams.<p>The team might spent untold hundreds of millions (of money they have earned) but the parent Mercedes company spend thirty million a year.<p>For Mercedes this is excellent value for money, equivalent to a billion or so in paid advertising time on television.<p>Contrast this situation with teams at the back of the grid: no revenue from supplying engines, expenses for getting engines, poor sponsorship money, no income from a parent manufacturer. Oh, and little in the way of prize money. They do get some sponsorship money from their drivers though, either because they are in a Mercedes&#x2F;Ferrari&#x2F;Red Bull &#x27;academy&#x27; or because the pay driver comes with sponsorship from his wealthy father or country.')
