Essentially, the chart shading calculation strolls the diagram in a DFS way (Depth First Search, which implies that it investigates a way totally prior to investigating another way).<p>How do you detect if a graph has a cycle?<p>To detect cycle, check for a cycle in individual trees by checking back edges. To detect a back edge, keep track of vertices currently in the recursion stack of function for DFS traversal. If a vertex is reached that is already in the recursion stack, then there is a cycle in the tree.<p>Which algorithm is used to check the negative cycle in a graph?<p>Bellman-Ford algorithm<p>The Bellman-Ford algorithm is a way to find single source shortest paths in a graph with negative edge weights (but no negative cycles). The second for loop in this algorithm also detects negative cycles. The first for loop relaxes each of the edges in the graph n âˆ’ 1 times.')
