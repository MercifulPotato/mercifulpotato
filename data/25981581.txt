Item(by='ycombobreaker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612120491, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25977649, text='During this period (looks like at least 10:30-noon ET) there were 11 volatility halts (and auction-priced reopenings) due to price movement.  The stock spent more time halted than open!<p>Reopening auctions concentrate trading volumes.  This may look more suspicious because volume is so concentrated, but in reality they give about five minutes for many participants to join and it all executes at one price.  Prices I see for reopenings are approximately<p>330\n290\n265\n226\n170\n140\n120\n141\n170\n210\n216<p>The idea that the 120,140 were lower than &quot;market prices&quot; is solidly in tail-wagging-dog category.  GME sold off hard, yes, but it was over the course of almost an hour and with substantial trading across the entire price range.  This is natural when any imbalanced order flow has previously pushed prices and then subsides.<p>Note that 120 was the low and prices retraced through about half of the prior range.  That retracement started at around 11:20 ET.  Do you know when RH or other brokers had opening buy orders blocked and subsequently unblocked?  Given that RH needed to secure cash for DTCC&#x27;S requirements, I expect that retracement was during the blocked period still.<p>Overall this still looks like tinfoil hat theory from WSB.  Volatility looks crazy and it&#x27;s easy to see demons in the shadows.')
