A giant array of antennas (still a lot of mass to lift) could have decent angular resolution but not great seeing power. The seeing power of a telescope is a function of the totally collector surface area. A big dish literally reflects photons that hit any part of the surface. A wire antenna with no reflector has a teeny tiny surface area.<p>For an antenna array you&#x27;d still need steering sturdy mounts, steering systems, and power for those steering systems. Just using big wires means you can&#x27;t really steer the focus and has far less gain than an array and way less than a system using reflectors. TANSTAAFL.')
