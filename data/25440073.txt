Item(by='Erlich_Bachman', descendants=None, kids=[25440301], score=None, time=1608104720, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25436173, text='&gt; This intelligence, which we might call conceptualization, is not a cognitive process. The real intelligence is animal intelligence<p>I can only partially see what you mean exactly by &quot;cognitive&quot; or &quot;animal&quot; (with regards to intelligence), it doesn&#x27;t seem like you use the words in their precisely common meanings.<p>I also never claimed that intelligence is in its base cognitive.<p>The original claim was that all of the intelligence is based in &quot;ape-ish&quot; motor skills, that it&#x27;s basically their motor cortex that is just a little more advanced that gives rise to all the behaviors that we call intelligent.<p>This idea would basically mean that a task such as writing and publicizing a great book such as Shakespeare&#x27;s Hamlet (including accumulating all the life experience required to produce it, and make it being so good) - is &quot;basically a motor skills task&quot;.<p>This just doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to me.<p>While it does of course require motor skills like taking a pen and putting the words to the paper, it requires a lot more other complex skills as well that have so little to do with motor intelligence that I don&#x27;t see any honest reason to put them in the same category.<p>Thus, my comment that your theory requires expanding the concept of &quot;psychomotor&quot; to such extent that the word loses all of its useful meaning.<p>&gt; political correctness = criteria for the fit of my body with other bodies as we want from each other<p>It&#x27;s just not a good explanation, it loses 90% of all of the intricacies. Try using it to explain it to someone who doesn&#x27;t know what political correctness is- it doesn&#x27;t do the job.')
