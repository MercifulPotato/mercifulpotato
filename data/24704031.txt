You&#x27;re basically allowing educational institutions to sell green cards. If you thought almost-unlimited-student-loans inflated education prices, you don&#x27;t even want to see what selling green cards would do.<p>&gt; but there should never be the case where a smart person educated in the US, especially in a growing or important field is forced out of the country<p>I agree with the premise, but this is kind of like &quot;It is better than 1000 guilty men go free, than 1 innocent man be wrongly convicted&quot;. It sounds great in premise, but in practice can&#x27;t reasonably happen. Again, I agree with your premise, but I think it needs to be approached in a different way.')
