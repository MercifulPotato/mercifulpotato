E.g. Iceland still uses excessive solitary confinement, even though it has shown to have negative rehabilitating effects and is under every definition a form of torture. The fact that the Icelandic prison system still engages in torture suggests that they are still in the retribution camp of punishment.<p>I don’t know about the other Nordic countries but I wouldn’t be surprised to hear similar stories from there.')
