It is a serious societal problem that maintenance is underfunded.<p>But that means that any language revision needs to work hard at making the transition easy and incremental. 2to3 was and is laughable; at no point was it a reasonable solution.<p>It&#x27;s okay to say &quot;we need maintenance money&quot;.
