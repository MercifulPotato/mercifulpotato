He also owns SCMP[1], which has a mix of supportive and critical articles on the central government. Assuming he wanted to throw some pressure, in the mild form of (probably mostly disregarded) external censure back on the investigation, he may have been passive aggressively refusing to show his face.

Of course, it could also be an Elon Musk-style stock manipulation play, but I think he&#x27;s more motivated by the passions than pure financials.<p>Speculation is fun, but it&#x27;s possible this is apophenia.<p>[0]no pun intended, he does like to dress up in camp drag and sing, if you don&#x27;t believe, search for the videos, it&#x27;s pretty funny for an (ex) CEO to do this<p>[1]this article doesn&#x27;t have much more than the Reuters link, but does have a couple of videos <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scmp.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;big-tech&#x2F;article&#x2F;3118454&#x2F;alibaba-founder-jack-ma-delivers-video-speech-chinas-rural-teachers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scmp.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;big-tech&#x2F;article&#x2F;3118454&#x2F;alibaba-f...</a>')
