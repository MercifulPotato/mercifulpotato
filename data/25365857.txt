I also shared the highest OP&#x27;s sentiment that I didn&#x27;t think FB was a good investment for the same reason (that people would migrate from FB to the next thing as fast as folks moved off of MySpace).<p>I was absolutely and utterly wrong on both accounts. Part of it was definitely wishful thinking, though, as I dislike FB by one or two orders of magnitude more than any other software company.<p>But yes, I&#x27;d say their acquisitions were not completely obvious slam dunks.<p>They also tried to be Snap, ofc, but my recollection is that Snap refused. Interestingly, folks have probably flip-flopped over the last few years in wondering whether that would&#x27;ve been good or bad for FB.')
