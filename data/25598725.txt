It starts with the magnetic field interacting with charged particles only at right angles to their motion, meaning that it cannot do work on them. Work is done by electric fields that are induced by time-varying magnetic fields. Then there are objections that they can do work on magnetic dipoles (eg two permanent magnets rotating into alignment). This is countered with an objection that permanent magnets are actually a virtual coil from the current sheet orbiting the magnet&#x27;s surface, so the former holds and work is done by induced electric fields. This is countered by the point that elementary particles with spin can have magnetic fields. Eventually the argument is declared a draw when someone points out that magnetic fields don&#x27;t actually exist, and are just electric fields viewed from different relativistic reference frames.')
