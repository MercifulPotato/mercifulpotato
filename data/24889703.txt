The Wayland protocols are found here [1]. Your compositor\nwill implement some of these protocols and not others. If I’m writing an application I will; possibly through some toolkit, ask the compositor what features it supports and configure how my application works accordingly.<p>This isn’t particularly different to say, an toolkit not supporting a particular form of input, such as <i>GLEW</i> not supporting tablet devices or certain GPU’s having more extension methods — which you can see if you look at Khronos specification. Or an even more drastic example, is an application having both a terminal display and a X11 display like Emacs.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wayland-project&#x2F;wayland-protocols&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;wayland-project&#x2F;wayland-protocols&#x2F;</a>')
