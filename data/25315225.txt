Every time I&#x27;ve tried to use `std::variant` I&#x27;ve been unhappy with the runtime performance vs any other way to solve this problem (the compile time performance is expectedly atrocious compared to any other method).<p>So you&#x27;ve got poor ergonomics, poor compilation performance, bloated code size, and poor runtime performance. I&#x27;ve written an enormous amount of C++ code from applications to libraries to system development. I literally have never found a place where `std::variant` has any positives that can&#x27;t be written a different, clearer way with drastically better compile time and run time performance.')
