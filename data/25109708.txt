Before that I used Linux exclusively at work. To test it out I installed it on a 32GB flash drive so that I don&#x27;t have the urge to install games when I&#x27;m space limited. It worked for the first 3 months. Then I got a new SSD and installed it there. A few days later proton came out and I ended up clocking in 600 hours in Warframe. The idea that linux has &quot;no games&quot; is an urban myth. I got scammed by Windows users.')
