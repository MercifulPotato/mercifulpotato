The ECC codes used now, with 8 extra bits for each 64 data bits, correct any 1-bit error and detect any 2-bit errors.<p>Very old computers (25 years old, or more) used parity instead of ECC and they just detected any 1-bit error (and any errors with an odd number of flipped bits), without being able to correct the errors.')
