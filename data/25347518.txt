The conspiracy theories about buying-CentOS-to-kill it are understandable but totally off-base. Red Hat brought CentOS in-house at a time when the company was trying to grow from being a single-product company to a portfolio one, and it became clear that Fedora wasn&#x27;t working for what at the time RH called &quot;layered products&quot;. The hope was that CentOS would provide a more-RHEL-like community place for work like RDO to happen. That was partially successful, but the plan wasn&#x27;t really realized â€” and speaking from a Fedora point of view, that &quot;Fedora is failing at a thing we need so we&#x27;ll turn to CentOS&quot; wasn&#x27;t a healthy dynamic for either project. CentOS Stream serves the initial purpose better, and now RH&#x27;s distro ecosystem story is actually linear rather than a crazy MC Escher contortion.')
