I even had to go ask Google what &quot;Gentrifying&quot; means, because I thought maybe it had some alternate meaning I wasn&#x27;t aware of. I think this article is using &quot;Gentrifying&quot; as a synonym for &quot;ruining&quot; here? That doesn&#x27;t seem quite right.<p>I&#x27;m really not one to care about semantics usually, but that seems like such a loaded word with a pretty standard definition, and I&#x27;m not sure it fits here.')
