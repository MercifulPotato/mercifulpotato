A clinical trial size of 40,000 (20,000 receiving the vaccine) is way larger than a lot of other drugs that people are comfortable taking.<p>Is there zero risk of serious side effects?  Of course not, there never is.  But the trial gives enough data to say the risk is worth the benefit.<p>Edit: The FDA has already hinted that their initial approval (EUA) may be restricted to certain populations where the risk-benefit is justified.  In other words, they may not approve it for healthy, young adults where the risk of serious Covid complications is low.  That &quot;full&quot; approval could come later after additional clinical experience is gained.')
