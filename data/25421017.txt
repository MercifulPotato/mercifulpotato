It&#x27;s basically environmental determinism in the extreme. Don&#x27;t let his Pulitzer prize fool you, Jared Diamond certainly is not an anthropologist, he is an ornithologist, and his application of ecological models to cultural phenomena really oversteps the boundaries of acceptable anthropological scholarship. See this article for a solid critique: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.columbia.edu&#x2F;~saw2156&#x2F;HunterBlatherer.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.columbia.edu&#x2F;~saw2156&#x2F;HunterBlatherer.pdf</a><p>Instead, if you&#x27;re interested in reading more about ice age art, particularly in the Swabian Jura region, you&#x27;ll definitely enjoy this upcoming book written by the leading archaeologists who work on that material: [Ice Age Archaeology: The Record from the Ach and Lone Valleys of Southwest Germany](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.ca&#x2F;books&#x2F;about&#x2F;Ice_Age_Archaeology.html?id=X0VhygEACAAJ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.ca&#x2F;books&#x2F;about&#x2F;Ice_Age_Archaeology.html...</a>) In 2018 I had the unique opportunity to visit Hohle Fels, which is where some of the oldest portable art was recovered, as well as the oldest musical instrument, a bone flute. The tour was led by Nicholas Conrad, the director of this project, and Ewa Dutkiewicz, who excavated and subsequently devoted a large chunk of her career towards studying the bone flute. Their enthusiasm during the tour was really captivating :)<p>I also highly recommend adding the forthcoming book The Dawn of Everything: a New History of Humanity to your reading list. It is co-authored by David Graeber, a fantastic anthropologist who sadly died this year.
