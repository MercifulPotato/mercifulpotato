I just treat my developer jobs as just that, a job, just to pay the bills. Not as a way to move up beyond an IC role, not to become a lead, not to stay on top of industry trends or news. My dad&#x27;s been a welder at the same company for 20+ years, with the same position, and he only quit because the health risks associated with the job were catching up to him. He has been a trucker since.<p>So I want to follow my career cadence basically the same way, only needing to change jobs if I feel it&#x27;s impacting my health (mental or physical) or if I no longer find my team and manager great to work with. Is there a career track like that for SWE&#x27;s which is low-maintenance and have few disruptions? Traditionally I&#x27;ve been a web developer but am tired of running the tech treadmill.')
