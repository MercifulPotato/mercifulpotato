Gbps) Thunderbolt 3 switch for this to work, because the dock only has one host port (the dock&#x27;s topology looks more like a USB hub than a network switch). I suppose there are chips that can do this, but I&#x27;ve never seen a standalone Thunderbolt switch as a product, and if one existed it would probably be expensive.<p>In any case, my desktop is old and doesn&#x27;t speak Thunderbolt. I&#x27;m not sure whether I can bolt it on with a PCIe card, but even if I could, configuring an nvidia card to reroute output from its own ports to a Thunderbolt add-on card sounds... not fun. And then you&#x27;d have to deal with the fact that the longest passive cable that the TB3 spec allows for is like, 2 feet long, and I have a standing desk...<p>It&#x27;s certainly an interesting idea, and pulling it off would be an impressive technical feat.')
