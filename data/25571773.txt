I imagine locals are allocated to and stored on the stack, exactly like you discuss for the registers.  But in a stack VM, you can&#x27;t work on them directly.  Instead you have to load them into this special other place (the stack) and work on them there.  Instruction set is simpler but at the cost of requiring additional operations.')
