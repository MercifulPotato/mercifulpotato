A key finding, obvious to anyone with experience, is that routers generate a lot of very fine dust, compared to most saws or drills.  And this dust will stay there forever without adequate collection.  Even now years later and after a house move I&#x27;ll find a box or something from that garage that just makes my eyes itch and water the moment I touch it.')
