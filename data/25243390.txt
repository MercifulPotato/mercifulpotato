Lots of money there.  Maybe there shouldn&#x27;t be, or it is allocated differently.<p>No one is seriously debating a lack of police.<p>A primary goal of defund efforts appears to be getting at the means of control and incentives that have brought us here.<p>Further, the longer we stay here, ahem, escalating?<p>Abolitionists garner a stronger case and support.  I do not agree with the harder, extreme stance out there, but I also completely understand how compelling it can be.<p>This, so far, has continued to be escalated.  I get it.  Admitting failure equates to weakness and loss of legitimacy, but isn&#x27;t that happening on a large scale anyway?<p>Police need more options same as ordinary people do.<p>Those can be found by having a real conversation, and that starts by deescalation all around.')
