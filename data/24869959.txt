And... if you want to try it past that, it&#x27;s $9&#x2F;month on month-to-month pricing.  For anyone working in &quot;western&quot; economies, it&#x27;s near enough to free to at least give it a trial for a few months.  The other &#x27;big&#x27; competitors - vscode and probably... eclipse - both can provide value, but I&#x27;ve found the JetBrains stuff provide a much nicer out of the box experience for most PHP folks getting started out that that $89&#x2F;year or $9&#x2F;month to try is almost a no-brainer.  But have also had people disagree, and almost always spend more than the $89 of their own time (or their company&#x27;s time) getting VSCode set up with a collection of plugins.')
