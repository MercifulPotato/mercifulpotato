It did everything in the spec, and the customer (Russ) loved what we had, but it turned out (of course) there were many things missed in the spec.<p>A week or two later, we worked out a deal for all of their power plants, provided I would work with Russ to make sure it did everything they wanted...  it would take about a year, in the end. Russ taught me everything I needed to know about users and how they think, in a direct and very effective manner.<p>He was the assistant plant manager, so he would pull a random person into the office, and say to them &quot;I know you&#x27;re not a computer person, I want to you to do X,Y,Z... but don&#x27;t worry... if anything goes wrong, it&#x27;s not your fault... it&#x27;s Mike&#x27;s fault (Russ points at Me). He then tells me to just watch... It took exactly 1 minute to learn the first lesson... there should always be &quot;Press F1 for Help&quot; somewhere on the screen.<p>It was a very instructive and productive year. I&#x27;ve carried those lessons from <i>his forcing function</i> with me for decades. I love telling the story, thanks for listening.')
