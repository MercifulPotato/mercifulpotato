You guys seriously seem to be completely disconnected from what reality looks like for 80%+ of the population.</i><p>You keep writing as if this is a normal problem that everyone faces. If it were, and if everyone or even a moderate proportion of drivers were doing what you seem to be arguing is essential, then population numbers would be falling rapidly due to all the fatal accidents. As far as I can see, however, you haven&#x27;t actually provided any data to back up your repeated claims about how widespread this problem is and how much damage would be caused if the relevant drivers stopped driving when they were unsafe.<p><i>You have no idea how microsleep works.</i><p>Susceptibility to microsleep is usually a result of failing to sufficient good quality sleep normally, an underlying medical problem, or both. Common conditions like obstructive sleep apnoea can be tested for. Effective treatments like CPAP machines exist. Given that OSA can have other serious health effects as well as causing the unusual tiredness that becomes a danger if you&#x27;re doing something like driving or operating heavy machinery, investigation and treatment of potential sleep disorders is definitely recommended.<p>Of course if you simply don&#x27;t get enough hours of sleep regularly, if you don&#x27;t sleep well because you do things like drinking excessive amounts of alcohol in the evening, you can go to bed earlier, cut down on the booze, etc.<p><i>You (as in specifically you) could be experiencing microsleep on a regular basis and never even know it.</i><p>Given that there are many warning signs of microsleeps, one of which is being very tired all the time, and given that the subject of this thread is people driving when they know they&#x27;re so tired they might fall asleep and having a history of scares caused by falling asleep at the wheel, I don&#x27;t see that your attempt to make this personal has any relevance to the debate.')
