At least it&#x27;s affordable.<p>Except for Tesla all the other offer a very bad experience for the price, even the BMW i3 is not what you would expect from a 40 thousands euros car.<p>&gt; People constantly break them by not using the clutch properly, shifting at the wrong moment<p>As I said I grew up in a repair shop too, imagine what they do to their cars when the same people think that an automatic is easier to drive so they put even less effort to it.<p>They destroy every other piece of the car, irresponsible people will be irresponsible.<p>I am not rooting for ice cars, but for letting cars go as a necessity and think of something else.<p>Electric cars are just another way to keep producing the same old product in a slightly different way.<p>They give a false sense of security and of progress.<p>But we are gonna have a black market for hacks and modified parts (batteries probably) anyway and they will be as dangerous as the traditional cars we have right now for pedestrians and other road users.<p>The problem with cars is barely the pollution, it&#x27;s the effect that they produced on our environment, especially the highly dense urbanized areas of the World<p>If they were harder to drive and operate there will be less of them around<p>We got rid of people dying by falling from horses by not riding horses anymore as a standard way to travel<p>How many people do you see flying a plane?<p>A Cessna is not more expensive than a high end Tesla<p>P.s. flying without autopilot is barely possible, using an autopilot without mastering flight first is unimaginable<p>P.p.s. the same people not using the clutch correctly are going to mess with the engine controls on their new electric cars. How is that going to be better? Are they magically going to be better at operating machinery?\nOr will they care less because &quot;EV are the future they almost drive themselves?&quot;<p>P.p.p.s. the number of fatalities is constantly going down because there are more and more mandatory safety devices on cars, but the number of accidents is almost steady (at least in Italy) also considering that the number of km driven went down due to 2 global economic crisis and a pandemia in 20 years and the increase of restricted areas in cities. But, and this is the bad news, there were more cars in Italy in 2019 than ever before, 1.4% more than 2018.<p>In red goal for 2020 victim reduction, in black actual number of victims<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pneurama.com&#x2F;ew&#x2F;ew_articolo&#x2F;images&#x2F;weekly_it&#x2F;imageset&#x2F;large_ACI%20260719.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pneurama.com&#x2F;ew&#x2F;ew_articolo&#x2F;images&#x2F;weekly_it&#x2F;ima...</a>')
