I&#x27;ve been considering replacing my T430, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worthwhile. Mine has 16GB of RAM, i7 quad core, 1TB SSD, etc. I think my money would be better spent upgrading the screen on my existing machine. It&#x27;s also worth noting that I was able to buy a backup&#x2F;spare T430 to use for parts and experimentation for ~$100. All in all, I&#x27;ve been very happy with this model.')
