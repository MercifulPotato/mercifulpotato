Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=[25557052], score=None, time=1609045081, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25546627, text='&gt; Rhetoric like this works until it won&#x27;t anymore.<p>Let it continue to work forever then.<p>&gt; And that rhetoric breaks when innocent bystanders start getting killed in numbers. Line up enough grieving families in front of congress and congress will act, and then the new rhetoric will be &quot;The car should be your mother.&quot;<p>Do I get to line up mine? Cars doing what idiots tell them to is remedied by punishing those idiots. Cars not doing what people need them to results in fatalities.<p>Bob is a big dude. He weighs 400 pounds and can only fit in the car by putting the seat all the way back. There are a million Bobs and you just prohibited any of them from ever using driver assist, which would have improved safety and saved lives.<p>Your car won&#x27;t let you drive more than 10MPH over the speed limit. But then it thinks you&#x27;re on a service road with a 30MPH speed limit when you&#x27;re really on the highway with a 70MPH speed limit, forces you to decelerate to a speed 30MPH slower than the traffic flow, and you get rear-ended and cause a twelve car pile up with nine fatalities.<p>You&#x27;re on a family vacation driving through a deserted area in the middle of nowhere and stop to stretch your legs. When you get back in the car, some sensor has failed and the vehicle&#x27;s computer won&#x27;t let you put the vehicle back into motion again, but there is no wireless coverage or anyone else around, so you and your family die in the wilderness.<p>You need to drive your car the wrong way down a one way street because you need to get to a hospital and the other road is blocked, or you&#x27;re currently impeding a fire truck answering an emergency call, or you need to get away from a forest fire. The computer refuses.<p>&quot;I can&#x27;t let you do that, Dave.&quot; -&gt; People die.')
