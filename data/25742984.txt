Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610431713, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25741300, text='&gt; But the good ones know a lot more about those fields than the average reader&#x2F;listener&#x2F;viewer.<p>I agree, but they never appear to be engaging in advocacy but rather not letting their interviewee get away with lying or deflection. Notably, I would like to see a reporter challenge some of the BLM narrative—at least ask the obvious questions, like “how do we know the police shooting racial disparity is racism and not crime rates or some other factor?” Virtually no journalists touched this issue, and it makes them look like they’re not only partisan, but that the movement itself needs high-profile protection from even the faintest of scrutiny. Small wonder people feel at liberty to find their own “truth sources” when the established ones appear to be dishonest.')
