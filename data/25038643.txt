A U.S. citizen may naturalize in a foreign state without any risk to his or her U.S. citizenship. However, persons who acquire a foreign nationality after age 18 by applying for it may relinquish their U.S. nationality if they wish to do so. In order to relinquish U.S. nationality by virtue of naturalization as a citizen of a foreign state, the law requires that the person must apply for the foreign nationality voluntarily and with the intention to relinquish U.S. nationality. Intent may be shown by the personâ€™s statements and conduct.&quot;<p>Link to source:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;travel.state.gov&#x2F;content&#x2F;travel&#x2F;en&#x2F;legal&#x2F;travel-legal-considerations&#x2F;Advice-about-Possible-Loss-of-US-Nationality-Dual-Nationality&#x2F;Dual-Nationality.html#:~:text=U.S.%20law%20does%20not%20mention,his%20or%20her%20U.S.%20citizenship.&amp;text=They%20are%20required%20to%20obey,right%20to%20enforce%20its%20laws" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;travel.state.gov&#x2F;content&#x2F;travel&#x2F;en&#x2F;legal&#x2F;travel-lega...</a>.')
