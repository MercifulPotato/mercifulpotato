Younger people seem to lean left. As they grow older, a lot of them start to lean conservative.<p>My hypothesis is that when they are young and underdeveloped, they have incomplete understanding of the world, are prone to believing in unrealistic utopian ideas, and hence are easy to manipulate. No wonder, the leftists want the voting age to be lowered even further.<p>As they grow older and wiser, they see it for what it is.<p>The younger conservatives are explained by the fact that some kids who grow up in conservative households don&#x27;t fall for the same manipulation and older liberals are explained by the fact that some people are more reluctant to change, mostly because they weave their personalities around their identities in early adulthood. Some is of course explained by influence of peers (i.e. people adopt a political view to fit in) and hence location... but I think this covers it all.<p>I know I will get downvoted for this which is fine but I&#x27;d like to know your hypothesis for the same population leaning conservative as they age is... if it&#x27;s not too much trouble.')
