It&#x27;s almost always single payer or something where you definitely don&#x27;t go shopping around for hospitals.<p>Doesn&#x27;t it start to feel a bit like indoctrination when arguing for a &quot;free market&quot; when no other developed country has a free market for healthcare?<p>Is <i></i>everyone<i></i> else stupid? What aren&#x27;t they seeing? Especially in the age of the internet?<p>I just can&#x27;t follow this logic.<p>I would love to get someone who argues from the &quot;free market&quot; point of view do some introspection and explain the logic in a way that doesn&#x27;t feel like repeating the same 2-3-4 ideas which as far as I can see, are common talking points in the US.<p>So, repeating the question, what is every other developed country missing?<p>Why aren&#x27;t they all doing this, if it&#x27;s obviously superior?')
