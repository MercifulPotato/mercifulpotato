On an international scale all the anglophone countries are extraordinarily high in their levels of mass social trust and respect for human rights.\nI fear that social trust is declining in all these countries because we do not recognise how special the conditions within we live under are, and as a result are not working hard enough to maintain it. I believe the consequences are visible earlier in a nation of 300 million than they are in a nation of 20 million. I am optimistic, more by disposition than through evidence, that this is something we will fix.')
