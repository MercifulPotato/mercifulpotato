The last time we bought one, they looked at us like we were very weird for...well, having the cash to pay for a car.<p>Then again, we basically didn&#x27;t go to a dealership other than for test drives.  We e-mailed every dealer within an hour and a half of us with &quot;This is exactly the make and model we want, these are the options, this is the color (but we&#x27;re open to substitutions), what&#x27;s your best price?&quot;  We took the lowest bid, and if there was any funny business (there was with one), we walked.<p>Most dealers now have online sales departments that are setup for these low-overhead but low-price transactions (this was a rarity when I bought mine in 2009).  Apparently the sales guy we bought from sells 3x more cars than the next-best sales guy at the dealership, because he knows how to price the cars to move online and then acts straight &amp; efficient when the buyer comes in.')
