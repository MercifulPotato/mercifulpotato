I haven&#x27;t tried the owned library sharing in years, but I have problems trying to get tracks I own into audio processing apps - they should just be available, but it seems I have to download the track in Music first, then wait some unspecified amount of time before the audio is allowed to see it. The whole things counters the convenience I thought Apple was selling.')
