The company I worked for provided devices which would create and read a topological map of the back someone&#x27;s right hand.<p>There were a couple of instances where users would be missing fingers or had deformities that would throw the machine off. In these cases we would have them put their left hand upside down in the device and map that instead.<p>In cases where there was issues with the original and alt methods we could remove the check altogether (employ would place their hand and it would go through so nothing was suspicious). This only happened once in the hundreds of thousands of people I&#x27;d deployed to.<p>As an aside, this method of tracking users in and out of work was markedly more digestible than reading someone&#x27;s fingerprints and increased user adoption.<p>Working in 1st 2nd and 3rd world we heard all kinds of stories from employees not wanting to provide fingerprints from not wanting to be framed for murder to stealing a part of your soul by extracting sacred finger marks (similar story to photos in some cultures).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;us.allegion.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;home&#x2F;products&#x2F;categories&#x2F;biometrics.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;us.allegion.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;home&#x2F;products&#x2F;categories&#x2F;biometri...</a>')
