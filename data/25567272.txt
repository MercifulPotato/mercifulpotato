You buy panels that are some standard width (say 16 inches) and come in standardized heights (e.g. 2ft, 4ft, 8ft) with whatever connections running through them. If you want to re-configure your house, you just buy replacement panels.<p>Now I see significant technical drawbacks to such a system, but it is an interesting idea to think about and would be way more space efficient than the one you are talking about.')
