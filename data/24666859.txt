I haven&#x27;t seen any maps but I think it probably very roughly corresponds with the Hajnal line: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hajnal_line" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hajnal_line</a><p>Of course, modern American notions of the nuclear family are a little different from the historical norm as wealth and health put limits on its expression. Modern, middle-class East Asian norms are probably closer to the pattern hundreds of years ago in Northwest Europe.[1] But in terms of <i>comparative</i> culture the distinctions are crystal clear across time.<p>[1] Of course, hundreds of years ago (or just 100 years ago), many East Asian cultures had uber multigenerational clan households and even entire villages. I heard a story over dinner once from an elderly Chinese-Singaporean. His parents were migrants from China. His father died when he was a baby, and his mother died when he was about 8. Every night his mother had him sing and memorize a song that described his [paternal] family&#x27;s village. Fast-forward to his late 60s, he finally has the urge to travel to China to find his roots. All he had to go on was the general region and the song, which described some kind of confluence of mountains and rivers. He got close enough that a local was able to recognize the details and tell him the precise village. When he got there the villagers--mostly cousins, and even an uncle, IIRC--already knew all about him and his parents. Both his parents&#x27; death as well as his birth were recorded in the clan books, even though they happened in Malaysia and he has no idea how news traveled back to the village. They even showed him the shrine to his father, which was tended to by the new occupant (presumably a distant cousin) of the house his father had previously lived in.')
