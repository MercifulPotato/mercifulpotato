I can see the point in building a kernel in the safe subset of Rust, to provide strong assurances about memory-management. I can see the point in building a kernel in SPARK to provide even stronger and more general assurances of correctness. I see the point in developing a kernel using a fully formal methodology, like Sel4. I can see the fun in hand-tuned kernels written in assembly, like KolibriOS. What&#x27;s interesting about using a language with slightly different imperative building-blocks? Rust wouldn&#x27;t be worth learning if it were merely C with different iterative statements.<p>Or are there significant advantages to the various Oberons, that I&#x27;m unaware of?')
