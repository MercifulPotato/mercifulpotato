Compared to 2.4GHz, 5GHz barely passes through walls, and it is actually a good thing. My rule of thumb for 5GHz is to have access point every other room and to lower transmit power so that they don&#x27;t in the way of each other.<p>In effect, there are 3 APs in my 160m^2, two storey flat. I get easily minimum 400-500MBit&#x2F;s on AC with multiple users in any spot in the flat but I don&#x27;t use typical consumer hardware. To do 5GHz properly in a large home you need something that will be able to properly roam users while they are moving about.<p>Where I live I see about 250-260 2.4GHz access points at any point in time and 2.4GHz is almost useless. I only see 3 5GHz APs. The fact that 5GHz is so attenuated by the walls makes it usable in high density environment.<p>I have also found that one shiny laptop that was more pricey than others had trouble with lower speeds and constant disconnets. <i>LOWERING</i> transmit power actually helped, because it caused it to be kicked earlier from AP and switch to another, closer one.<p>So, to underline, you need to know technology you are using. WiFi requires a little bit of knowledge because you want to realize a miracle of passing huge amount of data at high speeds through walls. I kinda wonder why everybody complains they can pass signal only through <i>single</i> wall.')
