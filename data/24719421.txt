Then making the grid more efficient and lower emissions benefits all the downstream applications without needing to wait for equipment replacements.<p>I just installed a new gas heating system (replacing my 1975-vintage hardware that died) because PG&amp;E charges me roughly 6.4 cents per KWh delivered by pipe vs 44 cents per KWh delivered by wire. [1] Ironically, my red-state-dwelling parents are all-electric and are emitting less CO2e than I am because it&#x27;s cheaper for them.<p>I moved out of walking range of a Caltrain station and honestly don&#x27;t miss it. Tickets are always more expensive than driving, the service is slow, and living nearby is noisy. But it doesn&#x27;t have to be that way. I only actually used it if I was going all the way to San Francisco, my bicycle was broken, or it was raining a lot - so a few times per year. There&#x27;s just no will here to make the public transit experience excellent.<p>[1] Folks may notice that the $0.44&#x2F;KWh is far above the stated rate. That&#x27;s because there&#x27;s tiers and fees. Other folks are quick to point to time-of-use as a way to solve everything, but that would actually increase my bill because most of my electricity use is either base load or peak-hours activities. And I dislike the cognitive burden of micro-optimizing everything all the time.')
