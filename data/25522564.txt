It was surprising to me the number of times the experience on a resume didn&#x27;t line up with what the interviewee showed through conversation and small whiteboard exercises.<p>I get that it&#x27;s not very real-world representative, and that&#x27;s why homework is used instead by some companies.<p>Maybe the answer is to give the applicant a choice?  Either be prepared to convince me you know what you claim, or demonstrate it with a take-home problem.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d prefer a day of in-person-pair programming as part of the interview.  I&#x27;d get a better feel for the team and their workflows.  If it&#x27;s a total horror show, it&#x27;s good to know up front :)')
