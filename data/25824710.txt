Oh and if you have state-based control flow you have to turn off the JIT. Etc. If you take a standard library like some thermodynamics simulator and throw Jax on it do you expect it to work without modification? Most of the time it&#x27;ll fail right at the start by using the wrong implementation of Numpy. So no, that&#x27;s not &quot;ordinary functions&quot;: those are functions where people consciously put in the effort to rewrite years of work onto Jax which is very different.')
