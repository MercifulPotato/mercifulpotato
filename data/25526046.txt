Item(by='black3r', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608800397, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25520412, text='&gt; The only difference between CVE-2020-0986 is that for CVE-2020-0986 the attacker sent a pointer and now the attacker sends an offset.<p>CVE-2020-0986 had been discovered in the wild in May. Microsoft claimed to have fixed it, so this was logged as a separate CVE, even though it&#x27;s essentially the same bug (the fix can be trivially circumvented) and P0 has given it a new 90 day period, which has now ran out.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t call it too strict, they had much more than 90 days to fix it properly.')
