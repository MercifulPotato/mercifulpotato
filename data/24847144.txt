A good web framework is indeed quite an important step towards making a language&#x2F;ecosystem more appealing to a more general audience.<p>I&#x27;ve yet to encounter a small enough project with low risk where I could get away with trying something completely new, but I&#x27;m looking forward to trying Nim in the (hopefully very near) future.<p>One negative thing that stood out to me was that commit messages are sometimes really bad, like &quot;break&quot; or &quot;let me try&quot;. I&#x27;m not trying to bash the author, but I feel it&#x27;s somewhat unprofessional.')
