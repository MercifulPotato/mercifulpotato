I&#x27;m free of the bothersome things that accompany relationships, but can ease people&#x27;s sense of loneliness. Maybe it&#x27;s something like that for me,&quot; Morimoto told the Mainichi Shimbun.<p>People can derive support from Morimoto, but he doesn&#x27;t <i>intend</i> to provide them that support. That lack of intention makes his service simple and allows people to get what they want from him.<p>How genuine.')
