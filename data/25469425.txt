I support broad and quality general education, I think it has value, but I don&#x27;t suggest anyone put themselves deeply in debt for the rest of their lives over it. But to have any shot whatsoever at a decent job? Yeah, maybe.<p>So if you have the opportunity to pay a fraction of the cost for the credential, even if it means teaching yourself everything, that seems like a strategy very much worth considering for many people. It&#x27;s dystopian that that&#x27;s where we are now, but it is what it is.')
