I find this concept of &quot;reaction bulldozing&quot; to cause any discussion to be shut down prematurely. Adding a reaction like that is so simple to do and doesn&#x27;t require any effort, it&#x27;s very easy to do, but actually adding your own opinion or nuanced explanation is very much harder, especially when the other side then already has so many &quot;reaction emojis&quot;. I feel like the &quot;signal-to-effort&quot; ratio is completely skewed by this. You&#x27;d have to be a very assertive person to pierce through it and offer your, possibly only slightly, different opinion after seeing this.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what exactly it is that I dislike about it - does it stifle discussion? Does it diminish diversity of opinions? I think it does, if you&#x27;re not early enough to give a dissenting opinion then it&#x27;s you against the group, and I&#x27;m guessing a lot of people at that point would rather not react at all anymore.<p>Am I alone in thinking this? Is there a solution for this? I often encounter this phenomenon in discussions with engineers, not just with contentious topics like nazi&#x27;s, but also e.g. styleguide or architectural discussions. I hope there&#x27;s a word for it so I can learn how to deal with it, because currently I really can&#x27;t pinpoint it.')
