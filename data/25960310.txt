They still have:<p>- Your location<p>- A list of what you post about, what you link, what photos you&#x27;ve shared, what activities you&#x27;ve attended, what groups you are in, etc etc.<p>- All of the above about many of you friends and family members just in case there are interests you don&#x27;t talk about on Facebook.<p>So how exactly is whether Facebooking that I checked the weather on the corner of 3rd and Center at 7pm going to help those small businesses advertising on Facebook?<p>Is there going to be some flash umbrella store around the corner if rain is in the forecast?')
