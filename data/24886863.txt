(Perhaps such employees have a risk of causing large harm, which could for instance be an issue in the military.) And we again compare admitting people at random vs only taking applicants with above average IQ.&quot;<p>[for reference, if using IQ as an indicator for performance, 2 standard deviations below the mean would be 70 IQ]<p>Taleb:\n&quot;The argument by psychologists to make IQ useful is of the sort: who would you like to do brain surgery on you&#x2F;who would you hire in your company&#x2F;who would you recommend, someone with a 90 IQ or one with 130 is ...academic. Well, you pick people on task-specific performance, which should include some filtering. In the real world you interview people from their CV (not from some IQ number sent to you as in a thought experiment), and, once you have their CV, the 62 IQ fellow is naturally eliminated. So the only think for which IQ can select, the mentaly disabled, is already weeded out in real life: he&#x2F;she can’t have a degree in engineering or medicine. Which explains why IQ is unnecessary and using it is risky because you miss out on the Einsteins and Feynmans.&quot;')
