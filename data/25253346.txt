So about a year ago, our team at Bunch set out to make it easier.<p>Our goal was to combine micro-learning (bite-sized, actionable advice), personalisation (using goal-setting and a content recommender), \na leadership competency model (my co-founder is an org. Psychologist), and a bit of gamification to make it more fun (RPG style “leadership personas”).<p>We’re hoping this will make leadership skills (aka people skills for managers) more accessible. We have launched it for free on iOS, and working on an Android version.<p>Would love to hear thoughts from HN on our approach and this direction! Also would love to hear ideas for improving UX and the content recommendations. Soaking up as much feedback as possible.<p>PS: We built it with SwiftUI, if you have questions about how it went, feel free to ask!')
