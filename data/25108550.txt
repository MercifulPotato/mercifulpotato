I found <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.virtahealth.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;keto-adapted" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.virtahealth.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;keto-adapted</a> which shows a graph of uric acid spiking as you begin the diet and returning back to baseline after several weeks, which was something I didn&#x27;t know before, but I was still confused because it was already at several weeks.<p>To make a long story short I discovered the next year that the culprit was pistachios. So long as I don&#x27;t eat too many of them while dieting, my foot is fine.')
