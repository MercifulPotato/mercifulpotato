Last week I booted into Linux to access an old project and the UX felt like an uncanny valley. I suspect it might be due to Windows&#x2F;Linux having different mouse acceleration formulas which is pretty noticeable when I try moving across 3x 1440p monitors.<p>Now that Windows dev experience (for me) is almost comparable to Linux and will continue to improve, I don&#x27;t see much reason to switch back to Linux.<p>Of course that&#x27;s not to say I don&#x27;t have any complaints for Windows. For example file names are not case sensitive and it drives me crazy when I need to change a file name&#x27;s casing.')
