There&#x27;s no client DOM in memory on the server, there&#x27;s no html buttons that call native code.<p>There are forms being submitted, there are normal requests happening, there are templates being rendered on a per-request basis (just like a full page load).<p>This is like a normal web application that renders HTML, from the perspective of how the server works. Just as scalable as every other Rails application that renders HTML.
