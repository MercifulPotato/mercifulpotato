Easy diffing between states of the CR (patch sets), so you can see what changes since the last round of comments, even if it spanned multiple updates. This is the feature I miss the most from other code review systems - be able to easily work on another commit that bases on one that I just sent out for review (even starting review on the new while the parent still hasn&#x27;t finished being reviewed!), and rebasing my current change as the parent change gets reviewed&#x2F;updated.<p>Possibility to send out a PR for review using just a push (change message in commit, push to refs&#x2F;for&#x2F;master%r=foo).<p>Snappy and compact code review experience (no space wasted for whitespace, avatars, pretty buttons). Full coverage with keyboard shortcuts.<p>Powerful review rule system based in Prolog, allowing for things like code owners, experimental subdirectories without the need for review, etc.')
