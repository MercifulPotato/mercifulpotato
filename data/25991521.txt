Any nation that did that was wiped off the face of the earth rather quickly.<p>If gender rolls were reversed wouldnâ€™t be many examples where the death toll was high enough for this to occur.<p>In Britain in the 1921 census there were 1,209 single women aged 25 to 29 for every 1,000 men. In 1931 50% were still single, and 35% of them did not marry while still able to bear children.<p>After the war there were about 40% fewer single French men for every unmarried woman, compared to before.<p>Devastating loses but nowhere near enough to threaten the existence of a country. \nPost WW2 Germany and Russia would also be grim examples. It is of note that the 20th century was the first time that deaths from actual enemy action exceeded deaths from disease during war.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;389781&#x2F;think-a-good-man-is-hard-to-find-now-try-france-after-world-war-i&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;389781&#x2F;think-a-good-man-is-hard-to-find-now-t...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Surplus_women" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Surplus_women</a>')
