If the compiler can be sure a type will be used exactly once, you could for example do automatic memory management by freeing the value directly after it is used. You can also fix a range of multithreading bugs with it, as other people have mentioned.<p>Finally, it allows you to express more invariants about your data through the type system, hopefully reducing bug counts. As an example, soneone could &quot;implement&quot; a sorting function as `sort xs = []`. This has the correct type signature, but is not a correct implementation of sorting. With linear types you could express that the output has to access the values of the input. (Of course what we&#x27;d actually want is to express other invariants for sorting as well, but full dependent types are still some ways off)')
