They limit what plugins you can install with an ever growing blacklist, and they try to handle as much of the performance stack as possible to reduce attack vectors. You don&#x27;t like their caching layer? Too bad.<p>You&#x27;re also paying for decent support tech&#x27;s and support availability. I think to this day you can call and a human will pick up the phone. Tech&#x27;s are well versed in the WordPress ecosystem and many are developers who can help you troubleshoot things at the code level, whereas with some budget webhost, they&#x27;ll tell you to pound sand and hang up (albeit more politely).<p>That said, I think these &quot;premium&quot; WordPress hosts are purely for non-devs or devs with no time to provide their own support. If you&#x27;re a developer, there is no reason to pay that premium to keep your blog online. If you want a more managed solution, use something like ServerPilot or SpinUp WP, or any number of other service that will provide a thin maintenance layer on top of any garden variety VPS provider.')
