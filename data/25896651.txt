The whole content seems to consist of only three points:<p>1- that their sensors are better and lidar is indispensable.<p>2- that there is no continuum between assisted driving and fsd.<p>3- that they have already achieved full self driving.<p>That&#x27;s it. Neither 1 or 2 are supported by any argument, and 3 contradicts the widespread opinion here that fsd is impossible (at least without agi).<p>Note: I&#x27;m not defending Tesla, I&#x27;m just saying that this article is very light on actual content.')
