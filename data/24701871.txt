In this case, we are talking about vertically aligned retail giants producing store brands as a form of further vertical alignment.</i><p>If you want to talk about vertically aligned retail giants producing store brands, it would be very helpful for you to understand that retailers like Walmart and Target are not vertically aligned and do not produce their own store brands. They buy them as white label products from <i>other companies,</i> most of whom make the name-brand products that appear in their stores alongside the store brands.<p>Tesla would be an example of a vertically aligned company, as would Apple to a lesser extent.<p>Amazon does not operate like Walmart or Target, so none of what I am saying applies to Amazon. I agree with you that Amazon is violating antitrust with its policies.  There are fundamental differences in how Amazon&#x27;s marketplace works compared to how retail sales work that drive that analysis.<p><i>They use that data in order to develop store brands in order to further monopolize profits from their position as a distributor.</i><p>The second half of that statement is false (&quot;in order to...&quot;), and demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of how the retail market works. Product manufacturers derive their profits from selling <i>to retailers</i> not to end customers. They sell their goods at &quot;wholesale prices&quot; that are far below what the end customers pay. The wholesale prices for <i>store brand products</i> are generally the same or close to the same as the price of name-brand products.<p>Once on the shelves, the products compete on the basis of marketing. Manufacturers do this by advertising, like on TV. Stores do this by discounting their products or placing them in a better position on the shelf.<p>And you know what? Advertising simply works better. People <i>prefer</i> the name brand even though the store brand of comparable quality (and often the same underlying product) is right there next to it. There are hundreds of studies on this, and literally trillions of dollars of consumer spending supporting this.<p>Also, in many cases the stores work with the product makers and provide them data about in-store sales statistics to help them determine marketing spend (including advertising, product design, package design, etc.), because they care more about getting people into the store to buy any product than they do about making a tiny bit more from selling a store brand item instead of Name Brand Product X.')
