I was contemplating EPOS Adapt 560, but after watching many tests by CallOne (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;CallOneInc&#x2F;videos" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;CallOneInc&#x2F;videos</a>) I&#x27;m just not too impressed. And also, I have no idea how those will work on Linux... Any recommendations?')
