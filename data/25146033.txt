What I wanted was to recreate life from scratch, an impossible task with todays technology; the logical sequence of steps behind our biological origins is not hard to see and become enamored with, but I will never get the satisfaction of learning all its secrets.<p>With programming and computers this is so much closer, because these things are made my humans. Millions of man-years of effort, but still man-made. So, at least with computers I know I can learn how it&#x27;s all done, and I know the steps needed to make all this technology are also known.')
