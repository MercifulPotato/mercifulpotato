I take precautions consistent with how I perceive the risk to myself and others - just like I always have my entire life.   Just like you have your entire life.  Ebola is a completely different risk&#x2F;tradeoff profile than covid.  Consider how many quality of life years have been lost due to things &quot;saving&quot; us from the pandemic.  I&#x27;d wager we&#x27;ve had at least a ~10% reduction in quality of life for everyone in the U.S. (that&#x27;s where I live so I&#x27;ll use the example).  That&#x27;s 300+ million people for about a year.  That&#x27;s 30 million quality of life years lost.  How many people will we have saved?  Maybe 500,000?  On average they had maybe 3 years left to live each.  Also, people dying tended to not have a great quality of life (i.e. they were near the end of their life anyway) - but just to keep the estimate conservative we won&#x27;t discount&#x2F;reduce the worth of their final years.  So we saved 1.5 million quality of life years.  What kind of moronic tradeoff is that?')
