But the underlying problem hasn&#x27;t been solved. That is an evolution, not a revolution. Which is my point - less and less revolutions, more and more money spent, for small evolutions.<p>&gt; Most other progress depends on cheap energy and governmental policies, which weâ€™re getting again.<p>Which, again, isn&#x27;t scientific progress. If it&#x27;s a sociological problem it&#x27;s not really a scientific breakthrough - it could have been solved decades ago if the will was there.<p>In fact I&#x27;d say we can gain MORE from sociological improvements, not pie in the sky science.')
