The Mac that I purchased is no longer the Mac that I have.<p>Apple now only provides 3 years of security updates for the OS that came with your Mac. You can&#x27;t even buy an extended service contract! So then you&#x27;re forced to &quot;upgrade&quot; the OS or else live with a bunch of known vulnerabilities. But every new version of the OS locks down the Mac even more. That&#x27;s not what I paid for.<p>Moreover, it was Apple&#x27;s decision to start shipping major new OS versions on a yearly schedule. That&#x27;s not how it was in the past. Mac OS X Jaguar lasted 14 months, Panther 18, Tiger 30, Leopard 22, Snow Leopard 23 months. But then Steve Jobs stepped down for health reasons, passed away, and Tim Cook &quot;altered the deal&quot;.')
