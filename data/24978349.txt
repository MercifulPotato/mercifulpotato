E.g. one with flagella on just one side. Then the better ones would evolve machinery to speed up the gradient, which happened to be using some energy but made said cell move and digest faster, thus also reproduce faster. At this point this could still be shut down during lack of food or activity, as there was a natural gradient when activity was nearby.<p>The membrane is the later invention, dating to organelles which are suspected to be microcellular parasites that got integrated and then reduced.\nThese membranes were much more efficient, however they were very hard to turn off for hibernation as the membrane is a static gradient and hard to disrupt temporarily.')
