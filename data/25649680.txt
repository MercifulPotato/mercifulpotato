Have you seen the UX of e.g. popcorntime? If not, I suggest to read up on just how low friction these things already are, and that&#x27;s with the typical use being illegal.<p>And no, the anti-tivoization part is about preventing corporations from using DRM and&#x2F;or hardware-locking to stop users from modifying the software running on their devices. I&#x27;d want exceptions for systems that are fully restricted from any kind of software&#x2F;firmware update, like e.g. Yubikeys. But if systems support software updates, the user must not be prevented from running their own code on hardware they own, though of course a way to lock systems permanently down is reasonable and likely needed for cases where the owner can&#x27;t ensure physical security.')
