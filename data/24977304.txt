Most of these insane financial contortions are done because they aren&#x27;t taxed on foreign, non-repatriated earnings - creating an incentive to convert domestic earnings into &#x27;foreign&#x27; ones, that get repatriated the next time there&#x27;s a tax holiday.<p>I personally would love to earmark my personal income as foreign-sourced, and to not pay any taxes on it until I get a tax discount... But if I were to do that, I would go to jail for tax evasion.')
