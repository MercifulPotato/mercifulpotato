If you hire Beyonce it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re paying for the performance she gives. If you hire Janet Yellen, no person credibly believes it&#x27;s because that hour talk she&#x27;s giving is hugely valuable. It&#x27;s because you want to establish connections with her to influence  her in her <i>actual</i> job where her power comes from. It&#x27;s a pretext for paying her money that, were you to turn up to her office and hand it to her at her day job, would be a bribe.')
