Right to the point.<p>I think Texas got this right. Higher property taxes are assessed every year on the current property value.\nThis has the positive effect to keep the real estate market within reason. \nHome owners have no incentive to see their taxes explode, unless they plan to sell and move.<p>CA is a mess! And don&#x27;t get me started on the fact that property taxes pay for public schools, so if I buy a property today say at $1M whereas my neighbor bought 10y ago and payed $100k guess who is paying the most to finance schools ? It is utterly unfair!<p>Hence, after almost a decade in SF, I and my finally finally moved on, I kept my job and bought a nice, modern, luxury house in Austin! I and my family are super happy now.<p>I voted democrats my entire life, I have now realized how wrong I was! SF and CA turned me into a republican! And that&#x27;s what I vote now.')
