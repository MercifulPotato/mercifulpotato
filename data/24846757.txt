However, you mention VHDL which I agree with and somebody else pointed out Javascript which is also a good point. The Javascript example (along with C++) make the point that serious computer languages are not necessarily great languages.<p>I would argue that Rust is not a serious language (at the moment [1]) because its still young, there is no specification and if anything happens to the one implementation it would be a disaster.<p>Despite C being a null pointer minefield, if someone was to sue a developer the argument could be made that it is an industry standard. In the less likely event that a Rust program hurt somebody what are you going to say?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;users.rust-lang.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;is-there-a-plan-to-get-a-formal-rust-language-specification-at-some-point&#x2F;21622&#x2F;8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;users.rust-lang.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;is-there-a-plan-to-get-a-forma...</a>')
