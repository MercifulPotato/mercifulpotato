You can&#x27;t really say the WF is predicting positions...if it&#x27;s up to you to provide the positions.<p>&gt; If the electrons and quarks don&#x27;t have identity, how can a ball?<p>Macro objects can be separated, to where macro measurements make them appear separate (but they never really are), however at the atomic level this video helps (as a mental visualization) explain why actual electrons have no identity:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-gr7KmTOrx0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-gr7KmTOrx0</a><p>In the video, ask yourself, do any of the &quot;humps&quot; in the string have identity? You can count them, see their position, measure velocity, etc., but they&#x27;re purely an emergent phenomena, and have no true identity.<p>Nothing about any quantum mechanical wave system has any identities either. So when you &quot;measure&quot; something (i.e. &quot;find&quot; a particle) by collapsing the WF, you have actually not &#x27;found&#x27; but &#x27;created&#x27; something that seems to have a location in space and time, but it&#x27;s not because it &quot;moved there&quot;. It&#x27;s because you &quot;created it there&quot;.')
