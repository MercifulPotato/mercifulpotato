Regarding soil acidity, wood ash is highly basic, so large quantities of ash from a major fire would help reduce the acidity.<p>In essence, with warming climate and mass wood fires we would expect also the soil in these areas to change in ways that are better for agriculture; the only question is about the speed of that change.<p>Also, the whole point of slash-and-burn agriculture in northern europe was that it was infertile and lacking nutrients otherwise - it was not a way of increasing the quantity your fields, you would abandon your fields after a couple of years to overgrow with forest, and slash-and-burn a new one for that temporary influx of nutrients in soil that is otherwise lacking them.')
