In general anti-abuse work is not nearly as useful as product work, a day off, or a variety of other things.<p>I agree, there <i>should</i> be better ways to do anti-abuse. Yet I find myself coming up empty when I try to find better options for the common scenario where people would really rather invest deeply in their service than in anti-abuse.<p>I would love to hear some ideas about how to solve this nasty general problem while also respecting user time and privacy. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve found that entirely too often the vague sense that there <i>must</i> be a better way fails to translate into substantive better way.')
