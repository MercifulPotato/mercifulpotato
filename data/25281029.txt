I find it works better than the gum, which tends to give me too much no matter how fast I spit it out.  I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of supplements and nootropics in my quest to regain what I lost when I got sleep apnea a couple years ago.<p>Strangely enough, one thing that I find is also helping is a balaclava.  I&#x27;m standing here like an idiot with a balaclava on because I find it helps me stay focused.  I got it a few days ago to use when hiking.  I just happened to notice while trying it on that I felt a little calmer.  I used it last night while working and finally managed to get some shit done.<p>I&#x27;m also using spaced repetition to try to remember things.  No apps or programs yet, just manual note taking and repetition.')
