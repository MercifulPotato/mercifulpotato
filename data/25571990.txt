If someone has covid and is dying in a hospital about to be ventilated and awake for the last time in their lives and they refuse to admit that maybe this is serous then watching some Intercept crisis porn would not have convinced them either. Some Americans refuse to admit that mass shootings at school actually happened and no amount of &quot;evidence&quot; will convince them otherwise.<p>Having journalist hover over the grieving like vultures asking the dying to describe how they feel is gross. Filming them while they die is despicable. Journalists might have become accustom to covering health crisis porn in famine and war zones outside of the USA, but inside we have legal protections against being the subjects of this kind of exploitative journalism and we have protections against the dissemination of health information.')
