That is simply a paradigm and no paradigm can fit the whole (unless there&#x27;s a better paradigm). Anyways, it depends on your definition of success. If it includes happiness then by definition no. If it&#x27;s more vague then that then probably. I would define perfect success as something like improving the world and being happy about it.<p>To that point there are definitely construction workers and nurses who hate their jobs and actively despise but still make the world a better place, are they successful? I believe your internal mental state will reflect and impact upon those around you and the things you are significant for. Does being an unhappy boss who gets great results make you not successful. The core issue lies in definitions. We could dream up a definition of success that could define any number of contradictory traits. That is for you to decide and society at large to gently guide.')
