Every single person with a computer, from a smart phone to render farm workstations, will have WASM support because those devices will have a browser. The only browser that doesn&#x27;t support it is the legacy IE line of browsers, of which only 11 is still supported, and which only runs on systems that will happily run Edge, instead.<p>Devs can rely on the fact that users won&#x27;t need to install a single thing, and users can rely on the fact that they&#x27;re not going to have to go through the insanity that is &quot;trying to install the right version of Boobletech(tm) Meep(r)&quot; or, hell: &quot;trying to get their OS to even acknowledge that the preinstalled version of java is over a decade old and it needs to stop using it instead of the new version you installed&quot;.<p>If your compiler can target WebAssembly, and your users are on computers with operating systems that are still supported, your WASM application will work for them, because everyone has a browser.')
