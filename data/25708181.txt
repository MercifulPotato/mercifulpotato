Precautionary principle applies and a circuit breaker goes off.<p>This is a special case that sits within a much broader question of where, how, and whether speech is regulated online. We clearly haven&#x27;t gotten very far along in that discussion yet, but society needs time to even be able to have that conversation intellectually and legislatively. If a peaceful and orderly transition of power is unable to occur, unfortunately we may never be given that time.')
