And what do you do if a learning disability of some form is discovered at some point? Dyslexia and ADHD may not be apparent until well into elementary school.<p>Do you or KA have the ability to recognize if there even is one? If so, what do you do? What resources or support do you have to navigate it?<p>We have experienced this with one of our children. Teachers, staff and administration have been amazing. The support are resources are incredible. We have seen our child flourish with their help, our child&#x27;s pediatrician and our involvement, of course. But we could not have replicated that on our own.<p>And the social aspect cannot be understated. We look to involve our kids with friends and family and organizations and activities outside of school and our home, but there are many constraints around this, particularly now. I see public school as an important testing ground for the eventual reality of existing in a society that isn&#x27;t solely constructed for your own success.<p>KA will always be there. And you may find that a more traditional setting isn&#x27;t right or is limiting your child in some way. Or you may find that it is a great place for them and that they also bring positive benefits to the system that our entire society relies on to work well.')
