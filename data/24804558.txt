Don&#x27;t do what?<p>Please don&#x27;t make that argument your making? Please don&#x27;t make your argument in that way? Please don&#x27;t argue at all? Please don&#x27;t ask questions?<p>Literally, all the comment you responded to did what ask a question to invite further discussion of an idea they were interested in.<p>When I hear &quot;please don&#x27;t do that&quot; I picture kids pulling up flowers in someone&#x27;s yard and they yell out &quot;please don&#x27;t do that!&quot; It seems aggressive and unspecific for a civilized discussion among equals.')
