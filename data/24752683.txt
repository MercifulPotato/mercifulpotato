We have often times where the price is negative and on the other hand sometimes exceeds hundreds of Euros per MWh.<p>Germany has allegedly 50% renewables in their electricity mix, yet they have one of the highest specific CO2 emissions per kWh in Europe, plus the highest prices.<p>If you want a positive example, you have to use France.<p>For comparison:<p>- France: 17 Cents per kWh, 50 grams CO2 per kWh on average<p>- Germany: 31 Cents per kWh, 401 grams per kWh on average<p>Also, the wholesale electricity price is irrelevant to the customer, especially in Germany where renewables receive a guaranteed price per kWh, _independent_ of the current wholesale price which is why our electricity bills are so high.<p>Germany is currently planning and building 16 gas plants and even two coal plants, so you shouldn’t take Germany as a positive example for decarbonizing the electricity sector. We aren’t.<p>I’m very glad Poland and the Netherlands are actually planning to build nuclear power plants.')
