He&#x27;s a name I know and I click it when I see it on HN.  There are a lot of other people with similar HN clout, patio11 for instance.<p>I haven&#x27;t noticed a trend for comments on PG articles to be less critical.  If anything I think I&#x27;ve noticed users feeling a need to be <i>more</i> critical (as I feel your comment illustrates).<p>It&#x27;s OK to hold pg to a higher standard than others in terms of factually supporting his claims.  Fine.  Just be clear that you are doing so.  It&#x27;s fine to remind others not to take his word as gospel as well.')
