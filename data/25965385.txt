Here is one study from Singapore in 2014 that showed surgical and n95 have about a 68% and 95% efficacy respectively at preventing SARS transmission <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4293989&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC4293989&#x2F;</a> Masks have also been shown to provide protection against the common cold (many strains of which are also coronaviruses) and seasonal flus <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livescience.com&#x2F;7661-masks-protect-colds-flu.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livescience.com&#x2F;7661-masks-protect-colds-flu.htm</a>...<p>There&#x27;s two ways I can see you interpreting this.<p>1) You are being extremely narrow in your focus and saying that you are talking specifically about viruses being transmitted as aerosols (although the overarching topic here is about whether or not masks are effective). And thus, since there was no research specifically about this, then there&#x27;s no reason to recommend masks. This doesn&#x27;t address the point that there&#x27;s research that shows masks are effective against similar kinds of viruses.<p>2) You actually are talking about effectiveness of masks and saying that viruses could not be transmitted via aerosol was to say that because they are not shown to be transmitted via aerosol, then there&#x27;s no evidence that masks would work, in which case, again, we&#x27;re back to the issue that there was research prior to 2020 that showed masks are effective against similar kinds of viruses.<p>So the question remains, are you wrong about your assertion that<p>&gt; Prior to 2020, most medical professionals believed most viruses, and corona viruses particularly, could not be transported as aerosols. This was a subject of research where the data had not come in.<p>and if not, what are we missing about what you&#x27;re trying to say?<p>&gt; Some kind of admission that the US health field ignored research because &quot;eww, icky Asians?&quot;<p>There was certainly the perception that Asians wearing masks was ridiculous. Whether or not this perception extended to American experts and influenced their conclusions is unknown to me.')
