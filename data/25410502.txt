The author states that a larger trade deficit is good for the USA and the dollar since it means more demand for dollars with little given back in return save for debt. and yet Donald trump has repeatedly called for closing the gap with China while the new admin will return to the status quo.<p>Certainly if the economics work out then why not. How could it be bad? But I cant help but feel there is something so perverse about such a system. What ultimately feels like encouragement to consume and rack up debt to detriment to others.<p>I donâ€™t claim to understand the forces behind the economics of this at all but my intuition tells me the pandemic has created more cracks to such a system.')
