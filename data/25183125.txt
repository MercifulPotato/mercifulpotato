We said it wasn&#x27;t backed by dollars, lo and behold, $850 million or 30% of the entire backing amount at the time had been siezed by authorities for being the proceeds of money laundering. It was all held by CryptoCapital, give them a quick Google lol.<p>We said it wasn&#x27;t backed by dollars, they admitted it wasn&#x27;t backed by dollars and instead crypto and swaps, and other ious. We said you couldn&#x27;t redeem them, you can&#x27;t. We said they didn&#x27;t have a banking relationship, they don&#x27;t and didn&#x27;t. Crypto advocates keep pretending none of this is real because number go up.<p>The fact it&#x27;s still around doesn&#x27;t invalidate a single thing anyone&#x27;s said and if anything time showed this all to be quite accurate.')
