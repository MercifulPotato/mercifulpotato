Normally goes on for about 90 minutes and this seems to keep us generally on the same page. This is our only real &#x27;scheduled&#x27; meeting, other ad-hoc ones can happen but its not all that often.<p>Beyond that we rely on slack. We have a channel for things we want to celebrate, where we can all share on the wins. We also have department specific channels for general updates on things others should probably know for that topic. Sales, Marketing, Engineering, etc. We try to keep the general chit chat out of those so there isnt too much noise. If something goes back and forth a bunch of times we just start a zoom chat and people who want to jump in will do.<p>Then we have the smaller group DMs that are just the people we&#x27;d normally chit chat with as the day goes on. As long as you get your notifications set right so its not bing bong-ing all day then it can be nice to chat sh*t with each other sporadically throughout the day.')
