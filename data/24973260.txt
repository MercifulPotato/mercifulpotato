Inequality isn&#x27;t caused because people produce proportionally more or less. The very wealthy generally own property that has appreciated in value, or have inherited it. Among working people, the differences fundamentally come from labor markets, not our productivity. An engineer might make more or less than someone else on their team, but they both make multitudes more than the people assembling beams for an apartment building.<p>You should totally enjoy the freedom to be a productive member of society, that&#x27;s not where inequality originates.')
