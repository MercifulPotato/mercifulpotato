Steinberg is just saying that a <i>single</i> particle alone cannot generate a causality paradox. But it still isn&#x27;t obvious why you couldn&#x27;t use this effect with multiple bits and some error correct to send signals faster than light.<p>Looking at the paper being discussed here - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iopscience.iop.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1088&#x2F;1367-2630&#x2F;abb515&#x2F;meta" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iopscience.iop.org&#x2F;article&#x2F;10.1088&#x2F;1367-2630&#x2F;abb515&#x2F;...</a> - the authors also don&#x27;t seem to have an explanation.<p><i>One final caveat worth noting is that our results do not definitively prove that an ensemble of free particles will always be a preferable method of transmitting a signal to an ensemble of tunneled particles. It is our intention to include a discussion of this in a follow-up paper.</i><p>This is basically the scenario you&#x27;re talking about, forming several bits out of different particles and using them in conjunction to send information faster than light. The researchers aren&#x27;t sure why this wouldn&#x27;t happen in their model.')
