Item(by='Benjammer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607108255, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25305612, text='If I look back at the company I was thinking of when I wrote that, the &quot;top half&quot; of the people there are VPs&#x2F;MDs in fintech, staff engineers at companies like Twitter, ~2-3 mildly successful founders, CTOs at startups, and several have one-person-consulting-shop lifestyle businesses. The other half are mostly engineering managers at (boring, non-FAANG) larger companies. I&#x27;ve bounced around doing greenfield projects &#x2F; new products at several B2B companies. I just find interesting projects I want to work on and then leave after a few years once the politics become overwhelming for me.<p>Our recruiting&#x2F;interviewing process would be criticized nowadays as completely bias-ridden. We sent teams of just-graduated first-year people back to their school&#x27;s career fairs, built relationships with career offices at those schools, and just basically would have people walk around and be outgoing and try to just chat with interesting students and see if they wanted to join a cool tech company in NYC with cool people. Our interviews were mostly gut-feel after talking to someone about whatever and doing a very simple many-to-many-linking-table exercise to see if they could visualize simple data relations in their head. We didn&#x27;t even test coding skills, for the most part.<p>I dunno if it would surprise anyone, but those teams actually were, by far, the most diverse teams I&#x27;ve worked on in my career in terms of age, gender, and race (not to mention socio-eco background). We invested heavily in training people on the job and building culture together internally. We ended up being merged into a larger entity by our parent company and the culture was utterly demolished, and everyone quit around the same time.<p>I just don&#x27;t see what context would attract these sorts of people back together at a tech company nowadays. If you find something that isn&#x27;t a startup founded by rich brats trying to completely fleece slightly-above-average engineers in secondary-market cities with 10-yr-old market rate salaries, and isn&#x27;t a big tech company ruining society, completely driven by political-insider-donors-- ahem, sorry, I mean <i>investors</i> -- please let me know also!')
