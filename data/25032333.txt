Item(by='nvrspyx', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604908398, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25031263, text='&gt; The people who argue that Apple should be forced to allow third party stores are only interested in the potential commercial gain they could make if they had access to Appleâ€™s customers.\n&gt; They just want access to the customers so they can make money out of them.\n&gt; That is all this argument is about and all it has ever been about.<p>And this is not an accurate representation of reality. I have zero professional or financial connection to software development, but I want Apple to allow third-party stores or at least third-party installs so <i>I can do the things on my phone that I want to</i> that Apple says no to. I want to play games on an emulator, I want to stream video games (e.g. xCloud) without downloading individual wrapper apps for each game or attempting to play through Safari, I want to use proper browser engines other than Safari and hopefully have proper uncrippled PWA support, I want to run interpreters&#x2F;compilers&#x2F;shells like iSH, I want to play adult games, etc.')
