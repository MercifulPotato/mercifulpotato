The only people who actually know if they&#x27;re authentic or not are Hunter Biden, the sender, and anyone who has the emails. Which, incidentally, includes the NYP, who could mathematically prove their authenticity instantly by simply publishing them in the raw. In fact, if the NYP did any due diligence at all, they already verified the emails themselves. Which raises the question: why are they publishing just the images?<p>My bet is that the NYP didn&#x27;t bother to verify the emails, because they don&#x27;t even know how to do basic due diligence on these types of things. (I would guess they&#x27;re authentic though, FWIW.)')
