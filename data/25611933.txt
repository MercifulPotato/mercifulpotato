I had an powerpc iBook (G4) and a x86 desktop (Pentium4). The desktop helped compile software on the iBook using distcc and a cross-compiler. It did work pretty well. I also used ccache in addition to that to cache build output. That was probably around 2005 when most (all?) cpus were still single-core.')
