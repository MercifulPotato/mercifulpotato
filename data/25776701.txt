A classic example of this is the recent George Floyd protests in the US:<p>All of a sudden, all over Europe, virtue signalling folks were going on BLM marches vandalising statues etc. Now, we may have had our problems in the past but, here in most of Europe, the kind of nasty emdemic racism that seems all too prevalent in the US barely exists any more. It&#x27;s largely been consigned to that handy receptacle &#x27;the dustbin of history&#x27;.<p>But, here we were, all of a sudden stirring up division and conflict in our own societies because <i>&quot;If the USA is nasty and racist then we must be nasty and racist too!&quot;</i>  And, of course, the media were falling over themselves to unearth black celebrities to recount the traumatic tale of how, sometime between earning their fifth and tenth million, someone once looked at them in a funny way in a supermarket.<p>I just can&#x27;t understand why the almost total domination by the US of European cultural and political life is a complete non-issue here. Why are Silicon Valley hipsters deciding on the acceptable parameters of discourse in London, Paris, Berlin, Rome... etc?')
