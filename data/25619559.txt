Not because of any NDA, just that I don&#x27;t know. I wasn&#x27;t involved with the workstation team at Pixar (or ILM at all); I was part of the Network and Server Admin [NSA] team, specifically focused on OpenShift. There are a lot of tools that Pixar use that I don&#x27;t have the full picture of how they work together.<p>Here at Blue Sky we are in our infancy for thin client based work. Remote terminals aren&#x27;t too new as they were used for contract workers and artists who needed to WFH on the prior show, but we don&#x27;t have VDI as we still use deskside workstations. For COVID, the workstations have been retrofitted with Teradici remote workstation hostcards and we send the artists home with a VPN client and zero client, utilizing direct connect. It was enough to get us going, but we have a long road ahead in optimizing this stack and eventually (if our datacenters can handle it) switching over to VDI.')
