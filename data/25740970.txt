Like Haskell, Erlang, Lisp variants.<p>It requires a lot of effort to learn, development tools are scarce, and you can&#x27;t easily hire a new worker simply because it&#x27;s minor.<p>Eventually, original developer left the company for one way or other, leaving a code and half baked documents only the early developer fully understand. Good luck maintaining those software. You can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s either abandoned or replaced.')
