The sidebar recommendations are another discussion -- those are possibly more pernicious but at least not as obviously dysfunctional.<p>How is it possible to have the largest repository of video content in the world, yet Youtube is only able to recommend me the same videos over and over again (half of which I seen already or quickly clicked out of). There is also a simplistic list of recommended categories, which I would change if I could, and those never change either.<p>If the front page were just completely random, it would be better than it is now. If I could actually tell Youtube to show me videos with a low-to-moderate view count and a high upvote ratio, then that would be fabulous and I probably would encounter new subjects and ideas rather than getting stuck watching the same garbage over and over. I&#x27;ll never let my future children spend even a second on Youtube, because the stuff that it recommends to kids is so asinine that it just makes me mad.<p>I really believe that collectively we are all much dumber because of the Youtube&#x27;s pathetically bad algorithms.')
