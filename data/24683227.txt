What&#x27;s the point to change it now? Why it hurts anyone?<p>Diversity should never mean race-color-gender-equality in the end. You have to earn it, isn&#x27;t that what American standing for?<p>Why do you need AA students to Harvard because their skin is darker, or someone&#x27;s parents did drug or jail time so their kids went through some hardship so they have to be put into the best college and hard-working students paying the price for that? There are many other schools for them to attend, put them where they are not ready to compete is hurting more than helping.<p>This country is so fxxxxx up by those liberals.<p>The key reason is the population ratio changed, when those &#x27;disadvantaged&#x27; people become more and more, they change rules to game the system instead of working hard to earn what they wanted for so long.<p>This is essentially a revolution by the gang under the name of democracy.')
