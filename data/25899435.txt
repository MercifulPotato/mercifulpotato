It changed my life.<p>You can find a clinic that will take you for $50 or so. It&#x27;s not the cheapest of options, but it&#x27;s the single most impactful choice you can make in your situation. If you adhere to your schedule, and if your brain chemistry matches my own (which it might not), you&#x27;ll start to be &quot;evened out&quot; after 30 days.<p>You have to take the pill every single day though, without exception. I almost didn&#x27;t realize the Prozac was effective at all, because the first time I tried it, I was inconsistent.<p>People seem to hate this advice and reply aggressively each time I give it, but the moment I see &quot;clinical depression&quot; I will continue to give it. If the doctor notices any problems, they will take care of it.')
