IIRC you could just enter the phone in fb search and it would spit out the name + fb link even for private profiles.<p>Someone I knew scanned down a whole country&#x27;s numbers in a couple of months (there was some rate limiting and that&#x27;s about it) - and that guy just did it for fun. I&#x27;m sure there were plenty of shady companies doing the same thing.<p>After a while FB started cracking down on this. They even admitted they knew about it for years. Can&#x27;t find a link but IIRC that was 4-5 years ago.')
