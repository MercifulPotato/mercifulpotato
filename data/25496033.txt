Concern, perhaps, but not panic.<p>There are a truckload of confounding factors in the middle, including potential &quot;founder effects&quot; (when a variant becomes dominant because it is the first to take hold, and just outruns the others out of larger starting numbers).<p>There is not yet solid proof of &quot;70% more transmissible&quot; given that all the data there are is the SAGE meeting minutes. We don&#x27;t know from where the data came from, and how the estimations were made. There are huge uncertainties.<p>Until the biological analyses are done, one needs to keep their cool. Sadly, that wasn&#x27;t what the UK government did.')
