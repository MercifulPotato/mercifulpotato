I&#x27;m not trying to &quot;gotcha&quot; here, and I&#x27;m sure the parent post to that was unpleasant and tedious, but I am hoping you&#x27;ll consider that you might be doing some of the same thing you&#x27;re upset about others doing. Describing anyone as &quot;the socially doomed&quot; to me indicates an attachment to the idea of mainstream social mores as &quot;right&quot;. The most socially awkward people I know also happen to have the most friends.<p>fwiw, the trick I&#x27;ve found for enjoying hn comments is to ignore the pedantic, argumentative ones, and find the nuggets of joy and wisdom. Not saying I always manage to do that either, but... that&#x27;s the only time I enjoy reading the comments.')
