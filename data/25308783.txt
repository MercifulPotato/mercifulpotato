Yep, like every single programming language out there.<p>But here&#x27;s the good thing: I have applied SOLID principle thanks tto Symfony and Laravel, which is (at least to me): hide the ugly parts behind a friendlier code base and deal with your newly designed interface.<p>Not only it makes your code clearer, it makes it extremely easy to follow your logic, plus it motivates you to write more projects just for fun.<p>About WordPress...yeah, it has its countless quirks, but trust me; it&#x27;s getting there.<p>Eventually, it will become a nicer platform for the end-user, especially now that adopts more JavaScript in both back and front end.<p>All the legacy code is getting upgraded slowly but steady with modern PHP standards, even Composer is being used at some code bases now, plus with modern tools we automate lots of procedures that used to be considered chore.<p>Now about writing code that can deal with high traffic...you can do that with modern PHP, yes, but you have an extra option nowadays: Swoole!<p>If Baidu and other Chinese companies are using PHP exclusively, they deal with <i>MILLIONS</i> of people on a daily basis, and contribute back in the language itself (core &#x2F; swoole extension), what else do you want?!<p>Is it dead?<p>Not even close, especially now with the release of PHP 8.0 that gets closer to enterprise standards!')
