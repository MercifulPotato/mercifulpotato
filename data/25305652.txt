This is the hardest one but all the 5 people MUST share your vision for the company and product&#x2F;service. If they don&#x27;t, you may still be ok but will be a long ride for you alone because they will just be employees who want to clock out at 5 PM. Again, nothing wrong overall but first 5 people should have more skin the game and must have that attitude. You also need to try and compensate them the best way possible.<p>2. I would look for behavior more than skills. Hear me out. I know that skills are needed but to build a company, you need people who have the correct attitude and mindset. Look for curious, always looking to learn, hungry to achieve something type people who don&#x27;t need to be always told what to do. Again, you have to compensate them as well as possible. Skills can be learned but attitude&#x2F;temperament&#x2F;ambitions cannot be.<p>3. Kinda contradictory to #2, but 1 Person should be very skilled&#x2F;experienced at the product&#x2F;service&#x2F;business domain. If that is only you, it&#x27;s fine to start but need 1 more. But again, 1 person other than you at start is fine.<p>4. Look for previous track record. Just because someone says they are very ambitious doesn&#x27;t mean anything. Ask open ended questions. Instead of asking &quot;so do you learn using youtube&quot;, ask &quot;what do you do when you cannot figure something out on your own&quot; type questions. Look at their body language and how they go about solving problems.<p>5. People who care about Titles are usually not a good fit for early employees&#x2F;partners. If prestige is important to them, they can be an employee some day but ideally not the first 5 hire.<p>Source: Bootstrapped founder for 6+ years who has done terrible overall in finding the top 5 people based on what I wrote (but I learned the hard way) but still made it to a team of 15+ and counting.')
