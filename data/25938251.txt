Item(by='patcon', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611808807, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25913407, text='&gt; This feels like splitting hairs though.<p>Respectfully, it doesn&#x27;t feel like splitting hairs to me... but quite a significant frame-shift. (Defensive credentializing: I&#x27;m a former biochemist and now technologist and event facilitator, with a fascination for the always-evolving fields of social physics &amp; complexity science.)<p>I&#x27;m increasingly a believer in something called the Leiden Theory of Language, or Symbiosism: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;316665359_Symbiosism_Symbiomism_and_the_perils_of_memetic_management" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;316665359_Symbiosis...</a><p>This theory proposes that language is a separate strata of organism&#x2F;information that co-evolved with the host biology of the human mind. i.e. We&#x27;re unique not because we&#x27;re simply &quot;the smartest biology&quot;, but rather, we&#x27;re more like a cyborg of two organisms, one biological and one semiotic. As a assemblage, we have vastly overrepresented dominance of the semiotic organism compared to other creatures who host very primitive semiotic organisms.<p>In this frame, humans can be conceptualized as individuals, but alternatively as simply hosts to the mind, which functions as the replication machinery of the larger social organism that takes shape between minds in the strata above (organizations, nations, culture).<p>I&#x27;m still chewing on all this stuff, mind you :) And thank you for the recommendation -- I really need to pick up that book!')
