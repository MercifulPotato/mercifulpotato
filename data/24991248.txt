Not to mention the bifurcation of resources to keep the monolith happening for customers using it while the microservice mess is being created.<p>There is almost a zealot-like-brainwashing that has happened to folks. I made case after case to our engineering team &quot;This doesn&#x27;t solve our business use cases. We&#x27;re prematurely scaling. We&#x27;re unable to move code into production efficiently. This is very hard to understand for outsiders joining our team.&quot; --- All fell on deaf ears since I &quot;didn&#x27;t get it.&quot; When I put a hard stop on adding any more microservices without a use scale for why we need that scale, I was called &quot;toxic.&quot;<p>In the end we fired the whole team since they wouldn&#x27;t buy into destroying their microservice dream world for something practical and put everything back in the monolith except for one service.<p>Our amazon bill is 1&#x2F;8th what it was. Security auditing&#x2F;upkeep is 1&#x2F;100th what it once was. Deploys are done without fanfare more than 1x&#x2F;week. Our average response time is down from 500ms to less than 100ms since we aren&#x27;t hop-scotching services all over God&#x27;s green earth.<p>Note: This isn&#x27;t a tiny project. 200k users, 700-1000 requests&#x2F;minute during peak times, lots of data moving through this.')
