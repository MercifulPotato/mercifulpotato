I gravitated toward consulting because it allows me the freedom to make my own accommodations. I have actually worked for huge consulting companies and currently work for a mid-size one. I also don’t drink caffeine or alcohol on account of said bipolar.<p>I don’t come out and say that I’m bipolar, but I do make it known that I have chronic mental health stuff that I need space to deal with sometimes. I also have hypomanic periods where I’m incredibly productive, and I think that helps smooth over relations with co-workers and bosses because when I’m good, I’m <i>really</i> good. When I’m bad I need space to sort it out and clear expectations of what I need to get done from a work standpoint.<p>Consulting works well because you kind of manage your own time, work is delivered in teams (at least in my world,) and if you can manage your client relationships well it smooths over a lot of bumps. If you work for a good company that gives you space to be a flawed human, you can make it work.<p>The pandemic has actually helped quite a lot; I no longer have pressure to go hang out with a bunch of people drinking when all I want to do is sleep. As long as I show up to meetings and communicate about what I can and can’t do it works out for me.')
