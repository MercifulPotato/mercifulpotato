Paying for Youtube Premium doesn&#x27;t give you a right to download whatever videos you want, since that right has to be granted by the copyright owners of the videos.<p>If you purchased a movie, presumably this included the rights to watch it offline (and most of the movie lockers like Vudu, etc, generally include such rights), then the selling website generally makes available copies for offline viewing (and many Blurays include codes to activate on movie locker service to get a license for a digital copy). In such case, you would need to use that service for downloading the offline copy, because the Youtube copy isn&#x27;t part of that license to you.')
