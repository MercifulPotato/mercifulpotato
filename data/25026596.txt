Item(by='cassepipe', descendants=None, kids=[25027102], score=None, time=1604851374, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25025924, text='&quot;to condemn Antifa&quot;\nAntifa is a construct from Fox News to designate a broad category of mostly young people that range from anarchists calling for direct democracy to people who are against racism and intolerance that have in common that they are not against clashing with police forces. So condemning Antifa does not make much sense. Maybe he could have condemned violence in the protests but anyone who has been in a demonstration knows elements in both the protesters and the police are looking for the clash. But the police always has the upper hand and violently crush what is mostly damage to property. Just tell me how many people have been killed by so called &quot;Antifa&quot;? Is that comparable to the number of people that have been killed by right-wing activists? Why is it always the progressive leaders that get shot? Right wing activists always say they are here to &quot;defend&quot; against something but they are the one attacking.')
