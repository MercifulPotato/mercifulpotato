It&#x27;s not possible in some failure cases.<p>If your acknowledgement of a message gets lost (because either server involved or the pipes in-between fail) you&#x27;ve processed the message already but the queue server will think you haven&#x27;t. It either has to resend it (duplicate delivery) or it ignores acknowledgements all together (drops messages that it sent you, but you didn&#x27;t process - maybe because your server failed.) So the choice when there is a failure in the system is between at least once or at most once - exactly once cannot be guaranteed.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any way around that predicament.')
