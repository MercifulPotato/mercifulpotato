Why does the government have the right to claim authority over privately owned infrastructure? Why now, and if NN is so essential, why did the internet have so little trouble developing over the past 2 decades?<p>I can’t answer these. I’d like to see someone attempt it, because I’ve been lambasted on this site for saying a version of what you’ve very cleanly stated.<p>It’s like everyone has forgotten the cute “save the internet” banners on the bug sites that loaded like 56k dialup progressive pngs did. No, that hasn’t happened at all.<p>If I was to make a piss poor attempt at your question, I would probably say that over the last two decades the scale of services didn’t increase so sharply, so what worked then might not work now... but it’s a halfhearted argument.')
