[1] Ones that are so deeply ingrained in our society, that we don&#x27;t even notice them?<p>If we were to apply your rubric, that would make arguments between people from different cultures completely unproductive - with each person hailing from each culture being able to dismiss the other&#x27;s out of hand.<p>The argument you are dismissing as brainwashing seems pretty straightforward to me. It&#x27;s entirely possible, even reasonable for economic stability to be a goal worth pursuing for government. You may find it anathema, but that viewpoint isn&#x27;t particularly privileged, in the global space of ideas.<p>[1] That&#x27;s a rhetorical question - of course we do. They are incredibly obvious to anyone who&#x27;s lived in a few different countries.')
