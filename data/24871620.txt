Since dynamic variables are implementable on top of lexical variables and `finally`, it&#x27;s basically just about unwinding the stack and `finally`.<p>The main issue is how a condition system would fit with any existing system which likely works by immediately unwinding the stack rather than allowing to wind it further; that&#x27;s the case e.g. in Java or C++.')
