If you are healthy, it doesn&#x27;t really matter either way; unless you are involved in a serious accident or something, your interactions with the health system are infrequent and relatively simple.<p>I have, among other things, asthma. I&#x27;m a 1099 contractor; I buy my own health insurance. Prior to the ACA, which people keep threatening to revoke, I <i>could not buy</i> insurance that covered my asthma. I tried. I shopped around a lot. The same company that provided complete coverage at a previous employer had a pre-existing condition rider on the <i>same policy</i>.<p>After the ACA, my policy now covers my pre-existing condition (Yay!), but I&#x27;m paying $750 or so per month for it. If I could not afford $750&#x2F;month, my options would be considerably narrowed. (And that&#x27;s before the prescriptions for my pre-existing condition.)<p>Yes, I go in, I get treated. But my situation demands a pretty hefty bill anyway, or potentially a very large bill. Possibly enough to make me consider not going to get treatment.')
