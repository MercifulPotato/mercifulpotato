Maybe in very specific conditions and never viewed zoomed in or bigger than Instagram sized, they’ll do.<p>I sync my camera photos to my Photos library along side phone pictures and whenever I’m flipping through to share something with a friend, they always notice and comment, “You took those on your phone!?” The difference is still huge.')
