However, wind and solar definitely have less of the land use issues that biofuels have.<p>The farms for biofuels are typically mono cultures, which is going to involve pesticide use and commonly fertilization. Both of which have some significant downstream effects that the world is trying to deal with right now (see the deadzones in many river estuaries, possible insect decline, etc).<p>Hydro is looked at less and less as a green energy solution because of the significant damage done to river&#x2F;ocean systems (elwha river restoration, possible klamath river undamming). I don&#x27;t think there will be any more large dams added to rivers that aren&#x27;t already dammed in North America.<p>I&#x27;m also not a huge fan of utility scale solar. I understand that it is currently moving the needle significantly since the infrastructure costs are cheaper than residential solar, but there are so many added benefits of residential solar (reduced urban heat islands, no additional land used) that I see it as the main way forwards. I think that the solar power split that we&#x27;ll eventually end up with is something like 40% residential solar, 60% utility as panels get more efficient.')
