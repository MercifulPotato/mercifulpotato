Item(by='rualca', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609276612, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25570831, text='&gt; Iâ€™ve seen an industry-wide trend toward using standard programming languages with those things (Pulumi, CDK, et al).<p>I can&#x27;t really talk about Pulumi, but CDK is just a high-level CloudFormation generator, and arguably one whose only usecase is to serve as an ad-hoc template engine, much like SAM.<p>CDK is currently one of 3 or 4 offerings from Amazon that handle the same usecase, thus it&#x27;s strange that you decided to refer to it as an industry trend when at most is a cherry-picked example.<p>Meanwhile, should we ignore how the entire industry, from Kubernetes to Docker Swarm and passing through Ansible and Chef and whatever other tools, runs on tools that use domain-specific languages?<p>&gt; Gradle seems to be an interesting case of a successful build system (...)<p>...yet it&#x27;s market share is completely eclipsed by the dominant tool, Maven, in spite of Android&#x27;s push.')
