Item(by='arminiusreturns', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604421084, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24979536, text='If you are referring to the lack tight coupling being the ability to remove journald, time sync, etc, then you are correct. I should have been more clear I was talking about systemd as a whole, and not just those other subsystems, but I&#x27;ll assume you meant the latter, in which case, yeah, it&#x27;s possible to stop using lots of the systemd subsystems without too much pain (which I have done quite frequently, and found great stability improvements.) To be frank, I just really don&#x27;t like the handwaiving away of valid criticisms people have (on any topic), with such dismissive language as &quot;People keep saying ... but never supply any proof for that.&quot; This to me reeks of intellectual dishonesty, but again, that was my response because I probably misunderstood you to say that about systemd as a whole instead of how you meant it which was focused on gp&#x27;s comment about subsystems.<p>One note: many people pretend sysv init has been dead and left behind, but I&#x27;ve seen production systems in major places still using it (not just embedded either). It&#x27;s not nearly as dead as people might like to think.')
