The militia had been heavily encouraged by multiple undercover FBI agents-provocateur who themselves were integral in engineering the plot - and it&#x27;s really unclear whether the militia would have even considering doing such a thing without these agents egging them on and offering to provide explosives.<p>If the British Empire had the technology and infrastructure of today&#x27;s intelligence agencies, the founding fathers would have been arrested as terrorists before they could get 10 people in a room together.  There would have been some undercover agent of the Crown showing up to meetings trying to convince George Washington that they needed to go kill the king - and history would remember them all as nothing more than evil terrorists justly apprehended for plotting violence against the state.')
