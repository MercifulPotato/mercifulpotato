This is what I used roadmaps for as a PM for a decade, but it was driven home after talking to hundreds of PMs after founding my fourth company[1] and coaching PMs and product&#x2F;dev teams to level up for another decade[2].<p>The real roadmap trap in my experience is that the org takes a roadmap as a promise of when specific things will be delivered. The best approach to avoid this is to not do roadmaps. But that’s also unrealistic for most orgs. The next best approach is to show the org short-term work that will definitely get done, and caveat the heck out of anything longer term.  I’ll happily commit to 6-8 weeks out, tentatively commit to 10-20 weeks, and add large asterisks to anything longer than that.<p>1- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.savio.io" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.savio.io</a><p>2- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.Reemer.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.Reemer.com</a>')
