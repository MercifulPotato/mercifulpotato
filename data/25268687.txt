You still have to set it all up and maintain it, its just different setup and maintenance than if you actually have a servers in DCs.  Most people still have the learning curve with AWS and usually do it incorrectly, or have to wait for Amazon to admit degradation of a service is occurring.<p>It&#x27;s really a matter of who within the company wants to know whats behind the curtain.
