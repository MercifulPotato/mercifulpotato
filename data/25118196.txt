Godel&#x27;s Completeness Theorem (which applies to many systems that Godel&#x27;s Incompleteness Theorem also applies to) shows that in a sense semantic properties coincide with syntactic properties and so in fact can exactly be inferred from syntactic properties.<p>What instead Godel&#x27;s Incompleteness Theorems show is that you cannot exhaustively list <i>all</i> the semantic properties of what you care about, but combined with Godel&#x27;s Completeness Theorems, only the ones &quot;relevant&quot; to your syntactic axioms.')
