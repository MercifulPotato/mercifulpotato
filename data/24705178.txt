This is the real problem imo:<p><i>Tesla was trying out a new product for the underlay and it didnâ€™t conduct proper testing first as Stacey would later find out.</i><p>How do they not extensively test these types of things? It&#x27;s not like software where you can just roll back a bad change, they caused expensive damage because they were beta testing on a customer&#x27;s house. This seems to be a common pattern with Tesla, and is part of the appeal - it can be really cool to feel like your car (or roof) is on the cutting edge of the new technology. But it causes cases like this where the update didn&#x27;t work out and wasn&#x27;t properly tested.<p>Tesla really needs to up their roof game, a couple huge problems recently.')
