While Intel does artificially separate &quot;enterprise&quot; and &quot;consumer&quot; parts, there&#x27;s still a bit of difference between SuperMicro boards with ECC, LOM features, and data center quality PSUs and the off the shelf consumer stuff Google was using for a while.<p>I don&#x27;t know if AMD really intended to break Intel&#x27;s pricing model. Their higher end Ryzen chips you&#x27;d use in servers and capital W Workstations don&#x27;t seem to have a huge price difference from equivalent Xeons. Even if they&#x27;re a bit cheaper you still need a motherboard that supports ECC so it seems at first glance to be a wash as far as price.<p>That being said if I was putting together a machine today it would be Ryzen-based with ECC.')
