In practice, I&#x27;m extremely happy that the Supreme Court doesn&#x27;t allow slavery and that they consider gay marriage to be a human right, that elective abortion is also a human right etc. But, as happy as I am that these are accepted as fundamental human rights, as I think they should be, I don&#x27;t understand what the point of the constitution really is in this place.')
