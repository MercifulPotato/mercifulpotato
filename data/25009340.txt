Item(by='modi15', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604683761, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25005305, text='&gt; Tip for acquirers: when a startup turns you down, consider raising your offer, because there&#x27;s a good chance the outrageous price they want will later seem a bargain.<p>This isnt accurate at all. Google&#x2F;Facebook turned down the offers because at the time the offers came, they were &#x27;feeling&#x27; good about their business. This feeling changes over time and had google not chanced on the business model of selling ads next to search results, they would have probably regretted not selling earliers.<p>No one at Google&#x2F;Facebook knew that the companies would be as big as they became and most startups who say to an acquisition face failure exactly like the 99% of other startups, sooner or later.')
