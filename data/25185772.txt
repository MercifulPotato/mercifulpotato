This has some limitations, most notably x86 VMs are not possible.<p>From my POV, the future of business laptops could be such powerful ARM macs around 1000-1300$ (i.e. quite low priced) coupled with cloud based Windows 10 instances to get all software running. This would then create some pressure on software developers to port over their software at least to Windows-on-ARM which could feasibly run in a local VM.')
