That would be the argument for choosing to install apps through Apple&#x27;s store, not for Apple preventing you from choosing to install apps through a competing store.<p>Because then it&#x27;s not Apple vs. literally every random shady garbage app, it&#x27;s Apple vs. some specific alternative store that you might very well trust more than Apple to be acting in your interest, e.g. F-Droid.')
