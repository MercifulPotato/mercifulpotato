These are all essentially non-performance features of the chips that need to be developed to bring them up to feature parity with the Intel chips.<p>This generation happens to have carefully bypassed the need for those features, a smart move by Apple for the first release, but later releases for the higher end MacBook Pros, the iMac&#x2F;iMac Pro, and the Mac Pro, will need most&#x2F;all of these features, and those will likely take significant time to work into their architecture.')
