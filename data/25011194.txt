Item(by='AnimalMuppet', descendants=None, kids=[25013717, 25012678, 25011439], score=None, time=1604697031, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25008936, text='&gt; My strong belief is that programming languages research does not value usability because there currently is no satisfying, agreed-upon way of evaluating it.<p>This is talking about usability <i>of the programming language</i> - or of a language that incorporates whatever conclusions the research reaches.  This matches something I&#x27;ve been thinking a lot lately, that software engineering is a different animal than computer science.  If your PL advance is the greatest CS thing since sliced bread, but it isn&#x27;t usable for actual programmers working to write programs, then... who cares?<p>The ergonomics of computer languages is not what computer scientists think it is.  CS types complain about how stupid the field is to use languages that don&#x27;t reflect the best CS research.  The reality is, the CS researchers are too ignorant to grasp what actually makes languages useful in the field.')
