Even in areas that they seem to have coverage. They have PJM covering the Mid Atlantic region, but none of the actual local companies doing it. Dominion Energy has ~1.5GW of Solar in VA alone. But doesn&#x27;t seem they take it into account. I am sure this is because Dominion doesn&#x27;t offer the numbers, but it seems like there is incomplete coverage in areas they are showing coverage for.')
