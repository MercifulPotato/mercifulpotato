Finally get your print, and walk a minute back. Say it takes 10 minutes total.<p>Meanwhile I just press print and in less than 10s my printout is on my desk.<p>I can see why some people donâ€™t need a printer, but I need one often enough that walking to the conbini and doing that dance is a major PITA.')
