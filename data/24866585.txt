I catch their algorithms making mistakes sometimes. I catch them doing something sneaky sometimes (Lyft more than Uber.) I have some ideas on how to make it work better. I&#x27;ve done 2000 rides and picked up some really interesting people. I like to go to different cities and try them out. It&#x27;s fun. If my enthusiasm makes me a shill, then so be it.')
