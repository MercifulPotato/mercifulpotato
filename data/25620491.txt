They&#x27;re computers in fact and in the marketing copy, yet Apple exerts monopoly power[1] to capriciously decide what may run on the device that I bought, paying upwards of<i>a thousand dollars</i> for[2].<p>[1] in terms of app revenue iOS is dominant. Apple is able to dictate usurious and abusive terms and vendors are effectively forced to capitulate due to the size of the market they control.<p>[2] I don&#x27;t actually have an iPhone despite the superiority because of this, but couching it in third-person terms is awkward.')
