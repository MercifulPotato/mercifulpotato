It will encourage socialism, or it will destroy freedom, or it will encourage censorship! (Etc. Etc). Come on, just stating a boogieman doesn&#x27;t help anyone&#x27;s point of view.<p>No offense to you personally, but a one sentence assertion is not an argument I&#x27;ll take seriously. Your contribution to this discussion so far has been less than mine. How about you elaborate your points a bit more?<p>------<p>But whatever, I&#x27;ll mirror you, so you see how stupid this gets if you just do one sentence assertions of boogiemen.<p>Your point of view will destroy democracy.<p>Ball is in your court now. Figure out a way to elevate the discussion. I&#x27;m not doing the heavy lifting unless I see some work from you as well.')
