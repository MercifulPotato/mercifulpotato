It says that we can want things we don’t like. It implies there is a paradox, but I don’t think there is.<p>Wanting is in the future. Liking is in the present. Wanting is the belief that I will like something.<p>The question unanswered by the article is, if I want something that I later don’t like, what do I believe at the time of wanting? Do I believe I will like it? Might like it?  Hope I will like it?<p>That’s what addiction is to me. It is the irrational hope that I will like what I want, even if I know in my heart that I won’t.')
