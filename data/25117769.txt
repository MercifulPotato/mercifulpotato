Lockdowns aren&#x27;t an agenda on their own - it&#x27;s because of the virus, which exists whether you do a lockdown or not. I guess people believe that the virus is nothing to be scared of, and so then they believe that people fearmonger to whip up support for a lockdown, but this belief makes zero sense to me - why would anyone be in favor of a lockdown if the virus <i>isn&#x27;t</i> dangerous?')
