I only remember one or two times that people were denied (they were misbehaving).<p>There was one time a kid got denied wrongfully because the teacher thought he was part of a group that was causing trouble right before that. He had a half-empty Gatorade bottle in his backpack from lunch... he was sitting in the back of class and chugged it while the teacher wasn&#x27;t looking. He then refilled it with a different yellow liquid, if you know what I mean. I&#x27;m a bit surprised the teacher didn&#x27;t catch him and that nobody freaked out and snitched.')
