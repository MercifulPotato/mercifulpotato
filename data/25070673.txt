They’re confronted with a problem and need to solve it, and solving it requires choosing and learning how to use a tool. If you have plenty of free time, choosing C#, Swift, and Java seem like odd choices for a pedagogic programming language. For learning about type safety, spending a couple weeks playing with SML or Haskell would be a good idea, though they’re both functional.<p>As a student I constantly complained that we were being taught these useless languages. As a grownup I realize that while some of the Comp Sci faculty may’ve been out of touch, their goal was not teaching us commercially viable skills. They were endeavoring to teach us how to think. Once you know how to think you can express those thoughts in nearly any language, no matter how hostile to those thoughts it may be.<p>But maybe you just want to get things done, and if that’s so, the answer for data problems is basically one or more of R, Python, Julia, etc.')
