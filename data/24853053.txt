Item(by='tmpz22', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603320253, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24852799, text='&gt; Imagine being invested in some story and only receiving 8-10 min of it every week<p>I agree with all your points except this one. Rick and Morty is essentially 20 minute episodes released weekly, after commercials. If you took out long pauses, transitions, and other filling, I&#x27;m sure you could get it down to 15 minutes of punch.  I&#x27;d add a lot of video creators like game of zones, alt-shift-x, theinternethistorian, also fill the punch of 15-25 minute content released weekly&#x2F;monthly, are ravenously popular.<p>There is room for ~10-20 minute content but it may be harder to market&#x2F;monetize.')
