Honestly when I read his post that was the biggest read flag. That is the hardest part for a man.<p>When a man invest in love it is very hard for them to just walk away from it, to the extent many of them hold on to it, when the reality is it is long gone.<p>I will tell you some of the best advice I got when I was in that situation and all of them seemed like they sucked at the time.<p>The following is what my friends did for me when my ex-wife decided to leave:<p>My friend John told me, you don&#x27;t quit a job until you have another job that provides you income. His point was she has moved on, you are the only one stuck here.<p>My friend Tim at a club, Dude that girl is all over you and you look like a dead fish, you are letting her (the ex) memory make you a shitty date for this girl, who by the way looks much better than she ever did. So you, who have the power over this date is letting her in on your date and ruining it, oh and by the way isn&#x27;t se banging another guy. He then went on to explain to me that her date was probably doing just fine.<p>My buddy Joe-Joe who would invite 10 or so girls over for a pool party at our house, every weekend. Who was nice enough to never try and push me, he just knew providing a fun environment, would bring me out of my shell sooner.<p>But it was finally my buddy Andy that snapped me out of it, by basically showing me, and giving me a tough love talk about the fact that she had moved on.<p>I wasted months moping and whining over a person that has moved on. In most of these cases, she has moved on, all of these guys seemed like jerks at the time, but they were my real friends, the one really working to free me from the chains that only I was in. This gentlemans best bet is to move on as fast as possible. She is not coming back and the funny part is the only way that she will try to come back is if he moves on.')
