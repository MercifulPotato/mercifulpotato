Exquisitely designed and thought out.<p>The animated series Primal by Genndy Tartakovsky. A pulpy cartoon without dialogue unlike anything else animated from the US.<p>The tv series Doom Patrol. Clever, revels in the absurd but still manages serious drama on what it means to not be completely human any more.<p>Philosophy in general. I&#x27;ve always seen it as academic wank, but i couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong. It gives you the ability to step back in a way that pure science cannot. Excellent tool to learn about yourself too.<p>On a more controversial note, I was initially put off by critical race theory (talking explicitly about race in academia? Putting blame on the prosperous west?), but I must say it makes a lot of sense.')
