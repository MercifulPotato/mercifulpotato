Thanks, but that&#x27;s not really what I&#x27;m getting at.<p>My complaint is that, if the language is supposed to be good for beginners, the workarounds should be unnecessary, since beginners are unlikely to a) be able to find proper workarounds, or b) even be aware that there&#x27;s a problem that a workaround would be needed to solve.<p>My son has no idea that invoking an un-initialized global variable immediately brings it into being with &#x27;nil&#x27; is weird behavior for a language. If a less experienced programmer was the one helping him learn, they might not realize it either.')
