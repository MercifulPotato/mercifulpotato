That seems a depressingly low bar for what you consider &quot;critical&quot;. If WhatsApp would disappear tomorrow, I think my social infrastructure would not suffer at all. I still have a smartphone with hundreds of other apps, including iMessage, SMS, and so on..<p>Besides that, I only consider real human interaction as critical.<p>&gt; Asking to leave WhatsApp is like cancelling your contract with your ISP and going offline just because you don&#x27;t like the company.<p>Sounds kind of depressing again. Not sure where you live, but most countries in the world have more than one ISP. I have switched ISP often in my lifetime. Never was it an issue, nor a massive burden and it has not caused me to go offline at all.')
