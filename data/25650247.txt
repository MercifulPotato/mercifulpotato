Some of the restrictions seem stupid. Although I also see how it was originally intended to prevent companies from keeping contractors like regular longterm employees but without benefits. Of course, that&#x27;s not much different from the current situation.<p>Our company doesn&#x27;t include contractors or consultants (both through vendors, never direct, like even typical contractors are brought in through a place like TCS) in our group activities. They also, have term limits of 3 years or less.')
