It&#x27;s possible for the advantages of restoring data to outweigh the societal cost of facilitating a criminal enterprise. For example, a patient has died in a hospital due to a ransomware attack. Would you prioritise saving human lives over sending some Bitcoin to some malware writer?<p>2. While there&#x27;s no guarantee, it is exceedingly demonstrated that if you pay the ransom, you will get your data back. Ransomware writers have a collective reputation to uphold (strange, huh), and a typical negotiation involves requesting decryption of a few files to prove this capability exists.<p>3. Parties can legally comply with law enforcement AND pay a ransom (see #1 and #2). When paid with bitcoin, it leaves a strong and permanent evidence trail, especially with Bitcoin de-mixing techniques discovered all the time.<p>4. The solution to your problem is mandatory and visible disclosure of security breaches, you do not need to criminalise paying ransoms to get here; nor does it achieve as much as a broad &quot;obligation to disclose&quot;.<p>5. By criminalising ransomware payments, the Justice Department has already made hundreds of corporations criminals. We know this Justice Department is known for selective prosecution: it is entirely plausible, if not likely, for companies against the current political party (e.g. donations to other candidates) to receive enhanced scrutiny and criminal charges.<p>Point 5 is not &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;: we know the Qwest CEO was arrested on selectively enforced &quot;insider trading&quot; charges because he refused to spy on his customers for the NSA.')
