Item(by='nathannecro', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604817917, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25023648, text='&gt;I am sure we are going to disagree on most public policy, including COVID Response...information was limited<p>Uh, I also didn&#x27;t talk about state vs federal responsibility regarding COVID. I merely pointed out that Germany (and pretty much every other developed country) was doing significantly better than the US. Sure, states have their own rights and their own mechanisms for doing their own things, but we are Americans. As our president, as our leader, as the highest officer in the land, it is his responsibility to take care of his people and Donald Trump did not do that.<p>Also, do you really believe that somewhere between 238k and 324k people (6) who have died due to COVID were mostly elderly people who were forced to live with other sick elderly people? Do you have reputable analysis that shows that this claim has any merit?<p>&gt;However none of that was the point of my comment, the claim was that only Republicans &#x2F; Trump Supporters are &quot;completely unable and often unwilling to consider any argument or information that conflicts with their views&quot;<p>I feel like the response to the OP was that looking to find a center was problematic fundamentally because one side (Trump and his band) are willing to constantly subvert ethical, moral, pro forma, and per se rules so you cannot treat them in a good-faith sort of way. I generally disagree with their assertion because if you don&#x27;t come to the table, then you have no agreement ever. So I rather explain my logic, point out flaws, and see if we can agree on some shared ideal.<p>&gt;That further devolved into claims that Trump supporters want to kill Biden supports, with a link to some wack job.<p>Well again, I don&#x27;t think this &quot;wack job&quot; is inconsistent with their representation. In the past few weeks alone, you have had people arrested for planning to kill the Gov of MI, to kill Biden, and to attack voting counting centers. In fact, before these things even took off, right-wing terrorists were linked to the majority (67% of domestic terror plots and activities in the United States (7). So we should call a spade a spade, no?<p>&gt;Now you have charged that is false equivalency the point...proves my point<p>Well yes, creating lists of people who have done morally repugnant things is very different to making a list of people to shoot! And refusing to work with people who are unethical is just good business sense and is likely personally healthier for yourself. Do you see what the difference is here? It&#x27;s not a crime for me to say that someone is immoral and that I wouldn&#x27;t work with them nor should any of my friends hire this person who might be a liar, cheater, and potential murderer. What is a crime is for me to plan, buy weapons, and execute a domestic terror plot. Can you see where I might be coming from in this case?<p>You set a person who declared murderous intent equal to someone who wanted to make sure that those who participated in potentially unethical actions were publically on record. Can you see where perhaps there is a false equivalence that you have made?<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;factcheck&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;26&#x2F;fact-check-obama-administration-built-migrant-cages-meme-true&#x2F;3413683001&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;factcheck&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;26&#x2F;fac...</a><p>2: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.esquire.com&#x2F;news-politics&#x2F;a27813648&#x2F;concentration-camps-southern-border-migrant-detention-facilities-trump&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.esquire.com&#x2F;news-politics&#x2F;a27813648&#x2F;concentratio...</a><p>4: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;biden-apologizes-for-pushing-hardline-laws-on-crime-immigration-in-1990s-2019-1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;biden-apologizes-for-pushing...</a><p>5: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;d1a9a629ade8ba444da6d31b997baef5" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;d1a9a629ade8ba444da6d31b997baef5</a><p>6: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nchs&#x2F;nvss&#x2F;vsrr&#x2F;covid19&#x2F;excess_deaths.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cdc.gov&#x2F;nchs&#x2F;nvss&#x2F;vsrr&#x2F;covid19&#x2F;excess_deaths.htm</a><p>7: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2020&#x2F;oct&#x2F;22&#x2F;white-supremacists-rightwing-domestic-terror-2020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2020&#x2F;oct&#x2F;22&#x2F;white-supremac...</a>')
