Keeping the amount of ads in mind and the stress they cause me, I am more selective and will often not click on a video that I previously would. And I don&#x27;t mindlessly binge-watch video for hours on end any longer.<p>With the new monetisation coming in place, I can see my consumption of YouTube declining even further to the level of Google - use it as a tool, when you really have to and not just for entertainment. And I welcome it! Just thought to share a perspective of a consumer rather than a creator.<p>On the other hand I do understand YouTube&#x27;s move. After all, it&#x27;s their platform and they&#x27;re not running a charity - people often forget that it&#x27;s not their birth right to use a company&#x27;s product or a service without paying for it one way or the other.')
