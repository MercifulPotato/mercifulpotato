The author&#x27;s git workflow is eerily like the one I&#x27;ve converged too over a decade, but &quot;never stash&quot; (without acknowledging the existence of the quick stash use-case) is wrong enough that it&#x27;s enough to give me pause about his general competency with git (or more likely and more charitably, that he just didn&#x27;t put too much effort into that section of the article).<p>The advantage of stash is that it&#x27;s quicker and easier than creating and cleaning up branches. If you&#x27;re naming stashes and keeping them longterm, then you&#x27;re basically using them like branches and should consider what benefit you&#x27;re getting from adding a separate workflow.')
