Not sure if I ignored email warnings and that was years before Twilio so there were no SMS reminders and iOS didn’t exist so there were no push notifications to try to give me a last chance!  I wish I hadn’t lost years of personal email history, especially since there were probably photos there that I didn’t have anywhere else.  Back in those days, data was expensive enough that they probably wouldn’t think of automatically archiving your account into a zip file in case you came asking for it later (when I asked, it was long gone).  Now I wouldn’t hesitate to pay if I could resuscitate that account.  Can’t really blame FastMail and now I use them for a business and love their service but it was a good lesson for me.')
