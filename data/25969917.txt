A sudden Friday night suspension of a popular, legitimate app is insane! That possibility shouldn&#x27;t be in the flowchart.<p>I get that for malware&#x2F;spam&#x2F;etc., it&#x27;s important to immediately suspend, but I don&#x27;t understand why Google doesn&#x27;t take more seriously the very negative harm caused by doing that to a legitimate app. Some notice and appeal opportunity should be required before suspending a popular app by a legitimate publisher.<p>I&#x27;m upset, and a bit scared, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m surprised. This sort of random&#x2F;erroneous&#x2F;arbitrary punishment without explanation happens all the time with Google and other major tech companies. And every app developer I&#x27;ve met has experienced _significant_ disruption to their app publishing efforts due arbitrary&#x2F;random rejections by an Apple app store reviewer, and this has been the case for years, so we can pretty confident that the vendors won&#x27;t improve unless they are forced to do so.<p>There needs to be regulatory oversight of the Google&#x2F;Apple app stores and the negative consequences for everyone else of their error-prone and ruthless enforcement processes.')
