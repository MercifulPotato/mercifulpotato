If we don&#x27;t consent, we only do so knowing that we are secure in doing so because the law permits us to do so. We only do so because there is not a threat of violence against us if we do so.<p>Consent doesn&#x27;t exist apart from threats of violence and deception. The latter two are all around us and constantly informing our decisions.')
