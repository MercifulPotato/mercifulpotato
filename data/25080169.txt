It&#x27;s a question of definitions. The most rigorous definition I&#x27;ve seen is that climate is a probability distribution over things like weather. Climate over a year in San Francisco will get you a distribution of temperatures, humidities, smoke, etc. Climate on Nov 13, spread out over many years is another distribution over weather.<p>It&#x27;s easier to deal with these distributions because you don&#x27;t need to predict the next year of weather to predict what global temperature properties keep the earth in equilibrium with incoming solar energy, for example.')
