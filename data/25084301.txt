Your point?<p>&gt; Copyright holders could potentially get future development shut down on the basis that the service implicitly authorises or encourages copyright infringement, as they are trying to do to youtube-dl.<p>Bullshit. The same argument could be made against a web browser. It&#x27;s not just because RIAA is making some absurd claim that is yet to be dropped in court that their claims are valid.<p>Also, even if the RIAA managed to block access to a central point of development, it would be at most a nuisance. Developers of whatever project gets blocked from Github need to do nothing youtube-dl<p>&gt; this strategy has worked for some tools like Napster, KaZaA, and some BitTorrent trackers. while failing for BitTorrent clients.<p>Very easy to see how the strategy only works against corporations, not against open source projects. KaZaA got sued, but GnuTella lives on.')
