You can just hold them on until the trim is normal. This is indeed what both the LA and EA crews did repeatedly, they just did not then turn off the stab trim.<p>This procedure is detailed in the Emergency Airworthiness Directive sent to all MAX pilots after the first crash.<p>Boeing Emergency Airworthiness Directive<p>&quot;Initially, higher control forces may be needed to overcome any stabilizer nose down trim already applied. Electric stabilizer trim can be used to neutralize control column pitch forces before moving the STAB TRIM CUTOUT switches to CUTOUT. Manual stabilizer trim can be used before and after the STAB TRIM CUTOUT switches are moved to CUTOUT.&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theaircurrent.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;B737-MAX-AD-1107.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theaircurrent.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;B737-MA...</a>')
