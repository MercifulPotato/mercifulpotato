I do not use the YouTube JavaScript player.  I download the video using a custom script and an HTTP client like tnftp and watch offline.  Google is suggesting that users use their browser, their website and their internal player to view someone else&#x27;s video file, so Google can serve ads, do tracking and collect analytics.  The testing is not something generic like downloading a file from a server; instead, it uses Google protocol, Google browser, Google website, Google player and is announced on Google blog.<p>All to show it will benefit everyone, of course.')
