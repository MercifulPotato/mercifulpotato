Suppose that some of the users are bots, doesn&#x27;t that mean that in order to fulfill amazon&#x27;s TOS Parler would have to actively build something (moderation systems) to keep up with the bots?   Doesn&#x27;t this make any service that can&#x27;t do this collateral damage?   What if people built bot systems good enough to sidestep twitter (speaking in code for example, using a cypher) and levelled them at twitter, etc. would the same thing happen?')
