I wrote it early on while I was learning, so I&#x27;m certain there is a <i>lot</i> I could update about it. Even still, it does its job pretty well. Sorting, filtering, editing, and reordering columns are all there. The way it&#x27;s constructed allows new features to be built on top of it without any need to learn a table (or component) API. Just interact with the table state directly, the types make it pretty easy.<p>One major problem is that columns are obnoxious to define. It&#x27;s just a giant record type. And in general I&#x27;m just not happy with the code. I&#x27;ll likely revisit this project again soon and rewrite some key parts.')
