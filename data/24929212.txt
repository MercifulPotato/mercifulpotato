Codes of conduct are a formalization of expectations and rules for behavior.  The are often tied (explicitly or implicitly) to an adjudication and enforcement process much more complicated than the person in charge just saying &quot;get the fuck out&quot;.<p>However when someone brings up the idea of improving that bureaucratic process by comparing and contrasting Codes of Conduct language and enforcement to our society&#x27;s hard-fought experience in creating fair justice systems, you retreated right back to the right to be arbitrary and capricious.<p>This is why people can&#x27;t help but wonder: what the fuck are we trying to accomplish here?  All I know is I need to publish a specific flavor of bureaucratic boilerplate so I don&#x27;t get my reputation attacked for not publicly promising to kick out people I would have kicked out anyway. And that I can use that document to dole out punishments with a larger air of legitimacy and seriousness than just telling someone not to come around my place anymore.')
