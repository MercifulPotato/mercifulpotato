The fact is that the people who were calling to abolish the police never amounted to anything more than the extreme fringe of the protests or activists.  Plenty of attention was paid to the &quot;crazed maniacs,&quot; but more important is the fact that nobody of any consequence actually told those crazed maniacs to riot, nor did anyone of consequence actively praise or encourage those who did riot (the worst were a few prominent politicians apologizing for riots by saying it is what happens when people&#x27;s concerns are ignored -- not even close to praising the rioters or telling them to go riot).<p>This is not a &quot;true Scotsman&quot; argument.  There is a meaningful difference between fringe elements acting on their own and powerful politicians or people with actual influence actively encouraging, directing, or praising that fringe.  That is what separates the riots that happened last year from what happened at the Capitol on Wednesday.')
