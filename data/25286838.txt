Item(by='acqq', descendants=None, kids=[25292894], score=None, time=1606984389, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25285498, text='The quote you use doesn&#x27;t claim sterilizing immunity but the &quot;protection&quot; and is misleading. The publicly reported protection of the vaccines seeking EUA is against the symptomatic disease, as it can be seen in the protocols of the vaccine studies.<p>E.g. Moderna protocol:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.modernatx.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;mRNA-1273-P301-Protocol.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.modernatx.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;mRNA-1273-P301...</a><p>&quot;To be considered as <i>a case of COVID-19</i> for the evaluation of the\n<i>Primary Efficacy Endpoint</i>, the following criteria must be met:<p>-  The participant must have experienced at least TWO of the\nfollowing systemic symptoms: Fever (≥ 38ºC), chills,\nmyalgia, headache, sore throat, new olfactory and taste\ndisorder(s), OR<p>- The participant must have experienced at least ONE of the\nfollowing respiratory signs&#x2F;symptoms: cough, shortness of\nbreath or difficulty breathing, OR clinical or radiographical\nevidence of pneumonia; AND<p>- The participant must have at least one NP swab, nasal swab,\nor saliva sample (or respiratory sample, if hospitalized)\npositive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR.&quot;<p>In some other protocols it&#x27;s not written in an easily quotable way but spread through the text and tables, but if you analyze the protocols carefully, the goal is the same: it&#x27;s the vaccinated and <i>symptomatic</i> that are counted and compared with the <i>symptomatic</i> counted in the placebo group.<p>So whenever you saw &quot;protection&quot; up to now it was implicit it&#x27;s the protection from the <i>disease as defined above</i>. Not the sterilizing immunity.<p>Moderna&#x27;s announcement is also explicit in mentioning so defined &quot;primary endpoint&quot;:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;investors.modernatx.com&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;news-release-details&#x2F;moderna-announces-primary-efficacy-analysis-phase-3-cove-study" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;investors.modernatx.com&#x2F;news-releases&#x2F;news-release-d...</a><p>&quot;The <i>primary endpoint</i> of the Phase 3 COVE study is based on the analysis of <i>COVID-19 cases confirmed</i> and adjudicated starting two weeks following the second dose of vaccine.&quot;<p>We should eventually know more, but we still don&#x27;t have that information.')
