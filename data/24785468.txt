It&#x27;s 100% proprietary, meaning I have little influence over some decisions.\nE.g., if I don&#x27;t want to be disturbed on my PC, I just quit all messenger apps. On Android, but only since very recently, there&#x27;s a DnD mode. I don&#x27;t use it because I don&#x27;t understand what it is doing + it has been burried somewhere as OS-level app.<p>Then of course, there&#x27;s this problem that on Android they want to hide files from you and that the whole experience is optimized to keep you on the screen.<p>And so on...<p>I don&#x27;t like my mobile phone UI at all!')
