I&#x27;m a big fan of Gelman (and learned from his books!), but he specifically mentioned that both Gelman et al&#x27;s Model and 538&#x27;s Model did indeed capture the outcomes in their probability distributions, but that to improve performance going forward it was much better to predict closer to the median than closer to the tails. (And funny enough, Gelman gave 538 some grief earlier on making a model with very wide tails.) This is a nuanced but very fair criticism, and taking a Twitter-style summary of it I think is overly reductionist.')
