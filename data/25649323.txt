Following a recent change, not having the SSO apps means I have to have use an extra password + SMS 2FA on many sites when I want to pay by credit card (the alternative being the SSO app).<p>I don&#x27;t drive, so I don&#x27;t know for a fact about the parking situation, but people tell me some places are app-only.<p>On a few occasions I&#x27;ve had to get my wife to pay for something using the app I mentioned, but it is becoming increasingly &quot;weird&quot; not to have it, and I see many classifieds specify that they only accept payment that way. I was almost cash-only for day-to-day stuff until Covid, but that&#x27;s been the nail in the coffin. Technically businesses can&#x27;t refuse cash, but many places will have signs asking you to pay by card, and I&#x27;m not going to be an arse about it to some 17-year-old behind the counter like an anti-masker. Thankfully almost everyone accepts credit&#x2F;debit cards, but the alternatives are cheaper for businesses so maybe in a few years that will also become problematic, and the app-based solutions will have fully overtaken government cash.<p>I feel like there should be an addition to basic human rights: Participation in the economy. It should not be a requirement for day-to-day life that one carries some tracking device and accepts thousands of pages of ToS from a private company. I can accept giving up many conveniences, but I feel like I should be able to have a place to live and buy food without a Google account.')
