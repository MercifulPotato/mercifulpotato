My point is that it will be increasingly difficult to do so. Your comment about &quot;If there&#x27;s a will there may be a way&quot; is not the answer because having a &quot;way&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s easy, and that was exactly my point. Tor exists, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s easy to do Tor, nor do regular people use Tor.')
