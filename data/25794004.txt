I eventually threw out my older charger because there was more electrical tape than original coating. My current one started deteriorating right at the connector so it&#x27;s patched up with epoxy paste to provide strain relief.<p>I tend to agree that Apple isn&#x27;t going to retreat on USB-C. That just doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense. And whatever minor virtues Magsafe may have, I&#x27;m happy when traveling not to have to remember a one-off charger for a laptop. (Which I have forgotten a couple of times.)')
