Because I think he’s being somewhat of a dick. Like it’s a little rude and not in the best taste.<p>Like it was totally possible to give this talk in a positive manner talking about all the reasons you think notebooks are good and demonstrating the use-cases.<p>* You don’t have to call out or reference the original speaker at all and say they’re wrong. Even if they are objectively wrong don’t be a dick and call them out publicly. Just shoot them a message and they can post the correction themselves. Were taking a professional peer, not someone intentionally trying to mislead and arguing in bad faith.<p>* Talking over their original slides gives a super adversarial tone. You can give your reasons why notebooks are good and even tackle common criticisms without picking apart their talk specifically. It’s the conference version of the gross “name and shame pattern” you see all over the internet.<p>* Why would you say something negative about a peer’s work <i>on stage</i>? Like it’s fine to have an impassioned rant at the bar afterwords if you want but this is the spiritual equivalent of saying something negative about a coworker in front of them and their boss. If it were me it would certainly leave a bad taste in my mouth.')
