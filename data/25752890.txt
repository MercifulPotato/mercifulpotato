AOL, CompuServe, Tymshare... they&#x27;re all dead and buried or absorbed into the Internet to the point they no longer have an independent existence on the technical level.<p>You can say this about programming languages: Compare the success of Python to the success of AutoLISP or even the success of Lisp Machine Lisp to the success of Emacs Lisp. I can&#x27;t think of a single widely-used programming language which is only available in a proprietary implementation. (And by widely-used I mean beyond a single OS and beyond a single industry.)')
