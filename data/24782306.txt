The first and the one that makes me dislike Python (not hate) is that Python enshrined into the language syntax that whitespace and structure count towards correctness. If it is not properly spaced according to the spec it does not work. Some people see this as an arbitrary constraint put on a developer and do not like it. Now I will give you others see it as a way to keep code readable, both arguments have their merits. Pretty much anything beyond noting how the two camps see it devolves into a holy war. Personally being a person that sees the beauty of LISP derived languages lack of syntax, I fall into the first camp and don&#x27;t see the value of it for me.<p>I think the second issue, is it is fairly safe to say that the path from Python 2 to 3 was not well thought out and has been a disaster. A lot of people where burned by it, and it left a bad taste in a lot of peoples mouths.<p>That being said, Python enjoys a huge userbase so I would not worry about the hate, it&#x27;s just not the language of choice for some people and that is fine.')
