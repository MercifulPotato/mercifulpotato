Eric Green gives some great general pointers, but here are more concrete applications:<p>- NIPT vendors (Natera, Ariosa (Roche), Verinata (Illumina), Sequenom (LabCorp) and others) have successfully commercialized carrier and prenatal screening for severe genetic defects.<p>- CareDx has commercialized pre- and post-screening for organ transplant rejection.<p>- Invitae, Color, Foundation (Roche) and others are scaling genetic testing, specifically clinical exome and panel sequencing (and solving the reimbursement problem in the process, by amortizing the cost of sequencing a patient&#x27;s DNA across multiple physician-requested tests). Because variants need to be understood by physicians, this also enabled public&#x2F;private data sharing partnerships for variant characterization (ClinVar).<p>- Grail (Illumina), Natera and others are on the verge of commercializing routine cfDNA cancer screening.<p>And here are more fundamental improvements which may yield more successes like the above:<p>- Oxford Nanopore has provided much needed competition to Illumina in lowering the barrier to portable sequencing and de novo whole genome sequencing.<p>- The ENCODE project has used ever more sophisticated assays to characterize functional regions of the genome.<p>- 10x Genomics has scaled and productized new ways to do single-cell transcriptomics, enabling breakthroughs in understanding functions of genes (by mapping differences in their expression across cell types and conditions) as well as development of CAR-T cell therapies (training and selecting the patient&#x27;s own immune cells to fight cancer).<p>- UK Biobank has provided privacy-preserving access to a large cohort of annotated genomic data from the NHS, enabling more powerful association studies between genes and disease.<p>One of the bigger balancing acts in this industry is the monopolistic tendency of Illumina, Roche, and a few other big players to buy everyone up. This has clear anti-competitive effects but also incentivizes a lot of startups looking for that exit.')
