In particular I modded Minecraft such that when I press a button it saves two screenshots: one regular and one where the game renders a depth map instead. I used this to generate ~1000 samples with perfectly accurate depth maps. Because of the mods, texture pack and world I used the data was somewhat realistic: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.stack.imgur.com&#x2F;Zai51.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.stack.imgur.com&#x2F;Zai51.jpg</a> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.stack.imgur.com&#x2F;eamMR.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.stack.imgur.com&#x2F;eamMR.png</a><p>This data was then used to train a neural network to predict the depth map of unseen images. It was relatively successful, but requires more data and more research, I only had so much time for a term paper.')
