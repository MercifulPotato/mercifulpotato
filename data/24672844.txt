It&#x27;s fundamentally broken, has been exposed multiple times, requires gaming to work in yiur favour (&quot;open a credit card as soon as you can, pay little things with it and pay it off immediately to beef up a good score&quot;) and brings nothing to <i>you</i>, the people.<p>For comparison, in France, the national bank keeps a record of all loans anyone has taken. When you apply for a new loan, the bank will check with the national one your history, and decide based on that to lend or not, and inform the national bank of their decision. I suppose Americans can be afraid that &quot;the government&quot; will know their loan history in such a system, but it&#x27;s not like they can&#x27;t currently ask and het that information, and they&#x27;re still more trustworthy than commercial companies that don&#x27;t care about you ( their clients being banks and companies) or your data beyond their sales.<p>But it&#x27;s not like anyone on the US would dare to destroy a profitable industry.')
