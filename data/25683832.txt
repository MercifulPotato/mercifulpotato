If you want a chat app then you need to list clients.  Which client would you use?<p>And xxxx&#x2F;XMPP isn&#x27;t on the list because when I last looked (which was some time ago) everything was unusable for muggles, same with Matrix.  Responses to this poll have convinced me that the landscape has changed, although most of the suggestions are still inappropriate for someone who just want to use something, without having to understand everything about the underlying protocols.<p>So, back to XMPP, or Matrix.  Which client would you use&#x2F;recommend?')
