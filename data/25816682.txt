Hardware tokens gated by software (ala yubikey + webauthn) are clearly the next step in auth.<p>It’s an accident of circumstance you even need to buy a yubikey - your iPhone, iPad, laptop, android whatever can do everything a yubikey does. There just needs to be enough demand and time for OS and hardware vendors to come around to shipping and integrating this stuff by default. Suddenly you’ll own 3 or 4 yubikey equivalents without buying any special auth devices.<p>25 years into the web and our login tools remain pretty barbaric. Maybe in 25 years we’ll have it sorted out. But change is coming. Call it 2fa, webauthn, whatever - regardless of the details username&#x2F;password auth (on its own) is dead.')
