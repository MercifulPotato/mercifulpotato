I’m here to be angry and will reject any evidence that doesn’t fit my narrative.<p>It’s very clear that Robinhood colluded with Citadel and Melvin capital to help stop me participating in a massive distributed market manipulation scheme.  I know this, because this is how hedge funds work; they always work together to stock it to the little guy.  You would know this too if you read &#x2F;r&#x2F;politics.<p>If it were not for Robinhood, I would definitely be rich or the moon right now.  I’m a sophisticated trader and definitely not a stupid money bag holder sitting at the bottom of a huge pyramid scheme.')
