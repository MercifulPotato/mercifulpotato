Are you not aware how the 5-Eyes program works at all?<p>FB gladly hand over the details of those Q-anon imbeciles on their platform with no resistance, they then proceeded to censor and de-platform anyone who didn&#x27;t follow the narrative and even went after people who had nothing to do with politics in the last wave of bans.<p>And you don&#x27;t think these &#x27;rich people&#x27; aren&#x27;t beholden to the State and its surveillance economy, of which they are just one part of the apparatus?<p>Corruption begets corruption: and many of these rich people  (specifically CEOs of FAANG) are not without blood on their hands, playing &#x27;whose worse&#x27; is like saying the one to actually kill Ceaser was the last to deliver the final blow on the Senate floor as he laid in a pool of his own blood. (Ceaser was a tyrant and deserved to die, just so its clear.)<p>I would argue the very Nation-State model is to blame, its a total cesspool; and this type of cronyism is prevalent in this model which rewarded a few (like, but limited, to Zuck) who acquiesced when they State showed up with bags of money for them to play along for these exact events.')
