First, compared to most of Asia that actually got this virus under control, we have never really had much of a true lockdown here. \nSecond, it’s not the lockdown, its the pandemic.  In most areas economic activity dropped off well before any lockdowns and has remained subdued regardless of lockdown duration as long as the virus remains active.<p>That is - the economic activity drop is more correlated with level of virus outbreak than with any government orders.<p>In NYC, everyone I know got sent home a week or more before any city&#x2F;state lockdowns started.<p>The only time offices were mandated to be closed in NYC was about 8 weeks when we had refrigerated trucks parked outside hospitals acting as mobile morgues, and the National Guard picking up 100s of bodies per day of those who died at home.<p>For the most part companies have kept people WFH because they can get close to 100% productivity with close to 0% absences due to disease &amp; death.<p>The mental health angle of more time spent at home, I still think is a wash.  For every extrovert craving lording over a conference room of coworkers, there’s an introvert enjoying reduction in forced social interactions.  Lots of people actually like their family &amp; enjoy spending more time with them.')
