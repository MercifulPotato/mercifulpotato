I spent a long time trying to figure out the best way to go about this before ultimately just settling on plaintext files and Git.  Some of my data goes into CSV files that I generally just manually edit with Vim, some (ie. notes) just goes into literal text files.  Sensitive data lives in a separate repo and is encrypted using GNU pass<p>Since this is how I&#x27;m used to keeping track of code and configurations, the friction has been surprisingly low; I&#x27;d even go so far as to say I find it fun.  I&#x27;m sure my specific setup is not what&#x27;s right for everyone but it feels right for me and I think that&#x27;s the whole point.')
