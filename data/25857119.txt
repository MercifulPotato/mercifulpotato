There is just no way to always keep such people out of your organization once you cross a certain size threshold. So the logical result is that with time, everyone is forced to become more like the metric cheaters just to survive so they either leave or become metric cheaters themselves; in either case the product goes to shit as the creative problem solvers leave.')
