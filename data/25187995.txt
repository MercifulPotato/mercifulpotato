They&#x27;re still playing the same old pieces by the same old composers, on the same old instruments. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with doing old things, but it&#x27;s somewhat baffling.<p>As a home guitar player and producer, I can trivially get pedals and amps that practically let me make any sound I want with my guitar, as well as equipment for alternative techniques like the E-bow. If you jump over to the MIDI&#x2F;DAW world, there&#x27;s pretty much no limit to what you can do. Some stuff is already coming out that lets you translate humming into MIDI in real-time. Yet people trip over themselves to tell you why there shouldn&#x27;t be pianos of different sizes, let alone (god forbid) pianos with different keyboard layouts. I can only imagine the reaction of the average classical performer if you were to suggest making a major overhaul to the design or performance of an instrument itself, if not adding in new instruments altogether.<p>As an engineer, I&#x27;ve been doubly baffled by the adherence to doing things traditionally just because that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s always been done. The attitude I&#x27;ve perceived from people in the classical world that I know is that they pretty much don&#x27;t believe there could be a better notation, technique, etc. Meanwhile in the software world, it feels like we have a new coding language every year and 10 different frameworks for each of them. Even if language A and language B can do the same thing, they could each offer engineer X and Y more comfortable or preferred solutions for doing that same thing. Music isn&#x27;t that different; in the end you&#x27;re just creating an evolving soundscape with different pitches and timbres, so why not try a new design that offers the same sound, or a new sound that can play the same role in the soundscape?<p>It&#x27;s unfortunate because I have immense respect for the skill that classical performers have. I just wish we could see what they could do if they applied their talents towards performing new music and instruments. The people who do innovate in this respect produce some incredible stuff: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IvUU8joBb1Q" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=IvUU8joBb1Q</a>.')
