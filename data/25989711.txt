What if you take your argument, and scaled it up. What if you promised each kid 1 trillion burgers. Will you have access to 1 trillion burgers tomorrow? What if they take their future 1 trillion burgers and sell half. What if you walk into McDonalds to claim the 1 trillion burgers. Does McDonalds have 1 trillion burgers?  No.<p>So you&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s okay to promise burgers as long as it&#x27;s an amount that actually exists and McDonald&#x27;s can fulfil it. So what you&#x27;re saying is that you shouldn&#x27;t sell things you can&#x27;t possibly fulfil? Hence the argument against this kind of trading.')
