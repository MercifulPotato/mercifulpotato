Because chatbot nudges users to give information.<p>Also in websites where you have a lot of information to convey, ex: banks, mortgages, etc. again chatbot makes sense. Because it helps give information that&#x27;s selective to the customer. And they don&#x27;t have to struggle through a lot of information presented to them at once.<p>We have customers who use our chatbot link directly on google ads.<p>We have also noticed our customers maturing over time and demanding more functionalities on the chatbots.<p>To summarize, no chatbots are not dead. They are only beginning. However, you need to narrow down on a specific problem and solve it.')
