Item(by='BlueTemplar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610798750, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25789204, text='&gt; Consider that we Linux users are a tiny slice of the desktop market. Let us be optimistic and say that we are 2% of desktop users (although in Steam it fluctuates around 0.86%). VR users in Steam are around 1.9% according to the latest hardware surveys, and those are gamers, they are not representative of the desktop users, but nevertheless letâ€™s suppose that 2% of desktop users have some kind of VR device. If the proportions hold, Linux VR users would be 2 percent of 2 percent, or 0.04% of PC users, or 4 people in 10,000, and scattered all around the world. That tiny market would not even be a consideration for any sane investor.<p>This math assumes that being a VR enthusiast and an (even occasional) Linux user are independent. On the opposite, I would guess that there&#x27;s a lot of overlap between the two ! (Also with things like being a gadget-loving &#x27;geek&#x27;, still owning a desktop PC, &amp;c.)<p>P.S.: &quot;Scattered around the world&quot; is not an issue for software, and maybe even not for hardware, as the overwhelming majority of the users able to afford desktop 6DoF VR are going to be either in North America or Europe.')
