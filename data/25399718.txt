It is more often a choice between:<p>1. Buy some platform&#x2F;framework which you will then need to hire a small army of costly consultants to integrate and customize for your particular business need. Or<p>2. &quot;Build&quot; your own solution by orchestrating a bunch of open source technologies to solve your problem.<p>Moreover, it is not quite clear up front whether 1 or 2 will be costlier in terms of development effort and overhead.')
