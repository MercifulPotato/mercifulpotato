I&#x27;d used:<p><pre><code>  2*(1&#x2F;49)*(1&#x2F;48)*(1&#x2F;47)*(1&#x2F;46)*365*1000*(45&#x2F;50) = 12.9%\n</code></pre>\nThe initial &quot;2&quot; term is for consecutive numbers going both directions, and the final (45&#x2F;50) term is to account for the fact that if you start with 4 or less and decreasing, or 46 or greater and increasing, you&#x27;ll run out of numbers.<p>Edit: but if the numbers don&#x27;t have to be drawn in order (e.g. 8-5-9-6-7 is OK), then the odds are much higher still:<p><pre><code>  2*(4&#x2F;49)*(3&#x2F;48)*(2&#x2F;47)*(1&#x2F;46)*365*1000 = 344.5%\n</code></pre>\n(With the initial &quot;2&quot; term accounting for 4 consecutive numbers on either side of the initial pick -- though I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve got that entirely right?) Then it would happen three to four times a year. Even with a 6th ball drawn separately out of 20, that&#x27;s <i>still</i> a 17% chance happening somewhere in the world in a year, given 1,000 daily draws.')
