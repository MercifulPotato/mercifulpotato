Some money is saved by police and by individuals who would have crashed, but the departments responsible for upgrading the infrastructure will never get a return on their investment. In practice that&#x27;ll mean higher taxes to support some new-fangled tech that doesn&#x27;t immediately help the majority of people, and I&#x27;d be surprised if that gets support.')
