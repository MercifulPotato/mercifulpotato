I&#x27;m one of the founders.<p>There are a few options for people when it comes to feature flags. Some options, like Azure, are features of larger platforms, others come at feature flagging from more of an A&#x2F;B testing angle.<p>In terms of Bullet Train:<p>- We focus on feature flags. We&#x27;re not going to build out features that are not core to that offering. We&#x27;re not going to build an analytics platform for running AB tests as we think using a dedicated analytics solution makes a lot more sense.\n- Our flags can be booleans, strings, ints or floats and can be overridden on a per environment basis. \n- We offer flags based on dynamic user segments, percentage splits&#x2F;rollouts and are about to release multivariate flags with ABN testing capability.\n- We have lightweight, low dependency SDKs for the majority of languages and frameworks that don&#x27;t get in your way.\n- You can run our platform yourself, with us, or we can help you run it on-premise. Our architecture is straightforward and can be up and running in a couple of minutes via docker-compose. \n- All our dashboard and API code, as well as our SDKs, is open source and BSD-3 licensed.<p>At the end of the day it depends on what you are looking for, and what tooling you are currently using.')
