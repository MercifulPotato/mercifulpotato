Item(by='patal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606337328, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25210684, text='That does not work so well if you&#x27;re working in a team. A fairly complex regular expression is always hard to read.<p>We see this as early as in code review and as late as when you find a production bug because expectations of the surrounding code have changed.<p>For those reasons, we usually break regexes into parts anyway, and name and comment the single parts. Using the library&#x27;s example, we might have:<p><pre><code>  protocol = &quot;^(?:http)(?:s)?&quot;\n  protocol_separator = &quot;(?:\\:\\&#x2F;\\&#x2F;)&quot;\n  url = &quot;(?:www\\.)?(?:[^\\ ]*)$&quot;\n  \n  regex = protocol + protocol_separator + url\n</code></pre>\nWhich turns out to be in the direction of these Java Verbal Expressions. I find the Verbal Expressions idea really enlightening.')
