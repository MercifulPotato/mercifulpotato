Not to solve the root problem</i><p>They name several apps which would seem to violate the same guideline, at worst they&#x27;re asking for the same exception Apple has already given to others. An argument can be made that they&#x27;re snitching on the others, but it&#x27;s also an argument for consistency that one could say <i>is</i> the root problem.')
