The quoted error is from the <i>debugger</i>, not from the stop code in a BSoD screen. The BSoD screen would be something like...<p><pre><code>    0x0000000A: IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL\n</code></pre>\nor...<p><pre><code>    0x0000007E: SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED\n</code></pre>\nIt corresponds to whatever the last operation kernel was executing before it fails, but without information on how it fails, and only indicates that something is wrong in the kernel or in a driver in general. You can chase these stop codes and check for bad RAM or bad drivers forever without real progress. Don&#x27;t spend too much time on these codes, it&#x27;s a waste of time. Enable memdump and get WinDbg. In comparison, analyzing the crash dump in WinDbg gives real information.<p><pre><code>    KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR - This bug check indicates that the requested page of kernel data from the paging file could not be read into memory.</code></pre>')
