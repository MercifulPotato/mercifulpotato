We were actually winding up an interglacial period and would likely be headed to another ice age...in a few thousand years. But our CO2 emissions completely changed that trajectory in two centuries. Our current emissions will change that trajectory even further in just a couple decades.<p>Now we are headed for something...very different. And it&#x27;s happening fast.')
