If a job is good for you it&#x27;s good to be excited about it. It&#x27;s good for employers too - to have someone that <i>really</i> wants a job instead of someone who&#x27;s just chancing for it and happy to move on somewhere else for a few bucks more just after you finished training them.<p>I agree employment is like a relationship. And good communication is essential in a good relationship. I&#x27;m not interested in a girl that browses for relationships as if she was on a meat market, same with employers. It has to &#x27;click&#x27;. And if it does it&#x27;s very unfair not to get feedback either way.<p>Having said that I&#x27;ve rarely been ghosted. I&#x27;ve always got decent feedback when I didn&#x27;t get a job, including on what went &#x27;wrong&#x27; and how to improve my chances. That information is very valuable. In most cases it just didn&#x27;t &#x27;click&#x27; and I didn&#x27;t want the job anyway.<p>I also rejected a job offer once because I didn&#x27;t like the work atmosphere there (I asked to see the workplace after the interview). The HR guy was absolutely livid :D I don&#x27;t get that, why would he want me in a job where I&#x27;m unhappy? I always ask to see the place so I can get an idea of where I&#x27;ll be spending a large part of my life. Money isn&#x27;t the only thing I care about.<p>The one interview that really stood out, where I was amazed at the lively atmosphere, it was with the company I still work for 17 years on. It was a crappy callcenter job I started at but when I walked in there I could see the people were happy and had time to have fun as well as work.')
