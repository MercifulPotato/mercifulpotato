It doesn&#x27;t matter what the Iranian gov does or did, nor what the US gov did all these years.<p>The argument is that the US sanctions are wrong. It&#x27;s totally against what America and the West at large stands for. Those sanctions, as always punish innocent citizens the most. The strategy of course is to make those citizens revolt. But it ain&#x27;t even working. See with Iraq and Libya, they litterally ended up bombing these countries and ensured the death penatly to those leaders, and now see how worse it has become over there (interestingly the news outlet don&#x27;t report much of the situation now).<p>I have been clearly and firmly reminded by my employer about sanctions on Iran and to not engage in any business with Iranian as clients. The US government, like said in another comment is using its country&#x27;s private economical powers for the service of its (absurd) geopolitics, not far from what China has been doing, but with far more hypocrisy and somehow less success.')
