The cost to implement is too high and is essentially the same as what we do for Municipal Solid Waste (just bury it).  I put it in a slightly less insane category than geo-engineering.  The only places that I see carbon capture as potentially viable as a transition is using it to offset industrial process gases necessary.  I.e. capture CO2 from coal plant for cement production - however that is niche case as siting is key and transportation is too expensive.<p>How do we solve climate change?  Deploy, deploy, deploy.  We have renewable energy that is cheap and available.  Change the policy incentives at the federal away from subsidizing oil and gas and incentives green energy.  De-carbonize the transportation sector with EV and HZEV.  Reduce Natural Gas for home heating with the injection of Hydrogen into the fuel lines (up to 20%).  Invest in research and development into further productionizing effective technologies.<p>Let&#x27;s skip the wasted capital, debate and energy and move on.  Also, let us not forget that Oil and Gas Majors have been deploying considerable money into this sector for decades to prolong their existence.  I for one do not want to subsidize their behavior any more as they have been trying to scuttle the climate date since the 80s.')
