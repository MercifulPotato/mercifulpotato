I am of the ‘what worked for the grandmas would work for you too’ camp. We are our genes and studying ancestor lifestyle(with tweaks to accommodate modernization, of course) is most logical.<p>Example: I have never been for the anti-carb lifestyle.

I am primed for rice.<p>I remember a time when I went to a nutritionist and she said that given my age and weight, I should have no more than 1&#x2F;4 cup of cooked rice. That’s 4 tbsp, ok? And I told her that my daily rice budget would be spent just tasting the biryani for seasoning while cooking it ..even before I can sit down for lunch.
