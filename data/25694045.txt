SCOTUS ruled that in limited circumstances, private property can be treated as a public commons <i>if</i> the property owner holds it out for general public use. Following the mall cases, many malls began restricting the acceptable uses on their properties, which is why you don&#x27;t get harassed by political activists every time you go to the mall. (In a nutshell, open mall spaces are now designated as transit spaces rather than as general use spaces, and thus the entire lineage of SCOTUS cases no longer apply to <i>privately held</i> malls.)')
