Sure, as kids we watched a lot of TV, but when it was time to turn it off we didn&#x27;t get a sound to tell us someone &quot;Liked&quot; your photo.  As you said, these aren&#x27;t bi-directional.<p>I think the hardest thing for this parent was balancing what was right for their child (and they seemed to be confident in their opinion) and what would hold them back socially at school.  It&#x27;s hard to say no to a child that says &quot;Everyone else has an iPhone&quot; because we all remember being that kid left out from something when we were young.')
