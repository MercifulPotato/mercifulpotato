You generally need to file an application to join, and you&#x27;re expected to pay membership fee on a regular basis.<p>CCP membership is by and large a YMMV scenario given how large the country is and how deep the organization runs. While I believe your wife might be in the situation where she felt she had to join (due to her social class, affiliation or being in a certain region), it&#x27;s not common for someone to be seen as a problem if they decide not to join.<p>From all the years of observation and all the people that I know day to day, <i>most </i> of people join for certain prospect of future benefits, career or social status wise. They know very well it opens the door to another class.')
