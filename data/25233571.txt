But you can&#x27;t freely express them. Try talking about fat people at work, and report how well that goes over. After you lose your job, you might feel a little &quot;ostracized&quot; from society.<p>My point which I did not state adequately in my comment, is that obesity is huge problem, that people use empathy to cover up for.<p>I&#x27;ll use cigarettes as an example, it wasn&#x27;t until packages started showing graphic pictures of cancer, damaged lungs, and huge graphic labels and warnings. That the public&#x2F;social pressure to quit, had substantial effect.<p>I think its misguided to put all our effort in protecting at risk individuals, when the responsibility lies with most of these people to lose weight, and strengthen their immune system.<p>You have to be a blind person to ignore the real authentic evidence of obesity in this country. I won&#x27;t even bother to look for links to studies. Here&#x27;s an article stating its 40% and higher.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;healthiest-communities&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020-02-27&#x2F;us-obesity-rate-passes-40-percent#:~:text=According%20to%20data%20released%20Thursday,40%25%20for%20the%20first%20time" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;healthiest-communities&#x2F;articles&#x2F;...</a>.<p>Its also directly linked to this pandemic in the USA. Its a direct predictor of mortality from COVID.   \nStudy.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7346803&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC7346803&#x2F;</a><p>I don&#x27;t oppose wearing masks, as a short term strategy to reduce infection. The evidence that they work is marginal.\nI have no problem wearing them, other than it may give a false sense security to at risk individuals.<p>But how long should we wear masks? A year, two years, a decade... ? Its very conceivable that technological innovation will take over, and cloth masks will become full-on ventilators. Which at that point really will resemble &quot;space suits&quot;. So will wearing mandated &quot;space suits&quot; be a path that we want humanity to go down on? \nOr will nature select out the weak, like it has done for millions of years in our evolution.<p>Also, &quot;my body my choice&quot; has to be respected at some point. If we want to save the most lives, we would really want to isolate the most at risk elderly and mandate some nation wide weight loss program.<p>Mandating that everyone do an hour walk, lose weight if you are obese, and put a treadmill in every classroom, would save more a lot more lives than just masks.')
