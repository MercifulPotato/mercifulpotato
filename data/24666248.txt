For example, if one has two copies of the TOTP secret, one of which is in a secure location, and one of which is used for daily purposes, as long as the secure location is reasonably secure, it&#x27;s not much different than storing backup codes in that secure location.<p>I do agree with you that having multiple copies of the TOTP secret that can be lost and not noticed isn&#x27;t a good idea though.')
