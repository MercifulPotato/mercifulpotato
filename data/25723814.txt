I don&#x27;t mean to downplay the tragedy of his death.  But using a fire extinguisher certainly sounds a lot more like a protest gone too far than a president trying to over throw the government.<p>Do I need to remind you that Trump encouraged the protest to be peaceful?  Then released a video telling everyone to go home, peacefully?  Those involved in the violence are being arrested.<p>&quot;People&quot; online have held up bloody Trump heads, wished for Trump to die.  The extreme left isn&#x27;t this super peaceful always tolerant group.  The extreme right isn&#x27;t either.')
