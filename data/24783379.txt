While these are normally quickly deleted, they appear to have been manually modded up (which I suppose would avoid a claim about HN censoring the articles about censoring). So that&#x27;s fine. But it&#x27;s tedious reading through a bunch of low-effort posts by throwaway accounts. Can we at least prevent those?')
