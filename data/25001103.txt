Garnishment or seizure are tools they can use to get the money, but the obligation is always there. If you don&#x27;t pay you incur fines and penalties, potentially criminal penalties.<p>You also have an obligation to report your assets. If you tried to keep your Bitcoin stash secret from the IRS to hide your money, you&#x27;d be looking at very serious criminal penalties, not to mention you could never touch your stash again if the IRS is coming after you without them immediately seeing you actually do have extra funds.<p>Stop treating this as some abstract technical problem that ignores real-world consequences.')
