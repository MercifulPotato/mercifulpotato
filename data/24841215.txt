Item(by='wtf_srsly', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603220935, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24840115, text='&gt; Apple seems to do all kinds of weird networking _stuff_. For instance, during wakeup, your T2 equipped Macbook will wait for a DNS response and then use said DNS response to synchronize time via NTP before letting the user use the keyboard. Probably checking timestamps on signatures for the keyboard firmware, or something stupid like that. This only happens if it happens to have a default route.<p>I had the same thing happening to me but Apple changed the complete keyboard under their extended keyboard warranty programm (even though it was out of Apple Care already).')
