Waking vs driving to work is an interesting example because it depends on what you count as work when you frame the problem. Driving requires your body to less work, but walking costs less energy overall because you don’t have to accelerate and move a heavy vehicle.<p>I prefer LaTeX (specifically via org mode) because it feels like there is less cognitive overhead to me. References are magical (especially with org-ref), I don’t have to fight with the layout algorithm to keep my train of thought as i move my cursor around and edit text, emacs keybindings....<p>This is all in tension with collaborative writing, since most people in my field don’t use LaTeX or org mode. Here I prefer GDocs to Word in large part because at least my browser understands some basic emacs keybindings.')
