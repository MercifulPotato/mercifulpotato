I wanted to get a pension from my IT job...meaning I had to stay 13 years.  I knew I was leaving at about 10 years.  But it is good to have a safety net or two, so I stuck it out.  It still felt really quick once I jumped ship and started my own massage therapy biz.  It felt good to finally make the leap, but it also felt good to have a plan.  I saw many people at that time taking crazy chances (early 2000&#x27;s) and they got clobbered by 2008.  So I&#x27;d say figure out your strengths and weaknesses before you so your own thing.  Be honest, because your new career depends on you.')
