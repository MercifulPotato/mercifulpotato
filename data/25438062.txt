But it&#x27;s not at all what the linked article says; it says that there was 40% turn-over of people leaving and entering the city, which is absurd.  The first sentence is literally &quot;Millions of people have moved out of New York City during the pandemic, but at the same time, millions of others with lower incomes have taken their place&quot;.  Not moved <i>within</i> the city, moved <i>out</i> of the city, and being replaced by other lower-income people.  That is all completely made up and wrong.<p>I&#x27;m not misrepresenting you; rather, you&#x27;re misrepresenting the article.  The article is indefensibly wrong.')
