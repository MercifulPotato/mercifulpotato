Most chess players are casual fans. They aren&#x27;t interested in deep analysis. And besides, if you want analysis, you wouldn&#x27;t want a youtube channel but stockfish or other chess engines and work through it yourself.<p>&gt; He mostly just moves the pieces and says the moves.<p>Not true. Sure he tells you the moves but he provides analysis for the good parts. He provides highlights which is what people want. Nobody is going to sit through a detailed analysis of an 8 hour game.')
