That being said, I could easily be wrong, which is why I said &quot;probably.&quot; :)<p>As to changing the laws, this is all well and good, but it&#x27;s hard to see that happening under a divided government, given Democrats and Republicans have different ideas of the effects they&#x27;d like to see out of such a break-up. If they can&#x27;t do something extremely popular like legalizing marijuana or providing universal healthcare, I am not sure how effective they&#x27;re going to be at less popular actions like breaking up Google or Facebook. We&#x27;ll see I guess.')
