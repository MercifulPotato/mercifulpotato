It boiled down to: give yourself time alone with your thoughts. We&#x27;ve become so used to being easily distracted by checking social media, turning on the TV, browsing randomly. We&#x27;ve forgot how to be bored.<p>There is a dive bar close to me(in Chicago) that had no TVs, no wifi, and no cell service(at least for my provider). Pre-COVID, I would go there regularly to just be forced away from it all. I would read, sketch, talk to regulars, or just stare into the void.<p>When I lived 2.5 miles from work, I would just walk to work. Some days I would listen to a podcast, but mostly I was just stuck alone with my thoughts. It helped me level out a lot.')
