And that is not so much their fault as project managers are being trained on methods big time, but then again then job they have to do is not just executing these tools somehow, but to understand the dynamics in larger organizations and to act accordingly. But many project manager just learn the tools and methods to perfection and try to bring their cure to everyone by prioritizing method adoption, when many times the missing methods are not the most important problem.<p>So many times there are politics and emotions part of the broken communication that causes quite a lot of havoc these days. So instead of teaching developers how they have to work project managers should focus more on how to foster collaboration and use their people skills to reduce friction between people.<p>Having a good idea of exiting methods can be advantageous, but should never distract from the first priority to actually help the people who do the work, as good as they can.')
