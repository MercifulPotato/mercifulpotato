Also, my wireless earbuds have built-in storage, so I load a bunch of music onto it and work out without carrying my phone with me. I also have a bunch of DJ mixes which are not available on online streaming services. Finally, I load MP3s onto my phone when I fly so that I can listen to music on the plane and in foreign countries. For all those reasons, I still keep and curate a pile of MP3s.')
