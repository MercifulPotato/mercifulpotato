They are ineffective in treating what is wrong with me. They also make me feel suicidal. I can&#x27;t take them. The doctors who recommended SSRI in my youth have no fucking idea what is wrong with me.<p>The only thing I&#x27;ve even seen that addresses my issue is benzos but they are extremely dangerous.<p>I was told by multiple psychiatrists that I should be on a heavy dose of benzos for life but I don&#x27;t take them because I think they are too dangerous.<p>A dose of benzos that is enough to knock a normal person on the floor passed out just makes me feel normal.')
