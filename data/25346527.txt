While it would be obvious in network traffic if they sent back plain text to their server, it is possible to encrypt txt with multiple keys, ie their key as well as the intended recipient&#x27;s.  Would something like that be able to be detected on the client side, in particular for one user?  I&#x27;m guessing yes but it would require verifying the js everytime you used their service, right?
