This is the web summit talk I was looking forward to. So part of the promise of wasm is its integration with the web api and dom. In the fractal application for example if we extend that to include a zoom function that handles mouse events and updates variables, I&#x27;m probably employing something like blazor or js-sys in rust. How will that high level integration be handled in the dev console? And is it possible to create custom visualizations? Thanks in advance ;)')
