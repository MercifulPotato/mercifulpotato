I started refusing to go to the eye doctor. He kept going. I happened to see his contacts prescription maybe six years later. His prescription was now over a diopter stronger than mine. I needed new contacts, so went to an exam about that time. My prescription was still the same, &quot;Well we&#x27;d like to bump you up a notch, but you can stay at this level if you want.&quot;<p>Further, I noticed growing up that the kids with the worst eyesight were the ones whose parents had the best insurance and could afford twice per year exams.<p>Anyway, I think glasses do irreparable harm to vision (particularly during adolescence). I think that will be borne out by research if anyone ever looks into it.<p>The myopia correction exercises do seem to help, but it&#x27;s a fickle process. If it was easy it wouldn&#x27;t be controversial.\nI would describe my experience as your baseline vision stays roughly the same, but you can learn to focus for short periods\nof time and improve your acuity by maybe 1 - 2 diopters.')
