But calling this slavery and throwing up a picture of galley rowing slaves is grossly inappropriate. People are not turned into property. This is coercion through debt. Also galleys rowers were a skilled or at least semi skilled occupation, a task rarely given to slaves and at least in the ancient world navies it commanded higher pay than infantry.')
