The author of the article credibly argues that the project is governed by a political theory (&quot;neocameralism&quot;), explained as  &quot;right-libertarianism taken to its logical conclusion&quot;. The network is described as based on a set of principles that considerably differs from common democratic principles (&quot;one person one vote&quot;) and instead posits a hierarchical structure much reminiscent of a feudal system with tiered voting rights and privileges based on (in-system) virtual property. The anti-modern gist is underlined by Yarvin quoting lead Nazi theorists (at least once) in his writings.<p>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ve missed something (but, I deliberately skipped the technology as that just seems like an outgrowth of the ideology), it is what I&#x27;ve gleaned from a quick readthrough, but my main  point here is not so much what Urbit is and wants to accomplish in detail (which seems &quot;a bit&quot; over the top  tbh)  as highlighting the category of systems that Urbit belongs to: by the users self-governed cyber-networks with internal assets that need to be distributed and ruled over in some way.<p>I expect this to be an increasing area of study moving forwards - at least I think  it should be. What are other examples of this? (not counting corporate owned systems)')
