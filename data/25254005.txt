Currently it&#x27;s a perfect fit for me in the private environment, because I keep browsers 100% jailed and all passwords out of browser context (so I wouldn&#x27;t use a  pass&lt;&gt;browser integration in any case).<p>For multi-user, however, I use 1password. Its vault sharing and management, federation under an organization, onboarding&#x2F;offboarding controls etc are a must-have when you have hundreds of people needing to share passwords. All organizations I&#x27;ve worked in before that had more than 20 users, any less-featureful alternative was absolutely not tenable. It becomes a shitshow as soon as teams cannot get SSO for internal systems under one roof and start trading credentials, or when teams have to trade API keys and so on because of disjunct secret management processes&#x2F;platforms (unifying 1000s of developers and 100s of teams doesn&#x27;t happen that fast, if at all). As of now, we have read-only vaults that internal customers can access right there on the desktop, in which we provide secrets that are being rotated, updated, etc in sync with our backend system password management, over 1password API. If 1p has one use for my team at my company presently, it&#x27;s not so much the great password management, but as a corporate-approved terminal for end-user secrets, like API keys, and so on.')
