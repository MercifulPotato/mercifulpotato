A meter is 39.3701 inches, so that would be 11,802,859,050 (11.8 billion) inches per second.<p>Now imagine a CPU trying to send a round trip electrical signal 4 billion times per second over the the RAM, over the distance of two inches (a 4 inch round trip). That&#x27;s literally 16 billion inches of distance that you are asking the electrical signal to cover in the space of a second, but we know that the electricity can only physically cover 11.8 billion inches in that second, so we would essentially have a bottleneck due to the physical restrictions of the speed of light.<p>Now imagine if you could cut that distance down from inches to cm or even millimeters... This is the benefit of having everything together on an integrated chip.')
