That’s in stark difference to the old Eclipse days as one example.<p>- Developer machines continue to get faster and have more RAM, yet most of the dev tools ecosystem seems to poorly take advantage of that. Compare the memory and processor usage of Slack (which arguable has a simpler task) with VSCode, which both use the same underlying platform (Electron). By so many apps setting such a low bar, it further enhances the view that VSCode is fast.<p>- our codebases continue to grow in size, have yet more dependencies, and yet more moving parts. Things like code completion &#x2F; doc bubbles &#x2F; etc are becoming more important as there’s just to much bloat for an average developer to keep in their “active memory”<p>- similar to the above point, our languages keep evolving constantly adding new things, making it harder to stay on top of all the new functionality, but the modern breed of IDEs can help there in a number of ways.<p>- we have a had a big wave of new developers start working over the past 15 years and some of them had NIH for things from the past, and now has reinvented what existed before, in someways better, in some ways worse.<p>I can think of more possible factors, but this is an already long post and I’m sure the ones I posted already will get debated as is.')
