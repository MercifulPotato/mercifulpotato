Section 6(b) empowers the Commission to require an entity to file “annual or special . . . reports or answers in writing to specific questions” to provide information about the entity’s “organization, business, conduct, practices, management, and relation to other corporations, partnerships, and individuals.” 15 U.S.C. Sec. 46(b). As with subpoenas and CIDs, the recipient of a 6(b) order may file a petition to limit or quash, and the Commission may seek a court order requiring compliance. If a party fails to comply with a 6(b) order after receiving a notice of default from the Commission, the Commission may commence suit in federal court under Section 10 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 50. After expiration of a thirty-day grace period, a defaulting party is liable for a penalty for each day of noncompliance. Id.; Commission Rule 1.98(f), 16 C.F.R. Sec. 1.98(f).&quot;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftc.gov&#x2F;about-ftc&#x2F;what-we-do&#x2F;enforcement-authority" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ftc.gov&#x2F;about-ftc&#x2F;what-we-do&#x2F;enforcement-authori...</a>')
