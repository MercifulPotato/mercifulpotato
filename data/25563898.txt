Thank you for sharing it!<p>I don&#x27;t really have a good, productive, use case for it right now but I really can&#x27;t wait to try it out. It looks really user friendly, fast, responsive, has a CLI, and it produces some easy to version in git latex files.<p>A while ago I wanted to create my CV in latex from scratch and gave up after days of trying to get FontAwesome to work (I wanted brand icons and other nice things), so I switched to a setup where I have a HTML webpage that looks like a paper page, and using chromium headless to &quot;print&quot; it to PDF (only works properly with chrome as other browsers have CSS incompatibilities on PDF generation, never mind the bit fart Firefox is doing on android lol). I guess I could try to replace that setup with this tool, it seems to have a export to PDF&#x2F;HTML and a CLI interface for exports. Fingers crossed all goes well and hopefully it&#x27;s customizable enough for the job. This will keep me busy&#x2F;entertained for a while :).')
