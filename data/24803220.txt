Science literacy in the general population is abysmal.  That&#x27;s just a fact.<p>Many people prefer to listen to what their morning talk show tells them than listen to the CDC.<p>This kind of ignorance could be overcome to some extent through massive information campaigns, but so far the US government at least is incapable or unwilling to do that.  If anything, on some of the highest levels it&#x27;s doing quite the opposite.<p>That kind of obviously harmful attitude is not just ignorant, it&#x27;s borderline malicious.<p>People certainly have and will probably continue to die because of it.')
