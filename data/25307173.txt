In some jobs workers are given 20 PTO days to use as sick or vacation as they please. In other jobs workers are give 10 vacation days and 10 sick days.<p>I was saying that it seems better to have the PTO days to use however you want than sick days that aren&#x27;t supoosed to be used for non-sickness reasons.<p>Are you saying that it is normal for people to use the sick days when they are not really sick?<p>You mention needing to consult a doctor at a certain point. This is not uncommon in the U.S., with the employer wanting a doctor&#x27;s note after more than two days of absence. (As an aside I always thought that was a burden on the employee, to have to pay for a doctors visit because the employer doesn&#x27;t trust them. Not as big a deal if the employer would pay for  the visit, but they don&#x27;t. Certainly not a perfect world we live in...)')
