At least it hasn&#x27;t helped to keep Linux sane (what&#x27;s the use of it when it&#x27;s being pulled into vendor-dominated directions a la systemd, gnome, and k8s?). Nor has it stopped the mass enslavement of business, users, and devs into &quot;The Cloud&quot;. Nor has it stopped Linux to become world&#x27;s largest spynet (Android).<p>GNU started with the goal of bringing free&#x2F;open alternatives to a Unix&#x2F;POSIX-like user-space, dev tools environment, and operating system, out of a sense of freedom and a strong distaste towards playing to the tune of big players. F&#x2F;OSS was never about innovation, so with Linux and the (shortly later opened-up) BSD being excellent alternatives in the mid&#x2F;late-90s, where&#x27;s the noble goal today, when F&#x2F;OSS is abundant &quot;on github&quot;, and cloud providers are taking advantage of it?')
