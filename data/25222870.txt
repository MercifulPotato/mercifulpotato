When the fascists arrived to the islands, they were hostile to the residents. And then hell broke loose, and Galtieri was at war with the UK, US and NATO. A complete lunatic. Once the war started, the propaganda machinery took over. People fighting the dictator didn&#x27;t want this war, but knew very well it would weaken the Military junta.<p>&gt; Do you really think Galtieri would have gone for any kind of political settlement<p>No. The ERP (People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army) and Montoneros were fighting against Galtieri, in the streets of Buenos Aires, so the Military Junta needed a distraction. However, my mom always said that the only person who could stop that war was Lady Di. She was very popular in Argentina, people used to compare her with Evita. Maybe my mom was wrong, she was a bit of dreamer after all.<p>&gt; The big mistakes by the Brits were made beforehand by not taking seriously the noises being made by the junta<p>True. Galtieri never thought England would go to war. I&#x27;m not sure why, probably because he had bad intel, or was a complete sociopath.<p>&gt; Itâ€™s very sad that what was once a strong relationship between the two nations went downhill with Peron<p>Yes, it&#x27;s sad. After Peron everything went downhill. My mom is an English teacher, and was born in Argentina. She loves the English culture and people (Ladi Di, Churchill, etc), and the war did not change any of that, but deep inside I think she feels betrayed by England (by Tatcher, the media, and even the Queen). But she knows very well what happened and why, and finds comfort in thinking that the war helped restore democracy in her country. She was a proud Montonera <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Montoneras" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Montoneras</a><p>All the best!')
