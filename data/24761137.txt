I would be surprised if a competition typist, presented with an already-shortened text, couldn&#x27;t beat out most stenotype stenographers working off the original text.<p>It would be unfair for a typing competition to exclude a chorded keypad, and I don&#x27;t know of they do or not. It&#x27;s completely fair to not accept &quot;ts cmptly fr&quot; as the transcription of &quot;it&#x27;s completely fair&quot;, no matter how it&#x27;s typed in.')
