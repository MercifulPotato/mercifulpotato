Shkreli is a bona fide Rennaissance man, and I certainly do not hold this gesture against him. I am tempted even to call it charity.<p>&gt; Besides, Shrkeli is in prison for securities fraud unrelated to his pharma shenanigans, so how does that work when he&#x27;s actually a terrific person?<p>His &quot;financial crimes&quot; are nearly universally acknowledged even in this thread to have been contrived by his political enemies in retaliation for his more famous antics which were unambiguously legal. The case they brought against him was an absolute joke, and he would have been acquitted of all eight charges (instead of just five!) if he had been given a fair trial. Then, to further make the crooked lawfare obvious, they absolutely slammed him at sentencing with an outrageous ruling that departed dramatically from federal guidelines and rulings in similar cases, including those involving his &quot;co-conspirators&quot;! It was an unambiguous &quot;f_ck you&quot; to an American hero who deserves nothing but respect and admiration. He rose into wealth and prominence in a highly technical field despite coming from virtually nothing by the force of sheer talent and motivation, and the established powers that be were really rubbed the wrong way. This is all yet another sad case of feelings of inferiority by bug-souled racists clashing with pvre Albanian Excellence.')
