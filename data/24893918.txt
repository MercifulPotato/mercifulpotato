GitLab is an international entity regardless of where it is registered, because it presumes to be a platform for (some forms of) interaction and information sharing for people in many countries. It is implicitly agreed between users and the entity behind the website that it is accessible and usable by everyone.<p>&gt; Why should one country not allowed etc.<p>It is not about &quot;allowing&quot;, in the sense that I&#x27;m not in control of the US and what it does, we are discussing what is morally acceptable. And it is not morally acceptable for individual states to disrupt people&#x27;s lives using the aspects of inter-dependency of people, groups and organizations across state boundaries - except according to norms which are accepted and defensible at the global level.')
