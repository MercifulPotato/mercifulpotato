They&#x27;ve got projections out to at least a year, but uncertainty becomes too great after that. It may last quite a long time, we don&#x27;t really know.<p><i>for the same reasons we get annual flu vaccinations</i><p>No. We get annual flu vaccinations because flu viruses mutate significantly and quickly, so we&#x27;re always getting vaccinated against <i>new</i> threats.
