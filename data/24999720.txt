And yeah, it&#x27;s faster for nearly the same price (though due to timing I paid ~$230 so it&#x27;s not insignificant when compared to the launch day pricing.)<p>There&#x27;s &quot;always&quot; more, more, more performance for the dollar in tech, and there is no perfect price&#x2F;performance product. The Ryzen 5 3600 was and still is a great price&#x2F;performance product and that doesn&#x27;t change because a more expensive, higher performing chip is released.<p>You can make decisions at a point in time, or if time is irrelevant, you can keep waiting for new milestones... and then make a decision in that point of time instead.<p>For me, I waited nearly 10 years to replace a 3+ Ghz quad-core CPU, so the 4+ Ghz octa-core was a nice upgrade (albeit still not earth shattering) and I am very glad to have it. I love the recent increase in performance growth over time, but it will likely be quite a few years before I upgrade my desktop again. Of course, I&#x27;m just one guy, and I&#x27;m glad many enthusiasts and computer-using professionals will benefit from all this advancement!')
