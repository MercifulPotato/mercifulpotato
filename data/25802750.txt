There is no need for verbosity once you experienced a problem recently (which is what happens most of the time)<p>The errors deserve both variants, short and terse, just not on the same place (I don&#x27;t want spams in terminal or logs). Short variant should provide some form of id that can be looked at for more details:<p>cat(e123): file not found<p>e123 could be searched in detailed error message document.')
