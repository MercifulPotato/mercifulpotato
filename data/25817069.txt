I&#x27;ve seen sites, optionally (you still have to turn the feature on), requiring a 72 hours delay before any setup change is taken into account (like, say, a password change). During this time a warning is sent by email and you can at any time during these 72 hours, unilaterally, prevent the change from happening.<p>So it may be &quot;game over&quot; in that the attacker can login and see all you account&#x2F;activity&#x2F;data (which, yes, is really bad) but it&#x27;s not totally &quot;game over&quot; as in it doesn&#x27;t mean &quot;logged out of your account&quot; (unless the attacker also compromised your email ofc, but now we&#x27;re talking about something else).')
