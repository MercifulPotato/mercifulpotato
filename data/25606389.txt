You can be arrested for probable cause, i.e. if the police <i>think</i> you committed a crime, even if you committed no crime. You can have your day in court later if you&#x27;re innocent, but you certainly can&#x27;t fight or try to escape.<p>Unless you think it&#x27;s also bad that the police can detain people who haven&#x27;t committed a crime &#x2F; should allow people being arrested to fight back and escape?')
