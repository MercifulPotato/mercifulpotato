Then stretch the rubber band. The dots aren&#x27;t moving, but the distance between them is growing. That&#x27;s the big bang.<p>During the big bang, the distance between things increased at speeds faster than the speed of light. They didn&#x27;t move at all (no FTL movement), just new space existed between everything. Still happening now, just at a slower pace (but a pace that seems to be increasing?).<p>Why? Answer that definitively and you&#x27;ll earn yourself a Nobel prize or two.')
