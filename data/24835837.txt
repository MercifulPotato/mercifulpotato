We were supposed to have a lot more widespread fiber to the home for instance, and I think we still pay a little more than many other countries.<p>However by now in 2020, I believe the majority of the US has access to internet over cable tv lines&#x2F;docsis instead of dsl with speeds more like 100mbps, with up to 1 or 2 gbps available in big metros for $70 a month. I know many rural areas are still underserved, and of course not every household is subscribed to internet service, but it seems to be available in most places.<p>Iâ€™m really surprised internet in the UK seems to be an order of magnitude or more slower for such a large percentage of the population.')
