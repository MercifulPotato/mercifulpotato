He created this chair that was sort of like the device from the Lawnmower Man, the patient would get strapped in and spun around until the particle dislodged. It worked great, but was a bit too silly (and the company too poorly run) to get investors.<p>So… maybe just for fun, go outside and do cartwheels, tumble down a few hills like a child? Ride some roller-coasters after quar is over? Couldn’t hurt.')
