Just 0.001% chance that you will be killed vs 99+% chance that you won&#x27;t. Believe me, you don&#x27;t want to be tossing this coin in a macro scale OR way too many times.<p>That has to be some kind of named law: As the volume of a system increases, tolerance for failure decreases. Used in cases of: 1% failure of a hundred might be acceptable, but 1% failure of a million isn&#x27;t.')
