All summer the uniform is long sleeve shirt w&#x2F;under shirt.  Light jacket for evenings&#x2F;outings.  Light to moderate wind.  Only a week or so of hot&#x2F;90F temperatures.<p>It&#x27;s turning toward winter now, so we&#x27;re adding a sweater and water-resistant jacket.  Moderate winds. I&#x27;ve never needed a down coat.<p>In other words, we can pretty easily socialize outside and&#x2F;or keep windows open, so any Covid virus tends to quickly disperse.')
