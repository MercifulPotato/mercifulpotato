From your link: “Specifically, partition-intolerant systems must sacrifice invariants when partitions occur. Which invariants?”<p>The answer in this case is that availability is sacrificed, unless Amazon is making a very misleading claim of strong consistency (per the submission title&#x2F;link). So it’s CP.<p>In case “not fully partition tolerant” is what is throwing you off, all I mean by that is that there are likely network partitions of the S3 nodes that will not cause outward failure (e.g. partition of a single node), though some will (e.g. too many partitions to form a quorum, or whatever their underlying consensus implementation relies on).')
