For me, my laptop is the only device I own that needs a big 100w adapter, everything else can share smaller adapters.<p>And one big benefit of the current USB-C era is that 15-18W power adapters are more ubiquitous than ever, and compact enough that there&#x27;s almost never any reason to use a smaller one anymore. And more and more devices are not coming with their own power adapter these days, which is better for the environment and simplifies my life, every usb-c device I own can be charged by the same chargers and will charge quickly.<p>It&#x27;s way better than each device coming with its own adapter of arbitrary shape that may or may not be able to be plugged in without blocking the adjacent socket on the wall or power strip, with seemingly arbitrary max power output, with an arbitrary choice of using usb A&#x2F;mini&#x2F;micro connector.')
