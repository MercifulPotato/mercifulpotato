The cutting-edge technologies backing this standard, like big data, cloud computing, and blockchain are already ready today to take on this huge responsibility.<p>Looks like Jack is not being entirely honest here. Blockchains are not a &quot;green&quot; technology.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s also interesting to see what relatively mild comments could trigger this kind of reaction when power is so centralized.<p>There was nothing mild about his comments.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marxists.org&#x2F;reference&#x2F;archive&#x2F;mao&#x2F;selected-works&#x2F;volume-1&#x2F;mswv1_16.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.marxists.org&#x2F;reference&#x2F;archive&#x2F;mao&#x2F;selected-work...</a><p>I haven&#x27;t read &quot;Mao&#x27;s thoughts&quot; on the distinction between practice and theory (c.f. Jack Ma on &quot;documents&quot; vs &quot;policy&quot; &quot;experts&quot;). For God&#x27;s sakes, this is Communist China, a Marxist party, and a country with a tradition of proverbial parsing of tea leaves for hidden and subtle meaning. And it is a direct attack on the very purpose of the Party. Manage the country&#x27;s growth and future!<p>--<p>So, what is Jack Ma&#x27;s thought crime? What is the issue with his &quot;empiricist&quot; mindset?<p>&quot;There were also a number of comrades who were empiricists and who for a long period restricted themselves to their own fragmentary experience and did not understand the importance of theory for revolutionary practice or see the revolution as a whole, but worked blindly though industriously.&quot; - Mao Tse-tung')
