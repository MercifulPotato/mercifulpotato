There is zero <i>hard forensic evidence</i> that it existed in a lab somewhere before the uncontrolled outbreak. If such evidence did exist, the PRC would never let it see the light of day anyway. There is, however, plenty of circumstantial evidence.<p>Remember that guy who said we should treat the Hunter Biden story as if it was a foreign disinfo op, even if it probably isn&#x27;t? Yeah, that was crazy, but I actually see similar logic here. If the virus was engineered, that&#x27;s really really bad for the world. It&#x27;s like Iran suddenly making a nuke under everyone&#x27;s nose... except if Iran had the largest population and largest economy in the world. It&#x27;s so insanely important that even a tiny chance that it is true--like 0.1%--is enough to warrant strong diplomatic pressure on China to be totally transparent about the early days of the virus.<p>As someone else pointed out, it doesn&#x27;t have to be engineered--China has already shown that it has a cache of previously unrevealed viral samples, so it could also just be a natural virus found on one of Dr. Shi&#x27;s hunting expeditions that got loose from the lab.')
