I keep installed (and updated) the NoRoot Firewall app, which by default blocks all access.<p>I also added to my mix the Nova Launcher. It makes it easier to tap&amp;hold an app icon, gives you a quick shortcut straight to the specific app&#x27;s Settings --&gt; Apps --&gt; specific app&#x27;s properties, in which I (usually) block access to data&#x2F;wifi&#x2F;roaming&#x2F;background (e.g. for a QR Code reader app).<p>90% of my apps do not need to reach out to the interweb, and I block them both on Settings as well as Block Data&#x2F;Wifi on NoRoot Firewall.<p>Although Huawei is beeing Huawei-ing (some sneaky apps are running).. I do like the interface into &quot;Manually&quot; managing backround running (battery), internet access.')
