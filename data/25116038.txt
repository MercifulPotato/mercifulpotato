Swedes practice social distancing in regular daily life. Also, it is a very introverted, borderline anti social type of society.<p>I had a couple of French co-workers that said it was very hard to form friendships outside work there (in Stockholm), while in the US (NYC) they had no problem.<p>Compare this to Italy, Spain, France, Greece, Albania, or other Mediterranean countries, which are polar opposite.  People are friendlier, that talk to each other more, they hug, they kiss more.<p>If you go to smaller towns, you regularly see older people hanging out with each other, playing chess and socializing.  You just don&#x27;t see that in Sweden. I think this is one of the main reasons that some countries like Germany and Sweden are not fairing that bad, but the south gets hit harder.<p>Also, from my understanding, many folks in Sweden are practicing some form of social distancing, and many are working from home when they can.  It is a &#x27;voluntary&#x27; type of thing.  Swedes tend to follow civi rules well in general, and are a homogeneous society, so I think that is contributing to the lower rates of transmission as well.<p>while the US attitude varies from wear a mask, to &#x27;don&#x27;t take my freedom away&#x27;, i do what i want, type of attitude.<p>Ps. Here is what bus line looks like in Sweden (before the pandemic):  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.redd.it&#x2F;4q36jg5ofi831.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.redd.it&#x2F;4q36jg5ofi831.jpg</a><p>Their culture just wants&#x2F;respects people spaces more, and are more &#x27;introverted&#x27; by nature.  Swedes are friendly&#x2F;polite, but not necessary &#x27;warm&#x27;. And you can see with their social interactions as well. Hope that makes sense.<p>Good luck trying to replicate that type of distancing in most of the Europe or the US unless it is mandated (i.e. you will get kicked out of a store if you don&#x27;t respect the line).')
