It seems self evident to me.<p>I post this idea on HN every now and then when I see the subjects of cancer, aging, or death come up.<p>&gt; Would you know how difficult it would be to do right now?<p>Incredibly difficult. This is an Apollo project.<p>You&#x27;d need egg donors, good embryo yields, a protocol that sustains life throughout development, womb surrogates, decephalization that doesn&#x27;t kill, life support systems at every stage, birthing, machines to keep them alive after birth, ...<p>Once you&#x27;ve worked out the kinks though, this thing prints money. But that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s exciting to me - this gets us one step closer to ending death.<p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve taken a single step in that direction yet, so it&#x27;d be nice to finally get started.')
