In that case, they&#x27;d be happy to pay for their users to anonymously download it.<p>This has hit us big-time last week -- all our k8s components are hosted on DockerHub and our firm is happy to do publisher-paid pulls, but it seems to not be an option. Instead, every customer is expected to get a paid account (if they pass some download threshold, which they may or may not.)<p>What are others doing? We&#x27;re thinking of moving to Azure Container Registry or Amazon Elastic Container Registry. We&#x27;re happy to pay just to ensure customers are not randomly throttled, though I wish we could just keep it all in DockerHub (we&#x27;d be fine paying DockerHub for customer usage, but we cant force customers to do so themselves.)')
