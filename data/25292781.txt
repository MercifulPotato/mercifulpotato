We are literally in a space where no-body is in the office today. You could pick up a $130 ~ $160k job anywhere and move out to a suburb in Texas. All you need is half-decent Internet, and you&#x27;d basically be living as if you were making the $200k you had in The Valley.</i><p>You&#x27;re talking to someone who is homeless, who probably hasn&#x27;t been able to bathe in a while given the pandemic, and who is probably wearing clothes that they&#x27;ve slept in for several years now.<p>Yes, there are employers that will hire people literally off the street, but they aren&#x27;t hiring for $130-$160k IT jobs, they&#x27;re hiring for manual labor jobs without benefits that are probably off the books and can&#x27;t offer steady hours.')
