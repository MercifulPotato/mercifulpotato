CBC-mode cannot perform 2-AES iterations in parallel. You need to use CTR-mode.<p>CTR-mode however has been largely subsumed by GCM (Galois Counter Mode), and all of a sudden you need to learn Galois fields anyway (which AES is an excellent case-study in GF(2^8)).<p>------<p>AVX512 performs 4x AES-instructions per clock tick by the way, to fill up the entire 512-bit register. You&#x27;re only reaching that parallelism with CTR mode or GCM mode.')
