The &quot;heavyweight&quot; part of it disappears when you&#x27;re using software which handles all this in the background.<p>The remaining parts of it is the unexpected results for someone who hasn&#x27;t used this sort of note taking system. The book &quot;How to Take Smart Notes&quot; explains this. You use the notes as a starting point to come up with new ideas. It&#x27;s useful if you do regular writing, especially as part of work rather than for personal private stuff.<p>For example, I use this method for jokes. Much of the value is simply having a list in one place. If I want to come up with a new joke, I look at all my material as a branching tree. I can extend a branch by going deeper. I can combine branches to come up with something completely different. I can start green branches. I can write new material all day long by doing this, rather than by waiting for inspiration to nail me.<p>I think people get too caught up in the technical parts. It&#x27;s just a branching system of ideas.')
