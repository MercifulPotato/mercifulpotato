I found the highest rpm I could run without hearing the fans and set the two lowest points in the curve to keep it at&#x2F;under that point and I almost never hear my fans anymore. Only time I really hear them now is when something is compiling and even then it&#x27;s much more bearable since I keep the highest rpm limited to 80&#x2F;85%.')
