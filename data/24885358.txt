They have 2.7bn MAU, and even the people who no longer use the service probably still have accounts. They almost certainly have an account on 80% of all the people in the developed countries in the world.<p>Like, most of their recent growth has come from the developing world, because they subsidise internet access to juice the user numbers for the Street. They&#x27;re not doing it to make money today, it&#x27;s all about making sure that they are ubiquitous.<p>&gt; 3)Your biggest problem is that you can’t think of creative ways to use data. Game libraries and play spaces can give more information on user income levels, user activity on Oculus helps Facebook understand how much of their users time is spent in games typically outside of Facebooks purview (there’s no tracking cookies in Steam games), the hours of operation of the device can give information about a persons occupational status, etc.<p>You are wildly underestimating the data that FB get from web&#x2F;app tracking. Consider, if you&#x27;re a gamer you probably visit game websites for socialisation or advice. The <i>only</i> benefit of the account stuff (from an ads perspective) is being able to sell access to Oculus users to Oculus app makers.<p>Like, FB already get pings from pretty much every website and app in existence, so they already know where people spend their time, no need for Oculus for that.<p>I personally think that tying Oculus to FB is a terrible idea which will get them in loads of trouble from an anti-trust perspective, but they&#x27;re almost certainly doing it to reduce costs, rather than to get gamers data (which they already have, btw).')
