Most users, especially gamers who often have higher-spec machines then normal users, don&#x27;t care about RAM usage.<p>Plus there&#x27;s an underappreciated aspect of having really good text channels tied in with the servers, meaning people have a reason to be looking at the server and who&#x27;s on voice outside of active calls&#x2F;voice channels.<p>(EDIT: Forgot to add, server downtime seems to be a regional thing. I&#x27;m unfortunately on Discord almost every night; there&#x27;s occasional degraded periods but otherwise I can normally assume it just works.)')
