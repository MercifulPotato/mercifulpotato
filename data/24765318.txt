While having a relevant education usually beats not having one, real-world experience usually beats theoretical knowledge when it comes to achieving real-world gains. E.g. if I want something computed as quickly as possible I&#x27;m probably better off asking an average game engine programmer than an average CS professor, since they&#x27;ll optimize for cache efficiency and branch prediction rather than just big O notation.')
