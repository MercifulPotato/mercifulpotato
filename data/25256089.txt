The A500 was nothing more than a cost reduced A1000 - no new features. The A2000 was nothing more than an A1000 with expansion slots. The A2500 was a couple extra boards, not a new model. The A3000, my favorite machine, was effectively a cost reduced A2500, combining the 68030 accelerator board and SCSI onto the motherboard. Again, nothing new.<p>So after 7 years, all we had were expansion slots and faster CPUs. The OCS -&gt; ECS chipset upgrade was very minor. That&#x27;s basically it.<p>Finally, at the end of 1992, the AGA machines (Amiga 1200 and 4000) were released. We finally had upgraded graphics that didn&#x27;t even keep pace with SuperVGA. The A1200 was also totally gimped with no fast memory and a slow 68020 that was now over 8 years old...')
