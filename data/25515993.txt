The hyperinflation episode took place in 1922-1923, Nazi&#x27;s took power in 1933. It&#x27;s a bit like blaming Bill Clinton for the slow 2010s recovery.<p><i>The scale of the cutback that Brüning enacted from 1930 to 1932 is truly staggering. The authors estimate that Brüning cut German government spending by about 15 percent, after inflation, from 1930 to 1932. He raised income taxes on high earners by an average of 10 percent, and slashed unemployment, pension, and welfare benefits. The economic consequences were horrific. GDP fell by 15 percent, as did government revenue. Unemployment increased from 22.7 percent to 43.8 percent. Brüning came to be known as the “Hunger Chancellor.” </i>')
