Reading up on it it seems to enable generic code deduce info or assume info about stuff (as in assert). Rust uses proper traits for that instead, basically having lifted traits to a first-class language feature. But there is only a barebones set of traits available in the standard library, mostly the ones needed for language or std features. Any traits only needed for generic libraries are left to crates to implement.')
