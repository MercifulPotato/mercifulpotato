Not to mention my PC is better than any console even though the GPU costs as much as a retail PS5. If I was on the console upgrade cycle I could wait until PS6 to upgrade my computer. That&#x27;s a portion of the PS4 cycle and all of the PS5 cycle for ~$1200 (no need to upgrade storage and other accessories for a new build).<p>People on the high end could even wait 2 console cycles to refresh.')
