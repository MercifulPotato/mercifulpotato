The damage this has done cannot be quantified. The ideal way to have gone about this is involvement of Courts&#x2F;Legislature to decide if Parler should be banned or not. Not a group of private companies deciding to fuck a competitor. It is a horrible horrible precedent which has absolutely zero excuses.')
