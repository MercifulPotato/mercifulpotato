But so far we didn&#x27;t hear many complaints about this feature from the users. The main problem is in forgetting to version code that changed. But the system has protections against such cases.<p>It doesn&#x27;t end up in spaghetti code as old branches are proactively removed after they are not needed anymore. Temporal provides APIs that allow to count number of workflows using each version.<p>I don&#x27;t think it is a leaky abstraction as it is indeed a part of the business logic of deciding how old version of the state should become a new one. I don&#x27;t think there is a generic solution that allows implicitly migrate old state to a new state on any long running computation.')
