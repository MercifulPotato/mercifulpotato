I try to meditate, read tech news and listen to Javascript lectures. I can&#x27;t reliably schedule meetings in the morning due to sometimes not falling asleep until 6-7am. Hack your environment to remove blue light.<p>-Pain. Basically, my only available option is narcotics, which I refuse to take for obvious reasons. Meditation, acupuncture helps.<p>The stress comes from how others react to me. They don&#x27;t see the behind the scenes, so I&#x27;m just some young, rather unprofessional-looking guy, making halfway attempts. I chose to ignore that completely, because at the end of the day, none of these people are helping the situation in any way.<p>It surely helps to have a never-ending will to go forward, on step at a time.<p>One piece of advice I would give is to focus on positive stuff. It&#x27;s all too often very easy to  find the negatives. Don&#x27;t take the easy route.')
