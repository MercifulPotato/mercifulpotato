Daily, brutal beatings in front of small children that make your blood turn cold.<p>The victim has been going the legal route for months now and has the police actively engaged. But, as we both know, the police are there after the fact and aren&#x27;t able to really do much until something terrible happens again.<p>The abuser is a highly skilled software engineer with a decade+ of white&#x2F;grey hat experience. This person is now using their professional skills to stalk their spouse.<p>We purchased the victim a new phone under my name with no connection to the old account. We&#x27;re setting up a new Google account now (Android phone) that&#x27;s not connected to the old account. Will be changing the email associated to all social&#x2F;messaging accounts and set up app-based MFA going forward on everything. Password manager with randomly generated passwords for all accounts.<p>Thinking of setting up this new android device with MDM under a new GSuite account. Hoping this will give an added layer of protection over phishing attacks the abuser may send.<p>I&#x27;ll be doing some education with the victim on phishing attacks, etc. to make sure they don&#x27;t click on any random links.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if you all have any additional advice? Have you ever helped someone in a similar situation? Basically looking to crank up this non-technical person&#x27;s op-sec to exceed what someone who knows &quot;everything&quot; can reasonably crack.<p>Thank you!')
