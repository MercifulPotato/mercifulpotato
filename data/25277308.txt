Finished off coding a couple of days ago. I only used it with a bunch of old pytorch projects for testing on Lambda Labs cloud. I plan to use it for training some NLP models, that are too slow for my home GPU setup.<p>For now, starting servers, copying their ips&#x2F;hostnames to the configuration files and stopping servers when training finishes seem is tedious. I think I will integrate it to the AWS (and other cloud) api so that you can automate starting and terminating servers.')
