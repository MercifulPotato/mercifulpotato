Budget ones can be had for a couple hundred dollars and they still beat phone cameras. \n• Cook something with your friends, or go out and eat dinner.\n• Play some board games, join a dungeon and dragons game. A great thing to do when the weather is bad. \n• If you have children, spend some screen free, activity free time with them. You could just chat, teach them spontaneous new skills, or explore together. \n• Have a maker itch but don’t want to look at a screen? Play around with physical hardware. Get a soldering iron, some components from Digikey, and make something yourself (and have fun). \n• Go to a party, festival, or rave. \n• Drive somewhere and just camp with good company and some drinks. \n• Meet a friend or colleague spontaneously for coffee and just catch up. \n• Draw. \n• Learn renovation and make your home better, just the way you want it (and increase its value).\n• Learn how to change oil on your car and start doing maintenance yourself. Fixing a car is kinda like fixing a computer. \n• Go for a swim. \n• Go to the gym, or workout with mates.\n• Read a book. \n• Go for a walk while listening to your favourite albums.<p>Life is filled with meaningful, screen-free alternatives. You just have to appreciate them.')
