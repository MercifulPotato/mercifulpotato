Facebook enabled everyone to publish his thoughts (post news feed) and then Insta allowed everyone to be a photographer, while tiktok did the same for video creators. Clubhouse is disrupting podcasts in the same way. This was written pre Series B announcement of Clubhouse.<p>I am optimistic we will see even better social products in this decade. More privacy focused, closer to offline experiences. Its not just how -the decentralization - that is changed, but also the why of why you go on a social app.')
