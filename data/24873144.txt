Just look at the electoral college electors record. It&#x27;s been a red majority since Bush.<p>Can you clarify what you mean? Wisconsin never went for a Bush, and other than Trump&#x27;s win in 2016 it&#x27;s been voting for Democrats in presidential elections since Reagan. What electoral college record and red majority are you referring to?<p>And even if you reject all polling evidence, why is that one Trump win indicative of a solidifying shift toward Republicans, as opposed to expecting a reversion to the mean and Wisconsin going back to being a generally blue state?')
