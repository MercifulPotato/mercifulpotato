It&#x27;s not a great move to assume that conservatives are dumb.<p>There are plenty of brilliant people who hold conservative values. Their idea of &quot;success&quot; may not follow the path of others who have moved from their hometown to a coast working in IT. Or the path of those who were &quot;enlightened&quot; with advanced degrees where the sophisticated choice is obviously to be a democrat. It&#x27;s different strokes for different folks, and there are many ways to live in the United States.<p>A vote for Trump isn&#x27;t necessarily a vote <i>for</i> Trump - It can be a vote for &quot;Not Democrat.&quot; Whether or not you believe that voting &quot;Not Democrat&quot; is appropriate, it&#x27;s a far reach to say that all, or most, of those people, are idiots with racist views. This approach discounts legitimate differences that should be open to debate and should be discussed. We can&#x27;t expect the United States to last or be successful if we assume everyone in the middle of the country is an uncultured idiot who should be censored. Or assume that those who don&#x27;t share the same views must be racists who just can&#x27;t be reasoned with.<p>If Democrats somehow lost control of the primary to a less ideal celebrity candidate (and this is possible: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.london.edu&#x2F;think&#x2F;why-most-elections-are-inefficient" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.london.edu&#x2F;think&#x2F;why-most-elections-are-ineffici...</a>), there would be many democrats who choose to vote for that person because it is &quot;Not Republican.&quot; It wouldn&#x27;t matter who is on the ticket as long as it is &quot;Not Republican&quot; because a republican choice would be dumb, racist, and unsophisticated.<p>I grew up in the rust belt, I&#x27;ve lived in the most diverse city in the country (Houston, TX), and I&#x27;ve lived in Cambridge, MA. People are largely the same all over the country - they care about being left alone with the right to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. How they define those things differs (e.g., is a fetus &quot;alive&quot;?), but as long as people have those rights protected, then it&#x27;s all good.<p>But we need laws where these rights come into conflict: if someone&#x27;s pursuit of happiness involves owning slaves, this is in direct conflict with another&#x27;s right to life and liberty. And they are ordered in importance - life &gt; liberty &gt; pursuit of happiness. So obviously, slavery should be outlawed. But other things aren&#x27;t that clear. Federal legislation doesn&#x27;t impact everyone evenly, and those who are impacted should have a voice. Assuming every &quot;Not Democrat&quot; (or &quot;Not Republican&quot; or &quot;Not X&quot;) voice is a racist, dumb person who should be silenced or ignored is a fast path to division and the collapse of a functioning Democracy.')
