To be sure you aren’t overwriting the wrong drive, you need to read the command before executing it — and you don’t need echo for that, just pause for a second before hitting Enter — and you need to know which drive is which, and that requires running a different command, or using eg. &#x2F;dev&#x2F;disk&#x2F;* instead of &#x2F;dev&#x2F;sd??.')
