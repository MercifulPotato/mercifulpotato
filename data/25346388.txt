Very corporate, not very soulful. Especially the big blank aluminum surface. The head band also looks rather plasticky. \nThe british stuff, eg from B&amp;W, has more elegance. Combine with nordic minimalism and maybe some natural materials like leather and it would be more appealing. But I&#x27;m sure they are technically superior.')
