As a frequent cyclist&#x2F;pedestrian, I&#x27;ve felt for some time that a low, consistently-applied automatic fine would go a long ways toward eliminating traffic behaviours which are mostly low-incident at present because vulnerable road users have trained themselves into hyper-defensiveness and basically know to jump out of the way. To some extent, this is even in the official messaging, with campaigns about how road safety is a &quot;shared responsibility&quot; and so on.<p>Basically, things like speeding in neighbourhoods, entering a crosswalk before all peds are off the roadway, running red lights and stop signs, right turn on red without coming to a full stop first, etc.<p>Currently in my city these things are all pretty much completely unenforcedâ€” the fines are in the hundreds of dollars are and only applied when someone is actually hit. This breeds a driver mentality of &quot;well, it doesn&#x27;t matter what I do as long as I don&#x27;t hit anyone&quot; which in turn makes the roads a less safe place to be for everyone. The fines are where they are partly as a deterrent, but also because the cost of enforcement is so astronomical when it requires multiple personnel on a special operation.<p>I feel that if the fine was in the $10-30 range, but it was applied consistently on every single offense, drivers would quickly train themselves out of doing these things. (This is the swift-certain-fair philosophy, see: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nnscommunities.org&#x2F;strategies&#x2F;swift-certain-fair&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nnscommunities.org&#x2F;strategies&#x2F;swift-certain-fair&#x2F;</a>)<p>Anyhow, I know that plate != driver, and there&#x27;s a bunch of existing case law around protecting drivers&#x27; &quot;right&quot; to get away with endangering themselves and others by disregarding traffic rules. But given how much of a step beyond plate-recognition a facial-recognition system would be, I&#x27;m interested to speculate if there might be more of an appetite for this kind of thing down the road.')
