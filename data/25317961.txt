Item(by='lowdose', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607199874, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25316263, text='<i>&quot;Once upon a time in Hollywood&quot;</i> is the best movie of all time because it is completely about the career of Clint Eastwood and his uncredited stuntmen. For example the flamethrower is about Clint Eastwoods nazi role in <i>Where Eagles Dare</i>[0] where he is on camera with a flamethrower he holds as a gun. Cinephiles completely missed the meaning of this master piece. Watch <i>Once upon a time in Hollywood</i> again with Clint in mind<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;pRHqtbt3ORc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;pRHqtbt3ORc</a>')
