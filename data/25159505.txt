Just because it&#x27;s not guaranteed to be true doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s unpredictable. Like, you can&#x27;t guarantee that the file for a Rails controller exists in `app&#x2F;controllers&#x2F;`, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that they are randomly scattered across every directory of the project. It also doesn&#x27;t mean that every developer puts them in a different folder depending on their personality. Sometimes you need to read carefully to determine the exact behaviour, but you only need rules of thumb to quickly navigate around a project.')
