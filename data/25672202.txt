You are missing my point.<p>There are many myths from many cultures that seek describe where we came from or how we ought to live. For example, nearly every culture has some story about the creation of man&#x2F;the earth. They all cannot possibly be true. I&#x27;m sure we can agree that man&#x2F;the earth wasn&#x27;t created as many times as there are stories about it.<p>So <i>you</i> are making claims about truth! How can you square the above with your belief in your own religion using the thought paradigm you outlined above? By claiming that <i>your</i> creation story is true (or as you may put it, &quot;not proven false&quot;) you are also making a claim that all others are not true. A claim you have just argued cannot be made... It&#x27;s <i>all</i> a fallacy.<p>The most interesting question worth answering is: Why do you believe the myths that you do?<p>Statistically speaking, the answer is because it is the one your parents believed. It&#x27;s hard to explain away the eerie correlation between a person&#x27;s religion and where they were born. Why <i>is</i> it that a child born in the Middle-East is so likely to follow Islam, a child in the West Christianity, in India Hindu, etc. etc.? It&#x27;s almost as if these religions are a product of the <i>people</i>, not some greater truth.<p>And for what it&#x27;s worth, I see no meaningful difference between something that is false and something that cannot be proven to be true:<p>&quot;There are 2,145,124,152 birds in flight above the earth right now.&quot; - do you believe me?<p>&quot;Jesus Christ just came down and told me personally that Hindu is the one true religion&quot; - do you believe me?<p>&quot;I just saw a red 2018 Toyota 4Runner drive past my house&quot; - do you believe me?<p>&quot;One of the above claims it true&quot; - do you believe me?<p>What role does &quot;faith&quot; play when appraising the above questions? Are you applying &quot;faith&quot; in the same way to the above as you do to your religion? Probably not.')
