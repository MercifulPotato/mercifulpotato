The thing about Musk is that when even 5% of his hype comes to fruition, substantial positive change follows.  Can you say the same about your employer, or about yourself?<p>Yes, in many respects he behaves like a stereotypical rich eccentric whackjob, somebody who will probably end up in Howard Hughes&#x27;s old hotel suite surrounded by bottles of his own urine.  It sucks that any defense of Musk inevitably has to be framed with a disclaimer like that.  But like Hughes, he gets important shit done when nobody else is even willing to try, and he isn&#x27;t afraid to place long bets on long shots.')
