Cases that work this way are better because they give you a new bezel made of rubber above the screen to cushion a fall.<p>Now, maybe Apple wants to convince people that a case that doesn&#x27;t actually protect the screen is a good case. It decidedly is not, but I wouldn&#x27;t put it past them.')
