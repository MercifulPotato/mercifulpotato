The grocery shortages were one sign but also think about the people who work at utilities and are responsible for keeping power&#x2F;water going.<p>Those companies typically have done some serious preparation such as segregating workers into different shifts or even having them live on site but the pandemic reminded (some) people that our modern living standards are held up by millions of people working for utilities, farms, waste disposal companies, etc. If a significant number of those people are unable to work you do need to be prepared to survive without power, running water, and fresh produce for a good amount of time. Typically middle&#x2F;upper class Americans haven&#x27;t had to contend with that fact but the pandemic has made it more clear that they won&#x27;t always be able to just pop down to the store for whatever they need at a whim.<p>Honestly waste disposal is one of the more frightening ones. I shudder at the thought of my area if the waste disposal companies stopped for any length of time. Those people who are willing to work in that job should be treated as heroes and paid much better than those of us who sit in front of computers typing relatively useless code all day.')
