It’s got usage, arg parsing, etc.<p>One thing I find incredibly useful, which doesn’t appear in the minimal template presented here (unless I’ve missed it), is the ability to run the program in a mode where it prints out debug info like variables getting set, function names and line numbers.<p>I add this to the start of every bash script:<p>if [ -n &quot;$DEBUG&quot; ]; then\n  echo &quot;$0: Setting bash option -x for debug&quot;\n  PS4=&#x27;+($(basename ${BASH_SOURCE}):${LINENO}): ${FUNCNAME[0]:+${FUNCNAME[0]}(): }&#x27;\n  set -x\nfi<p>Then to run with debug info printed just set DEBUG=1<p>Ideally there would be a debugger where you could step through code, but this is the closest I’ve found to that.')
