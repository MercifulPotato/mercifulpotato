Item(by='hardikjain29', descendants=0, kids=None, score=2, time=1604591340, title='Productivity app came 2nd on the App store on the 2nd day of its launch itslf', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I launched  a Safari extension called Hare - Spotlight for safari(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;hare-spotlight-for-safari&#x2F;id1538324606) on the App store 2 days ago and it was 2nd on the Top paid apps in the Safari Extension category and 3rd on the whole of productivity category, freaking WHOLE category.<p>It was my first ever launch on the App store and reaching that level of charts is like a dream come true for any individual developer. At first I couldn&#x27;t believe it and thought to myself that it must some kind of a glitch, at one point I convinced myself that there must be very less apps on the App store, how naive of me!\nTaking screenshots left right and center while still not believing it has indeed happened!<p>Although I am not sure of the algorithm, since it being new, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s ranked high maybe. I still am not able to see how many sales&#x2F;analytics since app connect&#x27;s data is delayed by 3 days. Will update this with the real numbers and find out what it means to be in that position in the chart!<p>Will be updating with all the numbers on my twitter. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;hardikjain29<p>Link to the app if you&#x27;d like to check it out - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;hare-spotlight-for-safari&#x2F;id1538324606<p>Cheers')
