Despite what you see in movies, high-G maneuvers aren’t what defeat radar-guided missiles and they’re not the bread and butter of dogfights either (which are all but a thing of the past).<p>They sure do look good at airshows though.<p>At the end of the day, if you’re a bomb or missile truck, you’re simply not going to outmaneuver a solitary missile that can perform 20G turns. You’re <i>vastly</i> better off minimizing your radar signature and taking out enemy radar sources using SEAD, at which point you can fly with impunity.')
