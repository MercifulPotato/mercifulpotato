This syntax will still be there after many now popular languages will long have been forgotten and replaced with other languages. In this respect, learning it is a safe investment.<p>Regarding opportunity cost of time investment, also take into account that, even though learning a lower-level language will first save you time in comparison to Prolog, most if not all tasks you solve with lower-level languages will take longer than solving them with Prolog would take.<p>So, investment in Prolog is like an investment with compound interest: It first takes time, and then you save more and more time, freeing you for other activities.')
