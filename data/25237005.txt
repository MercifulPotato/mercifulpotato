You could put the “System” and the “Finder” inside a folder called “System Folder” at the root of the drive and that was enough for you to have a bootable disk.<p>You could name your files whatever you wanted, as one should, no magical dot 3 letters extension at the end required.<p>There was a one to one relationship between a folder and a window and the files within it. One folder had always one window showing its contents which where always arranged in the way you set up. The arrangement was even preserved if you copied it to another drive.<p>I could go on and on. Memory management, process isolation and multitasking were deeply flawed and bolted on, but the rest of the experience was incredibly simple and cohesive and hasn’t been matched since.')
