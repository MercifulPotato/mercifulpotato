Russia has only few tank divisions in working condition and equipped. Rest is  just Soviet era junk that has not moved in decades. The military modernization program has stalled.<p>Russia can defend itself just fine. What Russia can&#x27;t do is to  large scale  warfare attacking others. Any  mobilization in Russia that is not purely defensive in the nature would fail. Reservist would simply not show up to fight for Putin.')
