But very proprietary, so not for me.<p>I&#x27;m curious about it.  Its the first time in a long time that custom silicon outperforms the volume X86 manufacturers.  For a long time custom chips (Sparc&#x2F; PA-RISC&#x2F;Alpha) where the fastest, till commodity x86 chips took over being faster and cheaper and those chips are extinct.  I think it helped that there were multiple vendors of these X86 CPUs.<p>But competition is good for us. As long as there is competition we&#x27;ll get better performance for less power usage&#x2F;cost.<p>Apple silicon is not a riskless.  Apple need to continue to execute on design and hope that their manufacturer can get the yields they need.  Its on the newest chip making process, so if there is a hiccup in the supply it could cause problems.  (I think of the harddrive supply drying up 10 years ago because of earthquakes.).  Nvidia is buying ARM now, so who knows what might happen if agreements need to be negotiated.  It can give them a advantage, but they have to keep executing.')
