He had a giant 21&quot; CRT, which seemed like it weighed eighty pounds.  It was the dead of night, in the middle of winter.  We were walking on ice, carrying it together.  (We both had late-90s computer nerd biceps.)  He slipped, and with a great exertion I managed to grab his side and prevent a fall to the pavement.  Neither of us had much in the world at the time, and that sweet monitor was one of his most valuable posessions.  Needless to say, he was grateful that I&#x27;d rescued his 1600x1200 view into the future.')
