Now, let&#x27;s say amazon opened the warehouse and created higher paying jobs (like gp claimed), and the jobs now look like the following:<p>* 30 forklift drivers @ $22&#x2F;hr<p>* 500 pickers at @ $11&#x2F;hr<p>Every job&#x27;s wages went up by 10%, yet the average wage slightly fell to $11.62.')
