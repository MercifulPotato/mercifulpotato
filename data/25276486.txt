I was going to discard it right after opening - I&#x27;d been expecting it and already knew the refund was approved.<p>Right before closing the message, my eye caught the line &quot;will be displayed in your next bank account&quot; (?). That got me looking at the rest. When you read it through, the whole thing is in horrific broken English and looks like a spam&#x2F;scam.<p>I&#x27;m not really sure what to make of this. On the one hand, it doesn&#x27;t seem too critical - it&#x27;s not asking you to do anything, the meaning is obvious and a lot of people probably won&#x27;t even read it. On the other hand, it&#x27;s not exactly setting a good example or making it easy for customers to identify what is and isn&#x27;t a scam. After spotting the issues, I actually had to verify whether it was real after all - it is, the link does indeed navigate to Amazon.co.uk and the shipment number&#x2F;order number (redacted from screenshot) do indeed match the order I cancelled during shipping earlier in the week.<p>Key issues:<p>- &quot;We are writing you in relation to the cancellation request&quot; - Missing &quot;to&quot;.\n- &quot;We have refunded the order and you will receive a confirmation e-mail.&quot; - Erm, isn&#x27;t this the confirmation email? Not completely sure to be honest but I think it is.\n- &quot;You can see the refund within 5-7 working days, after the refund release, and will be displayed in your next bank account.&quot; - This line is awful. Weird mixing of tenses and I&#x27;ve no idea what &quot;your next bank account&quot; is meant to mean.\n- &quot;Click on &#x27;Your Account&#x27; that you find high right corner on Amazon website&quot; - !!!\n- &quot;Refunds and replacements are displayed on the bottom in this page.&quot; - !!!\n- &quot;We cannot read your answers reply.&quot; - Great.<p>This is a genuine Amazon email...')
