It is the narcos who create the harm. I&#x27;m 100% pro dugs and 100% against allowing narcos to thrive.<p>&gt; Actually, at the bare minimum, it removes political control of the monetary supply, leaving only fiscal policy, which may enable better long term control of public deficit by implementing a Milton Friedman like rule (whether it&#x27;s constant inflation, deflation, or nothing, all is good as long as it remains constant and predictable)<p>I don&#x27;t agree with any of that. I don&#x27;t want any of that.<p>&gt; Hackers often fall prey to black-and-white thinking. Trust isn&#x27;t binary, because you can&#x27;t fully trust an organization made of people, regardless of how &quot;good&quot; they are, or which legal constraints they have.<p>Which is why we have legal recourse.<p>It sucks to have to re-explain this from first principals, but trust is infinitely more efficient, so long as you accept some small fraction of the time you&#x27;ll get screwed. So, you create legal recourse.<p>However it&#x27;s clear you&#x27;re far more likely to get screwed over in a crypto economy with zero recourse than you are to get screwed over in a fiat economy -- separate from the fact you have recourse in a fiat economy.')
