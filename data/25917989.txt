Somehow the conventions are stuck together, and that then affects how our systems work.<p>&gt;  Postgres supports both Perl and Python extensions that run in the RDBMS process<p>But I&#x27;m talking about not having to use the RDBMS process. If I have a text file on the disk, I can use a million different programs to access it. I don&#x27;t have to run one program through another program just to open, read, write, and close the file with any program. Why don&#x27;t we design our databases to work this way?<p>&gt;  Very few people use them because running in the RDBMS process means that you can break the RDBMS process in really bad ways<p>Yes, it does sound bad. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d prefer an indirect method rather than having to wedge access through the RDBMS<p>&gt; So if you consider other processes that communicate with the database and then show views of that over other protocols, that describes most of the backend apps in the world.<p>Yep! We architect entire systems-of-systems just because the model for our data management in an RDBMS is too rigid. We&#x27;re building spaceships to get to the grocery store because we haven&#x27;t yet figured out roads and cars.')
