Item(by='stale2002', descendants=None, kids=[25600288], score=None, time=1609466173, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25599698, text='&gt; My point was that the government has control of the internet, and thereby all activity on the internet.<p>And yet, here we are, living in a world where such controls are pretty difficult to enact and simply aren&#x27;t happening.<p>Even in places where there <i>are</i> government controls over the internet, such controls are apparently not even close to perfect, on many many people are successfully able to get around them.<p>So, the evidence shows, that despite any argument that you are making about how governments might control the internet and stop anyone from ever doing anything at all that they don&#x27;t like, that is simply not happening right now to such a perfect degree that you suggest should happen, even in currently authoritarian countries.<p>&gt; We&#x27;re talking about Venezuela, which has had extreme economic damages caused by a government trying to maintain control over its population<p>And yet, despite all of that, it doesn&#x27;t really seem to be enacting extreme&#x2F;perfect control over the internet, despite many motivations to do so, that have nothing to do with crypto.<p>&gt; The comment we&#x27;re replying to said that Bitcoin is valuable in transactions with Venezuelan counter-parties because of Venezuela&#x27;s government&#x27;s damage to the domestic economy.<p>Ok, and Venezuela isn&#x27;t at all successfully preventing this damage.  They aren&#x27;t doing that.  So the evidence shows that, for some reason, Venezuela is unable or unwilling to put extreme controls on crypto, do the the consequences or difficulty of doing so.<p>Any hypothetical, or arguments that you can possibly think of, as for why Venezuela <i>should</i> put extreme controls on crypto or the internet, needs to deal with the fact that Venezuela simply isn&#x27;t doing that right now, likely for a good reason.  Because it is very difficult to do that.')
