The poster was claiming that an app’s popularity was meaningless via <i>argumentum ad populum</i> and that their chosen alternative was “correct.” It’s like arguing that everyone should replace their USD with Bitcoin. In an ideal world, perhaps, but we don’t live in an ideal world; we live in a world where popularity matters. I’m sure there are other examples of this kind of logical purism being misapplied to the real world, especially among programmers.')
