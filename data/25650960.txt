Flash survived because:<p>A) enterprises don&#x27;t upgrade or move away from technologies period (we still support IE11 and old Windows Server deployments at my current company).<p>B) Flash <i>the authoring tool</i> never got replaced. It&#x27;s not about whether or not HTML5 is up to the task of being a Flash-equivalent runtime, nobody built a replacement for Macromedia&#x2F;Adobe Flash targeting any runtime anywhere. To this day, there is not a vector animation tool on par with Flash for any platform, and that has nothing to do with the capabilities of the web.<p>People blame HTML5 when what really happened was Adobe abandoned their authoring tools and nobody built an alternative because we expected the W3C or somebody to do it for us. But a programming language will never be a replacement for a full-featured content creation tool and IDE.<p>Even WASM is not going to replace Flash unless some company or group somewhere actually sits down and writes a native program that can target it and that is actually competitive with what Flash the authoring tool offered devs. I have not seen serious effort in that direction, so if you&#x27;re hoping WASM just magically makes these problems go away, I&#x27;m a little less optimistic about that. WASM is just going to be another runtime target -- a good one, but not a replacement for an IDE.')
