The first part is between breakfast and lunch. During lockdown (like we&#x27;re about to go into again) my afternoon becomes my other, new, exhausting job of being a crappy early grade teacher while my partner works her normal job. Evening we all have dinner together, then alternate who does bath&#x2F;bedtime vs dishes&#x2F;laundry&#x2F;garbage&#x2F;etc, before going back to &quot;day&quot; job and finally sleep.')
