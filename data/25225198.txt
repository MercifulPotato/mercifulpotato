This applies both to SSDs and expansion cards...<p>Edit: It&#x27;s worth adding that your CPU(s)&#x2F;mobo must have enough PCIe lanes when trying to get max throughput. 10 SSDs would need 40 PCIe lanes dedicated to them (many consumer CPUs&#x2F;chipsets have 36 or 44 and some lanes are used for other stuff! The new AMD ThreadRipper PRO WX has 128 :-)')
