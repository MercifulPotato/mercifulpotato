Can I prove God exists? No. Similarly, I cannot prove such a claim.<p>There have been seemingly plenty of news, I&#x27;ve spoken with Iranians, etc. None of this would be enough to prove anything to someone who can&#x27;t see the writing on the wall.<p>Nonetheless, I do respect the possibility that I might be wrong, that&#x27;s why I had written <i>seemingly</i>. But it&#x27;s so likely at this point, based on what I&#x27;ve seen, observed, understand, that my comment seems good and fair.')
