Who exactly is the &quot;manager&quot;? the &quot;company&quot;?<p>In my experience, most of my reports left because of low pay. I as their &quot;manager&quot; agreed that they receive an raise which is justifiable due to their output and our team&#x27;s growth.<p>But the &quot;company&quot; is against it. In particular the CFO. Is the CFO the &quot;manager&quot; then?<p>In any case, a statement like that is almost always misleading.<p>The article is Ok though. I just wished that statement was not there.')
