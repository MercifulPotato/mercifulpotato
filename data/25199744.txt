Item(by='derekp7', descendants=None, kids=[25199797, 25199811], score=None, time=1606234405, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25199459, text='To put this in perspective (Hopefully I got the numbers correct, assuming everyone follows the convention of B=Bytes, and b=bits, and 8 bits per byte) -- I believe it is 1.2 TB, not Tb (bytes, not bits).  A quick google search shows that Netflix HD streaming is 5 Mbps (bits), which is 2.25 GB (Bytes) per hour.<p>1.2 TB per month is 40 GB per day.  Which is about 17 hours of Netflix HD per day.  Seems like a lot, but not if you have multiple family members each watching something different (so just over 4 hours of Netflix per family member).  In our case, we have a little one in the house, and Netflix is going most of the day as background for him (against my better judgement, however...).  So to help mitigate the bandwidth usage, I adjusted all the profiles on Netflix to use the lowest quality setting, turn off auto-preview, and turned off auto-play next episode -- which cut my monthly usage by 2&#x2F;3.<p>Also, a typical Linux ISO image may be about 5 GB (the one &quot;large&quot; item I typically download whenever a new CentOS or Debian&#x2F;Ubuntu is released).  So that is 8 Linux ISO&#x27;s per day, so not too bad there.<p>The only thing I haven&#x27;t measured yet is when what the kid&#x27;s Zoom class uses up, and my remote RDP sessions.  However with two adults in the house and a little one, my usage hovers around 500 GB -- but for some reason back in July I hit about 1 TB, and last month was 800GB.<p>Now if you have teens in the house, esp. if they are gamers, then I can easily seeing usage well beyond 1.2 TB.')
