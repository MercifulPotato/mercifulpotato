I&#x27;ve been using something similar called Backyard (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;backyard.co&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;backyard.co&#x2F;</a>) for game nights with friends - they&#x27;ve got video, voice and text chat with a whole host of games all in one place. I think your site would benefit from some of the same design decisions they&#x27;ve made like showing a snapshot of a game and available titles on the homepage. Also, my squad loves the backyard whiteboard since we can use it for student group projects and stuff when we&#x27;re not trying to play')
