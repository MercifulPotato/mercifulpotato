Item(by='jfengel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611164858, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25847086, text='This is a thing I hear a lot of:<p>&quot;They&#x27;re currying favour with the Democrats to avoid regulation and push back the discussion of the elephant in the room&quot;<p>I think they&#x27;re missing a more straightforward hypothesis. The worst case outcome is that there is violence coordinated on their platform -- violence that they had been warned about. They don&#x27;t want violence to happen, and they certainly don&#x27;t want it to happen using their platform.<p>This is a lousy way of currying favor. It&#x27;s very small and very belated. It&#x27;s not going to have a measurable change in their fate at the hands of regulators.<p>But if there was violence that they could have prevented, they&#x27;re going to feel very, very bad. They can&#x27;t completely prevent it, but if they did nothing whatsoever, they&#x27;ll know that they were warned. That was an abstraction until two weeks ago, and then suddenly became very, very real.<p>That also cuts off the slippery slope. They&#x27;ll worry about it again the next time the leader of the free world uses an official podium to make statements interpreted by his followers as calling for specific acts of violence. Until then -- and hopefully it&#x27;s not soon -- they&#x27;ll have no reason to apply this reasoning.')
