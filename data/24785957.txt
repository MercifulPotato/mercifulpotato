Social media is currently poisoning our country to a degree that I think it may be too late to try and draw out the fight for free speech by using free speech alone.<p>The idea is that we are supposed to be equally free to say whatever we want, regardless of our status or wealth. This has been corrupted.<p>The ability for one person to amplify their voice or ideas via hundreds or thousands of bots, paid assholes, and gullible people who lack the capacity for critical thought is a problem. It&#x27;s a big problem.<p>Truth, facts, and hoping that people can apply logic to find their way to them isn&#x27;t enough anymore and the people exploiting this advantage are getting better at it.<p>I agree that what YouTube is doing here is a slippery slope and it&#x27;s scary. However, I personally think that this is now a war for democracy, and things are going to need to be sacrificed.<p>I do not like the idea that hard, easily proven facts can be overwhelmed by voluminous bullshit. If this is allowed to continue, our country is going to die. Banning obvious bullshit, albeit akin to censorship, is NARCAN. The underlying problem exists and is dangerous, but this will keep us going long enough to hopefully find a more suitable solution.<p>I hate this.')
