Remember that once you specialize something it becomes expensive. Should a fix come to light it has to be as general as possible. The fix should solve a problem experienced by everyone if it is to be adopted en masse and cheap.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d change &#x2F; reinforce users&#x27; behaviours such as not opening attachments from e-mails they do not know (or have a good anti-virus scan their attachments OR have their SMTP server helper do that), maintain a strict software update policy and so on. The usual procedures. Quite frankly, I don&#x27;t believe this is what a good percentage of people, companies, etc do.')
