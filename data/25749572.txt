Item(by='ansible', descendants=None, kids=[25751193], score=None, time=1610470370, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25747247, text='&gt; <i>It is a low-cost, low tech way to verify that the camera is not picking up usable images.</i><p>It is definitely not <i>low cost</i>.<p>In the hardware business, we count pennies.  We count <i>fractions</i> of pennies with the costs of various components.<p>A shutter means at least one extra mechanical part, and a more complicated housing and increased assembly time at the factory.<p>You might look at a piece of plastic and think it is only a few pennies of plastic.  But by the time you get it integrated into the product, and shipped out to consumers, it can add up to a dollar of cost.  That really eats into the profits of low-margin hardware.<p>Only if enough consumers care about hardware shutters does it make business sense to include it.  If most don&#x27;t, and it is not a part of their buying decision making, then you&#x27;re just throwing away money.  Especially if it leads to increased post-sales tech support costs: (&quot;My camera doesn&#x27;t work!  Is the shutter closed?  Oh it is!&quot;).<p>Note that this is not an argument <i>not</i> to have hardware shutters.  They are a good thing.  But they come at a significant (to the final price) cost.')
