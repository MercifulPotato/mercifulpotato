Secondly, Kirin 9000 gets 3700 multi core vs 4000 A14, so quite close to that of Apple with a year old A77 cortex. ARM tried making their chips larger with X1 and it resulted in 30% improvement in the first iteration itself, so it&#x27;s not crazy to think there are so many unrealized gains to be made by ARM and others. Second mover advantage is a thing. And lastly Qualcomm isn&#x27;t the flag bearer of ARM chips. Nuvia, Ampere, HiSilicon and even old Mediatek &amp; Samsung could take their crown.')
