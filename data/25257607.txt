I&#x27;ve played many thousands of games online and have run into obvious cheaters fewer than 5 times, and in those cases it is obviously obvious.<p>If somebody is cheating so stealthily, why do I care?  Their rating will reflect whatever cheating they stealthily do.  Remember: If the cheater won every single game, they would be caught immediately, so if their rating is around mine, then whatever cheating they are doing roughly makes them a player of my skill level.  It really makes no difference to me if the person I&#x27;m playing is actually weaker and cheating to simulated somebody my skill level or actually my skill level.<p>And from their perspective, what is the point?  If you are a 1500 player and can cheat to be an 1800 player, what are you gaining from that?  Wouldn&#x27;t you rather play other people that are your skill level?  And if you are a beginner (&lt;1000) that is trying to pretend to be a higher rated player, you just won&#x27;t have enough understanding of chess to pull it off.<p>The cheating thing is just not a major issue for casual online chess.')
