Or joining some servers.<p>Some servers can opt into extreme &quot;are you a human?&quot; validation and SMS verification is a good, universal signal of that. It helps prevent botting, alt accounts (frequent reuse of that number shouldn&#x27;t be possible IIRC), and ban evasion.<p>Also, if Discord itself notices weird activity coming from your account that looks like a selfbot (a program pretending to be the client via Discord&#x27;s private API) or automation, it can pop up that verification flow. I&#x27;m guessing extremely abusive shared IPs can also trigger this.<p>But AFAIK you don&#x27;t have to attach your phone number to continue. (I don&#x27;t remember if it only suggests to link your phone for 2FA or that it auto-links and you can remove phone 2FA afterwards) Discord have outright denied selling or forwarding your info, and they don&#x27;t show or plan to show ads. In that case, what&#x27;s the issue with one-time phone verification in some cases?')
