However, I&#x27;ve seen other programs in complex languages get out of hand.<p>In my experience this kind of gatekeeping eventually breaks down due to deadlines and similar. There&#x27;s also a slow rot that always creeps in, and unfortunately seniority doesn&#x27;t always keep &quot;clever&quot; solutions and general over engineering out.<p>But it looks like we&#x27;ll have to agree to disagree here.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve seen many instances where errors are ignored by mistake, e.g.:<p>It&#x27;s true that there&#x27;s sometime bugs due to mistyping err != nil sometimes. But I have not noticed that it&#x27;s too often or that it&#x27;s somehow is such a large problem that it out-weigh the benefits of the clarity and simple flow brings.<p>&gt; At my employer, we use a monorepo and build with bazel.<p>Hard to compare with an anecdote like that, I just haven&#x27;t heard much complaints regarding compile times, if anything the opposite, and certainly not that it&#x27;s a significant problem in a pros&#x2F;cons comparison.')
