The government should be allowed to compete along with the private sector. The winners of this scenario are the citizens and the people who work for these companies.<p>I&#x27;ve seen exactly this scenario play out in Santa Cruz. Comcast had a virtual monopoly. Even as recently as about 5 years ago one of the best internet packages was up to 20mbps (4mbps in reality) for $40&#x2F;month.<p>The city announced a partnership with Cruzio for municipal broadband and virtually overnight Comcast started offering 200mbps for $50&#x2F;month.\nToday you can get around 400mbps for $55&#x2F;month.<p>We should do the exact same thing with healthcare (public option).')
