But yeah, I do. I don&#x27;t want to be stuck in a hospital with a multi thousand dollar medical bill for an emergency. The worst that would happen without me owning a car is needing to rent one on a moment&#x27;s notice. Maybe there&#x27;s the odd moment when I would need a car for a city-wide evacuation? Seems like that&#x27;s such an exceptional case that I would not spend my money maintaining a car just to be prepared for it.')
