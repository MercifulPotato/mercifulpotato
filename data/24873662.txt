I started music in middle school and got frustrated with a friend who couldn’t play back a melody from a video game we both liked even though I could (he was much better at violin so I wanted to hear him play it, haha).<p>Thankfully, he knew what perfect pitch was and after figuring out the disconnect, explained it to me. I honestly thought he was lying until I asked other folks in the class and found out they couldn’t identify the notes by ear either. I just assumed it was something I learned to do as a part of the class instruction.<p>I wouldn’t say I have any attached feelings&#x2F;synesthesia to particular notes besides their western names.')
