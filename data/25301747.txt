I still find it problematic as Google probably doesn&#x27;t need a cookie to identify you but it&#x27;s at least something that is officially backed by Google, instead of a hack like this.<p>BTW if you use client information to derive an identifier that is unique within a session and you send that identifier to a third-party (e.g. Google) this approach gives you zero benefits. In fact ePrivacy &amp; GDPR don&#x27;t mention cookies anywhere and don&#x27;t care what technology you use to derive identifiers, if they can robustly identify an individual or device and you actually send them to another service (for purposes that are not strictly necessary for the performance of your service) you&#x27;re obliged to asked for consent.')
