Please look at the link I posted with the data - almost every ethnic group listed has less than 1% prevalence. The group it is most prevalent in is Ashkenazi Jews (3.4%), who have an unusual history that discouraged cross-ethnic relationships for millennia, and who are prone to many recessive genetic disorders that would have otherwise been more diluted. These mutations are not so prevalent because Ashkenazi Jews needed them to survive European persecution: they are the consequence of said persecution.<p>There really does not have to be an adaptive explanation or an adaptive “coincidence” like you suggested with the founder effect. Please please please please look at the data.')
