The heaters only have two settings: off and thermonuclear. And the controls are centralized, ie there&#x27;s no thermostat in my home. So, yeah, we control the temp by opening the windows sometimes. All that being said, living in an apartment building is automatically far more efficient than a house. We don&#x27;t need to insulate three of our walls because they directly abut other heated residences and not open air. We have one big boiler for 120 or so residents.')
