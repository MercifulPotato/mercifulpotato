Some stuff will be in 6ths, some will be in full height 3rds. And occasionally, I&#x27;ll get a spreadsheet that needs full screen.<p>Web browsers tend to run at normal res, terminal and emacs are using Anonymous Pro 14pt. At that size, terminal is 157x122 when running in a full height third.   Works pretty well for my aging eyes.')
