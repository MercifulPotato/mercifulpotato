It has no ads, the TV&#x27;s UI hasn&#x27;t noticeably slowed. It&#x27;s 4K. It&#x27;s an excellent TV.<p>I catch myself thinking that I&#x27;ll be in a conundrum when the TV eventually dies. It looks like new versions of LG&#x27;s WebOS has ads every time you open it&#x27;s &#x27;dock&#x27;.<p>Yes, you can buy an AppleTV (or your preferred alternative) â€“ but you&#x27;ll always be scurrying to the TV&#x27;s original remove for anything beyond on&#x2F;off, or changing the volume. So you either keep two remotes around, or toss Apple&#x27;s glass remote and use a universal remote.<p>Does it work? Sure. Is it elegant? Eh. How have you guys solved this?')
