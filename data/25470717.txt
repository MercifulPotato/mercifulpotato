What does it mean?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Having too much time in my hands yesterday evening, I googled various combinations of astronomy, space, coincidences and was intrigued by the number of astronomical coincidences that seem to exist. Has anyone pieced all of them together? Is there some kind of pattern to this chaos?<p>1. Earth’s radius is 3,960 miles. Moon&#x27;s radius is 1,080 miles. Add them both for combined radii are 5,040 miles. (rounded off)<p>Number of minutes in a week. It’s also equal to 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 – also equals 7 x 8 x 9 x 10.<p>2. Orbital periods of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are 30,000 days, 60,000 days and 90,000 days. (rounded off) They orbit the Sun in a 1:2:3 ratio, if you allow an accuracy of 99.8 percent.<p>3. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;astronomy.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;bob-berman&#x2F;2015&#x2F;09&#x2F;just-a-coincidence : [..]I keep finding little numerical coincidences. Like, the number of Earth-Sun distances (astronomical units) in a light-year (63,240) is virtually the same as the number of inches in a mile (63,360). So if you model the Sun as a dot, which would make Earth an invisible speck an inch away, the nearest star (4.2 light-years distant) is another dot 4.2 miles from the first.<p>Such matchups make it easier to memorize numerical tidbits. The number of seconds in a day (86,400) uses the same digits as the diameter of the Sun (864,000 miles). The half-life of carbon-14 (5,730 years) starts with Heinz’ “57” varieties. The Sun’s mass in grams is the same 10 followed by 33 zeros as its luminosity in ergs. One finds connections everywhere. [..]<p>(two more in comment section)')
