Most people don&#x27;t use their memory very much in their daily lives and so their ability to remember things atrophies. You need to exercise it regularly.<p>Memory is also a skill. People have all kinds of techniques to remember things more easily, for instance med students use a lot of mneumonics. The key is to make memories stronger by building associations. Memories that are islands die faster. Associations with places are especially strong, which is the genesis of the &quot;memory palace&quot; technique where you imagine a palace with rooms containing the things that you want to remember. But any association will do. For instance, when I&#x27;m learning a language I like to make up a little story for each word. Using your episodic memory is a great way to increase strength of memories.')
