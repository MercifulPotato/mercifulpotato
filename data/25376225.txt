I&#x27;ve not been a director of a single person company but from what I recall (it&#x27;s been a while) I didn&#x27;t pay anything other than normal PAYE for being an employee&#x2F;director. Of course as a <i>shareholder</i> you may be subject to other taxes but you can be a shareholder without being a director and vice versa.')
