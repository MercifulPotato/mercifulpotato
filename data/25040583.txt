That broker would also authenticate &#x2F; validate the devices &#x2F; data etc. And it can do stuff like batch the input, for efficiency.<p>If you actually need that many incoming connections, for now you&#x27;d probably want to use pgbouncer (or oddysey or ...) in transaction or statement pooling mode.')
