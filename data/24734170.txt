And I probably wouldn&#x27;t want to live in Chicago; winters are especially brutal in the upper Midwest, there aren&#x27;t &quot;real&quot; mountains, and I have no connection to the area. But I have no problems with winter generally and I doubt I would move to the Bay Area even if you took money off the table. Silicon Valley is meh and SF is nice to visit but has a lot of problems. Santa Cruz mountains maybe--if one ignores the wildfire problem.')
