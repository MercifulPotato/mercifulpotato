The reason is because the thing they excel at is impaired. People who are introverts or less social, love it (like me). Often, CEO&#x27;s, Marketing, Sales, Mangers etc. are generally more social and their skill set lies there.<p>I have noticed in the company that I work for that a lot of the managers are nervous because it turns out that the major part of their job (wandering around and socializing and sitting in meetings for hours) is not needed and we are all able to function more efficiently without those distractions.<p>Just my opinion based on my experiences and observations.')
