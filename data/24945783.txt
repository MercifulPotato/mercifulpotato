I think we&#x27;ve all seen such hubris play out. When you want to prove that you are intellectually superior you will demonstrate that you can master the most difficult tools (say category theory?) without understanding that your real goal should be to find simple solutions to difficult problems.<p>A simple solution does not look like much because it is so simple, but it can take a genius to come up with it.
