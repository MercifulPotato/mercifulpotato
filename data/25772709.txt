Virtue is fairly objective, and doing that for your own sake wouldn&#x27;t be virtuous. Classical stoics believe humans are a social animal, and truly virtuous behaviour is pro-social.<p>&gt; The stoics say that you should care about whether you acted virtuously rather than whether your actions lead to a good outcome<p>I&#x27;m not sure I understand this, but I doubt that&#x27;s your fault. All I can think is that if your actions lead to a bad outcome, ultimately you didn&#x27;t act virtuously - even if the intent was there. There&#x27;s a sort of tricky spot in the philosophy which I don&#x27;t fully understand yet though. Take Cato the Younger for example. His virtue and integrity stats were so buffed that he brought ruin to himself and those close to him, and history seems a little torn about it. Was it virtuous to stick to his guns and end up dead, or was that actually foolish and ultimately not virtuous because it served no one around him? I don&#x27;t fully understand the classic or modern stoic take on this kind of situation.<p>However I do think in most cases that if your actions have bad (bad as in Stoic Objective Bad) outcomes then you didn&#x27;t act virtuously. I suppose if it couldn&#x27;t have been anticipated, then maybe you did.<p>&gt; solipsism-lite<p>Interesting - my take is the complete opposite. I see it as though Stoicism describes the ideal human as quite selfless and pro-social.<p>&gt; I think it&#x27;s ok, even good, to actually care about real-world outcomes sometimes.<p>I believe this is actually all that matters in stoicism, since real-world outcomes are all that matter to the people around you. I could be wrong - I&#x27;ve just read a couple translated books and listened to some podcasts at this point.')
