Learning zero knowledge is on my to do list.<p>I&#x27;m skeptical of differential privacy for patient medical records. I assume big data style deanon wins once you can correlate with other data.<p>Differential privacy is probably fine for &quot;data dumps&quot;, like when study data is extracted from many patients. Since those dumps are not used for ongoing care, they can be more aggressively scrubbed.<p>Total aside:<p>Even encrypting data at rest is insufficient. Because even preserving chronological order (no timestamps) is sufficient for deanon. But last week I had a new notion for hiding time and order. I am a total crypto noob, so I&#x27;m still trying to figure out if this is a new idea.<p>As a defender of patient and voter privacy, and so therefore a very vocal critic of electronic voting, I will be deeply chagrinned if I figure out how to make it work.')
