That actually did help me become a better writer as I blogged, but I really think this methodology is limited.<p><i>PERFECT</i> Grammar is optional.\n(edited from &quot;Grammar is optional&quot; because people didn&#x27;t recognize the hyperbole. My bad)<p>Sure, you have to have the basic grammar that everyone understands so that your writing can be understood. Beyond that, style takes over. I learned this from a newspaper columnist years ago. He didn&#x27;t follow the Exact Rules. He made up some of his own, and his writing was better for it!<p>And so it is with me. I write to be understood and hopefully easy to read, and maybe, just maybe, be entertaining. Grammar is only <i>part</i> of the equation for me.<p>So what do I tell people? Use these tools (Grammarly, Hemmingway, etc) to become a better writer, and when you feel like you&#x27;ve met your goal, toss them. They&#x27;re good for the purpose, but will limit you in the long run.')
