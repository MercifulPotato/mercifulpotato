It was interesting&#x2F;scary to modify the parameters and see how thing changed. Also, try to fix misinformation in the models, like a 50% death rate.<p>Anyway, a SIR model can be programed in 20 lines of codes, and is pretty straightforward. Adding a vaccine is like 5 additional lines at most. Also, the main idea is very simple to understand. (Someone should write a tutorial of SIR in Excel&#x2F;GoogleSheets, it&#x27;s interesting to see the graphics.)<p>The most simple models just assume that everyone meets everyone randomly. It&#x27;s more complicated if you want to consider a more realistic model of how people move. For a decision about lockdown you need the complex model, but to understand herd immunity the simple model is good enough.<p>For a nice explanation of more complicated models, there is a video of 3Blue1Brown: &quot;Simulating an epidemic&quot; <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs</a> Note that he explains that the models in this video are not 100% accurate, some number are chosen to get nice graphics, they are only useful to get some insight but not get quantitative predictions.')
