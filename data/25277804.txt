It search inside content and try to find the best content that fit your criteria, it could be from trustworthy source, or not, it could be right or wrong on what you meant. For sure their goal is to give you the closest thing to what you asked, with the best sources, but it&#x27;s not a guarantee, so it shouldn&#x27;t be trusted as such.<p>It&#x27;s crazy that we all came from the &quot;don&#x27;t trust Wikipedia&quot; and now some people are arguing that we should be able to trust Google results directly.')
