Instead they pretty arrogantly pushed to merge a PR which was breaking other stuff in Docker, and were pissed when the maintainers refused to. That whole thing obviously rubbed people working on Docker the wrong way, which was the beginning of the pretty sour relationship.<p>After that I don&#x27;t think there was a lot of goodwill from Docker towards RH, probably causing a lot more issues..')
