Item(by='PaulKeeble', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603191401, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24835601, text='London is actually one of the bad areas for broadband. Due to the density its not been deemed worthwhile to roll out fibre to home at all and fibre to the curb is often held up by a bunch of factors including there being no room in the local telecoms office for the hardware and difficulties placing the boxes on the street to contain the replacement dslams alongside the other road works. Many rollouts have been held up for many years due to very hard logistics problems.<p>It has proven much easier to roll out fibre into villages and smaller towns where DSL is no where near as obvious as the solution and there is room to place the equipment easily.<p>What irks me more than anything is the fact that builders are making big blocks of flats and running normal copper cabling into them. Ones that opened just 5 years ago genuinely had ADSL back to the local telecoms office and only recently got upgraded to DSLAMS in their basements to fibre. It really doesn&#x27;t save a lot of money to put copper in instead of fibre at this point and to not have planned at the very least VDSL is just quite ridiculous. These types of builds have just made local issues with broadband that much worse.')
