No you can&#x27;t politely refuse because not only you don&#x27;t have time to write the refusal, but you don&#x27;t have time to even consider the offer. Ask any pretty girl what happens on tinder. It&#x27;s the literall same in a professional setting if you have a semi-valuable or public position.<p>Then you will realize being ignored is the default behavior as you get into more &quot;valuable&quot; circles or look for more &quot;valuable&quot; ressources in general, and that it&#x27;s the burden of the &quot;asker&quot; to make himself interesting to the person he wants an answer from. No one owes you his time because you exist. You will understand that because there  will be 100s of candidates looking for the same ressource than (speaking very generally). That&#x27;s when you will become less sensitive (or you will become frustrated as why the world is soo not nice with you).<p>Good luck and no offense')
