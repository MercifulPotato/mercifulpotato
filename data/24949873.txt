Your iPhone wasn&#x27;t built here. Your banana was not grown here. The corn might have been grown half a country away. The drugs you might have been prescribed were maybe not produced in your country at all. Why would energy be such different?<p>Intermittency is much easier circumvented geographically than temporally. Move energy instead of trying to store it. Self-sufficiency was necessary in medieval times because it was impossible to move large amounts of things fast and easy. We solved this problem.<p>High-voltage direct current power lines also exists. China has power lines that can gigawatts over distances of thousands of kilometers.<p>Losses are roughly 3% per 1000km by the way, so it is not even that half of the energy is lost in the process.')
