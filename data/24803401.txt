Those places always will be overprices and high stress.<p>Look at how Boston area money has shit up Cape Cod, southern Maine and NH.  NYC money has shit up all of Long Island, large parts of PA, upstate and VT.  CA money has shit up Colorado so bad that CO money shits all over Utah.  Chicago money shits all over Wisconsin.<p>What you&#x27;re really trying to get away from is the secondary effects of people like you (and me, and most everyone on HN).  You&#x27;re trying to get away from a service and tourism economy where everyone else is (somewhat rightfully) out to screw you for every dollar you&#x27;re worth.  Unless you have radically different tastes in what you want this will never be possible because all the other people of the same means will gravitate toward the same places.')
