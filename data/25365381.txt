The institution of policing has for several hundred years been a team of enforcers for use by the ruling classes. It has historically been used to maintain social, economic, and racial disenfranchisement.<p>And there are plenty of cops who should absolutely not have a <i>modicum</i> of the power they now have. But, in 2020, it&#x27;s important to recognize that &#x27;police&#x27; are not a monolithic state entity, and there are plenty of good, kind officers who truly make an effort to &#x27;protect and serve.&#x27; Let&#x27;s get the bad ones the hell out of there, take some of the pressure off of the good ones so they&#x27;re not acting as community mental health counselors, and maybe work to disarm folks on both sides so they don&#x27;t have to enter every situation wondering if someone is going to murk them through a tinted window on a traffic stop.<p>It&#x27;s a complicated situation that demands empathy and nuance on all sides.')
