In the current world, there are all sorts of ways that code implemented one day does not run the same the next day. Say the code is in an interpreted language and an unrelated sysop updates the language runtime in a way that changes the behavior. Again, in a perfect world that doesn&#x27;t happen, but that is not always the world we live in. I have great sympathy with people who treat software systems AS IF they were &quot;physical, mechanical systems which can fail in all kinds of exciting and unpredictable ways&quot;.')
