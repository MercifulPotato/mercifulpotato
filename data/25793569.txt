If you take a basket of good that includes consumer discretion items like cheap tech gadgets, subscription music, staple foods, then these “balance out” the much worse inflation in housing, college costs and medical care, things which have a much higher quality of life impact.<p>I’n not making any claim on how this dichotomy relates to cryptocurrency speculation, but I do think in general nobody should be using CPI-based figures or traditional BLS figures at all, and anyone seriously talking about US inflation needs to be starting from the given baseline fact that “real” inflation (ie, excluding discretionary consumer toys, subscription services, staple foods) is much higher than 2%, and has been for a long time.')
