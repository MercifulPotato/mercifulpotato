Item(by='dekhn', descendants=None, kids=[24984863, 24983939], score=None, time=1604436531, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24967472, text='I&#x27;m a bit of a weirdo but at the current time, my gigabit is provided by a company whose name histortically was associated with a monopolistic company (AT&amp;T) but really was cobbled out of the bones of several large dead telecom companies and is now a monopoly again.  It costs $100&#x2F;month, is delivered by fiber straight to my house from a pole, works as described (in terms of latency and speed tests), and I don&#x27;t want it to change at all for the next decade.  I don&#x27;t feel overcharged and the service is excellent compared to every broadband I&#x27;ve had before.<p>The counterargument is that I happen to live in an area where it makes economic sense for AT&amp;T to do this (high density homes, high level of internet use).')
