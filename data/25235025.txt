The place I most notice lightweight wheels are when climbing slowly on steep mountain bike stuff. Climbing like this is not a steady application of power like steady riding on the road; it&#x27;s a series of small accelerations. When doing this lighter wheels are incredibly noticeable.<p>You also probably won&#x27;t see this in your PM data unless you&#x27;re getting data on partial pedal strokes.<p>More steady power stuff like on the road, climbing fast, etc? I agree that lower wheel weight just isn&#x27;t something you&#x27;ll notice. (Very good evidence for this is riding a fatbike on a fast rolling dirt road ride vs. climbing very steep fire roads.)')
