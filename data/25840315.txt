It can upgrade to version 7.11 of these projects, thereby accepting the terms of SSPL and potentially also being required to release the code for its entire stack (a great deal of which it will not have the copyright over and will be unable to release, thereby potentially being in violation of SSPL). It can remain on version 7.10, but then it will no longer receive future updates, including important security fixes, thereby taking on another sort of risk.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;14&#x2F;elasticsearch-and-kibana-are-now-business-risks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;14&#x2F;elasticsearc...</a>')
