But when you frame it with words like &quot;imperialism&quot;, &quot;revolting&quot;, and &quot;bullshit&quot;, that becomes flamewar.<p>As for your general point, HN users are about 50% in the US, and of course some of those are immigrants&#x2F;expats. So HN is a highly international site. It certainly has a US orientation, but I think that&#x27;s far from &quot;conformity to American culture&quot; and certainly we have zero intention of forcing that. We want people to be themselves and have curious conversation across their differences.<p>In a way I think a bigger problem here is the opposite to what you&#x27;re saying. Because so many of the non-American users here have such incredibly good English, it seems on the surface that the site is much more uniform than it is. People have no idea how diverse the community here is, and it makes for a lot of misunderstandings, often bitter ones.')
