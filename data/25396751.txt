COVID-19 hospitalizations and ICU utilization (and deaths) are surging with the expected lag behind new cases, which wouldn&#x27;t be expected if the new case surge was an illusion from, e.g., symptomatic colds leading people to get tested and discovering what would otherwise have passed as asymptomatic COVID-19 cases.<p>Whether the <i>overall</i> hospital or ICU utilization is seasonally high is a different issue.')
