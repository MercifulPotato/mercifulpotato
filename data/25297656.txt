This highlights an interesting property of &#x27;reasonably-solved&#x27; problems like spell checking and <i>why</i> they might be so much more straightforward now.<p>It&#x27;s often not that we&#x27;ve developed groundbreaking algorithms that make solving the underlying problems intrinsically easier - the techniques we&#x27;re using (like ngram modeling, in this case) may be the result of research work decades ago.<p>Instead the difference is that the fruit of that prior work has been implemented and made available in more accessible forms (libraries and source code) - and becomes easier to re-use, reason about, and modify thanks to abstraction and languages that have evolved to handle similar problems in a more expressible manner.<p>(upgrades in hardware and resources certainly help advancement too, but spell checking&#x27;s probably a good example of a situation where an efficiently-designed implementation&#x27;s likely to be noticeably more responsive, whether it&#x27;s 1980 or 2020)')
