If a page is heavily manipulating SEO to get your attention, you can bet it is loaded with adverts. If you built an anti-advert search engine you&#x27;d be competing with pretty much no-one, because all the search startups are chasing their cut of the multi-billion dollar advertising market and&#x2F;or buying in SEO-infected results from one of the big existing search engines. The difficulty of course would be finding an alternate funding model that could scale, because building a search engine isn&#x27;t cheap or easy.')
