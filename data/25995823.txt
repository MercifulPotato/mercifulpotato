When I&#x27;m on stimulants I can&#x27;t just let my thoughts wander and do whatever feels right at the moment, and I really like that part. If I don&#x27;t have work to do I greatly prefer not being on them.<p>The only time I feel the need to abuse them is when I am over burdened with work and I feel I need the extra focus to complete tasks. At those times I try to do the opposite, quit taking the medicine and calm down and tell people that I don&#x27;t have time to do the tasks now.')
