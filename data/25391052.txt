I don&#x27;t know how to draw any that aren&#x27;t hedged heavily. 18% for doom seems much higher than I expected - is that because I underestimate it, or because of how the survey was conducted? There&#x27;s no way to tell, here.<p>Good survey design _does_ exist; it&#x27;s an extremely intensely studied practice. It&#x27;s not surprising that a casual internet survey doesn&#x27;t follow anything resembling modern surveying techniques, but it does make results unclear.')
