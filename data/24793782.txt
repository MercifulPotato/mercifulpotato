Maybe I&#x27;ve just not seen it happen. But, the way things seem to have worked here (very well I might add) is that when enough of the community disagrees, things get downvoted to death and if you don&#x27;t have &quot;Show dead&quot; enabled, you don&#x27;t see them. Your choice. I&#x27;ve had show dead enabled as long as I can remember because I like to see everything posted.<p>Sometimes I agree with things a lot of people here clearly disagree with and I&#x27;m fine with that. I can decide to either argue my&#x2F;their case or move on and accept we have different views. Maybe sometimes seeing things heavily downvoted here changes my mind on subject as well and question if my views are right or not.<p>We can&#x27;t all agree about everything all the time. Sometimes I&#x27;m right, sometimes I&#x27;m wrong. We all are, nobody is ever 100% right, 100% of the time. I sure as hell don&#x27;t want somebody else controlling everything I see and read because they think it might give me the &quot;wrong&quot; ideas. I&#x27;m an adult and I should be allowed to make my own mind up and most importantly question things, as should everybody else, regardless of education level or where they &quot;fit&quot; into society.<p>When I think about all of the forums and comment sections I regularly interact with, the ones with the most open, democratic, free speech, with little to no direct moderation seem to be the most engaging, tolerant and frankly, nicer places. I&#x27;ve given up on engaging with anything that&#x27;s heavily moderated or frankly, blatantly biased - Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, etc. and I feel a lot happier.<p>‘I would rather have questions that cannot be answered, than answers that cannot be questioned’ - Richard Feynman.')
