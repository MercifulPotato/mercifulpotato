Dealing in absolutes doesn&#x27;t do the nuanced systems governing our reality justice, you should know that.<p>To illustrate: <i>absolutely</i> free speech would imply the right to harmfully agitate kids for whatever your cause is. Does it seem obvious that this is a bad idea? Then just extrapolate &quot;kids are easy to manipulate&quot; to &quot;adults are mostly just older kids&quot;.<p>And btw, I know what it&#x27;s like to be on the other side. That doesn&#x27;t justify turning a blind eye to the madness that comes with absolute free speech.<p>Either you accept that a line has to be drawn somewhere, or you accept <i>every</i> consequence of absolute free speech. Which, imo, would be a terrible idea with 7 billion people just waiting to be gamed through their fears.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I don&#x27;t consider what we&#x27;re seeing here unproblematic at all. I just don&#x27;t consider absolute free speech to be unproblematic either, quite the opposite.')
