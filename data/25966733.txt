Martha Stewart went to a minimum security prison for female inmates, and honestly, she&#x27;s exactly the type of criminal that belongs in minimum security. The judge recommended they send her to her first choice prison (in Danbury) but for some reason they couldn&#x27;t and they sent her to a prison she didn&#x27;t want. I&#x27;m not really seeing favoritism here. She was investigated for insider trading, but those charges got dismissed and she was ultimately just convicted for lying.')
