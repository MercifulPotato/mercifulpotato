People didn&#x27;t have any meaning beyond &quot;survive and make children&quot; for millennia and they did fine. The whole search for meaning I feel has sprung up only among the people who have too much free time ;) I found that I became much happier when I explicitly rejected it, absurdism-style, and then at least partially internalized the notion... it doesn&#x27;t quite get you back to the natural lack of concern that you have when you are young and don&#x27;t think of life as finite, but it&#x27;s the step in the right direction.')
