Right now it is a interesting idea but not actually practicable. When a war starts military leaders get their way if it means winning, which means the treaty will be broke if there is something useful to do in space.<p>This is why chemical weapons treaties are signed and obeyed, while land mind treaties are not: the  military of powerful countries doesn&#x27;t seem chemical weapons as something they want, while landmines are useful in some situations.  (If your country has signed a land mind treaty it is probably because they can count on an allied country that hasn&#x27;t to place land mines.  If your country hasn&#x27;t signed a chemical weapons treaty it is because your military isn&#x27;t very good by modern standards and so you can accept the downsides)')
