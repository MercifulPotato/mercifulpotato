My app, for example, needs to write files in ~&#x2F;Library&#x2F;Application Support&#x2F;Chrome in order to add native messaging permissions for my extension. Can you imagine the number of &quot;Karens&quot; that are going to email me because they &quot;caught&quot; me trying to &quot;steal their data&quot; if they add restrictions to this folder?<p>Apple did the right thing by only adding warnings for more sensitive areas like your Downloads or Documents folder, but any more than that and I think it&#x27;ll cause more harm than good.<p>I agree with the blog post. Apple seems to be more focused with &quot;security theatre&quot; right now (or at least half-assed security for the sake of marketing). They do things like add easy-to-implement (via their FileManager class) file access warnings to appease most non-technical users. But at the same time ignore bigger looming threats like apps accessing the Internet. I think the issue isn&#x27;t the warnings, it&#x27;s what the warnings are about.<p>Anyway, my guess is that Apple will be adding network access warnings in the future (since it seems they re-wrote a large chunk of the networking code recently) but let&#x27;s not deny the two-faced marketing speak going on right now and fact that they do stuff like making it impossible to inspect network traffic from Apple apps. The hand-wavy &quot;trust us&quot; argument shouldn&#x27;t work for Apple either. Why do I <i>have</i> to trust Apple more than a third party developer?')
