The trend today with Google<p>Sorry, but I think this is totally wrong.<p>I knew the guy who wrote the very first web crawler&#x2F;search engine, and even then, the intent was to find answers, not websites.<p>Moreover, I don&#x27;t see any limit on what google returns when you search. I just searched for &quot;the trend with google today&quot; and it told me there were 927,000,000 results. When I got to page 22 of those results, it told me that the rest were all very similar but gave me a link to fetch them anyway. I could get to an arbitrary Nth result.<p>The reality is that search engines actually are, by any historical standard &quot;some sort of oracle that can provide answers&quot;.<p>And when they can&#x27;t&#x2F;don&#x27;t, they still function as tools that provide you with links to help you explore the question more.<p>Recognizing whether or not you&#x27;ve actually found the answer (from a book, from deductive processes, from a human oracle or from a search engine) has always required critical thinking skills, and that has not changed.')
