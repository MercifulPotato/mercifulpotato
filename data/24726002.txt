Ok.<p>But if you&#x27;re paying attention, architecture wise, it may be of interest to note that Apple&#x27;s ARM chips, so far, have delivered good performance in their handheld applications by careful attention to sustained memory bandwidth. Competitors went with more CPU cores.<p>So there&#x27;s some fun chip architecture to be had, even in 2020.<p>A desktop Apple architecture might use something like HBM for main memory, rather than DIMMs.<p>There&#x27;s lots of room to innovate, out there in consumer computing.')
