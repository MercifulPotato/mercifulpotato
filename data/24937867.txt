They have a right to own property - in perpetuity, which makes it an even more powerful right than flesh-and-blood humans have. They have a right to bring lawsuits. They have a right to influence our political process, thanks to Citizens United. They serve as an impenetrable shield between those owners and liability, and (thanks to those property rights) to a large extent taxation as well. Very little of this <i>should</i> be the case, but it <i>is</i>, and because corporations have this very substantial separate existence they should also be subject to tax.')
