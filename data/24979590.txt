I&#x27;ll concede that we do pay for a home address.<p>However, that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that the economic model has changed when it comes to email. We no longer pay with money, but we pay in other ways when we use Google. So it&#x27;s actually worse than with mail, because there used to be a clear exchange of goods but it is now obfuscated. And thus, there is nothing mandating good service, which is why people can be randomly banned from using it.')
