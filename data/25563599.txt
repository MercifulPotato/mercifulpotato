Item(by='folkhack', descendants=None, kids=[25564841], score=None, time=1609191914, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25563270, text='&gt; These are cops willing to aggressively threaten lethal force when they are experiencing fear&#x2F;anxiety&#x2F;uncertainty based on what the suspect looks like, be it their skin color or their clothing.<p>There are also a fair amount of bully cowboys out there hiding behind the badge.<p>I was a teenage passenger in a car when a friend of mine held up his wallet in the light of the back window to see if he had his bank card or w&#x2F;e. Cop car was behind us in traffic, pulls us over, and two cops get out guns drawn instructing everyone to get face down on the pavement.<p>Turns out they thought they saw a knife&#x2F;gun when my friend had held us wallet up in the light, and they figured we were brandishing a weapon at them. We all got searched and when they found half of us <i>Boy Scouts</i> were carrying pocket knives things got really stupid really fast. We had to beg them to be rational with us, nose down on the pavement. Still makes my blood boil.<p>This is anecdotal in rural small-town Iowa.')
