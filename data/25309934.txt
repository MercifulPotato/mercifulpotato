It’s based on an analysis of leverage (like GP’s comment), where the levers are necessarily some mix of advantage&#x2F;privilege (feedback loop as discussed all over) and exploitation (not solely as a moral issue, but that issue is inescapable). It’s impossible to be&#x2F;become a millionaire without access to, and activating, those levers. I don’t care about the moral character of the humans this analysis addresses. I care about the opportunity and moral failure it imposes on others.')
