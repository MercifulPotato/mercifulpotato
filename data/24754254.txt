Microsoft are arguing that the malware operation damages Microsoft&#x27;s brand, instead of putting the fault onto themselves for making vulnerable software.<p>The malware operation should absolutely be shut down, but other laws (that we have - the CFAA would apply) should be used to do so.<p>Otherwise any other manufacturer of defective products can argue that someone else (potentially unintentionally) is damaging their brand by triggering a flaw in the product instead of fixing their product. Imagine a car manufacturer whose cars fall apart due to minor irregularities in the road suing the city for not making the roads smooth enough instead of producing better cars that are immune to this problem.')
