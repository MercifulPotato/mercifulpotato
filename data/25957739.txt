Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25977889], score=None, time=1611931634, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25957466, text='That the Roman Empire was to some extent decentralized doesn&#x27;t matter though - they had all of the power and were able to extract all of the surpluses from their vassal states.<p>They definitely &quot;the accumulated and monopolized power of all its individual members&quot; -&gt; 66% of Rome were slaves i.e. literally property!<p>They collected all of the surplus wealth of their vassal states through tributes and had absolute direct power. Imagine they &#x27;owned&#x27; those entire national economies and accumulated wealth through those &#x27;dividend payments&#x27; of tributes.<p>&quot;the growth of capitalism was disconnecting responsibility for the population from the accumulation of capital. &quot;<p>2 issues:<p>1) Since when did the Roman Emperors or the Feudal Nobility have any <i>responsibility</i>? The only thing they did was ensure that their territories were not invaded. That&#x27;s it. Everyone was a serf.<p>By your own example of &#x27;Feudal Lord&#x27; - his responsibility was to &#x27;keep his slaves just barely alive&#x27;.<p>2) Again the Adam Smith: you&#x27;re not counting surpluses. Economies create vast amounts of consumer surpluses. Whatever the capitalists are able to hoard away in their bank accounts is small in comparison to the value created by consumer surpluses.<p>eg: the guy and&#x2F;or corporation who invented the dishwasher pocketed 0.001% of the value he unleashed by freeing up entire societies from having to wash by hand.<p>The Merchants beat the Nobility <i>because they did useful stuff</i>. Like make railroads. Dig mines. Transported food and materials. Make stuff like steam engines. Made grocery stores. Created financial services, banking, accounting. Made textiles. Built buildings.<p>From the entire history of Greek Antiquity up until probably about 1500 - GDP &#x27;per capita&#x27; of most places economy barely grew an inch.<p>When merchants and capitalists took over, the economy skyrocketed and hasn&#x27;t looked back.<p>It&#x27;s not a paradox that people are immensely more wealthy in capitalism despite however &#x27;unequal&#x27; the distribution of accumulated wealth is.')
