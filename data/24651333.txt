I had chargers around the house, in my car and at my desk at work. Life was good.<p>Then I upgraded by phone, to one with a USB-C port.<p>Most of my chargers had a single USB port, so I would need to detach the cable if I wanted to switch device. That&#x27;s if I had a cable to hand. I had invested in around 20 good quality micro-USB cables and now I needed more. Some chargers had the port integrated into the plug so that would be useless for the phone.<p>In the end, I acquired a set of converters so I could put a little dongle on the end of each cable in case I wanted to charge the phone. I silently curse the USB people every time I attach or detach the extra tip.<p>Frankly, the new connector was completely unasked-for. If the phone manufacturer had offered a choice between micro-USB or USB-C, I&#x27;d have gone for micro-USB every time. The ability to plug it in either way around just isn&#x27;t enough to make it worth switching.')
