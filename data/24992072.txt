They operate at billion dollar losses and just laid off a bunch of employees. It&#x27;s just a race to who can drive prices lowest and establish a monopoly.<p>Second, you&#x27;re right in part, I don&#x27;t want to build another uber, but not because its hard work (I like hard work). It&#x27;s just that ethically Uber is pushing our country in the wrong direction, furthering our dependence on private individual transit, while further burdening the worker and the environment.')
