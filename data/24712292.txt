When you can get a functional language to type check, it really does Just Work. And when you limit side-effects, you know another function isn&#x27;t going to monkey with something it&#x27;s not supposed to.<p>That said, I&#x27;m presently struggling with AST transformations and other fun stuff in Haskell, so I completely agree with stating it imperatively. It&#x27;s far, far easier to learn and read simple imperative code.<p>That&#x27;s why in my language Tenet[1] I&#x27;m trying a hybrid approach: the underlying representation is immutable, but the language uses ordinary control flow and mutation.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tenet-lang.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tenet-lang.org&#x2F;</a>')
