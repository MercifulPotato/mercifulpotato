Item(by='JumpCrisscross', descendants=None, kids=[25955173], score=None, time=1611887342, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25952506, text='&gt; <i>Shares are moving electronically between different ledgers as orders are fulfilled</i><p>Ah, this is the disconnect.<p>They&#x27;re not. Shares and payment for them move <i>within two business days</i> [1]. In the meantime, both sides must post collateral as a guard against their failing to deliver.<p>You&#x27;re a broker. Suzy has $20 in her account. Suzy sells a share for $10. She buys another share for $10. With the first trade, you have to post--today--collateral against that $10 for two days. With the second trade, you have to post--again, by close of business today--collateral against that $10 for two days. To keep things simple, let&#x27;s assume Suzy did not use the proceeds from the first sale to finance the second. That leaves you with $20 of liabilities and $20 of cash.<p>Next day, Suzy sells all her shares for $40. Now you&#x27;re putting up collateral against that $40 for two days. The $20 from yesterday still hasn&#x27;t arrived from JPMorgan--they have until tomorrow. You now have collateral against $60 of liabilities. At the end of the day, Suzy makes a withdrawal request because she&#x27;s a little shit. So now you have $80 of liabilities from someone who deposited $20 in her account and never had more than $40 of assets.<p>Clearinghouses use the last day&#x27;s closing price to determine how much collateral you need to post. They then multiply that by some value that ranges between 2% and 100%, depending on what their line-of-credit lenders offer them. That is leverage. To manage that risk, the clearinghouse adjusts that multiplier. Going from 20% to 100% in the above example would mean going from $16 of collateral required to $80. That&#x27;s $64 of cash you need to come up with before the end of the day or you&#x27;re out of business.<p>If Robinhood operated with zero clearing leverage, they would not be able to offer the instant-trading experience their competitors have offered since the 1990s.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investor.gov&#x2F;introduction-investing&#x2F;investing-basics&#x2F;glossary&#x2F;settling-securities-transactions-t2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investor.gov&#x2F;introduction-investing&#x2F;investing-ba...</a>')
