When you are born into wealth, there&#x27;s a sort of &quot;rubber band&quot; helping you move up the ladder. When you are born into poverty, that rubber band pulls you down instead of propelling you up.<p>I can speak to this myself, I have helped my parents&#x2F;family enormously at cost to my financial wellbeing.<p>And by the way....when a son&#x2F;daughter does well, gets into software, makes a healthy $150k salary in SV, that does not change the financials at home. That $150k salary has to keep coming and you have to keep giving it to your family to make a real difference over time. At the same time, you have to pay SV rent, you have to buy a car, go on dates with your significant other, have a life of your own, etc.')
