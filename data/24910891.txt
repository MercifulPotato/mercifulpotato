Or sue them.<p>If said friend takes a pic of you and records everything you say in real life and gives that to researchers (or &quot;pro Trump&quot; people), you wouldn&#x27;t go after your or their landlord claiming they &quot;allowed this to happen&quot;, nor would you go after the city where it happened, would you? (your friend is voluntarily participating, knowing what they are doing)<p>Now if the researchers tricked your friend into giving them information about you somehow, then you&#x27;d go after your researchers. But do not expect your landlord to go after those researchers for you.
