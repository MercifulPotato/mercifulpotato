I use the TV remote to control an Nvidia Shield via HDMI-CEC.<p>Some apps work &quot;better&quot; on the TV (Netflix, Amazon Prime) since I can get Dolby Vision from the built-in apps.  Other apps (Disney+) are horrifically buggy on the TV and I use the Shield for them.<p>I have not enabled all the snooping that LG wants, and so I do not see any ads.   If I ever start to see ads, I&#x27;d factory reset the TV so it forgets my wifi, and use the shield or an Apple TV.<p>I also use the shield for and ad-free youtube by using SmartYouTubeTV on the shield.')
