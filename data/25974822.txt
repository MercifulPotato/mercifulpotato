I mean, you can have an argument around that point.<p>The second half has an absolutely absurd argument: “This company says there are 10 stocks that are better than Tesla.”<p>So what? That’s not an argument for Tesla not being able to give you return on your investment. That there exists 10 stocks that are the best investment doesn’t mean that everything else is negative ROI.')
