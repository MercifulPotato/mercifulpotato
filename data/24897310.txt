Item(by='majewsky', descendants=None, kids=[24898234], score=None, time=1603726593, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24896720, text='&quot;Just do the vulnerable people first&quot; has the significant advantage of being easy to explain and implement, but it does not maximize the speed of economic recovery.<p>For instance, I&#x27;m a vulnerable person because of preexisting conditions, so I&#x27;ll likely be offered a vaccine relatively soon after approval. But that won&#x27;t have a large impact on economic recovery: I&#x27;m in the home office in a single-person household and don&#x27;t have any care obligations, so I&#x27;m at a comparatively low risk anyway. And I won&#x27;t change my current behavior until the disease is fully gone anyway.')
