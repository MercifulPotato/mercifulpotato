I&#x27;m constantly surprised by what a modern smartphone can take compared to what I get out of my camera. Yes, you can get way better photos if you do everything right with a traditional camera (and certainly much more real bokeh) but that usually involves a lot more editing than you have to do with an iPhone 12 Pro or similar.<p>For the amount of time it takes - the iPhone 12 Pro and similar can really outperform a camera. One you get a snapshot you&#x27;d be okay with sharing with others immediately - with the other, you&#x27;re like, &quot;Yeah, the exposure is a little off but maybe that&#x27;s just because of the dynamic range limitations? And I need to adjust the contrast, maybe sharpen a little bit, colors aren&#x27;t really there, and it would&#x27;ve been great if I had done bracketed exposures because the sky is just too blown out to recover properly...&quot; A lot of that stuff is gone with smartphones because they do it all for you.<p>It&#x27;s what annoys me about modern cameras - they don&#x27;t have any of that built in as an option. You have to do all the work by yourself and bracketing is just way too much of a PITA for me to deal with for most photos. Computational photography is a huge breakthrough that many cameras just don&#x27;t utilize almost at all.')
