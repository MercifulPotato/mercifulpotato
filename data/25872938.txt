I brought a bunch of them (132 so far) under one roof. I made them searchable (using typesense.org), and list out the license details and link back to the site or GitHub repo.<p>I&#x27;m not much of a designer, and it&#x27;s just a first stab at the concept. It&#x27;s been done, but I wanted to also build it API-first, since I know it would be useful to be able to search through them all for developers.<p>I&#x27;m always on the lookout for new icon libraries to include, and plan on making it easier to learn more about the designers themselves. If you have any ideas on icon sets or libraries to include please let me know in the comments :)')
