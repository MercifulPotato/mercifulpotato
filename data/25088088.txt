I mean as much as I felt disgusted by the things I read, I am more disgusted by the fact that the company just gets away with these things. I mean they paid $25 million for price fixing because it was unfair to other big corporations or $250 million for tax avoidance, but almost nothing for every time they dumped toxic waste into the water because it&#x27;s the public that gets affected? I&#x27;m sorry but we need to make the elected officials work for us, not corporations.')
