Keep your cat indoors.<p>I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve been considering pets for several months since I&#x27;m now spending so much time at home and, as for many people looking for some at home companionship, it comes down to dog or cat.<p>I&#x27;ve read a reasonable amount of material that suggests that if your cat is kept indoors it&#x27;s a lot more likely to be unhappy. So if you <i>must</i> own a cat then keeping it indoors may not be the best strategy for the cat. On the other hand, the point about environmental impact of cats - killing of birds and other small animals - might be a really good argument against having cat full stop. If you can&#x27;t keep it in a way that ensures its welfare whilst also ensuring that it doesn&#x27;t cause havoc amongst the local wildlife, maybe don&#x27;t get one at all.')
