And I am not even in the US where the choice is, let us say, rater one-dimensional.<p>The problem with it is that one might end up with the people voting for, among other things, more generous unemployment benefits, many nice infrastructure projects, lower taxes, and a balanced budget.<p>I guess one could attempt to solve this by putting a price tag on what people vote for as in &#x27;we have this nice project  but taxes would increase from this to that amount&#x27;.
