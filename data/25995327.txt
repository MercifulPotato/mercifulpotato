It doesn&#x27;t work in my country which means it sucks. It doesn&#x27;t have whatever game I want which means it sucks. It doesn&#x27;t work on my crap WIFI (although they explicitly say you need a powerful internet connection) which means it sucks, and so on.<p>I think Stadia is one of the few really innovative products released in the gaming world in years. Everyone else is just pumping their money into sales &amp; marketing and you keep buying their products year after year, even though there&#x27;s nothing new to them.<p>Perhaps they wouldn&#x27;t kill more than half of the projects they start if you&#x27;d give them some real feedback on how to improve them instead of constantly throw shit at them like they owe you something.')
