Why are we treating women like children?<p>If a non-gender-activist group wanted to host arts &amp; crafts for mental health &amp; community building, I have no problem with that.<p>I have attended a few and found that there was too much &quot;staring at the problem&quot;. We&#x27;d start with an agenda and leave off without any action items.<p>So, if I don&#x27;t like it why don&#x27;t I try to change it? At the time I was just starting out and felt that being involved in these groups was not a good use of time as they were a) a distraction, and b) put me at risk of being taken less seriously by my colleagues. A few years later and I&#x27;ve found that I get a lot more satisfaction by having 1:1s or small group discussions with women on my team, who are changing careers, and the leadership in my current company, than I did in a group setting.<p>I could just live &amp; let live, but the point of this post was to get a feeler out for whether other people feel the same way. Thanks for the data point! :)')
