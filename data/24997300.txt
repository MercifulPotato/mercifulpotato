It’s really easy to drop into your code for debugging or simple image exporting and it is so easy to work with. The amount of information you can get out of a good image is just so high that getting NetPBM output of your complicated thing can be so worth it, even if you are writing it from scratch each time. Plus you can kind of “read” it without an image viewer if you use P1.<p>The other one I really like is Graphviz :)')
