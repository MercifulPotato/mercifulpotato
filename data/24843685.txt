And it turned out to be massively wrong, but he never issued a mea culpa.  Instead, he says &quot;Going off of the only numbers that I already had, it basically quite clearly said that inside Hubei, there would be a few thousand deaths, and outside of Hubei in China there would only be a few hundred deaths. And that was enough to give people more confidence in understanding the virus, though I don’t think it really prepared the rest of the world for what was going to end up happening. &quot;<p>Yes, there is a reason that actual epidemiologists did NOT come to that conclusion: due to myriad factors, data about disease is messy, and you need to account for that.  I never see him acknowledge that fact; I just see more &quot;I connected these dots and extrapolated the curve predictions&quot;, even though that hasn&#x27;t worked for him yet:<p>&gt; I think it’s going to end up with less deaths than what I thought. In March, I thought there would be a total of 220,000, but there will be less than that. Right now it is around 155,000 in the U.S., and I am expecting it to end up under 170,000 or maybe 175,000.')
