Item(by='dwohnitmok', descendants=None, kids=[25120848], score=None, time=1605593912, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25120751, text='Oof... what&#x27;s the term for being sunk by the very thing that you&#x27;re warning against?<p>I was using a very hand-wavy version of the word &quot;truth&quot; in my reply, trying to frame it in terms of how people talk about capital T Truth in informal philosophy rather than, say, model satisfability in model theory (which completely side-steps this question by assuming its resolution).<p>What I meant was to express a hypothetical anti-Platonist position. One version of mathematical Platonism is a belief that only some subset of &quot;plausible&quot; (i.e. those expressed by a consistent set of axioms) mathematical entities are real and it is the job of logician-philosophers to feel out just what those are. Of course they must appeal to extra-mathematical and extra-logical principles to do so, but that is after all why Platonism is a philosophy rather than a branch of mathematics. This is a simplified version of the philosophy that underlies some efforts to find &quot;the one true set theory&quot; that extends ZFC.<p>A hypothetical brand of anti-Platonism could argue that every consistent set of axioms is similarly real or unreal. There is no reason to choose one over the other. The only thing that has any objective reality to it is the mapping of those axioms to the real world. That you can do either correctly or incorrectly. Hence if we&#x27;re talking about capital T Truth (i.e. the reality of the world) it is captured in that mapping, rather than the axioms themselves. Therefore, e.g. there&#x27;s no point to trying to divine &quot;the one true set theory.&quot; Just use whatever you find useful.<p>Regardless my overall point is that these are all matters of philosophy that cloud the particulars of what is going on with Godel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems, often by exaggerating their consequences.')
