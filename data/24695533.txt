There is no clear distinction between body and soul.<p>Historically, doctors in a small community were some of the best educated people there and they knew people pretty well simply because it was small. They also took their little black bag and went to see you where you lived, which gave them enormous amounts of information about your life without saying one word and this informed their assessment of what exactly was wrong and needed to be fixed.<p>Then modern tech came along and now we go to see them because their office or the hospital is where the big fancy tools are for running diagnostics, as if what ails you is entirely about your body and your body is separate from <i>your life.</i> And they are little more than fancy technicians. They&#x27;ve lost that role of &quot;village wise man&quot; and we fail to see how valuable that was, how critical it was to the practice of good medicine.<p>I don&#x27;t know how to fix it, but doctors don&#x27;t do what they used to do and then we wonder why some things go so very wrong in a world with more &quot;miracles of modern medicine&quot; than ever before.<p>The diagnostics are amazing. Getting the right diagnosis was a big, huge deal. But then the treatment and attitudes were a huge disappointment and when I began getting healthier, my physician expressed zero interest in how and why that was. He just scheduled me fewer appointments because other patients needed him more than I did.<p>So when I moved, I didn&#x27;t bother to find a new doctor. It seemed pointless. And then the internet decided I was some extremist anti-doctor nutcase when in reality it was doctors who basically wanted nothing to do with me.')
