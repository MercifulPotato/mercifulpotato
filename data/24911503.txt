They&#x27;re tiny 32kB memory slabs + decoder + ALUs + networking to connect to the rest of the FPGA.<p>But its certainly more advanced than a DSP slice (which was only somewhat more complicated than a multiply-and-add circuit).<p>-------<p>I guess you can think of it as a tiny 32kB SRAM + CPU though. But its still missing a bunch of parts that most people would consider &quot;part of a CPU&quot;. But even a GPU provides synchronization functions for its cores to communicate &#x2F; synchronize together with.')
