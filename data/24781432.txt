Item(by='jfengel', descendants=None, kids=[24781805, 24782498], score=None, time=1602708613, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24771013, text='A body count of 4 hardly puts him in the running for &quot;greatest villain&quot;. But it&#x27;s an important observation that he&#x27;s rather a horrible person.<p>His treatment of Ophelia is dreadful. Laying her death at his feet is an overstatement, but &quot;misogyny, gaslighting and open sexual harassment&quot; isn&#x27;t. The deaths of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are undeserved: they don&#x27;t know that they&#x27;re bringing Hamlet to his death.<p>He could perhaps be forgiven (in the violent context of the setting) the death of Polonius, but he&#x27;s being deliberately obtuse in his fake justification of &quot;How now, a rat!&quot; That&#x27;s not madness or heat of the moment: he knew it was murder. He might not be lying that he thought it was Claudius, though he&#x27;d just seen Claudius and decided not to kill him.<p>That switch, at least, drives some interesting choices for the actor and director. Hamlet&#x27;s nowhere near the greatest villain, but he&#x27;s not a good person, either. The play gives performers a great opportunity to find a base for him and picking that through his many inconsistencies: being able to play that strong commitment at every moment can yield a great performance. But it&#x27;s a challenge to find something you can commit to.')
