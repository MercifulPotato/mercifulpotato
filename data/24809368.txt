Item(by='imtringued', descendants=None, kids=[24809405, 24809915, 24809510], score=None, time=1602936275, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24809108, text='I don&#x27;t know if they have changed their tipping practice but last time there was a backlash they just deducted the tip from your order. E.g. you earn $10 from the order and get a tip of $15. They deduct $10 from your $10 order so you&#x27;re basically getting paid nothing except the tip so you get $15 in total.<p>Here is the thing. If the tip is lower than the order e.g. someone tips $7 on a $10 then you still only receive $10. Now that they have capped the maximum tip to $10 they have eliminated the only way to make money off of DoorDash tips. When you&#x27;re tipping on DoorDash you&#x27;re tipping DoorDash, not the worker.<p>Maybe they changed the tipping system and what I&#x27;m talking about doesn&#x27;t make any sense but I&#x27;m not optimistic when it comes to DoorDash.')
