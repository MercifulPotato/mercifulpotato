The math was it would take +7 more years investing the &quot;mortgage&quot; to reach even (so 12y, 3y less than a 15y loan with far far less interest due) and I compounded that much more month over month during those +7 years, leaving me at the end of 12 years with a &quot;free house&quot; and a lot more month over month to keep investing with a nice reserve. I realize that&#x27;s extremely aggressive and perhaps not possible by many people, I started with enough in reserves to be able to make it work.')
