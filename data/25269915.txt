I&#x27;m a contract system administrator for small to medium clients that have technological or contractural needs that are difficult to provide outside of large institutions. I help companies build solid environments and get the most out of them until the time they&#x27;re large enough to launch their own internal teams to manage them. If you&#x27;ve got problems that your developers don&#x27;t want to deal with, drop me a line. I try to be the kind of sysadmin your developers want to work with--not the guy they&#x27;re trying to scheme up elaborate shaky tools to try and replace.<p>Email: jbudde@a2tech.us')
