I don&#x27;t remember having trouble using any of the compilers I&#x27;ve used. On the other hand, (almost) every other software I&#x27;ve used have crashed one time or more.  My question is : how compiler devellopers do for making bug free compiler ? How is it possible ? is there anything that give a proof that a compiler is stable ? In other words, is it possible to have a bug in a software produced a by a compiler flaw rather than by a bad coding ?')
