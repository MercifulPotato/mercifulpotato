In the end I decided to simply say that, if I worked at Gumroad instead of at an employer who pays me about 10% less but pays even just part of the premium on mediocre health insurance, the events of the last six months would have killed my partner, bankrupted me, and left me widowed and homeless in the middle of a pandemic.<p>At best, I&#x27;d be six figures in medical debt.<p>At worst, I&#x27;d be seven figures in medical debt.<p>You all can go without insurance? Great. That&#x27;s great _for you_. Congrats _to you_. Good luck _to you_.<p>Yes, the system is horrendously broken. But just acknowledge — just _acknowledge_! — that it&#x27;s a massive, massive, massive privilege to be able to afford to work a job that doesn&#x27;t offer health insurance in the United States as it exists right now.<p>Consider how many people absolutely cannot fathom working for Gumroad as a result. I don&#x27;t want to hear you do it. Just think. Think about it. Please!')
