Search for &quot;3 inch screw&quot; and you&#x27;ll get screws of all sizes.  Another bad thing Amazon has started doing is throwing random products into the search results.  Search for pillow cases and you also get a bicycle and shoes in the search results.  The review weightings were changed some years ago to make the &quot;average&quot; higher also, it&#x27;s no longer really an average, especially when the lowest review score is one instead of zero.<p>After the pandemic messed up it&#x27;s algorithms Amazon never really recovered and search results have gotten really weird.  There are many obvious examples of price gouging as well.  It really seems like Amazon is now selling us to the products, rather than selling the products to us.  And why on earth does Amazon still (after many years of doing this) list products that are not available?  I can understand keeping the pages active for previous buyers, but a search for a product should not turn up hundreds of hits for things that are not actually available.  Additionally, instead of returning only items that match my keywords, I often find that two or three pages into the search results the products listed don&#x27;t match ANY of my keywords, and there will be 20 pages of them; they are adding hundreds of products at the end of search results that could not possibly be relate to what I&#x27;m looking for, just to try to sell me _something_.')
