If you get on a CMTS which is overloaded (either through an area with higher than average usage per customer, or too many customers connected) you are pretty screwed. QoS on DOCSIS is an oversight which I&#x27;ve never really seen work properly (mainly it is upstream that is the problem, and it&#x27;s just hard to enforce this on such a shared channel).')
