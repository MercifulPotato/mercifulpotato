What if I don&#x27;t build the feature but just write documentation for it?<p>More pertinently, most of the time: What if I think that feature would be a net-positive for everyone? There obviously cases where a product literally couldn&#x27;t exist without collecting user data, and so long as they&#x27;re up-front about it, I&#x27;m fine with that. It&#x27;s sneaky data collection that&#x27;s the problem.')
