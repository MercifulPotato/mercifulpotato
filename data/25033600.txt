Squats have different limitations than DLs. But even a kid can squat (and their knees do go past their toes so cut the BS about that)<p>What BS? This strikes me as an incredibly naive take on squats and people&#x27;s ability to do them. Likewise, a kid is a bizarre benchmark, because they haven&#x27;t yet had decades to abuse their body. Duck feet&#x2F;knocking knees&#x2F;knee valgus or even shin splits will make squats incredibly uncomfortable if not implausible to do with correct form. Add to that years of being a software dev. I imagine there are many other conditions that would start you at -2 or more in terms of progression.')
