The company in question,WhiteHatJr, claims all sorts of nonsense and targets Indian parents, promising to turn their kids into AI ML super coders.<p>I know Indian parents. They will sweat out hundreds of thousands of bucks so that their kid gets to be part of this &quot;revolution&quot;.<p>Its really scammy and pathetic. I guess the lockdown has a lot of kids sitting at home, saving their parents transport, food, misc costs. Also, the Indian parent mentality now screams, my kid is sitting at home, so he better be learning something, outside the normal school stuff. and boom, you have the perfect environment for scammers.')
