Item(by='irq11', descendants=None, kids=[24736697], score=None, time=1602300910, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24735492, text='“There is such a thing as an ‘epidemiologist’,” is not a true statement at all. It’s a strange assertion, given that I just proved otherwise.<p>Epidemiology is not <i>one thing</i>, it’s a bunch of practitioners of different disciplines who broadly work in the area of human disease. Dismissing an expert because they are not “an epidemiologist” is like dismissing a physicist‘s opinion on math, because they are “not a mathematician”. It’s a lowbrow dismissal.')
