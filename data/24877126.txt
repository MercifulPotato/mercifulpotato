Anything that runs Linux is better off with CBOR or MessagePack or even ProtoBuf. Dunno about FreeRTOS et all. I&#x27;ve only seen libraries for JSON. ESP32 and Cortex M4 are powerful enough for serialization formats but at the expense of wasting cycles, so you&#x27;re probably better off with a custom binary protocol most of the time. But if you want to sell your product to integrators use a well supported serialization format. Nobody is going to write decoders for your custom binary format today.')
