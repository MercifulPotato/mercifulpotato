At first, I was thinking that this designer was just a junior designer and they didn&#x27;t know better, maybe learning how to implement designs so it&#x27;s fine, we can&#x27;t all be pros for day one.<p>But now when I realize that this was made from someone at Google&#x27;s UX team, it all makes sense. Interacting with this site feels exactly like interacting with the typical Google property, where all standards and expectations gets thrown out for something that probably looks pretty on the designers screen but is 80% off for everyone else.')
