I can just throw it in a bag and walk out the door.<p>It&#x27;s got enough battery life that I usually don&#x27;t need to bring a charger. It has all the ports that I ever need. I can hook it up to a projector with the built in HDMI port, I can put in the SD card from my camera, or I can quickly copy files from someones thumb drive. I don&#x27;t need to think about bringing the right kind of cables for what I&#x27;m planning to do.<p>Sure, the new Macs are a lot faster, but every Mac released after 2015 would be a downgrade for me.')
