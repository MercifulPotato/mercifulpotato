Many have race conditions in frontend code that are not revealed on fast connections or when all resources are loaded with the same speed&#x2F;consistency. Open the developer console next time it happens, I bet you’ll find a “foo is not a function” or similar error caused by something not having init yet and the code not properly awaiting it. If an SPA core loop errors out, load will be halted or even a previously loaded or partially loaded page will become blank or partially so. Refreshing it will load already retrieved resources from cache and often “fixes” the problem.')
