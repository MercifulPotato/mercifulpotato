I share some of the sentiments and believe that the authro has some misconceptions.<p>But I also believe that he makes a lot of great points. Installing and maintaining programming languages is too hard. Going from &quot;I would like to try some $lang&quot; to being up and running is usually difficult and requires you to install binaries, then deal with PATHs, and with CLIs, and REPLs and a bunch of cruft before you can start experimenting and getting to the interesting parts.<p>The programming language experience comes with a shitoad of stuff that really has very little to do with the language itself.<p>There is also a lot of potential in more flexible tools that allow me to create small apps with, well, maybe not with minimal coding, but with minimal installations, minimal integrations in my particular OS, minimal maintenance of the installed binaries and tools etc.')
