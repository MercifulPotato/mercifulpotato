So you need to engineer around that<p>And now you have N+1 problems.<p>&gt; You can’t get mad at JSON for not being good at this.<p>It&#x27;s not about being mad at JSON or even critical. It&#x27;s about recognizing that the format&#x27;s simplicity pushes some logic into either your language, your codec&#x2F;serdes or your application itself.<p>Unfortunately, what I&#x27;ve seen is that people opt for the &quot;application itself&quot; approach, do it completely ad hoc, and trust all kinds of godawful things that have no reason to be trusted.<p>If you&#x27;re using JSON and represent richer types (edit to add: and almost every JSON API does, there&#x27;s no Date type so you&#x27;re definitely making some assumptions about names or string [or bless your heart number] data), you should either:<p>- Use a transport format that extends it in a consistent way like Transit.<p>- Use the same codec logic on coupled client&#x2F;server, and make your server&#x27;s codec logic a first class part of your SDK which you should provide.<p>There&#x27;s good tools for sharing and translating type definitions. Use those too. There are better tools even than that (one of which I&#x27;m working on, and hope to have a `Show HN` soon).')
