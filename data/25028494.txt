Uncompressed raw video (like Sigma FP) is unencumbered by the patent, but the file sizes are huge.<p>RED were pioneers in the early days of digital cinematography but now they are slowing things down. Can&#x27;t really understand how they got a patent for something so simple. Even Apple lost the patent lawsuit to use compressed raw video in Prores RAW without paying royalties RED.<p>I&#x27;m hoping Blackmagic RAW would take off beyond Blackmagic cameras, but so far only Atomos has picked it up. (BM and Atomos both use FPGAs in the ISP so maybe that&#x27;s what you need to process it realtime)')
