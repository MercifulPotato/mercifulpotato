CentOS 7.x will remain as today until RHEL 7.x reaches EOL.<p>I&#x27;m very pessimistic on what this means for the RHEL ecosystem as a whole...<p>If I understand correctly, CentOS Stream 8 should be relatively stable just after a RHEL 8.x release, because the pipeline will contain just minor updates. But as the next &quot;x+1&quot; release approaches, the pipeline will contain whatever is being tested for inclusion in it. This makes CentOS Stream unsuitable for the vast majority of people that currently use CentOS in production (i.e. the people that choose CentOS over something else like Debian Stable or Ubuntu LTS).<p>One can argue that these people can go buy RHEL licenses, but they most likely don&#x27;t do that already because they see support as the value added by RHEL-proper and they can support themselves just fine. Many will also have RHEL instances along CentOS on systems that need vendor support, but pushing them to license everything may also push them into another direction altogether. Suddenly, standardizing on Ubuntu LTS (with paid support for a subset of instances) starts to make sense.<p>I think Red Hat (or maybe IBM) is vastly underestimating the value of CentOS in keeping the whole RHEL ecosystem competitive. They may be setting themselves up to be another SUSE.')
