I&#x27;m sure this was also done somehow in the mainframe world.<p>As to whether K8S is a superior embodiment of the concept, I&#x27;d say that the problem is rather that a large majority of  adopters are just cargo-culting without having a real need for what it actually provides, externalizing the costs of complexity it brings. I have nothing against K8S itself, but its adoption curve is telling of CV-driven architecture at it&#x27;s worst. Mind you, the same might have been said of J2EE back in the day.')
