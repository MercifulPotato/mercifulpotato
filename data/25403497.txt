The discussion about the fallback seems to imply that some pretty rare feature is going to be used at least for some rendering paths. I&#x27;m a bit worried that this is then reserved for some current- or previous-gen GPUs, but if you&#x27;re not amongst the lucky few, you&#x27;re going to skip straight to CPU.<p>And if that fallback isn&#x27;t fast&#x2F;easy&#x2F;ubiquitous enough, a widget library using this, might have a different&#x2F;legacy renderer altogether, with all the chaos this entails.')
