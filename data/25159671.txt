For all these syntax changes, no committee should be required. The language should be able to express these modifications itself, instead of needing to implement them at the one vendor of TypeScript. I should be able to have a macro defining my own syntax, not have to beg MS for a new syntax, which might never be implemented. It also creates a lot of work for the people having to design these changes and implement them, instead of enabling others to implement their own and share it with everyone.\nI guess you can sort of have that cake with Babel, but that is a post processing step and I am not sure it is as powerful.')
