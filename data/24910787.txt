In simulation.<p>My wild ass guess is the extra compute power is running the robot driver code. Then the human and robot actions are compared. Do some AI magic to close the gap. Any big unexplained significant deltas are forwarded to the mothership, for further analysis.<p>This notion is why I&#x27;ve gone from bear to bullish on Tesla&#x27;s autonomous driving. Tesla has more data than anyone else. And per Norvig, IIRC, more data is better than more compute.<p>What little I know about Tesla comes from HN peanut gallery and Munro Live and others on YouTube. This parallel simulation idea is just what I&#x27;d do. And may explain what all that spare compute power in each car is being used for. I don&#x27;t know if my wild ass guess is original or not.')
