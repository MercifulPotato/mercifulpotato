Can you point me to an article or documentation where this was widespread?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appleinsider.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20&#x2F;08&#x2F;20&#x2F;apple-sued-over-stage-light-macbook-pro-display-issue" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;appleinsider.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20&#x2F;08&#x2F;20&#x2F;apple-sued-over-s...</a><p>&gt; What ways has this actually impacted you?<p>None of Apple&#x27;s mistakes have impacted me because I refuse to purchase broken hardware powering a walled garden.<p>&gt; are these apps that have had any active developer attention in years?<p>I&#x27;ve got apps I run in PCem because Dosbox won&#x27;t cut it. Why should I stop using software I prefer simply because someone has made something similar, wrapped in electron, running atop a hideous tower of dependencies and bloat? Hilariously, emulating a 90s PC running FreeDOS takes less memory and CPU than utilizing some modern alternatives.<p>&gt; Do you mean quality control coming out of their factory? That their defect rates have gone up? Or do you mean their products are being poorly designed?<p>Backlight failures are both design and factory quality. The app lockout was software quality and design. The keyboard was design.')
