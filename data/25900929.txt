It&#x27;s hard to describe it, but it&#x27;s got something to do with not believing that a mathematical object exists until it&#x27;s been &quot;constructed&quot;. I&#x27;m not sure if it can adequately be described without referring to formal logic. One motivation for considering this philosophy is that mathematics becomes more &quot;computable&quot; when you do, but there are other reasons as well.<p>The statement that there are infinitely many integers is true in constructive mathematics: Given any integer, you can construct some integer  larger than it. Likewise, the statement that the real numbers are uncountable is also true: Given any sequence of real number, it&#x27;s possible to construct a real number that&#x27;s not in the sequence (using Cantor&#x27;s method).<p>The claim that all real numbers are computable doesn&#x27;t have any constructive content, so its truth depends on which version of constructivism you believe in. Personally, having looked into this, I prefer versions of constructivism in which the claim is <i>false</i>, because then you can claim things like every continuous function on R is locally uniformly continuous (which weirdly enough, implies that not all real numbers are computable, <i>without</i> asserting the stronger claim that an uncomputable one exists).')
