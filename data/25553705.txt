Or that was the plan, anyway, before the Chinese finally activated their APT and, at the last minute, replaced the passengers with CCP leaders and their families. (Satire aside, if humanity could &quot;come back&quot; from this unlikely scenario, then I&#x27;d say the excesses of the 20th and 21st century might even have been worth it. But really, the odds of any of this happening seem vanishingly small.')
