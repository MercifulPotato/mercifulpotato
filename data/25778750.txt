When you open the App Store app, that serial number is also sent, and associated with your Apple ID (email&#x2F;phone) if you log in.<p>Apple knows when you leave home, or arrive at the office, or travel to a different city, all with no Apple ID, no iCloud, and no location services.<p>This has always been the case on all devices using iOS, too.<p>This change is essential for blocking such traffic, and I&#x27;m glad for it, but there is a long way to go when it comes to pressuring the pro-privacy forces inside of Apple to do more.')
