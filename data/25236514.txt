For other data, SQLite databases that you can just download and query on your own computer, would be a good things to have, too.<p>So, SQLite is very good, for many more things than I had just listed, too. \nA few other things which use SQLite are listed at: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fileformats.archiveteam.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Category:SQLite_based_file_formats" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fileformats.archiveteam.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Category:SQLite_base...</a>')
