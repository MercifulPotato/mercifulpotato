If you are comparing to colo, I don&#x27;t know of any colocation facilities which provide higher level services (say, Kinesis). They might provide some features like CDNs, but nothing very fancy.<p>You are left with a EC2 vs servers racked in some colocation facility comparison.<p>At that point, it&#x27;s not even fair. I can run a terraform script and spin up a copy of the production environment in minutes. I don&#x27;t have to create purchase orders and wait for hardware. I don&#x27;t have to issue tickets. If any machine goes down it can be recovered in minutes, and it will spin up in another hypervisor, maybe even a different datacenter.<p>You don&#x27;t have to spend time and resources with discussions on how the &#x27;network topology&#x27; is going to look like, and then send people off to implement and wire up stuff.<p>You don&#x27;t have to spend cycles diagnosing issues just to find out that there&#x27;s a bad transceiver in a NIC somewhere. YOU DONT CARE. AWS cares and, even if they can&#x27;t find an issue, stop&#x2F;start, new hardware in minutes.<p>You cannot compare the two in good faith. Sure, it might make sense to host some workloads in a colo, but you are giving up a lot.')
