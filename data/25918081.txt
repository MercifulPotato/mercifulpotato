I&#x27;m curious as to why people set both of these clocks in the first place.<p>The microwaves and ovens I&#x27;ve seen do not actually require you to set the clock. None of their cooking features and functionality depends on it. It&#x27;s just a convenience feature. I doubt that most people actually need two clocks in the kitchen, so why not just set one of them (or neither if you don&#x27;t need a kitchen clock at all)?')
