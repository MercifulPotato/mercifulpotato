Item(by='missedthecue', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611536389, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25891678, text='<i>&quot;Symptoms range from persistent headaches, dizziness and fatigue to anxiety, insomnia and loss of concentration and memory&quot;</i><p>These are the symptoms one would experience after anything happened to them that involved their brain, be it a little lost sleep or getting knocked out by a 300 lbs linebacker.<p>Given this, the headline seems a little exaggerative and reductive to the point of being meaningless. I mean, spinning around in an office chair a dozen times will cause a few of these symptoms, but that&#x27;s not anywhere near the level of harm caused by getting concussed.')
