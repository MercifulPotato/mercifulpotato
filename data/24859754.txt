At that point it&#x27;s non-controversial and the argument about peer-review vs. no-peer-review can be separated from &quot;how do i get this back into the mainline without breaking everything?&quot;<p>Also I merge master into my branch several times a day just as a matter of habit, because yeah it&#x27;s usually better to discover conflicts ASAP instead of two weeks after they&#x27;ve happened. Keeping your branch short-lived also helps prevent conflicts in the first place.')
