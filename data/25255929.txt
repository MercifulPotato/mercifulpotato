I&#x27;ve fixed a bug specific to perl-5.10.0 about a week ago and so far the module hasn&#x27;t been picked up by that version again.<p>So while this is definitely good as a service for the general public, it doesn&#x27;t get you very far if you&#x27;re trying to build a thing that&#x27;s supposed to ensure compatibility for other Perl modules across 20 years of Perl history. :)')
