Additionally, all the greenhouse gasses you have already emitted are still in the atmosphere so just stopping emissions will only stop the heating up (if we are lucky) and not automatically result in the climate returning to &quot;normal&quot;.<p>*: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;North_Sea_flood_of_1953" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;North_Sea_flood_of_1953</a>')
