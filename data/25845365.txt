All these companies started up making cards that you could plug into your Apple II and write a little software (mostly games at first) on cassette tapes. You’d go to the store and they’d just have all this stuff that you could buy to enhance the Apple II.<p>So one of our big keys to success was that we were very open. There’s a big world out there for other people to come and join us.&quot;<p>Steve Wozniak in &quot;Founders at Work&quot; by Jessica Livingston.')
