And thus, attempting to pull mankind together with a single giant lie, whether it be an afterlife, a god head, or fear of a fire demon such as old man summer conquering old man winter, we are likely to be run asunder if we rely on a lie to unite us.<p>as a student of the jewish path, and many other paths, i find that this particular demon or &#x27;baal&#x27; , the one of &#x27;climatapocalypse&#x27; is unlikely to withstand even the briefest test of time. in 2 generations, at most, this demon will likely be forgotten as just some other random god offered sacrfice and attention at the altar of human effort.<p>humanity must find a path forwards, one with some profound measure of relativistic truth in it, but this doens&#x27;t mean shallow lies , lies , of course, containing some measure of truth, will unite us. they won&#x27;t. study humanity. you will see the patterns are about as slow as the ice ages themselves. after all, we&#x27;ve only been around for 200,000 years in our possibly entirely modern forms. and only 11,000 years with agriculture and recorded traces of writing. \nalas, how do we emerge from this , that is a much bigger question. will we have a chrysalis? if &#x27;climate change&#x27; is part of it, that&#x27;s not bad, but it would still be surprising.')
