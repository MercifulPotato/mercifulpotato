They are not against it because it doesn&#x27;t help. So rather than saying no shutdowns, how about we take the proper steps and have a moratorium on rent and mortgages so solve the root of the issue.&quot;<p>inspires me to believe that the brutal and short shutdown, with the planned measures to prevent ordinary people getting  penalized during it would in fact be the best treatment imaginable, with the least long term consequences.<p>But I also imagine enough those who would never be ready to accept such an approach for having huge ideological objections.<p>Thinking even more about it, some kind of such a response indeed happened in the world and gave the results. Knowing that result and proper planing can surely allow for even less negative effects than those observed.')
