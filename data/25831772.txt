So even if you totally disable security on your machine and patch the kernel, you won&#x27;t be able to run encrypted app store apps since the device&#x27;s FairPlay decryption key is withdrawn before you gain code execution. You can, of course, still can decrypt them using a jailbroken iOS device (or...AS mac I guess lol) and run them, but that&#x27;s significantly harder.')
