It&#x27;s possible that I&#x27;d &quot;win&quot; and allowances would be made, but it&#x27;s also possible I&#x27;d end up making some real enemies and&#x2F;or put on a track out the door.<p>One hopefully-unusual circumstance here is that most of the rest of my team (and in fact the company) either don&#x27;t mind the situation much, or at least aren&#x27;t openly vocal about it, which makes me look like that one nail hanging out that&#x27;s ready to be slammed back down.<p>&gt; <i>Quit &#x2F; change teams, citing oncall as the issue</i><p>This is probably the inevitable solution unfortunately, although I will feel bad exiting (making the rotation even smaller) and without having moved anything in the right direction.<p>&gt; <i>Why are some issues not solvable by engineering? Would simply resetting expectations mitigate the largest issues&#x2F;waking up at night?</i><p>Yeah, agreed. This is the obvious way out if at all possible, but there are many types of alarms where it&#x27;s fairly difficult. For example: (1) cases where there is a big problem and we get paged essentially as a side effect of one failure causing issues in our part of the system, or (2) catch-all alarms designed to page when something looks suspicious enough to merit human attention, even if not a known failure case. There&#x27;s a strong attitude of err-on-potential-issues, so relaxing any of these tends to be a no-go politically.')
