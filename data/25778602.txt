I would argue that the solution is that those corporations need to be regulated and broken up into smaller parts.<p>So, I think we need to do something about amazon, but in this case, we also needed to do something about parler, and now amazon did that for us.<p>The zuckerberg example: I would argue that in that scenario, it would be (at least) equally obvious that said regulations where needed. The difference would be that in that scenario, I would argue that zuckerberg was abusing his power, but with what&#x27;s happening now, I don&#x27;t think that amazon is abusing their power, (because I think that amazons reason is a valid one), but I still think that they shouldn&#x27;t have that much power.<p>I&#x27;m a bit tired, but hopefully I&#x27;m still making some sense.')
