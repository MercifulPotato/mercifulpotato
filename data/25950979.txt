It&#x27;s a &quot;fuck you&quot; to Wall Street. They exploit the working class, get rich, fuck up our economy, and then steal even more from us to save their own asses.<p>People are tired of it. Gamestop is a form of protest. Robinhood did the worst thing they could by messing with it. They sided with Wall Street against the little guy. It shows how rigged the system is. Apparently the little guy can&#x27;t exploit a bad trade by the rich, it can only go the other way around. So now Robinhood is on the other side of this, and I hope they go under from it.')
