Seems to whom, on what evidence?<p>That&#x27;s the difference between someone who has cultivated a history of performing reputable journalism, defended under the scrutiny of editors, fact finders, and the public and low effort armchair experts, spin doctors, popular conspiracy theorists, and other soundbite spewing talking heads.<p>I&#x27;m not exempt, but my point is that when subjected to the same standards and scrutiny we might hold another to, especially on the internet, we don&#x27;t often fare as well as we&#x27;d think.')
