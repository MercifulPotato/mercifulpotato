Its described in the article itself that microplastic attracts&#x2F;collects toxins (heavy metals etc.). We already know that plenty of animals are dying because of plastic as well.<p>Also general speaking, while we live longer everyday, it still can mean that we live longer but worse due to microplastic and its affects on us. Sleep issues perhaps? Alzheimer perhaps? Depression?<p>For me personally speaking, this feels very unnatural (and i don&#x27;t like this word at all normally) and its sickening to know that we produce a product and it is now floating in our bloodstreams and it doesn&#x27;t need to be there.<p>We have had millions of years of an selfs sustainable ecosystem and we arrive, produce an enormous amount of plastic and taint our own environment in such an idiotic way. It is now everywhere. We found it in rainwater, on mountain tops etc.<p>1950 0 tones of plastic production per year vs. 2015 350 Million tons.<p>It also weirds me out a little bit to see that other people actually don&#x27;t care or don&#x27;t see any issues with it.')
