I think I have good reasons to disagree and that every example I listed has real world implications negatively affecting people and not just because they chose to follow Catholic norms.<p>Do I feel I am persecuting the Catholic Church? No.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Death_of_Savita_Halappanavar" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Death_of_Savita_Halappanavar</a>')
