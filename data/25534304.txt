They&#x27;re a VC, that&#x27;s what they want, of course they&#x27;d be endorsing it. It doesn&#x27;t hurt their brand, again because they are interested only in making money, and founders are similarly interested in a VC that pushes their company to make more money. That you as a bystander (not even a customer) don&#x27;t like it is inconsequential to both YC and their portfolio companies. See my response to another comment in the thread for more context.')
