Maybe they should ask these other dog park goers _why_ they are so interested in status of their dog&#x27;s reproductive organs...<p>In my own anecdotal experience, my male golden retriever (who I&#x27;ve spent considerable time socializing and training since adoption at 8 weeks), started to display some territorial and dominance issues around the 18mo mark. This behavior was particularly apparent around other intact males of equal-to-larger sizes than him, and culminated in a defensive fight with another (intact) lab mix.<p>I made the choice to schedule his neutering that day.<p>Since then (~6 months ago), his behavior has mellowed out considerably -- far more so than what I would otherwise attribute to maturing. I try not to judge people that harshly who make the choice not to neuter in the area (urban US city), but at the same time believe too many minimize an intact Fuffy&#x27;s higher (IMO) propensity for dominant and aggressive behavior in social circumstances. Too often have I heard, &#x27;he&#x27;s a &lt;retriever&#x2F;doodle&#x2F;some other family dog..&gt;, obviously he wouldn&#x27;t hurt a fly!&#x27; and it really grinds my gears.<p>Having an intact dog in a denser area is a huge responsibility (beyond potential offspring) and good owners should recognize this..especially if they&#x27;re bringing these dogs into semi-controlled environments with strangers -- who, I&#x27;d posit, are more concerned about a harder-to-control Fluffy stepping over the line and their dog getting injured or worse, rather than causing an unexpected pregnancy.')
