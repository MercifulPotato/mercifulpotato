GPU drivers have long followed an &quot;exokernel&quot; approach: the kernel just ensures that access to the hardware is multiplexed with enforced security boundaries, everything else -- the actual abstracting over hardware differences -- is done by userspace libraries.<p>It&#x27;s somewhat amusing to me that the people who discuss exokernels rarely talk about GPUs, even though that&#x27;s the one area of computing where exokernel ideas are universally deployed today.')
