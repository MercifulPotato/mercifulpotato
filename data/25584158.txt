For a 49 year old with hypertension, diabetes, and morbid obesity then their risk will be significantly higher. For a 20 year old with no co-morbid conditions then their fatality risk is virtually zero.<p>That&#x27;s only for fatalities. We don&#x27;t have solid data on long term symptoms (those that last more than a few months), but those appear to be very rare among healthy 20 year olds.')
