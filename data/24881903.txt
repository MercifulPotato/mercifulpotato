I don’t really subscribe to the “death is natural” idea. It’s certainly not a taboo for me, but my experience of life is the ultimate natural high and sure when it has gone I won’t be here to mourn the loss. But you can be upset (naturally so) and grieve for what you will lose, by knowing your life will be cut short or the shared future you have lost when someone you love dies.<p>Without that capacity, we would lose the precious ability to imagine a better life.<p>Hope is the feeling that takes us out of absurdity. Hope that one day the nature of the universe will be understood.')
