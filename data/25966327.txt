Am I wrong?<p>Wouldn&#x27;t this accumulation strategy make more sense even if it&#x27;s harder to apply?<p>I ask because it&#x27;s clear that vaccination has become so political everywhere that govs are rushing to &quot;start immunization&quot; while not being able to garantee a sustainable rate of vaccinations.')
