For X day of suspension, fine Y. And so on.<p>If they give tools for people to make their lively hood on, then they are responsible for their mistakes. This is happening for far too long, on too many platforms: Youtube, Amazon, Twitch... only if you have special access to insiders, or if you&#x27;re some kind of celebrity, or you reach a massive outcry, is when you are able to reach a human that solves your problem rather quickly?<p>I say that&#x27;s bullshit.
