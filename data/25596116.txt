Before the restrictions, watching the fireworks meant ensuring a crush of people for hours, and even getting away from the riverside afterwards could take over an hour. Getting a paramedic in and out of that was terrible, not to mention toilets and small children.<p>Anyone who can look up to the sky is welcome to do so, from hills, rooftops, balconies etc.')
