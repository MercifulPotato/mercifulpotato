I just sold a perfectly fine car for less than $2000, having bought it new 10 years ago.  Someone else will probably buy that car, after a few cosmetic things are fixed, for $3000 or so.  It&#x27;s spent most of its life south of Pennsylvania, so it doesn&#x27;t have road salt damage, and will probably last another 10 years or more with regular oil changes, etc.')
