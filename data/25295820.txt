(Some developers can move now, and — because Xcode running on the M1 compiles code so much faster than any Intel MacBook — are rejoicing.)&quot;<p>I know that HN has many more active&#x2F;vocal webdevs than native software developers, and so the point may be lost on some. I suspect that Gruber doesn&#x27;t understand why his point  is actually so completely accurate.<p><i>Developers</i> (native ones at least) need to compile, a lot. Compilation is an embarrassingly parallel task: if you&#x27;ve got N cores, you can use N cores and get a linear speedup for every expansion in N you are offered.<p>The M1 seems like an awfully nice system for people concerned about CPU&#x2F;Watt, and an awfully nice system who want a very powerful bit of hardware to run macOS on.<p>What it remains is a less-than-top-of-the-line system for people who care about CPU&#x2F;$ or just maxCPU. No doubt if you&#x27;re used to building native code on existing MacBook Pro or even a Mini, the M1 systems will seem incredible.<p>But I&#x27;m building my software on a 12 core, 32GBM VM running on a threadripper, while still able to read Hacker News and listening to Soma FM in the Linux&#x2F;Debian host environment, and for people like me (especially the even tinier set who also are net-zero for electrical supply thanks to solar PV), the M1 systems are just not interesting so far.<p>But then, as Gruber said, I&#x27;m a developer, and this mismatch is caused by the set of tools I use.')
