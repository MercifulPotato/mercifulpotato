Some of the others precompute the vectors between the pairs, but that&#x27;s not the expensive part of computing the distance.<p>As an aside: this made me notice this n-body simulation only has 5 bodies! This is a pretty strange case that makes these O(n^2) optimizations practical. The n-body simulations I&#x27;ve been familiar with in the past had thousands of bodies, where this approach probably isn&#x27;t a good idea.')
