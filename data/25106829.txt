The only on-ballot challenger to the incumbent used political tactics that overcame what would normally be exclusionary credentials. It was so successful, I was taken aback by it.<p>At one point I had a chance to speak with the candidate by phone, and I spoke about my concerns about the divisive rhetoric.<p>The candidate said it was only something they had to do to &quot;fire up my base&quot; and that they would not govern in the way they had campaigned.<p>Hearing that sent a chill down my spine and I voted against this person.')
