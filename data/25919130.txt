The old one was much faster to operate. It was like this: you are in this page, tap the tabs button at the top, the screen with all the open tabs appears, tap + at the same place of the other button and get to the top sites &#x2F; bookmarks screen. Or tap the URL and get directly there.\nThe new UI takes more taps and I don&#x27;t understand what that is supposed to improve.<p>I updated my tablet and my old phone to check the UI. I&#x27;m staying on the old Firefox on my main phone, partly because of the UI and 90% because of the add-ons I&#x27;m using. Not all of them are available on the new Firefox.<p>Mozilla self sabotages every few years, then fixes things. Unfortunately they lose users along the way.')
