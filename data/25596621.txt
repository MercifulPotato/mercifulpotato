Refusing to take obvious common sense precautions simply because you don&#x27;t like the fact that the government is telling you to do it is not individualism, it&#x27;s stupidity. In fact, individualists would have been taking precautions against COVID well <i>before</i> the government was telling anyone to do it (see further comments below).<p>Nor is authoritarianism or valuing conformity necessarily a strength during a situation like COVID. South Korea and China both took authoritarian approaches, but they were very <i>different</i> authoritarian approaches with very different human costs. South Korea wasn&#x27;t welding people inside their homes.<p>As for valuing conformity, people who valued conformity in the US, for example, were waiting until the government told them to take precautions before they took precautions--which was too late. My wife and I started taking precautions at the end of February, at which time the government and other authorities were still saying that things weren&#x27;t going to get that bad and everyone should keep traveling and not worry so much. By the time the government started telling people to take precautions, we were already weeks into exponential growth. And then, of course, things swung to the other extreme and we started slamming barn doors shut and barring them after the horses had already left.')
