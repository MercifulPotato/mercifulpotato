Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s that or something else, but I have this weird problem that it&#x27;s as if my biological clock day is a bit longer than 24 hours. So if I don&#x27;t discipline myself, if I go to bed whenever I want and wake up without an alarm, my sleep schedule goes to crap fairly quickly. Even if I do, it still drifts somewhat. At some point it becomes so bad that my waking hours are at night and vice versa. I then have to fix it by forcing myself to stay up all day because I live in a society that sleeps at night after all. Waking up for school and then university was a torture for me, too, but at least that kept my sleep schedule in check somewhat at the price of only ever getting enough sleep on the weekends.')
