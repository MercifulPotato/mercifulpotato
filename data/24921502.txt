I got into FLL in late elementary school, though the age range accepts kids from pre-K through middle school [1].<p>FLL uses LEGO Mindstorms robots, while later FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC)and FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) use metal&#x2F;plastic parts. In FRC we used milling machines and CAD, big steps up from playing with LEGOs.<p>The FIRST programs are amazingly educational and fun engineering&#x2F;programming experiences. I cannot recommend them enough. Going through FLL and FRC was life changing for me, getting me into programming and building teamworking and countless other skills.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.firstinspires.org&#x2F;robotics&#x2F;fll" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.firstinspires.org&#x2F;robotics&#x2F;fll</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.firstinspires.org&#x2F;robotics&#x2F;fll&#x2F;what-is-first-lego-league" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.firstinspires.org&#x2F;robotics&#x2F;fll&#x2F;what-is-first-leg...</a>')
