Evidence is evidence and people should be taught to expect evidence rather than blindly believing words.<p>Even your statement here is an evidence of propaganda. Just because you repeat a lie does not make it true it makes it commonplace. Much like the earth is flat and the many hundreds of years of things said by the various churchs.<p>You do nothing to improve the situation and only seek to destroy information and belittle people into treating them like mere children incapable of discerning information themselves. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s called propaganda and you&#x27;re taking part in it.<p>Treat people like adults who have the mental depth to actually have a conversation not open vats where you can just throw info in enough and assume anything said becomes true.<p>You know what really works when you repeat a lie enough times to make it believable? When you delete anything that calls into question that statement. Which you happen to be for and yet you should be against it because it makes it so &quot;authorities&quot; are able to say things and be automatically trusted and assumed to be fact, can&#x27;t argue that they&#x27;re wrong now, can you?<p>You literally cannot defeat racism, fascism, or oppression using racism, fascism, or oppression. It just flips who the fucking person or group fucking doing it.')
