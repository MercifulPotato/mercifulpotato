Item(by='sokoloff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611416677, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25882873, text='Legally, you would have to do certification tests on every airplane type again.<p>A 10% loss of power would require much more than 10% increase in runway for a given weight.<p>Further, a 10% loss of energy density would require heavier takeoff weights for any given trip, meaning the penalty is further increased. I’m already weight-limited (either by certification limits or runway performance) on some flights. I carry about equal mass of fuel and people on trips with the whole family aboard.<p>I’m not crying about it and I hope to see a viable 100UL emerge, but a 10% loss on two variables in the fuel would result in a lot more than “just use an extra 300 feet of takeoff roll and she’ll be a’ight”.')
