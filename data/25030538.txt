The two ways that is see self governance succeeding is through a strong,  homogeneous national (cultural) identity, or through philosophical enlightenment in the form of expansive tolerance of others and the suppression of natural tribalistic behavior.<p>The national&#x2F;cultural identity can be fragile due to the population changing and situations evolving. I do think population size plays a part in this, but I don&#x27;t think there a hard number.<p>The tolerance of others and avoiding tribalism is nearly impossible due to human nature. Just drawing the line on what is tolerable and what should be punished (law and crime) will at least divide the population into lawful citizens and criminals, if not political factions. Most people don&#x27;t have the ability to self recognize confirmation bias (even very difficult for trained people to do).')
