On Medium alone you&#x27;ll find multiple articles on one topic with completely opposing thoughts.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily see this as a negative thing, however. It&#x27;s bad in the sense that sometimes I can&#x27;t find a quick answer when I just want to copy paste a solution. On the other hand, I found that it has forced me to read multiple different solutions&#x2F;opinions (often including source code), which deepens my knowledge on the topic and puts me in a better position to make an educated decision.<p>Sure, it&#x27;d be nice to have the perfect answer just slapped in your face. But nothing beats the feeling of finally getting something to work, but also understanding <i>why</i> exactly it works in the first place.')
