Because every tiny trail is in there and Google Maps is lacking this. I don’t use OSM directly, because Komoot offers additional data on top of OSM such as photos, trails etc.<p>I wonder why the author doesn’t include the simple fact in the analysis that Google Maps doesn’t win because of its map data, but because of the additional data it provides and OSM is one layer below. It’s not an equal comparison.')
