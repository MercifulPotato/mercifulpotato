But that question isn&#x27;t as useful as others that could be asked, such as &quot;which policies make the world get better?&quot;<p>Hinkel&#x27;s argument is that Pinker uses &quot;is the world getting better?&quot; as a proxy for &quot;are my preferred policies making the world better?&quot;. If policy evaluation is their goal, the ad-hoc exclusion of China is overly simplistic, but so is drawing policy conclusions from overall trends without examining what&#x27;s driving the trends. Both Pinker and Hinkel should be measuring the degree to which various policies were applied and evaluate poverty-reduction against that quantity.')
