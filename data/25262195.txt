They said things like, how can we make a better battery pack and will the math then work for a good EV car. They showed to their satisfaction that the answer was yes, and built from there to a degree. Their battery &#x2F; powertrain work has been consistently good before any of the huge capital efforts, and the path forward was pretty well defined.<p>Same with their rocket engines. They iterate and qualify pretty quickly.<p>ITER and these folks are spending billions on what is actually ancient tech with really no realistic (I don&#x27;t think) path to sustainable commercial power even theoretically in any reasonable time horizon. This is the Space Launch System approach, gear up and go on old tech.<p>We do need someone in a lab (Tesla &#x2F; SpaceX style) iterating, and then proving out key physics &#x2F; components. The problem with ITER, you CANNOT stop funding it, it&#x27;s just gobbling up all the money because the number of jobs now tied to this - it&#x27;s a jobs machine basically.<p>At spaceX it doesn&#x27;t feel like their are a lot of sacred cows. These maga projects are pure sacred cow it feels like sometime. It&#x27;s private &#x2F; personal capital driven.')
