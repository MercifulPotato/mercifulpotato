Thank you for pointing that out.  As of now, the four text buttons should say &quot;Scramble&quot;, &quot;Solve&quot;, &quot;Record&quot; and &quot;Rewind&quot;.  I will check with Firefox to see if I get blank buttons with no visible text.  The radio buttons have no labels or text associated with them currently.  I will add little pictures next to them of the sub-puzzles they select.')
