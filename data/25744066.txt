The Canadian tech scene is limited not by the Captains of Canada’s industry (although it might be a factor, but not the major one) but by the simple fact that Canada’s economy and population are much smaller than the US and importantly, Canada doesn’t throw insane amounts of Cash into its Defense industry. They also cannot deficit spend forever like the US can because of the USD. I would wager these structural issues are likely to be more consequential than debating over compensation fixation.')
