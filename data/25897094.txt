Grew up in Devon and lived in the South Midlands on the M4. Left the UK 15 years ago for somewhere better :)<p>The UK has - quite literally - decayed in that time. It&#x27;s really sad visiting, seeing high streets gutted. Infrastructure dilapidated. So few young people. So many people in terrible shape. All signs of the economic disparity that the statistics showed.<p>The right have their modus operandi, they&#x27;re the same everywhere. The two-party system in the UK (and US) enables the very worst of their behaviour because they&#x27;re able to concentrate power more easily and have paths to minority rule.<p>I almost suspect that the Farage class of politicians are designed (and funded) to fill the gap which which would otherwise be filled by socially progressive populists. Someone to the left of Corbyn (who is center-left despite the media lies) but with charisma.')
