Item(by='grugagag', descendants=None, kids=[25190061], score=None, time=1606150129, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25188518, text='I don&#x27;t know, I personally understood the comment without any problem and wasn&#x27;t even aware that loose was used instead of lose until it was pointed out. I got the meaning perfectly well from the context. To me these kind of comments pointing out to misspelled words are pedantic at best.\nAnd I take back that they&#x27;re pronounced the same, I ran it through my head a few sentences and there&#x27;s a difference at the end but it still does not make any sense and these rules are quite arbitrary and sometimes even contradictory.<p>Why does lose pronounce the way it does when nose doesn&#x27;t pronounce as noose, pose doesn&#x27;t pronounce as poose, lol.. It&#x27;s even funny if you ask me.<p>Let the grammar police whip me down with downvotes but I still stand up by my opinion, English is a frigging weird language full of quirks. I speak 4 languages and 2 of them are Latin based and almost never run into the same kind of issues as English. French does not pronounce the way it is written but at least is consistent about it.<p>And nobody bothered to respond to the original comment other than making pedantic remarks. You&#x27;ve got too much free time on your hands.')
