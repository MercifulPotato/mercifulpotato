Someone who has a blog is no less a journalist than anyone at a national newspaper.<p>&gt; They have to rely on real newspapers or the pentagon (!) to do it for them. It’s no defence to say: we tried to get other people to help us do the right thing<p>Actually it is. That&#x27;s why intention is regularly taken into account in court cases and it shows WikiLeaks had the intention to redact and if needed even via the Pentagon.<p>&gt; but we couldn’t, so we did the wrong thing instead.<p>They did no &#x27;wrong&#x27; thing <i>instead</i>. They tried to consult the U.S. Government about any needed redactions and then published vital information to inform the public that the government is committing war crimes of foreign soil in their name.<p>Not publishing that would&#x27;ve been wrong and was most likely the goal of the Pentagon in not cooperating.<p>Is similar with zero days, researchers publish them if the vendor doesn&#x27;t cooperate because not doing so and letting black hats exploit a known bug is way more &#x27;wrong&#x27; than publishing the 0day widely is.')
