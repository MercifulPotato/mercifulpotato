The basic workflow was to compose the deck in LibreOffice and then do a few conversions:<p>- ODT -&gt; PDF\n- PDF -&gt; directory of PNG images<p>Then all you need is a basic web page with an image and some nav buttons, coupled with some JS that knows the list of files and can update the image&#x27;s URL based on nav button clicks. At the end you have a portable web slide deck.<p>Fancier setups are definitely possible (you could for example mimic multi-monitor presenter mode by having multiple\npages where one drives the other via websockets, or even just add a timer and presenter&#x27;s notes) but it gets\naround having to hope that the other side has a decent PDF reader or a presentation editor that likes your preferred file format.')
