What you&#x27;re saying there is a mix of half-truths.<p>One is of course that &quot;I suppose you can call it a kind of honor system,&quot; no, you can&#x27;t, it&#x27;s enforceable by law and actively collected upon. That&#x27;s not an honor system.<p>&gt; And given your examples, you apparently aren&#x27;t aware that when it comes to emergence care in the US, hospitals which have an emergency department are required by law to provide emergency care as needed to make sure a patient is stable.<p>Yes, the bare minimum, then ejecting them out the back door as soon as they possibly can. Of course by waiting until they require emergency care you&#x27;re fleecing everyone. Minor issues that could have been addressed earlier for pennies on the dollar are instead allowed to fester until they become life-threatening, then when the poor can&#x27;t pay, it&#x27;s socialized across those who can at the <i>worst possible time</i> for the <i>highest possible price.</i><p>Not to mention, this is an argument <i>against</i> the free market approach which would just be to refuse service. This is actually bolstering my case that healthcare is not a free market because of a lack of ability to form a voluntary contract.<p>&gt; One&#x27;s ability to pay is not a factor.<p>Oh come on now. Who doesn&#x27;t have health insurance? The poor. Who&#x27;s going to get the bare minimum treatment required be law and getting booted out the back door? The poor. Who&#x27;s then going to get a bill for it forcing them to declare bankruptcy? The poor.<p>This is strictly about one&#x27;s ability to pay.')
