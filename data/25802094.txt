But as a newcomer, you cannot know which one it is, and as the OP said this behaviour has a lot of chances to be perceived as invalidating. I&#x27;ve been on both sides of this situation, and in both cases I felt that it was almost disrespectful, it&#x27;s sending the message that you don&#x27;t think the team is competent enough to have considered them and carefully picked trade-offs.<p>When I was on the receiving side (there was a newcomer to the team doing a lot of &quot;suggestions for improvement&quot;), I made a lot of effort to explain the context that led to a different decision, but it was very draining and rarely the good time for it (it distracts from the conversation), it was really hurting collaboration. Eventually we had a one-to-one in which I explained exactly that, and we found that it would be much better to raise these as &quot;can you tell me why is this one like this&quot; (rather than &quot;improvement suggestion&quot; that can be invalidating), and do it in one-to-one so that it&#x27;s not distracting. Collaboration was much better after that<p>For sure, it&#x27;s great to have a new pair of eyes and you certainly don&#x27;t want to tell somebody to keep their challenges and suggestion for improvement for themselves. But it doesn&#x27;t mean that there&#x27;s no good way or bad way to do it')
