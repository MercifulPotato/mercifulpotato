I have to re-pair them every time I use them (often multiple times.) no matter if its with a mac, an android phone, a linux pc, or whatever. its pairing sucks. if anyone wants to buy this wait until you&#x27;ve verified from other people that it pairs well with your devices. a 500 USD headset SHOULD be able to connect well for that price and if it doesn&#x27;t its most certainly flawed... note: that im using an earlier version of airpods so maybe this flaw is absent in later airpods? but i thought id share this negative experience')
