You don&#x27;t need to __own__ an expensive or complicated mechanism to &quot;appreciate it&quot;. It&#x27;s enough for it to exist in the world. I appreciate the ingenuity of ITER, I don&#x27;t want to own it.<p>Also, it can be argued that pointless mechanical complexity (mechanical watches are truly pointless today) is immoral profligate decadence, and misallocation of human labor. Some grand complication watches cost obscene money.<p>&gt;I find its ability to keep time through purely mechanical rather than digital processes fascinating<p>The price ceiling for a well crafted relatively complicated mechanical watch minus the status, prestige etc is $1000, and automatic mechanical Seikos start from around $100. Doesn&#x27;t explain the $7000 for cheapest steel Rolex, or most watches interesting to an average watch nerd.<p>&gt;when I am 80 years old and I can give it to my son<p>Modern quartz watches can also do that, and won&#x27;t require any part swapping due to wear.<p>&gt;You conflate &quot;rational&quot; with &quot;utilitarian&quot; or &quot;practical&quot;<p>rational is defined as &quot;based on sensible practical reasons rather than  emotions&quot; in MacMillan dictionary for example.')
