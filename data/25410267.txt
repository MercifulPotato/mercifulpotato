I have seen stoped cycling between rows of parked cars and darting through a red light, or going full speed down a sidewalk past rows of parking garages etc.  Without dash cams it’s nearly impossible to tell the root cause as reckless driver or a suicidal cyclist.<p>This is why both drivers and cyclists really should be recording things.  It doesn’t prevent injuries,  if it can make a huge difference afterwards.')
