And a facility to store these batteries (and charge them). Oh and these batteries are quite valuable, at least half the price of the EV. You would also need to have different size batteries, based on the EV model, the battery model (LF or SF), etc etc.<p>You would have to staff these Battery Swap (I&#x27;ll call them BS) facilities for when the machinery breaks down, or damages a car, or any other of a myriad number of problems. You would also need substantial real estate for this BS facility, zoned appropriately.<p>Or you could simply install some automated charging stations that don&#x27;t require any of this CAPEX or headache. Pretty easy to see why this is the model Tesla pursued.')
