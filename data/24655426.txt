I also think that languages that are noob friendly can achieve broader appeal and greater mindshare.<p>For example, ruby has plenty of warts and annoyances that become evident with experience, but I still find plenty of ruby code that’s lovely to read (like it’s telling a story). Plenty of atrocities too, which is exacerbated by the language.<p>I see the value in succinct languages too, which require a knowledge investment to be productive. Just more efficient.<p>It’s kinda like QWERTY  typists and stenographers, but with far more middle ground.
