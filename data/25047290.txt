Item(by='ashtonkem', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605023484, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25041716, text='I was actually trained in ~15th century longsword (modern term) fencing, in the Italian school.<p>We actually had a drill called the &quot;villains blow&quot;[0] designed to deal with an untrained assailant attempting an overly strong top down blow. The basic story is that a peasant (villain basically means &quot;poor&quot; back in the day) has gotten their hands on a sword and would like to express their displeasure about how their life is going on you. It&#x27;s scary how effective the drill is, during slow speed training you have to actually fight to slow the weapon down. At speed it&#x27;ll end an engagement with one blow; someone chopped in the neck tends to stop fighting very quickly. In a sword fight between a trained person and an untrained person, the trained combatant will win convincingly the vast majority of the time.<p>Beyond that there were fairly complex drills about fighting multiple opponents when unarmored, which we never practiced because it&#x27;s a logistical nightmare. It can be done, but it&#x27;s going to be <i>very</i> hard to pull off; you effectively have to move in a way to make your opponents interfere with each other. Doable, but since unarmored longsword fencing is a very high stakes game, chances are even if it works you&#x27;re leaving with an interesting scar and perhaps fewer fingers than you started with.<p>One manuscript (I forget which) had some section that basically said this &quot;if you find yourself set upon by five or more peasants while in harness (hard plate), stand as you will and cut them down one by one&quot;. It is extremely hard to kill someone wearing full plate armor if they&#x27;re standing and prepared. You either need overwhelming numbers, specialized weapons designed to defeat hard armor, or they need to be knocked down onto the ground first (there&#x27;s a reason &quot;he fell&quot; was a euphemism for death in combat). Ideally (if you&#x27;re not the knight), you&#x27;d like to see all three. This is what happened in Agincourt, where freaked out English archers (who wouldn&#x27;t be ransomed if they lost) swarmed and drowned the exhausted French knights in the mud while beating them to death with hammers for good measure.<p>As an aside, the difficulty of getting up in armor is vastly overstated[1]. Yes, plate armor is heavy, but any armor that you can&#x27;t move in is a death trap, plus the vast majority of this stuff was worn by men who would be in <i>fantastic</i> shape, since fighting was their only job. The problem with plate armor isn&#x27;t that it&#x27;s impossible to get up in, the problem with plate armor is that it&#x27;s impossible to get up when you&#x27;re being opposed. Think less &quot;I can&#x27;t get up&quot; and more &quot;I can&#x27;t get up with another guy on top of me trying to kill me&quot;. Plus while armor is heavy (50-60lbs isn&#x27;t unusual), it&#x27;s not <i>that</i> heavy; for comparison a typical Marine might carry 100-200lbs into Afghanistan.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=9yTH0ADnBZg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=9yTH0ADnBZg</a><p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qzTwBQniLSc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qzTwBQniLSc</a>')
