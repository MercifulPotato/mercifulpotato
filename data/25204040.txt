I went to med school for two years in my home country, married to a doctor who is in her residency training in the US and couldn&#x27;t agree more.<p>If you look at my HN comment history, you&#x27;ll see that I&#x27;ve tried to mention that part of the problem of exorbitant healthcare expenses in the US is the artificial scarcity of doctors. It starts with this inflated&#x2F;unnecessary requirement to have a bachelor&#x27;s degree before going to med school. Other nations in the world (e.g., India) do fine with training their doctors for five years (even that, I think is too much; the first year of med school training in my country is pretty much an extended high school curriculum not essential to medicine).<p>An internal medicine (generalist) doctor in the US can earn $250K right after finishing the residency. Elsewhere in the world (e.g., in the UK), the doctors earn about $90-150K.<p>I also have to agree with you that contrary to the popular belief in the US, doctors can be fairly un-intellectual. The main requirement to do well in their career is to rely on rote memorization (go check out on YouTube how Anki is so important&#x2F;popular among med school people).')
