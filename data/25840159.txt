Some choices are scary to actually make, but are healthy. For instance, my mom stayed with her abusive husband for many years because she had Stockholm syndrome. If you had asked her why didn&#x27;t she leave during that time, she would say &quot;I didn&#x27;t have a choice&quot;. Ask her now, and she will tell you &quot;Fear - fear of not knowing how things would work out.&quot;<p>Sometimes the hardest choices to make are the impossible choices.')
