It isn&#x27;t the actual problem.<p>You get advertising whether or not you pay for a channel. You even get ads at the cinema. You get spied on when you buy a phone, echo, when you use a paid app, subscribe to netflix, etc. It has nothing to do with free, in practice. This is just a way of pointing the finger at the public. <i>&quot;You are being abused because you are cheap and deserve to be&quot;</i>.<p>The &quot;problem&quot; is that advertising &amp; espionage while creating market&#x2F;portal&#x2F;platform&#x2F;feed monopolies is the most profitable strategy in most cases. A lot more profitable than selling stuff is. Just look at the largest fortunes made in recent times. A non-spyware messaging app would never be worth what FB paid for whatsapp, no matter how many paying users it had.<p>Let&#x27;s stop pretending that our moral failings and cheapskates are the problem.<p>Newspapers have often had financial problems, and it has almost always been the case that &quot;hard journalism&quot; is not as profitable as entertainment media. Google are leveraging this to further cement their monopoly. <i>They</i> are the problem, not us. We are the victims.')
