Lack of evidence doesn&#x27;t make something fake, but it doesn&#x27;t make it true either. Twitter is pointing that out and telling people where things don&#x27;t have evidence so they shouldn&#x27;t automatically accept it as true (or fake). Where something is incredibly influential and could lead to  violence I think Twitter should be wary about publishing it. People&#x27;s safety is important, so while I don&#x27;t think Twitter should block speech I do think putting a warning on it is reasonable.<p><i>If Twitter had existed since the 60s, would it be right for them to block everything mentioning Higgs boson until evidence for it was found in 2012?</i><p>Anyone with even the tiniest bit of science education talked about the Higgs Boson as a no more than a possibility and definitely not a fact until it was proved experimentally and the evidence was clear for anyone to see. If people had been saying it was definitely real then a skeptical warning that there wasn&#x27;t any evidence to prove that might not have been a bad idea.')
