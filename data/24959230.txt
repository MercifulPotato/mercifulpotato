(the Sweden Democrats are probably the biggest party now, if there&#x27;d be an election today)<p>When you&#x27;re told by the press and politicians that even raising a topic makes you racist and you should be cancelled, you&#x27;re not exactly going to be won over.<p>It&#x27;s so sad to see from the sidelines. Why has the left shifted so much to shutting down all debate that isn&#x27;t 100% in agreement with the party line? It&#x27;s not that I disagree with them on the issues, it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s sad that they&#x27;re not seeing how it&#x27;s actively hurting their stated goals.<p>If Sweden is any predictor, then this is going to get much worse (or, if you&#x27;re on the right, it&#x27;ll get much better).<p>Every time someone who said &quot;biological men should not be allowed to compete in sports with biological women&quot; is called Hitler, that&#x27;s one more person lost to your whole argument, and someone who says that Trump is an OK compromise, and who&#x27;ll think &quot;if that&#x27;s your choice argument then you&#x27;re too crazy to be listened to on abortion, too&quot;.<p>tl;dr: If you&#x27;re choosing between &quot;practical&quot; and &quot;effective&quot;, choose &quot;effective&quot;. But also see history for how I think when you say &quot;practical&quot;, you actually mean &quot;low effort&quot;.')
