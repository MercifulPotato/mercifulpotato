That&#x27;s not the narrative I hear pretty much everywhere, I simply hear it rebranded to: growing the economy, improving life, creating jobs, etc. It all depends on the argument and who wants what.<p>Ultimately, capitalism drives greedy behaviors in <i>everyone</i> either by choice or by necessity. At some point if you donâ€™t adopt similar behaviors to the greedy, you will be taken advantage of, guaranteed. One of the flaws of this system is that competition is what props it up and gives it stability, so <i>everyone</i> has to play the optimization game as much as the most optimal are optimizing, otherwise they&#x27;re &#x27;losing&#x27; in our economic system, relatively speaking.<p>So yes, it&#x27;s the same optimization like behaviors Google and other giant businesses in the capital ownership class are utilizing. Are the motives different (greed, survival, sense of &#x27;fair&#x27; compensation)? Maybe, maybe not, but if you don&#x27;t play the game it doesn&#x27;t matter because you&#x27;re being taken advantage of and the state will only decline.<p>I for one applaud Google employees pushing this and hope they can set a precedent for the entire industry. There is widespread rampant abuse in tech no one talks about or just ingore and it&#x27;s often waved away because <i>&#x27;...but money&#x27;</i> and employment mobility. None of these fix the underlying problems and are often merely excuses made to allow abuse to grow and fester.')
