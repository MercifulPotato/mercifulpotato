I would argue that whilst that is a commonly held belief, and certainly true for some tests of business logic, the main value and reason for testing is to allow developers to confidently make changes to existing code. In my experience user acceptance testing is a more useful tool for detecting user facing defects as it also tests the developers assumptions about functionality.')
