The difficulty of enforcing millions of contracts at the same time are nothing but a market way to tax your profits.\nThe less you sell, the easier it will be to pinpoint the culprit and sue him.\nAs a creator you&#x27;re in your right to sue whoever breached your contract with them and redistributed &#x2F; copied your work &#x2F; didn&#x27;t respect your conditions, but is it going to be cost efficient (especially if you consider the marketing side of piracy)?\nSomeone pirating your content without entering into a contract with you is not breaching any contract and, despite being highly immoral, is not doing anything wrong. The original copy must have been sourced from somewhere though, so I would consider it fair to put the entire cost to whoever breached the contract first.<p>If as a society we create regulations that allow big corporations and their friends in the government to infringe on people&#x27;s freedom, we&#x27;re not only losing our freedom but also increasing inequality.')
