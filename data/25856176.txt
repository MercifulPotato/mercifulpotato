Or for that matter, work out how to sidestep the distance argument though some other exotic method that we&#x27;re yet to discover (i.e. wormholes or some such).<p>I&#x27;m not exactly a proponent for little green men visiting us, but I do think that arguing about distance or physical limits of speed&#x2F;travel based on our current frame of reference is an incorrect position to take.')
