Borders are more porous than people think<p>Obviously, but those are things that can be managed.<p>&gt; The mental cost of lockdown is also higher than people originally thought.<p>Maybe the mental cost of a shambolic pandemic response is also pretty high, too?<p>&gt; &quot;Listen to the experts&quot; really meant &quot;listen to epidemiologists,&quot; but this is their first time trying this at this scale, and it ignores psychologists and economists, even though those forces are going to be major drivers of behavior.<p>The non-outlier epidemiologists are the right experts to trust right now.  If a town is about to be overtaken by the front lines of a war, you don&#x27;t ask the economists about the economic cost of closing main street or the psychologists about the emotional costs of forcing people from their homes.  You listen to the people who understand war and evacuate the civilian population.  You don&#x27;t tell people to stay put and keep their shops open while the shells fly because some economist&#x27;s model predicted unemployment and reduced growth if they leave.')
