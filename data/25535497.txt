That means the UK can&#x27;t single out German cheeses if they have the same quality as other cheeses - but that still only means that any issues importing cheeses are created, on purpose, by the UK regulators. Because they explicitly want to control foreign cheeses on their market.<p>Thread ancestor was pointing out he likes having a big market to sell in to. I sympathise. And I really like the sound of the no-tariff low regulation UK cheese market, I&#x27;d vote for that if I were in the UK. But, and this is the focus for me in context of the article, these restriction are fully in the control of the UK and have very little to do with the success and failure of an EU-UK deal. It is simply a basic and well established observation that regulation makes it harder to run a business.')
