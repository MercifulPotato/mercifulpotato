You&#x27;d loose stemming, but gain language support and indexed regular expression search which is a nice power user feature.<p>Looking at your where clause, did you index language and textsearchable_index_col together ? If not, you are giving the planner the opportunity to skip your full text index.<p>if you order by ts_rank_cd then the query will sort all rows, including those that don&#x27;t match. A better pattern is to take the ranking score as a column and then sort it in a subquery. [1] from stack overlfow has an example.  (As an aside, from pg2, CTEs are no longer an optimization fence, so you can write the query out more cleanly with a CTE and still get the desired performance).<p>You should experiment with GIN vs GIST indices. GIN are larger, so on a large dataset the index might not fit in memory. You could pay more to have more memory, but worth trying a GIST index to see if that makes things faster just because it fits in memory.<p>A final frontend comment, I&#x27;m a fan of infinite scroll for this kind of stuff. You already have pagination effectively set up, you could spoil me as a user with infinite scroll. react-virtualized[2] is a great library for that.<p>Hope that helps.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;9.6&#x2F;pgtrgm.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.postgresql.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;9.6&#x2F;pgtrgm.html</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dba.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;4054&#x2F;ts-rank-massively-slows-my-query-how-can-i-improve-performance" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dba.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;4054&#x2F;ts-rank-massive...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bvaughn&#x2F;react-virtualized" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bvaughn&#x2F;react-virtualized</a>')
