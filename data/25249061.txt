Because, frankly, most aspects of B5 pretty objectively haven&#x27;t aged well (the elevator scene is one exception), and the FX renders are especially bad, at least from the DVD box set.<p>I fully believe it looked incredible at the time on a standard def CRT. But TNG still looks OK and DS9 looks good.')
