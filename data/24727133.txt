Unwanted<p>This is a subjective standard which means nothing. For example browser access to the Camera may be unwanted by many, but at the same time has enabled a whole range of video-chat, barcode-scanning, and translation Web apps.<p>If the definition of &quot;better&quot; is only &quot;I like Everything&quot; then clearly nothing qualifies.<p>There have been lots and lots of great new features added to browser engines (html, css, js) over the past 10 years.
