It&#x27;s great.<p>The charts are self-contained in a blob of JSON, so you can ship them around easily.<p>It supports both Canvas and SVG rendering, which is great if you need to export to a .png since Canvas is better suited to this. SVG is good for crystal clear vector graphics though. So we use SVG mode on the mobile app, and Canvas mode on the back-end.<p>We tried numerous other JS charting libraries (c3, chartist, chart.js, frappe, and a couple others I forget) but none of these were as professionally and comprehensively put together as Vega-Lite in our experience.<p>I am starting to view Vega-Lite as &quot;the SQLite&quot; of the charting world - I hope this view holds for the long-term.')
