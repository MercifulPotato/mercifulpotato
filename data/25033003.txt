Windows does not have accessible installation as far as I know, but it also has some basic screen reader on activation. Don&#x27;t take my word for Windows though because usually I try to put a better screen reader as fast as possible.\nI can&#x27;t say for Macs or Linux, though I&#x27;ve heard that now some distros also come with a screen reader and it could be switched on at some moment.')
