Have programming  courses &amp; curriculums changed so much in the past ~20 years that this isn&#x27;t simply part of every introduction to the subject?<p>Yes, the topic of code performance as a whole is more complex than just Big O, but as its own concept it was, in my time (get off my lawn!) pretty effective covered everywhere, and certainly the moment &quot;algorithms&quot; we discussed in any learning material.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just that it goes back to the common topic here on HN that there&#x27;s a lot more inefficient code nowadays because faster processors &amp; more memory helps to paper over the cracks. But if something like Big O isn&#x27;t taught as one of the most primitive bits of knowledge in programming then I can&#x27;t completely that trend either.')
