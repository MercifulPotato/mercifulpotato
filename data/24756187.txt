Soldiers are trained to deal with situations where lethal force and high power weaponry are assumed standard.<p>Police, if they are really to protect and serve, and act as part of the community should be dealing with an entirely different set of tools and skills. A solider and a police officer should be completely different roles. The former should be an expert in using state sanctioned violence to deal with high level threats to public safety and the latter should be a member of the community with the ability to resolve local conflicts and enforce standards agreed upon by that community.<p>You can&#x27;t reasonably mix these two responsibilities and expect good results.')
