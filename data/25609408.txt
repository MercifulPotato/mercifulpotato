It&#x27;s all I can fit on my bike. I&#x27;m not sure what the state of the art is -- the podcast mentions testing 50mm and wider tires, and running less than half the pressure of what people used to use. They&#x27;re talking about, basically, the widest possible tire you can fit, and the lowest pressure you can go (including going tubeless) without the tire coming off the rim in corners or cracking a wheel in an impact.<p>It&#x27;s truly a remarkable change in strategy and thinking. As you go wider it&#x27;s unquestionable that the weight and aerodynamic properties get worse, which means for wider tires to be more efficient, the rolling resistance decrease has to be huge to overcome the aero loss.')
