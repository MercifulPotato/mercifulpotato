Item(by='DennisP', descendants=None, kids=[25387178], score=None, time=1607701619, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25384673, text='The only way no background check is required is if you buy from an individual, not a dealer.<p>The threshold to be considered a dealer is fairly low. If it&#x27;s someone with a table, they&#x27;re going to be a dealer. It&#x27;s just that if an individual sells their personal firearm, they&#x27;re not required to do a background check, and at gun shows you&#x27;ll see a few people walking around with a rifle slung over their shoulder and a sign saying they&#x27;re selling it.<p>But that&#x27;s semi-auto only (one bullet per trigger pull). Fully automatic weapons have stringent federal requirements.')
