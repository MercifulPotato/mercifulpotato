My favorite minecraft mod is gregtech.  It adds the most complexity of any mod I know of, but it’s balanced in a rewarding way.  Higher tier setups need more factory to produce, but also produce squared gains (each power tier goes up by a factor of 4).  The endgame is fusion for both power and alchemy.  It’s great stuff, but eventually one has seen it all.<p>If you really want to see an offender of complexity for complexity’s sake: check out gregtech new horizons.  They maintain a minecraft modpack based around needing gregtech recipes for all other mods.  On paper that’s great.  Hell, even I made a pack like that for personal play.  They go pretty far with it though, to the point that the maintainers seem to have an expectation of grinding endlessly and never reaching the highest tiers.  An outsider might dismiss it as chasing a dragon.')
