I have a decent grasp of how complicated biological systems are. I don&#x27;t even begin to profess to have adequate understanding. I am not a domain expert.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t see how imagining an engineering solution where measurements are taken of a brain&#x27;s &quot;state&quot; and replicated with an algorithm are metaphysical psuedoscience. It&#x27;s out of the reach of today&#x27;s tech for sure, but I&#x27;d like to think we&#x27;ll eventually make progress and one day be interested in solving this problem. Evolution stumbled upon human brains as a solution for propagation. We&#x27;re all a lot smarter as hill climbing agents than our genes.<p>I do not think we&#x27;ll solve this in our lifetimes, but it&#x27;s so much better to think of than optimizing ad tech, election fraud, and structural inequality.<p>&gt; philosophically rigorous work<p>You lost me here. I don&#x27;t think something has to be philosophically grounded to be identified as a problem space and tackled. Epistemology ontology whatevers don&#x27;t fuel rockets.')
