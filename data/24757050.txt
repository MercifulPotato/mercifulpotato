The ballots are all sealed in postage paid envelopes already and surely the majority are placed in regular mailboxes which are everywhere. So what&#x27;s the point in having special drop boxes at all?<p>I don&#x27;t see a security argument since centralizing the collection of ballots would seem to me to make it easier, not harder, to attack. Fake boxes are one attack discussed in the article, but even straightforward stealing of ballots from boxes would be much easier when you only have to attack one collection box containing thousands of ballots instead of thousands of individual mailboxes distributed all over.')
