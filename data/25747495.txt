It is not even particularly good in the niches it once served\nin either, such as in the embedded realm and memory constrained systems.\nLearning the language, and more importantly implementing my own Forth, has made\nme a better programmer, but I do not think I would ever use it professionally.<p>It is quite a poor language for modern software development.\nThe advantages of Forth are nearly never useful to a modern application, mobile or\nweb developer. The advantages are; works well on a memory constrained system\n(think kilobytes not megabytes), it is good for writing assemblers and cross\ncompilers for Forth (I think we can agree that most developers are not going\nto be porting a programming language to a new architecture in order to write\na CRUD application), and poking hardware and hardware registers interactively\nwhich goes without saying - the vast majority of programmers will never do,\nonly embedded and kernel developers on any regular basis.<p>Instead it has many disadvantages like poor string handling, global state\nbeing the default and not the exception, poor support for structures (I\nknow you can make your own but that does not make them good), and even worse\nmemory safety than C. That is just that language itself, the ecosystem around\nit is just as bad, there are few libraries for generic functions, and it is\nmost likely that they will require some kind of porting to the Forth you are\nusing, there is a saying within the Forth community - &quot;If you have seen one\nForth, you have seen one Forth&quot;, they are different in quite fundamental ways.<p>It just does not solve modern problems but ones that were relevant in the \n1980s on microcomputers.<p>The reason I like Forth is because I like reinventing the wheel, understanding\nhow systems are implemented, and puzzles. I do not like Forth because it is\ngood at getting things done.')
