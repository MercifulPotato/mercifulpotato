I&#x27;m not aware of any estimates that attribute almost 100% of US deaths to our poor public health response. That would imply that there was a realistic scenario in which we&#x27;d have roughly zero deaths. Though there are countries that managed this, I&#x27;ve yet to see any evidence that this is _entirely_ attributable to public health levers (and there are a few characteristics in common among many of them: many are small islands, many had been hit badly by pandemics in the past, almost all are East Asian, and IIRC none of them are large federal systems, a massive exogenous variable when it comes to governance).<p>Or perhaps you&#x27;re you&#x27;re interpreting the parent comment overliterally? I understood it to mean that Coronavirus restrictions are safety theater, not that the virus itself is a fantasy.')
