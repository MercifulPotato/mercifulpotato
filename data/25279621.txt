The detection of overlapping objects happens at the raster level (Z-Buffer). The shading happens at the raster level. The raster is used to for texture derivatives.<p>By contrast, the result of a raytraced image may be a raster image, but the raster doesn&#x27;t have to play a role during image synthesis, all the sampling can be done oblivious of an image raster. You could technically store samples without a raster grid and create images from those samples at various raster resolutions.')
