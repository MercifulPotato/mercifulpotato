This is very effective against an open society like the US.<p>An example is that the CCP has funded US shell organizations to block the banning of Chinese apps in the US, in US courts.<p>Also, WeChat is used as a means for the CCP in mainland China to exercise control over diaspora, so it really needs to be banned outside China. One of the abuses was using WeChat to have American Chinese hoard PPE supplies this spring and mail them to China.<p>So when an open society tries to defend itself, you end up with what appears to be an &quot;ironic&quot; situation, but was actually choreographed by the CCP.')
