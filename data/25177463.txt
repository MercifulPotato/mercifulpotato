The reviewer was able to conclude that the fan was actually doing something, since the benchmark score held steady over those multiple consecutive runs whereas the score of the Air dropped after about ten minutes of sustained load.<p>I’m sure the Pro has the same throttling logic as the Air since they’re identical apart from the fan and case&#x2F;peripherals but it’s going to be very difficult to get it to throttle. I would think you’d need to run a microbenchmark of vector instructions in a very tight loop just to get the fan to spin fast enough to be audible. Under normal use it may never happen unless the fan fails.')
