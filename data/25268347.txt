Some are even more comfortable to use (books with lots of images or diagrams) than ebooks. Sometimes the typography is really something. But they&#x27;re still ink-covered dead trees, they take up lots of space, weigh tens or hundreds of kilograms, are a pain to move between apartments, are an even bigger pain to pack for a vacation.<p>High resolution e-ink displays are just as nice to look at, and ebooks are much easier to self-publish without all the middlemen.<p>It&#x27;s sad to see the bookstore go as an interesting kind of place, but I won&#x27;t miss books at all.')
