I had to go with my sister as backup after her kid came home in tears because a teacher called the child &quot;ugly&quot; and said &quot;I don&#x27;t want to look at your face&quot;.<p>Whether or not they said it we&#x27;ll never know, only going off of what her kid told us and said teacher denying it, but the teacher was fired months later after an investigation launched from other poor behavior on their part-reported to the school by <i>several</i> other parents, so there&#x27;s weight to the kid&#x27;s claims.')
