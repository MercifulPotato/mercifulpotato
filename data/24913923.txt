All you had to do was look at base.js and duplicate the string operations used to produce the updated s, whatever they were.  No need to use Javascript.  yt-dl chose to use Python.  Only a minority of videos used this &quot;technological measure&quot;.  Most videos on YT do not require a continually updated s; the value of s stays the same.<p>2017: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tyrrrz.me&#x2F;blog&#x2F;reverse-engineering-youtube" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tyrrrz.me&#x2F;blog&#x2F;reverse-engineering-youtube</a><p>2015: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bitnol&#x2F;CipherAPI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;bitnol&#x2F;CipherAPI</a><p>2014: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;kl&#x2F;9070523" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;kl&#x2F;9070523</a><p>2014: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.w3hills.com&#x2F;ytcipher" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;api.w3hills.com&#x2F;ytcipher</a><p>Regarding the &quot;bookmark&quot; comment, there is no way to &quot;bookmark&quot; any YT download URL because all YT download URLs (not just ones that have a changing signature) include timestamps; as is typical of download URLs on video sites, they have an expiration.  Generating URLs that expire is not done as a means of copyright-related &quot;access control&quot;; the purpose has to do with caching.')
