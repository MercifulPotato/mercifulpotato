On Mac it is: was-the-last-thing-I-worked-on-another-app-or-another-document-it-was-another-etc<p>This can happen hundreds of times in a day, costs up to a few seconds at a time and more importantly it is insanely annoying when you know how snooth it can be.<p>And to rub it in: Gnome 3 has something similar to Mac but you can disable it if you are a keyboard person like me.<p>KDE is like Windows but can be configured however you like it.<p>&gt; 2. except for some exceptions keyboard shortcuts are pretty unified across all apps on mac os and can even be configured in a single global place<p>Good thing they fixed that since 2012.<p>&gt; 3. from my biased point of view of being a software developer myself: If I see a file chooser modal component that locks all interaction then I see a wrong choice in a UI component that does not fit the usecase. But if I see a rendering glitch of a component in a promotional video, it looks to me as if the whole state space of the component or even of the GUI stack is ill defined.<p>From my perspective: if a file chooser can block all other windows and I know people keep talking about the separation between apps and windows on that particular OS I conclude that they messed up that particular one.<p>When I see rendering glitches on an open source project (I rarely see them, but thats maybe just me) I conclude that they haven&#x27;t had time to fix it yet and probably the graphics drivers they have to build on aren&#x27;t as polished as those on other OSes.<p>But back to my conclusion: I&#x27;m happy all OSes and DEs exist. Some people honestly prefer every one of them for different reasons.<p>I&#x27;m just so tired of people pretending KDE is kind of subpar because it doesn&#x27;t excel in all areas at once.')
