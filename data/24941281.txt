Someone convinced some politician with a bag of money to keep a legally mandated monopoly on mapping, locking out foreign competitors.<p>PS: Japan does similar things, where for example Google Maps refuses to &quot;download&quot; maps of Japan because by law they are not allowed to make their own maps of Japan and must license the data from a local provider. That local provider does not allow offline use.<p>The world of mapping is nuts.')
