I guess I would call myself a front-end developer though I have never had a front-end job. I am able to find work here and there as a freelancer and I have worked one tech job in QA in my 20s. I am now in my 30s. I make the majority of my money flipping stuff and working in service industry jobs and occasionally find work as a designer, developer, photographer, videographer, video editor, and much more....I know how to do a lot of things, but finding a job isn&#x27;t one of them.<p>This has developed a lack of trust in humanity for me and a great mental illness.
