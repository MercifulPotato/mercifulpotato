Works without assigned ownership cannot practically be re-licensed, as you&#x27;d have to get individual consent from all owning parties.<p>Yeah I understand this. Hence there _is_ a difference and maybe one I don&#x27;t prefer. I understand why Google would want this, but maybe I view Google&#x27;s inability to relicense my code as a feature and not a bug.<p>In any case, I think the people involved in this back and forth essentially understand the state of things. I only seems some of us disagree on whether we should care. If people want to sign CLA&#x27;s with Google that&#x27;s their prerogative. If they understand what they&#x27;re doing, more power to them. I don&#x27;t like that Google has special preference over other actors, but that&#x27;s just me.<p>edit:<p>&gt; This came up a lot when GPLv3 was introduced â€” many projects wanted to migrate from GPLv2 to GPLv3, but couldn&#x27;t, because they never acquired legal ownership of contributed code, and so didn&#x27;t have the right to re-license the contributors&#x27; code.<p>Sure there are a lot of people who didn&#x27;t like that, but maybe those who contributed their code under the GPLv2 never would have done so if they knew it would change to GPLv3 (not that he&#x27;s more important than others, but Torvalds seems to fall in this camp)? Their wishes should be respected. Besides in those specific cases the projects could have avoided it by only accepting code licensed as &quot;GPLv2 or later&quot; so a CLA wasn&#x27;t really required in that case anyway (though obviously that only applies to this specific GPLv2 -&gt; GPLv3 case and not more generally).')
