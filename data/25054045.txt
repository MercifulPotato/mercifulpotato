I took your moderating personally when I first joined here, got banned for some comments I didn&#x27;t think were that bad, hell i&#x27;ve made worse since, spent a while posting greyed out comments going off at dang, posted some not so shitty comments that got given a chance, realized I should try harder in my comments and just push my way back in by writing things that contribute better to HN.<p>It would have been easy to start a new account, but I liked warring with dang at the time. I even emailed him a bunch appealing my, what I still believe is not really all that bad of a comment, but I accept why it got me in shit as a newer commenter. It spurred me to just try harder at contributing better.<p>Eventually, I was just randomly unbanned.\nSince then, i&#x27;ve come appreciate HN&#x27;s moderation style.<p>There&#x27;s really not many places on the internet with such lax account rules, yet mostly good conversation.<p>I appreciate the surprisingly wide range of topics and viewpoints generally allowed here. It does get a bit echo chambery, but mostly, any issue tends to get both sides heard as long as comments are written constructively.<p>Also, just learning about the purpose of this site helped. This is a news website, first and foremost, for people interested in funding from YC. It may have expanded since then, but the moderation does reflect the intended purpose of this site and just generally the kind of discourse expected from people interested in YC funding or other such things.')
