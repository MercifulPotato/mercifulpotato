Professional displays are indeed usually dumb TVs and are made to witstand 24&#x2F;7 operation and may have higher lumen, etc. They do come at 4k. They also usually come with better management software and more ports. They can be connected to the internet for some remote management but I’ve never used that.<p>There’s of course a price difference between you $300 cheapo consumer stuff, and a $1000-2000 pro display.<p>I used to have these pro displays at home with Chromecast, works fine.')
