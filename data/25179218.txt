The number of people buying because bitcoin represents freedom is <i>significantly</i> lower than the number of people buying simply because they&#x27;re speculating that the price will go up some more. If those people decide to cash out their gains the price will go down again. There&#x27;s nothing inherently more free about bitcoin at $18000 than there is at $12000. The value is not linked to the politics.')
