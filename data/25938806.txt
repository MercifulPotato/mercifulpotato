I.e. how do you account for installations through Linux distro repos etc (which will likely cease to be an option for most) when describing this? Only counting <i>your</i> downloads is an extremely disingenuous measure of use of open-source software.<p>And for open-source users things definitively do not &quot;remain as they are&quot;, given even your blog post admits it&#x27;s not an open-source license.<p>But well, not particularly surprising you don&#x27;t consider such users as &quot;your users&quot;. Disappointing, but not surprising. Good reminder to check the CLAs required by any project I consider using.')
