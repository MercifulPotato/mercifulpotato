Currently the peer to peer stuff is mostly manual, as there&#x27;s no way to discover peers (yet). So you would have to add other local machines yourself in the browser settings.<p>Security wise there&#x27;s currently a lot of things that are changing, such as the upcoming DNS tunnel protocol that can use dedicated other peers that are connected to the clearnet already by encapsulating e.g. https inside dns via fake TXT queries etc.<p>&gt; public dns could be considered private<p>Totally agree here, I tried to find as many DoT and DoH dns servers as possible, and the list was actually longer before.<p>In 2019 a lot of dns providers went either broke or went commercial (like nextdns which now requires a unique id per user, which defeats the purpose of it completely)... But maybe someone knows a good DoH&#x2F;DoT directory that&#x27;s better than the curl wiki on github?')
