The Republicans now also have two members of Congress who believe that Democrats participate in ritual sacrifice of children to drink their blood so maybe we shouldn&#x27;t focus on the extreme minority opinions of these parties.  Voter fraud is a rallying cry of a large percentage of the Republican party.  Votes being changed in 2016 or any other election is not a major rallying cry of a large percentage of the Democratic party.')
