Until VR output data at that rate to every human sense being in VR will be less stimulating than being in real space.  I think this is especially true of social environments, were subtle body language, facial movements, touch and smell are critically important.<p>Being around a group of people is easily 20x more stimulating to me than any VR experience I’ve had, and I’ve experience the state of the art in VR.  Spending day after day, year after year, going to classes with the same group of peers was very socially validating and helped me be more engaged with my time at school.')
