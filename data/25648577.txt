It is a very popular issue, and I’m sure they would gain a lot of political capital by moving this through, as many people support this. However they need to do this carefully.<p>There are some health questions unanswered. And some research is needed before they do this. Sleep is important and sleep deprivation is a thing that affects some portion of the working class, and some portion of school children. Before they take this step, they should know the effect this would have on the sleep behavior of this population. If moving to a permanent DST would further disrupt the sleep cycle of this population, the result could be dangerous.<p>I really hope that the ruling class consults public health experts, and asks for research and goes with their recommendation which is based on that research rather then simply going by what people think they want. Sleep is to important to be messed with and disrupted because of a rushed—but popular—decision.')
