The more &quot;academically&quot; minded students who obsess over getting the grammar correct like a math equation are still struggling to form even basic sentences outside of solving homework problems on a piece of paper. I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;ve been making much better progress now that I&#x27;ve been focusing on just trying to express myself even if I&#x27;m making mistakes.<p>Which is obviously the complete opposite of using a programming language.')
