For dependent users --- which I think is most users? --- a big part of the &quot;benefit&quot; of caffeine is just the cessation of withdrawal symptoms. It also has a relatively long blood half life and messes with your sleep.<p>For me, 95% of the trick was just finding a good decaf. You can drink <i>lots</i> of decaf (it&#x27;s got ~5% of the caffeine of a normal cup) as a taper.<p>I have no discipline of, like, any sort whatsoever, and I don&#x27;t even remember what quitting was like. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s very difficult for lots of people, but just to chime in for the idea that it might not, for you, be nearly as bad as it is for some other people, and if you&#x27;re interesting in ceasing caffeine, you should just give it a shot.<p>† Not <i>health! My alcohol and nicotine affinities will attest to how little health has to do with any of this! I literally just mean life is more pleasant without the caffeine.</i>')
