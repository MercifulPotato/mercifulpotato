At this point Mozilla (corp) stopped actively investing in Thunderbird.<p>- In 2015, Mitchel Baker made it clear that the Mozilla (corp) wanted to get rid of Thunderbird [2]. At this point the Mozilla corp started shutting down support services for the Thunderbird project.<p>- In 2017 Thunderbird was legally moved to the Mozilla Foundation (instead of the corporation) and started surviving mostly on its own, with some minor help from the Mozilla Foundation [3]. Here Mozilla (corp), the company responsible for Firefox, already got rid of Thunderbird entirely.<p>- In 2020, it became clear that Thunderbird can survive entirely on its own donations and could even try to provide commercial services. Thus, the Mozilla Foundation created a new &quot;MZLA Technologies Corporation&quot; that is now the legal entity responsible of Thunderbird [4]. MZLA Tech is not responsible for any other product that I know of.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.lizardwrangler.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;07&#x2F;06&#x2F;thunderbird-stability-and-community-innovation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.lizardwrangler.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;07&#x2F;06&#x2F;thunderbird-stabi...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.google.com&#x2F;g&#x2F;mozilla.governance&#x2F;c&#x2F;kAyVlhfEcXg&#x2F;m&#x2F;Eqyx1X62BQAJ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;groups.google.com&#x2F;g&#x2F;mozilla.governance&#x2F;c&#x2F;kAyVlhfEcXg...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.thunderbird.net&#x2F;2017&#x2F;05&#x2F;thunderbirds-future-home&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.thunderbird.net&#x2F;2017&#x2F;05&#x2F;thunderbirds-future-hom...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.thunderbird.net&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;thunderbirds-new-home&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.thunderbird.net&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;thunderbirds-new-home&#x2F;</a>')
