Whether the market is phones, tablets, smartwatches or personal computers, Apple&#x27;s market share comes nowhere near close to being a monopoly.<p>Exactly, which is why <i>it&#x27;s in no way clear that &quot;Apple&#x27;s market share comes nowhere near close to being a monopoly.&quot;</i>  If you defined Standard Oil&#x27;s market as &quot;fuels,&quot; it wasn&#x27;t a monopoly because it was competing against coal and wood.  If you defined AT&amp;T&#x27;s market as &quot;communication services,&quot; it wasn&#x27;t a monopoly because it was competing against TV, Radio, and the Post Office.  And if you defined Apple&#x27;s market as &quot;3rd party software distribution, in general,&quot; you&#x27;d get the same result, but maybe not if its market is &quot;3rd party software distribution for ~45% of all American phone users.&quot;<p>Since the advent of antitrust law, every monopolist has a definition of its market that magically makes it not a monopoly and obscures its anticompetitive behavior; but that&#x27;s not the definition we should use to judge them.')
