I tried a few but none seems to work well with music files Google Drive. I would prefer if they maintain some cache as well. If I can&#x27;t find one, I might just write one over the weekend. Let Google Drive do the storage, and I will create the bare minimal player which can play music files. That setup will last for eternity.')
