I looked up the last military operation they were in and couldn’t find anything relevant. Looks like they do extraordinary light peacekeeping and such. (Yes, yes, they’re “neutral”. Suppose I assumed they were still deploying with western bloc powers at least for some sort of combat experience training.)<p>Seems like the military is more for show than anything else at this point. I can’t imagine a populace living some of the most privileged European&#x2F;western lives possible would have the stomach for its populace taking heavy casualties in any form of conflict.<p>The terrain is seemingly still their best advantage, but with modern air power this feels more like some sort of historical LARP the Swiss are proud of more than a force that would really achieve anything.')
