WTF, this is a game I bought in Australia.<p>There were pages and pages of other legalese but those are the parts that I remember.<p>I was so angry after reading it that I haven&#x27;t accepted it or been able to play the game (that I paid for) since.<p>What kind of bullshit is that? Changing the terms of something that I purchased six months earlier?<p>I wonder what would happen if I take it back to the store and ask for a refund because I can&#x27;t accept the TOS.')
