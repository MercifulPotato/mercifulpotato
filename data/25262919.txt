It&#x27;s clearer to me after reading this article.<p>I wonder how much the gain in performance of e.g. Apple&#x27;s M1 chip, compared to an x86 CPU, can be attributed to this weaker constraint. Given that the M1 can outperform an x86 CPU even when emulating x86 code, perhaps it&#x27;s not much.<p>Also, I suspect programming languages that are immutable by default will gain a larger advantage using ARM&#x27;s weaker memory model, as the compiler can more often safely let the CPU perform reordering (due to not having to wait for a mutable variable being updated until it can execute a subsequent line of code which depends on this updated variable).')
