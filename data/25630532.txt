It causes severe psychological distress. That&#x27;s what a prison is. The differences are in the nuance, and you might call those subjective.<p>This was an extradition hearing, not a trial. This seems to have given the judge room to justify a nuanced conclusion that doesn&#x27;t extend far past this case. IDK if there&#x27;s much precedent. If there is, it relates to espionage-adjacent cases. That kind of makes sense. Espionage is different to other crimes. The imprisonment is different, and so is the standard for justice. Closed trials &amp; such. This was also true of these extradition hearings.<p>I have to wonder though, did all the other stuff relating to this saga affect her decision. The odd charges in Sweden. The party-politic aspects to the US&#x27; pursuit of him. Also the &quot;time served&quot; aspect. If he&#x27;s found guilty, the sentence is unlikely to be longer than the 8 years he has spent imprisoned already.')
