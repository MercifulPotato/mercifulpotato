It&#x27;s fair to say he orchestrates feelings, it&#x27;s semi-fair to object that he&#x27;s not outlining a detailed plan for how to fix and run everything (to which I would reply that&#x27;s not his job), but I don&#x27;t like seeing his work written off as meaningless. It seems to be to be journalism of a very high level, in that he outlines things clearly and understandably that are newsworthy and that matter.<p>I guess the take-away there is that news is not enough. You can document the human condition all you like, and then if we do nothing to evolve it away from its darkest aspects it&#x27;s just depressing. Knowing that I still like that he&#x27;s doing that reporting, the way he&#x27;s doing it. He&#x27;s making abstractions concrete for people.')
