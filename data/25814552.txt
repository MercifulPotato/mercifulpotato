Before that, I was a Slackware user, since 1997. Long may Linux continue its march for many more years.<p>I&#x27;ve gone from Pentium Pro, SparcStations, various incarnations of Intel processors, UltraSparc, Pentium 4 64 bit, ending up with Threadripper. With all this my data has migrated with me all through these architectures. Still amazes me how well all that has gone.<p>Looking forward to transitioning to ARM or RISC-V workstations some day.')
