They typically require high-level preparation (several years of pure math courses as prerequisites) and are taught in an extremely abstract way, often are deferred to grad school, and are seldom if ever taught to non-math-major undergraduates.<p>But geometric algebra, a.k.a. real Clifford algebra (“geometric algebra” was Clifford’s own name for it), can easily be taught to high school students in a very simple concrete way, and then used throughout science&#x2F;engineering&#x2F;computing courses aimed at non-math-majors. It can unify and simplify the wide variety of other mathematical formalisms that are used throughout undergraduate technical curricula. It is straight-forward to implement in a computer, and it makes calculations much easier to write down.')
