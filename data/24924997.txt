When anything takes more than 50ms to react, it becomes mentally jarring to the user. Whether it is typing in an SSH session, clicking a menu with a mouse, auto-completing a box, etc - all these things generate a completely different human response and relationship with the application if they get below that threshold of latency. In my experience, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get non-SPAs across that threshold for large sections of their functionality, while for SPAs it becomes more or less the default. So people can make all the technical arguments they want, but to me the human factor of that subjective feeling trumps it all.')
