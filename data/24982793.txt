Item(by='awb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604430255, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24979566, text='Models are backtested against the historical record where hundreds or thousands of elections (federal, state and local) can be used as training data.<p>For example, a weighted average of polls has Biden up ~5% in PA. In state-wide elections, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if candidates with that sized lead in PA (and states with similar size and socioeconomic demographics) end up winning about 85% of the time, which is what the 538 model has Biden&#x27;s chances at in PA. That 15% uncertainty accounts for the bias you describe. If polling was perfect and there was no bias, a ~5% polling lead (and exceeding the margin of error) would be a 100% guaranteed victory.<p>It would be great to see Taleb&#x27;s forecast of federal and state elections so he has &quot;skin in the game&quot; as he likes to say. Assume you get points based on your % confidence, so if you predict there&#x27;s a 55% chance of a particular outcome and you&#x27;re right you get 55pts, and if you&#x27;re wrong you lose 55pts. If Taleb pegs every race at 50&#x2F;50 or 55&#x2F;45 because you &quot;can&#x27;t predict elections&quot;, I doubt his score will be higher than Silver&#x27;s. You&#x27;ll end up with silly predictions like 40% chance of Trump winning Washington DC or 30% chance of Biden winning Wyoming, when in reality each have less than 1% chance of doing so.<p>When you make reasonable, weighted predictions based on state polling, you see that Biden has leads outside the margin of error in states totaling 270 EV. So, the 10% chance Silver gives Trump is saying, hey there&#x27;s a chance that the polls could be extremely biased in all 7 swing states in Trump&#x27;s favor. But, if Trump loses even 1 of those swing states, there are so many safe D electoral votes that Biden will win.')
