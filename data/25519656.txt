Item(by='DanBC', descendants=None, kids=[25520089, 25519953, 25520020, 25519852], score=None, time=1608743260, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25519276, text='1) Someone says &quot;look at this idiot&quot; and sends me a link to a video. I watch it, and reply to the person &quot;yep, the person in the video is an idiot&quot;. The video website has no option for me to say &quot;don&#x27;t show me any more of this kind of stuff&quot;.<p>2) COPPA means youtube doesn&#x27;t allow under 13s to have an account. But those children want to use the like and subscribe and notification bell. This means that youtube gets all of my viewing and all of my child&#x27;s view, but can&#x27;t tell the difference.<p>3) There&#x27;s no way to tell youtube what I like. I watch tiny channels doing original songs and covers. Youtube thinks that&#x27;s music, and so pushes general chart shit at me. Or it thinks it&#x27;s some genre of music and pushes huge channels that are roughly that genre at me. I have no way of telling YT that it&#x27;s the small channels with fewer than 1000 &#x2F; 10000 subs that I want to see.')
