Item(by='worker767424', descendants=None, kids=[25392819], score=None, time=1607724775, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25391812, text='&gt; The average American earns $900 per week and is probably not dropping that kind of money on a hotel.<p>The average American making $900 per week doesn&#x27;t normally go places that charge $50 a night for parking. Apparently parking at the Omaha Hilton is $15 per night.<p>If I&#x27;m price-conscious, all else being equal, I&#x27;d still prefer a Super 8 to an Airbnb because it might not be nice, but it won&#x27;t be bad, and the variance between room and service quality across all their properties is pretty small, so I won&#x27;t be surprised by anything. That, and if you&#x27;re price-conscious, a bad Airbnb experience is expensive to fix; you just finished traveling, you want your room now, 3 hours and 4 phone calls later. Don&#x27;t book an Airbnb unless you have a backup hotel to go to.')
