Induction isn&#x27;t a testable hypothesis; it&#x27;s a strategy we have no choice but to adopt if we want to plan for the future at all. So there is no &quot;problem&quot; of induction at all: it&#x27;s just something we&#x27;re stuck with.<p>Proposed solutions to the black hole information loss problem <i>can</i> be tested against experimental data; we just don&#x27;t have the technical capability to acquire such data yet. That doesn&#x27;t change the fact that until proposed solutions are tested against experimental data, and some proposed solution passes the test, the black hole information loss problem is not solved.')
