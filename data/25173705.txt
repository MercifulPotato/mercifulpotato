Item(by='kmill', descendants=None, kids=[25173911], score=None, time=1606003810, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25173564, text='Ergonomics to me means &quot;what is the moment-to-moment experience of a user of the language, in particular frictions between what the user wants to say and how it must be said.&quot;  For someone who does not care much about constructibility, it is better not having to do anything differently depending on whether or not something is constructive.  The workaround for such people could be to always include at least one negation for every statement, but that&#x27;s a pervasive reminder of questions of constructibility!  If practitioners are going to be using this transformation by default, then the language would be more ergonomic if it was just automatic.<p>I don&#x27;t think having to think about constructibility all the time is more ergonomic than accepting that the system has a well-accepted axiom.  There doesn&#x27;t need to be a one-true system, of course, and for people interested in foundations, reverse mathematics, constructive mathematics, higher category theory, and homotopy type theory, there are other systems.  Most mathematicians don&#x27;t study these things, and accepting LEM is natural for them.')
