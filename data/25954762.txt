I&#x27;m glad you found it useful.<p>As you go through this exercise I&#x27;m sure you will gain new insights into the process and the API itself. Please document them for the benefit of others around you. The way I see it, you are anyway putting all the effort to learn the system, you might as well put in a little bit more effort to document and get your peer&#x27;s appreciation in return. Also, you will have something concrete to show for all the time and effort you put in over 2-3 weeks, as opposed to just saying &quot;Right I&#x27;m now ready to maintain&#x2F;change this API&quot;.<p>Written communication and specifically documentation is a very under-appreciated skill among software engineers. But it&#x27;s a great way to make yourself visible among your peers and spread the knowledge of the system.<p>The software you write will have impact on customers, but they are far removed from you. The documentation you write on the other hand is beneficial to your peers with whom you work and interact every day so this is a good way to be in their good books. They will appreciate and respect you for going the extra distance to spread the knowledge.<p>Good luck!')
