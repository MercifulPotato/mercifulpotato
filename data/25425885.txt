All that overhead and complexity for what?<p>What complexity? I&#x27;ve been hacking a small Node app in my dev environment for the past few weeks. Decided to stand it up in prod. It took me literally 10 minutes to setup the Dockerfile, build the image and deploy it to the server.<p>Later this week, I&#x27;ll probably throw it onto a GKE cluster. It will take maybe 15 minutes to write and test the Kubernetes YAML. (It will also save 50%+ on the hosting costs, since self-healing means I&#x27;ll be able to put it on GCE preemptible nodes.)')
