All of them are showing some viability and could become very successful if properly funded&#x2F;staffed. I&#x27;ve also identified some new opportunities that I&#x27;m keen to explore, particularly relating to health and personal growth, after my own journey to overcome burnout. And, I still haven&#x27;t fully scratched the itch of the original travel startup.<p>I&#x27;m uncomfortable with the idea of committing exclusively to any one of these concepts, as several of them are compelling, both as commercial opportunities and the potential to havre a positive impact for the people they serve. I&#x27;m also now a father and mortgager, so I&#x27;m not in a position to bet everything on a single idea the way I was 5+ years ago.<p>Whilst the industries&#x2F;markets I listed might seem very disparate, I&#x27;m confident there are common aspects of the way these companies could be built and run, that could mean it could be beneficial to build several of them out of the one studio.<p>I&#x27;ve been turning the idea over in my head for a while, with part of me feeling like it makes sense and could work really well, but the other part of me thinking &quot;nobody has made this work before, everyone will say you&#x27;re unfocused and noncommittal...&quot;<p>So, it&#x27;s just nice to see others thinking along similar lines.<p>If anyone can point to any examples of this kind of thing working really well, I&#x27;d love you to share them.')
