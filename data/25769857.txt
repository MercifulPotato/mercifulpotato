I&#x27;ve been down to the wire with bug fixes and had to balance the remaining bugs vs potentially missing our ship dates that would mean breaking contracts with major retailers and other partners.<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is a technical marvel and on high end hardware the loading times are stunning - something I aim to push for with future titles I work on. With so much data being loaded and unloaded, bandwidth limited hardware was always going to struggle, and generational leaps in hardware are always hard to navigate even if you aren&#x27;t on the bleeding edge.<p>I&#x27;ve been having a lot of fun with the game on PC and I&#x27;ve hit relatively few bugs. I believe a lot of the bugs people are seeing may be streaming perf related. Delayed physics lod loading could cause results like objects being catapulted around as seen in videos.<p>I was also pleasantly surprised to find out one of the more interesting side characters is transgender, and this is communicated very respectfully as you get to know them through their side quests. Some of the marketing material was quite tasteless so I&#x27;m glad to see this inclusion, as some other characters you encounter in the game did not come across well.')
