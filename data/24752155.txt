But I can&#x27;t agree that it&#x27;s inferior unless someone points to a better alternative that achieves similar results.<p>I&#x27;ve written programs that were portable to both GCC and MSVC, using the inline asm syntax of both compilers.  The MSVC version produced slower code, because there was no way to produce the asm I wanted using MSVC.')
