I suggest you to build Linux 5.4 (you can avoid reconfiguring the kernel by using &#x2F;proc&#x2F;config.gz) with the code workaround (adding &#x27;return 0;&#x27; at the beginning of uvd_v6_0_enc_ring_test_ib) applied, and see whether it fixes your problem. You should also check the NULL pointer patch and see whether it&#x27;s already included in the source code by manual inspection, if not, also apply the patch. If it fixes your problems, report it to the Bugzilla thread.<p>Nevertheless, I still recommend you to try reproducing it in Linux 5.9 first and see whether you can reproduce the original problem. The comments in Bugzilla suggests that the latest kernel has already fixed the issue.<p>&gt; <i>Alex Deucher 2020-10-01 14:59:58 UTC</i><p>&gt; <i>The original issue reported in this bug was fixed long ago.</i><p>If Linux 5.9 fixes it, good. If not, see whether the error messages are different. If so, you should chase the new issue instead of the original issue.<p>---<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.kernel.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=204241" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bugzilla.kernel.org&#x2F;show_bug.cgi?id=204241</a>')
