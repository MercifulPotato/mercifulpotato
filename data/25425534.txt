They also spent <i>centuries</i> torturing Africa.<p>12.5 million Africans don&#x27;t end up enslaved and heading to the Americas without the European empires making it happen.<p>The US owes a lot for its part, no question (what I&#x27;m saying is not a reduction in the responsibility of the US, I&#x27;m properly adding the Europeans to it). The Europeans owe that much more, including for the other 12 million slaves in the rest of the Americas (which, again, nobody ever wants to talk about re reparations, not under any circumstances). Every discussion is always about the US paying reparations. The Europeans were primarily responsible, the US didn&#x27;t exist yet and banned the import of slaves as one of its first major actions post formation in January 1808. The US has spent two centuries dealing with the consequences of what the European powers did. We have had to deal with the consequences of their slave trade, while they&#x27;ve skirted it almost entirely.<p>What consequences have the Europeans suffered over the past two centuries, for what they did? Almost nothing. It&#x27;s long past time for the Europeans to pay, big time.<p>It will bankrupt parts of Western Europe. That&#x27;s how big the reparations number very obviously is.')
