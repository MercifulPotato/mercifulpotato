I would venture that most people pushing diversity agenda want representation to match the general population, but that may not be supported the candidate pool.<p>As you point out, it&#x27;s well studied that women don&#x27;t graduate with STEM degrees at a rate that matches the general population.  That means that for every company that matches general population for women in STEM fields, there&#x27;s other companies that literally cannot unless they hire unqualified women from outside the candidate pool.<p>[0] I&#x27;m defining this as the group of all possible people who are qualified to be hired into a role.')
