Companies making many billions of dollars paying no taxes.<p>My intuition is that if I personally came up with a cute &quot;gotcha&quot; like this where I wound up paying zero in taxes because of some loophole, I would go to prison. Why isn&#x27;t the same standard applied to rich companies?<p>&quot;You&#x27;re technically owned by an Irish company you invented to avoid taxes? Cool.  The c-suite plus your accountants are going to prison for the next five years and we&#x27;re seizing the X billion you actually owe plus a punitive fine.&quot;<p>These tax shenanigans would stop if laws were enforced.')
