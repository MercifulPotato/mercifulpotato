Everyone has their own story, but I&#x27;ve heard this one too many times.  Imagine this is over the course of years:<p>- You feel chemically great due to this pill<p>- The pill stops working so well<p>- You find out, despite the scary name, that heroin is basically the same thing as the pill but a whole lot cheaper<p>- You&#x27;re hanging out with the people you&#x27;ve met that do the same drug, and one of them offers to IV for you<p>- You debate it, but end up trying it at home<p>This is, of course, an oversimplification.<p>The opioid crisis was so awful because many people got to step 2 without realizing the path they were going down, and when the doctor&#x2F;dea cut them off, it was easier to go down one step than go back.  There should have been massive support in place.<p>Stay safe everyone, please.')
