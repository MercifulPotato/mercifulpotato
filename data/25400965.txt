As long as we&#x27;re talking about the shell, when will we be able to interact with sourcehut entirely from the command line? Right now I&#x27;m particularly looking at managing build secrets.<p>Being able to use it entirely from the command line is the only thing sourcehut lacks for it to become the best code&#x2F;project&#x2F;build management tool. At least for me anyway[1]; I&#x27;m aware that sourcehut&#x27;s idiosyncrasies are not for everyone.<p>On that note, is anyone aware of any such platform that can be managed entirely from the command line? The one that comes closest is the github CLI, I think, and even that one still requires a browser flow for logging in and getting the token[2].<p>[1]: I am aware that I could dive into the code and maybe contribute this myself but a) there might be plans for this already; I believe there&#x27;s an issue where it was discussed and b) I don&#x27;t have nearly enough time to commit to it.<p>[2]: I know that this is very nitpicky of me, but I do truly want a tool like this; I think it&#x27;d be awesome.')
