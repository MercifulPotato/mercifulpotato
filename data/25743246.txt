That is true regardless of how those models came to be--who built them, what credentials they had, how their peers regarded them, or even what philosophical beliefs they had (Platonist or otherwise). The models and their predictions, and how accurate (or inaccurate) those predictions are, are all independent of all that. Those models are science <i>separate</i> from how science is practiced as a human social endeavor.<p>So I would say the answer to the article&#x27;s title question is simple: If the experts are basing their expertise on models with a good predictive track record, then yes; otherwise no.')
