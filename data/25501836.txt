You could in theory have maximum entropy at 1000K. Our universe has a ton of empty space, and not all that much energy, so the temperature at which it equilibriates is very low. It&#x27;s also expanding, so the hypothetical equilibrium temperature is decreasing all the time.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that the entropy can be very large, even if the temperature is absolute zero. (You just need a system with a lot of different ground-states that all have the same energy.)')
