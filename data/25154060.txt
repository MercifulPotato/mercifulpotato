I&#x27;m really against the accredited investor limitation, as it creates the conditions for shady loans, reduces small entrepreneurs access to capital, and causes bubbles in things like real estate and garbage stocks, but the altruistic rationale of the regulation for &quot;protecting small investors,&quot; seems insincere and it seems more plausible that it protects an establishment of investors instead.')
