I wonder how that cultural interaction happened or whether it&#x27;s coincidental. Turkish alphabet is mostly based on German and French alphabets (with a certain dose of creativity) and Turkish language was heavily influenced by French in 19th century. So it&#x27;s interesting that they don&#x27;t use ,,&#x27;&#x27; or &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;')
