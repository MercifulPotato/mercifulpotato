Firefox is the daily driver browser. In that sense, I don&#x27;t lose out much by not having all the synchronization features etc. But I would lose out much by not having Chromium available at all.<p>A side point, the post mentions having to retry broken web sites in Chrome being a ritual for Firefox users -- I can&#x27;t think of many instances where that has been the case over the years. In fact, in the past decade it has been rare for any web site to fail in one browser and work in another. I remember two distinct cases: 1) H2O Wireless&#x27;s account management (and bill paying) which didn&#x27;t work in Chrome, and their tech support actually advised to use Firefox at the time (which worked), 2) Web Skype in recent years, for a time, dropped support for Firefox but only by user agent sniffing -- I was in fact able to get it to work completely fine on Firefox by using a plugin that changed my user agent string to say Chrome.')
