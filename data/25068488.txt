Item(by='BlueTemplar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605177510, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25066823, text='&gt; telling people how they can totally disable that nasty ME thanks to the apparently very well meaning NSA.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t claim to be nearly well versed enough to understand if that NSA advise is actually useful<p>Why do you think that it&#x27;s thanks to the NSA, and not despite what the NSA wanted ? What NSA advice ?<p>Also, Dell supposedly can sell you IME-disabled (?) (thanks to this?) Intel CPU computers if you&#x27;re a large enough organization.<p>Of course it could be that it&#x27;s actually a fake way to disable IME â€“ can we really know without having the firmware source <i>and</i> checking the hardware, which is likely to be a monumental task considering the level of miniaturization these days ..?')
