From tiny things like how to name the downloaded security files.. should we have the app name in the file or not - otherwise how would IT admin locate the file when they search, should file have time stamp because later we discovered that these d**n things expire, is there a &#x27;standard&#x27; to begin with that defines the naming convention of these things, and so on..<p>All this because? The detailed level of spec is never written by product managers. Which I think is a very foolish culture, particularly in enterprise space.')
