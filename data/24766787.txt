The requires strict inter-server security, authorization and roles.<p>On a normal server, you can run multiple processes (DB, front-end, back-end, etc) and rely on the fact they&#x27;re running on the same server to not having to design roles and auth.<p>In serverless, you need to manage roles and auths for everything.<p>You see the same issues for data pipes, triggers and queues.')
