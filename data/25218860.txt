My primary &quot;front-end&quot; machine is a 12.9&quot; Pro at the moment - I do dev work using Blink as a Mosh terminal to a Linux box, I do sketches, I communicate with clients on it.  And I very rarely have any complications with using it.<p>The only things I struggle with are<p>* the browser - it&#x27;s really annoying that notifications aren&#x27;t allowed and I don&#x27;t see why that&#x27;s not the case<p>* the browser - there&#x27;s no web inspector - I rarely do front-end work but there&#x27;s always some bit of CSS or JS to sort out (I use Luna Display into a 2012 Mac Mini or VNC into my Linux box for that)<p>* a minor annoyance with audio - I&#x27;d like to use my USB microphone with it, but plugging it in means it gets recognised as an output device as well, so I can&#x27;t hear anything - unlike a Mac I can&#x27;t find a way to route the input from one device and the output to another.<p>All my other annoyances with it are around poorly designed apps - for example ones that assume you wouldn&#x27;t want multiple windows or think you only ever want to upload from the camera roll rather than the filesystem.<p>UPDATE: one other thing - in the article she talks about landscape-first; I often use my iPad in landscape but it&#x27;s in portrait mode where it shines.  In landscape, with the magic keyboard, it just feels like a crippled laptop.  In portrait with an external keyboard in a stand it feels like a writing machine.  In portrait and with the pencil, it feels like a notebook.  I don&#x27;t really get the people who want the iPad to become a laptop when its strengths are elsewhere.')
