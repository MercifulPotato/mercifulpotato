Not sure if it affects M1&#x27;s.<p>Just ran into this on my 16&quot; Intel MBP after upgrading to Big Sur and attempting to play a game while using a Razer mouse.<p>Basically many gaming mice in including my Razer have upwards of 1000hz poll rate by default and apparently macOS does not handle that well causing high cpu in WindowServer, however in Big Sur it really doesn&#x27;t handle it well hitting 150% cpu in WindowServer and games seem to be almost unplayable do to massive stutter. Supposedly some improvement in 11.1 but still recommended to lower poll rate.<p>Had to plug my Razer into a PC to run their config software to lower the poll rate to 125hz. Now everything runs great, didn&#x27;t realize how much it was effecting everything and now games are smooth and playable again.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;mac&#x2F;comments&#x2F;juqcrd&#x2F;calling_all_big_sur_users_here_check_windowserver&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;mac&#x2F;comments&#x2F;juqcrd&#x2F;calling_all_big...</a>')
