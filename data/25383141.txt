Therefore the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.<p>--- (Community)<p>The wealth that we create is built upon the preexisting wealth created by others before us and by the community we live in. Therefore, should part of the wealth we create be shared communally?<p>The arguments for wealth tax don&#x27;t usually take into account<p>- wealth accumulation as a driver for increasing wealth for everyone (even if it increases inequality)<p>- whether government is an efficient means of redistributing wealth<p>- whether there are moral arguments against wealth redistribution as a form of coercion<p>As is often the case in history, this argument will probably not be decided by reason but by power.')
