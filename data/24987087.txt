ITER is designed to produce 10x fusion energy output vs electrical energy input.  As in you out 1 MW of electricity in and get 1 + 10 = 11MW of heat output.  While not designed to be an economic fusion system it would unequivocally demonstrate a working design and a provide a test bed for experiments relating to reactor materials and full scale operations.<p>This however is aimed to explore novel geometries which may aid in future designs.  However, the net efficiency at this scale would be vastly lower. It’s still a useful project, but it’s just one of many possible designs.')
