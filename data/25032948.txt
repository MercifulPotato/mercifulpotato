But that&#x27;s SciFi American I guess. It&#x27;s pretty incoherent.<p>The reason IQs are rising across the world, including recently in the West, is in part better nutrients in young people and mothers.<p>Your grandparents could only buy things in season, it cost money for usual vegetables other than potato and carrots, frozen foods are of course great and fortification was ok back then, but it&#x27;s better these days.<p>Who cares if carrots and potatoes had some better nutrients, if it&#x27;s all you ever eat, that&#x27;s not good.<p>I&#x27;d also like to test some old canned foods compared to today&#x27;s foods. I don&#x27;t fully trust old data being accurate especially retold in biased stories like this.')
