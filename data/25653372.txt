There are some videos out there from &quot;urban explorers&quot; heading down into the tunnels. I got to tour the unfinished platform and part of the tunnel under Central Parkway back in the late 2000&#x27;s. The water main running thru one of the tunnels is eerily imposing. There&#x27;s a fair amount of fiber down there, too.')
