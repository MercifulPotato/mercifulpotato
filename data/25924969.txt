One of the replies mentioned a setting to turn off hiding toolbars when you scroll. But I can&#x27;t find it on iOS.<p>In and of itself, I don&#x27;t find it strange that the UI is different between platforms. That&#x27;s called being a good citizen on a platform. In fact I wish they&#x27;d do it more. For instance, on macOS I&#x27;d expect close buttons for tabs in the top left.')
