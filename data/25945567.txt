Fernando here. I am really looking forward to getting some feedback about Hupreter (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hupreter.com) from you all.<p>I started working on Hupreter a year ago, mostly exploring what was possible. But some time before that, I started playing with NLP (natural language processing) and discovering what was currently possible. At first, I was using it on news articles but then I thought that it might be possible to use this to program in natural languages (like English), instead of programming languages. How cool would it be if you could just tell your computer what to do! Your computer, your phone, or any machine.<p>Most of the work has gone into creating a semantic engine that aims to &#x27;understand&#x27; the meaning behind a piece of text. Once that worked, I focused on the second stage which is converting that understanding into instructions in a programming language.<p>I am really happy to put this out there and get some feedback. Hopefully some interest too. This is just the beginning, it will keep growing to handle more and more tasks.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hupreter.com<p>Thank you! Let me know what you think.')
