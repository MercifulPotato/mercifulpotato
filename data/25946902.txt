Even if it wasn&#x27;t legal, they would just re-interpret the rules in their own favor.<p>Additionally, this is presented as if any of us had any say whatsoever in the writing of these laws or their enforcement or non-enforcement.<p>It&#x27;s a distinction without a difference. It implies that &quot;if we don&#x27;t like it we should change the laws&quot;. But none of us wrote the laws in the first place, and certainly if we had the power to change the laws we never would have written them this way. If we had the power to change the laws we would change them. So it&#x27;s an irrelevant point.<p>The entire point of the situation is &quot;these are the laws&quot; either officially, or unofficially but in practice.')
