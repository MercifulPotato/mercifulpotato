Onedrive has occasional issues, but being able to save my documents, pictures, etc. to Onedrive instead of a local drive is constantly useful to me. Even more so for the non-technical members of my family. Using a Microsoft login instead of a local login has also been useful, especially at times when I&#x27;ve been running multiple computers (laptop, desktop, Media PC, etc.).')
