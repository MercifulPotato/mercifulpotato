So I’m interested in what the mental model is that leads to being surprised when it <i>does</i> work—I know there’s plenty of stuff that I don’t know how it works and may guess incorrectly! As it stands, the only sort of mental model that I can think of is the screen telling the OS “I’m a such-and-such type of display and my resolution is so-and-so”, either when you plug the device in or when the OS asks.')
