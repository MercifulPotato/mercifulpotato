Item(by='edgefield', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1610655485, title='Ask HN: Get Magic for Physical Deliveries', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='There are many delivery services cropping up but they only offer delivery from a limited set of restaurants, stores, etc. You  often have to check multiple websites to see if they deliver from a selected restaurant and store and often strike out. Would folks find value in a delivery service where you can order anything from any local restaurant, store, or vendor? This could also include pickup and delivery of items from&#x2F;to businesses and homes. I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback on this idea. Thanks.')
