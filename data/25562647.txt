I wish I could say that I&#x27;m shocked that authorities take the word of software over looking at the evidence and thinking, &quot;umm, doesn&#x27;t <i>look</i> like him...&quot; Or perhaps someone did look and said, &quot;meh, they all look the same to me.&quot;<p>All I know is that I&#x27;m highly skeptical that this white guy would suffer the same fate, even if I were to have a similar criminal record. Facial recognition seems to be the polygraph for a new century. But unlike a polygraph, it mostly false positives only for dark-skinned people. While I&#x27;m not quite ready to allow my cynicism to let me think it is an <i>intentional</i> feature, I question how many are demanding a fix.')
