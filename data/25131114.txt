In python I would have done something like new_var=[{a:i[&#x27;a&#x27;], b:i[&#x27;b&#x27;]} for i in old_var], but apparently that is impossible in ansible. The best solution I was able to find after lots of searching was to to pass new_var to a jinja2 template which would render new_var as text, then run that through a json interpreter and set that as new_var. Absolutely rediculous.<p>It astounds me that a tool BUILT on python lacks any semblance of python&#x27;s biggest feature, list comprehension.')
