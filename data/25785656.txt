Don&#x27;t pursue 5+ years of learning to master the world of academic research if your <i>goal</i> is to help people sell t-shirts or whatever.<p>Certainly there are some people pursuing specific PhDs, such as those in computer vision and nlp where there are some industry options that <i>might</i> offer more challenging&#x2F;interesting research than academia. It makes sense if you&#x27;re a PhD at NYU or Stanford in CS fields related to neural networks to go work for Yann Lecun at Facebook or Geoffrey Hinton at Google.<p>But if you&#x27;re, say a biologist that wants to sell clothes online... why spend 6 years working in academia to do that? Is your dream really to optimize clothing sales? If so don&#x27;t be a biologist. If your dream is biology, why in the world would you set your course on selling clothes?<p>I get it if your dream is biology but you can&#x27;t find a tenure track job and so you pivot to industry... but if you are mid-phd, what are you doing there? If you love your subject, try to find a way to work in that and if you don&#x27;t, don&#x27;t waste your time.<p>Data Science is not a glamorous job, and the vast majority of companies it is literally bullshit. The people solving mind-bendingly hard problems are already in programs specializing in those problems because that&#x27;s what they are passionate about. On top of that DS is way over indexed at most companies. If you&#x27;re mid-phd now I would expect a serious contraction in DS jobs in the next 5 years. DS will be a niche job after the next market &quot;correction&quot;')
