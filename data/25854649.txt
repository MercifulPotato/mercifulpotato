Having lived in Portland, I did not see a correlation between the construction of market rate housing or luxury housing and the reduction in rent in other neighborhoods.<p>I also don’t understand that “if the government says something is designated as being affordable housing then it will be affordable” is suggested to be a possibly unreliable assumption. I’ve lived in affordable housing and market rate housing. Affordable Housing was uh, much more affordable.<p>Maybe I’m completely misunderstanding this post but the general tone comes off as “anything associated with ‘the left’ is actually diametrically opposed to truth”')
