It&#x27;s wrong to equivocate between groups &quot;following their incentives&quot;. Facebook could have chosen not pursue algorithm-based advertising as a business model. The news companies didn&#x27;t have the option of ignoring Facebook (and Google) by about 2014 or 2015 (news companies also  didn&#x27;t conduct unregulated psychological tests or commit fraud to push a video-first model). I don&#x27;t really blame Facebook for playing the game, but if you play, you also accept the consequences when society gets sick of your shit.<p>It&#x27;s hardly persecution to insist that American businesses stop doing gross harm to the American people. Your personal anecdote is largely irrelevant compared to Facebook&#x27;s earnings report - lots of people still use these platforms and they will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. It&#x27;s unlikely that these companies will pivot their business model in the absence of oversight. I&#x27;ve stopped using it too, but we absolutely should create market rules to deal with the obvious abuses that have occurred so they don&#x27;t crop up again.')
