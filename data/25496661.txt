Ironically, it somehow takes more engineers than ever to ship most products. The surface area and expectations for a modern product have grown substantially. Gone are the days when a couple of people would throw together a quick and ugly Rails application and then start trying to sell it to customers.<p>I wish we&#x27;d see more startups bucking the trend of doing complicated React websites with complex backends that look like someone was trying to use as many AWS product offerings as possible. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s increasingly difficult to convince engineers to focus on the easy, simple problems. Everyone wants things to be as complex as possible so they can pad their resumes for the next job, whether or not the product calls for it.<p>Another factor is that interest rates are incredibly low right now. The cost of capital is so low that startup founders will often take excessive amounts of investment to grow faster and pad their runways. When it comes time for acquisition talks, the founders negotiate million-dollar &quot;retention bonuses&quot; with the acquiring company if their shares are worthless due excessive dilution and liquidation preferences. Works out well for founders, while employees get nothing.')
