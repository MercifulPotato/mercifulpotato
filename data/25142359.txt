Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25142498], score=None, time=1605733091, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25141513, text='&gt; he &quot;conducted without entitlement to a paid job&quot; test, as the &quot;fellowship&quot; is clearly being undertaken with the hope of receiving a full-time job.<p>&quot;A hope of X&quot; and &quot;entitlement to X&quot; are not the same thing.  I tend to agree that this is likely illegal, but it seems to have been <i>very</i> carefully crafted to have at least a superficially-plausible argument for compatibility with the primary beneficiary test.
