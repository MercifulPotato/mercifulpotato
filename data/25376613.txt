Obviously you can&#x27;t refute them, because if you could, you would have already, after I originally asked you to refute what he said that you don&#x27;t agree with. Now you&#x27;re asking me for a refutation (but of what??!), just like Trump incoherently projecting his own lies onto other people, after you refused to refute anything that Hitchens said, or even state what he said that you disagree with. So why should I answer your vague demand to refute some unspecified claim, after you failed to answer the specific question I asked first? You&#x27;re the one who&#x27;s denying reality and dodging questions. The ball&#x27;s in your court to refute what Hitchens said, before demanding I refute some hypothetical claims you won&#x27;t even identify.')
