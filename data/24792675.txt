And then we&#x27;re just back to storing everything on B2 and S3, except in a less efficient and more opaque way.<p>They can totally do this, but they are on the hook for that data. If the backing store for the data that the miner is trusting goes down, the miner loses a pretty significant amount of collateral (currently 0.2 FIL per 32GB sector).<p>In practice, we&#x27;re seeing most miners set up their own storage clusters. Whether a bunch of small (100TB-1PB) nfs boxes, or much bigger single filesystem CEPH clusters.')
