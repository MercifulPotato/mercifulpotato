I pushed to have it simply because &quot;if google says jump, you say how high&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s a bunch of insane tactics with the Ads model. For example the Ads quality score which is a totally ambiguous rating out of 10. They will then rate the page based on a whole load of variables and determine the rating - if you get 4&#x2F;10 you are going to be paying more for your bids due to being penalized for low-quality BUT they will still allow it.<p>Now trying to figure how to improve and get it up to 10&#x2F;10 is an entire process in itself. There&#x27;s going to be people coming out of the wood work saying that the Quality Score is easy and so on but to me is just smells of unfair practices to exploit each cent out of advertisers.')
