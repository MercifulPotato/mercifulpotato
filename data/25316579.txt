Life on its own is ultimately a tragic story for everyone. So once we have our basic necessities met, it&#x27;s the job of each of us to try to layer on top of that tragic story a personal story of meaning, a story explaining why the pain mattered somehow.<p>That layered story can take many forms. The most time-tested one is having children. But there are many other ways to write the story too.<p>There&#x27;s also no law saying we have to layer any story of meaning at all, but human brains seem to really crave it and don&#x27;t seem to do well without one.')
