Yes.<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t think we should knock Instagram for mental health issues, that&#x27;s really up to the user. Instagram&#x27;s responsibility should be in providing tools to block users&#x2F;content you don&#x27;t want to see. If your child is suffering from Instagram, that&#x27;s on you as a parent (why the fuck are they on Instagram). You don&#x27;t need Instagram to be bullied, though social media in general, does increase its reach. But what do you expect when you put your life on display for the internet?<p>&gt; Do we knock tobacco companies for making cheap&#x2F;addictive products that are detrimental to health? Yes.<p>Tobacco only has one use. There is no benefit to it. Robinhood is an investment tool that has significantly lowered the barrier to entry for all investors (isn&#x27;t that what everyone has wanted all along?). I would not consider what they are doing gamification, they&#x27;ve just unlocked investment options to the average Joe that make it very easy to shoot yourself in the foot.<p>&gt; Do we knock MLM companies for predatory behaviors? Yes.<p>MLM companies are created for one purpose, scamming people out of money.<p>Robinhood serves a purpose. Instagram serves a purpose. Both services provide a ton of value for millions of people. You can&#x27;t compare them to entities that only exist to cause harm.')
