Just read the post on MacStadium&#x27;s blog: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.macstadium.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;developers-big-sur-and-vindication" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.macstadium.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;developers-big-sur-and-vind...</a><p>Under the new agreement, you must:<p>* Rent to only one organization<p>* Rent for 24 hours at the minimum<p>* Use it for some set of &quot;approved&quot; development work<p>â€¦among other restrictions. And Brian Stucki is <i>celebrating</i> these changes?! This is a sick joke. You&#x27;re enjoying a significantly tightened EULA that benefits nobody but yourself, a EULA that means that a single CI build now costs $26 on AWS instead of 50 cents; one that means that more than half the comments here are confused why AWS is ripping people off.<p>Shame on you Brian Stucki, shame on you MacStadium, and shame on you Apple. Your EULA changes are absurdly hostile to developers, since now they&#x27;re either going to have to buy Macs themselves or rent from MacStadium-like services. Shame on you both for colluding together for making this situation horrible and then having the guts to write that blog post.<p>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying this, but Amazon, I feel so sorry for you. You didn&#x27;t deserve this.')
