We don&#x27;t dream of America because we cannot even read its blocked content and paywalls, so we are not too exposed to propaganda anymore.<p>Although, if you ask me, apart from its chaotic state, attachment to unhealthy religions, political corruption, and overcomplicated health care situation, fighting with visas is something we don&#x27;t feel the need.<p>I lived in San Francisco as a software engineer for many years, and I lived the American dream, but it is not a place to live long term. I was tired of living as a second class citizen, kind of an indentured servant, tied to a Visa.<p>The health care situation is disgraceful and when I had my first couple of scares with the health care system, I packed my things and came back home.<p>Most of the people that came with me are back to the EU. From my friends&#x27; perspective, it is not really the greatest country on earth tbh, and people should travel a bit more to explore the world and compare it against other countries.')
