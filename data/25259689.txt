Item(by='klelatti', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606774294, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25258956, text='On 1) I think that you&#x27;re right about the impact of the ISA being overdone but lets not forget that Intel has had a process advantage for a long time and that it was partly the volume of consumer sales that supported their R&amp;D and helped them win on servers. That situation has changed now - the process advantage has gone and there is lots of money pouring into TSMC and the mobile SoC designers.<p>For me the key point on the ISA is that Arm is not limited to two companies: what we&#x27;ve seen in other markets will happen in desktops and servers - the really big customers can take the ISA and build highly competitive SoCs that suit them on the leading process technology and for lower cost.')
