EU offered so much incentives in the last years that companies bought them, but never charge them. They emit 400% of the CO2 quota that was allocated for the cars, it&#x27;s the new type of diesel cheating that car companies use. I&#x27;m not against hybrids of course, just against giving incentives to buy them.')
