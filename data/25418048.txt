I&#x27;ve seen reports which claim they are mostly used as a subsidy to training which was already taking place, as a workaround to pay workers less, and generally in low-skilled jobs.<p>Like the grandparent post, the UK model is guilty of assuming that the word &quot;apprenticeship&quot; together with a sort of folksy appeal to a golden era of apprentices will solve the hard problems of training and education.')
