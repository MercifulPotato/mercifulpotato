When you look at big tech, the numbers are drastically higher:<p>- AMZN: 92<p>- GOOG: 34<p>- FB: 33<p>- NFLX: 76<p>- AAPL: 35<p>- MSFT: 35<p>Compare this to, say, 3M, at 19, or GM with 17.<p>edit: incidentally, apparently Zoom&#x27;s P&#x2F;E is... 527, which is grossly inflated even for a tech company. Tesla is also in the same category with a P&#x2F;E of 834.')
