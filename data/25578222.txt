It&#x27;s good to have an idea what they&#x27;re doing so you can better utilize the APIs, compare two different approaches, and often you&#x27;ll find yourself hand-rolling aspects (like writing an exporter from something like Maya to be used in a realtime engine or converting Y-up data to Z-up data before sending it along).')
