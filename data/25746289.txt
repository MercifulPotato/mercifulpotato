Do you think that there hasn&#x27;t been a shred of substantiated hard evidence of widespread voter fraud for 70 days and then all of the sudden there was and so platforms started censoring people? Have you been paying any attention to this? or is your comment just based on a very narrow perspective of very recent events?')
