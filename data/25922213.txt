Item(by='JPKab', descendants=None, kids=[25928263], score=None, time=1611703188, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25914115, text='I was &quot;stuck&quot; working with a bunch of leading academics and researchers on a SemWeb project using OWL&#x2F;RDF, in collaboration with DARPA and the US Department of Defense, around 2008-2009.<p>You are absolutely correct that they are hostile to anything outside of their &quot;ideology&quot;.<p>The awful, horrific performance of the RDF&#x2F;OWL databases compared to the impure, heretical evil Neo4j that they despised for its practicality..... that was always funny.<p>Another interesting thing I encountered in the field was the side-effect of an academic field that sounds really good to people who have never built anything EVER is that it can often get a ton of funding and grant money from central government organizations, thereby creating legions of rather shitty companies (especially in the EU, where the grants were everywhere) that have the word &quot;semantic&quot; in the name even though they do nothing with actual semantic technology. These shitty companies are often just there to employ the academics.<p>The craziest thing was these projects where they would employ a dozen or so &quot;library scientists&quot; who were all just masters and phd students who had, for some reason, decided to study to be librarians in the digital era to create the OWL ontologies.  None of them knew anything about computer science or programming, and they would just sit there and read thousands of policy documents and use an Eclipse based GUI to create and edit giant graphs of knowledge and rules.  All were being paid six figures, and didn&#x27;t produce a single goddammed thing of value.  So much taxpayer money in those rooms going to complete waste.  Glad it wasn&#x27;t just me that thought the community was a joke.<p>The semantic web will arrive one day, but OWL and SPARQL won&#x27;t be anywhere in it.  And it won&#x27;t be any of these academics delivering it.')
