The graphics are amazing, never enjoyed pixels so much.\nThere is an amazing depth in the storytelling and in the universe conveyed. The occasional bugs only make the game more fun. I consider myself lucky to have witness a few I&#x27;m sure many people won&#x27;t be able to see them when in a few weeks most bugs will be already fixed.')
