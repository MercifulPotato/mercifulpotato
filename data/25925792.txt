That would expose what the build program is doing and how it differs from the expected intent.<p>The online notebooks used in data analysis (Jupyter, Apache Zeppelin) are a step in the right direction; IMHO their approach of &#x27;data is always readable besides the code processing it&#x27; makes for a better introspection infrastructure than the REPL loops of old.')
