I&#x27;ve had to use my horn while stationery for safety reasons. Like when I&#x27;m in a parking lot, I can&#x27;t go anywhere because there&#x27;s a car in front of me, and someone starts to back out of a parking space toward me without looking. They need to know that it&#x27;s not clear, and that&#x27;s what the horn is for. (It&#x27;s also what their mirrors are for, but I can&#x27;t control that.)')
