Item(by='bboygravity', descendants=None, kids=[25207497, 25207435], score=None, time=1606295310, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25207025, text='&gt; And even if someone farms for selling to others if they don&#x27;t have reliable access to machinery the farms will be really small as that just does not scale up (just take a look at pre industrial world where something like 90% of people were farmers)<p>You seem to assume&#x2F;imply that small farms in the developing world cannot scale up due to economic&#x2F;business reasons.<p>However in some developing countries, farms cannot be scaled up due to legal reasons. Countries like The Philippines don&#x27;t allow ownership of farmland over one or two hectares per person. For companies the maximum is 5 hectares if I remember correctly. Foreigner investors cannot legally own  any land whatsoever there (not even through a company, because foreigners aren&#x27;t allowed to be majority share holders).<p>Is that good or bad? I don&#x27;t know. Agriculture world wide is a highly regulated and highly subsidized non-free market that has very little to do with the concepts of capitalism and free market. This should probably be analyzed on a country by country basis with a couple of history books handy.<p>Random facts that I like about farming subsidies in the West: if farming in the Western world wasn&#x27;t heavily subsidized, it wouldn&#x27;t exist in the Western world. The reason for the farming subsidies is to have internal food production in case a war prevents sufficient food imports.')
