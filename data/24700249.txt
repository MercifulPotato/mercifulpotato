What it does is explain why they are admittedly &quot;not too experienced with MySQL&quot; and didn&#x27;t straight remember that <i>obviously</i> the range of MySQL&#x27;s TIME type is &#x27;-838:59:59&#x27; to &#x27;838:59:59&#x27; so 960 would be out of range.<p>Also please don&#x27;t staple dicks onto people, the author&#x27;s gender is irrelevant to the article and it&#x27;s very disturbing.<p>&gt; Also see: the title of the article.<p>The title of the article, and the introduction you&#x27;re quoting, follow from the article itself. Unless you&#x27;re calling the author a liar and think they made up the entire thing just to bash mysql.<p>That the author ultimately considers the behaviour of MySQL&#x27;s TIME type and its bounds &quot;a WTF&quot;â€¦ is entirely defensible.')
