I&#x27;m as much of a software liberty zealot as it gets and will never understand people flocking to &quot;platforms&quot; when we had open protocols for chat for decades (irc, xmpp), but Salesforce certainly is a respected company having pioneered SaaS long before that became a thing in this decade, isn&#x27;t it?
