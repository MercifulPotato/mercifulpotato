Do you say this as someone who is familiar with actual laws? Genuinely asking. Because I know that engineers (my past self included) like to imagine formalizing laws and turning them into code, which is extremely naive, once you see actual laws and how much human common sense judgment is needed to decide on them, including inferring intent, judging potential consequences, interpreting imprecise terms, etc.<p>Perhaps a part of the tax code <i>is</i> like code. But a lot of laws are far from it. It&#x27;s more formal than novels but it&#x27;s firmly natural language that you need to understand as a human.')
