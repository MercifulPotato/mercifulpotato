It&#x27;s actually based on how hard it is for them to get someone else to do your job and how hard it is for you to get another job.<p>It is easier for them to replace a remote employee than a local employee, so that works against you.<p>It is harder for you to find an alternate job if you live in a low COL area than if you live in a high COL area, so that also works against you.<p>Obviously, this wouldn&#x27;t be the case if every company went fully remote, but that isn&#x27;t going to happen, so you should still expect a lot of remote jobs to adjust pay based on locality. If they don&#x27;t, they are just leaving money on the table.')
