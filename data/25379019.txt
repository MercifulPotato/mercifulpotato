I mainly focus on code output, but I&#x27;ve hit a wall when it comes to learning how applications are set up on the cloud, setting up services, automation and whatnot.<p>Consider an average web dev from that period, who may be working professionally but in small-scale operations, and not in big corp settings.<p>After reeling from the shock of the pandemic worldwide, they need to make themselves relevant for most web development work in 2020. Automated build and deploy is now as bread and butter skill today as spinning up a LAMP stack was 12 years ago.<p>If you were to show a web developer from that time period what cloud and serverless products are, and how they can be used, how should you explain it to them? And what resources would be the best for them to learn considering what they may already know?')
