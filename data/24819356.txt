Nice restaurants (not necessarily expensive ones), which are very particular about how they serve their food.\n2. Enthusiastic hosts who go out of their way for infrequent guests - especially guests from abroad.<p>It all boils down to <i>omotenashi</i> - to be exoticizing a little, that&#x27;s the Japanese spirit of treating guests with the utmost welcome.\nTo be more down to earth, this is all about cultural expectations. Restaurants and cafes try to present a perfect-looking dish, because this is how they are judged by their customers. Some (not all!) hosts might go out of their way and serve using their best dishes, trying to make restaurant-looking food to make good first impressions on a guest.')
