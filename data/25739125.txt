Open world games should have emergent gameplay or fun side content. 2077 doesn&#x27;t really have either. You can&#x27;t lead the law on a merry car chase, like GTA. You can&#x27;t steal into people&#x27;s homes to find goodies or start a battle with the town folk like Skyrim. You can&#x27;t play a chill game of Gwent with a nearby NPC. You can&#x27;t build a neat base like in Fallout 4. You can&#x27;t go fishing or pelt hunting like in RDR2.<p>There&#x27;s just...nothing to do that isn&#x27;t on a yellow quest marker dot. Nothing to explore and no AI to create rich, memorable experiences with. Just a gorgeous, puddle-deep map. An aquarium swimming with schools of brain-dead, filler NPCs.<p>It makes me wonder why CDPR even made 2077 an open world at all. You don&#x27;t need one for a smattering of (superb) siloed missions&#x2F;levels and cut scenes. That&#x27;s a <i>lot</i> of extra work so players can...drive around the mostly empty world, I guess?<p>Who knows, maybe CDPR had a lot of features in mind and will deliver them to us through updates &amp; DLCs. But as it stands, 2077 is billed as an open world and delivers a dead&#x2F;static map.')
