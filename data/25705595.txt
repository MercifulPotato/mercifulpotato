You just need to obtain the DNS names or IP addresses of the nodes the same way everyone else does â€” by participating in the network. This way you can even selectively ban the &quot;bad&quot; nodes.<p>Banning a centralized service like gmail is easier, but then you lose in productivity as 90% of your country&#x27;s businesses are likely to rely on it.<p>As far as privacy goes, it&#x27;s also easier to coerce admins of smaller nodes to disclose valuable information than fighting with a multinational foreign corporation.<p>This is not an argument against decentralization. It&#x27;s just not immediately obvious that decentralization does not automatically lead to censorship resistance. To do that we need onion routing or mix networks as a base for all our communications, so that banning the network would be equivalent to disconnecting the ISP from the Internet altogether.')
