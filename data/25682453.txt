One section that made me chuckle was when the narrator said that scientists predict that the Amazon rainforest will be totally gone by the year 2010. Obviously that didn&#x27;t happen.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t feel too hopeless about things just based off of a study whose timescale is roughly the same as cold fusion research. We still had the rainforest in 2010 because people changed their behavior and the rate of deforestation decreased. There&#x27;s still time to change things.')
