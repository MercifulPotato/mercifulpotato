In Nevada we have had a mask mandate since the summer, and our numbers are worse than most states, even those that are far less restrictive.  When I go out in public, I see near-100% compliance with the mandate, so “rational decision making” isn’t the issue.  Perhaps it’s that masks, unless combined with highly impractical protocols that nobody would follow even if imposed (not touching&#x2F;using their cell phone after touching other things, wearing disposable gloves, etc), simply aren’t that effective.')
