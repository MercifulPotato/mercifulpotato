I am disgusted by the Capitol incident and so happy to see Trump on his way out, but we really shouldn’t just go full throttle on banning anyone we don’t like politically now. Stuff like this is going to make the past 4 years happen again even more severely in the future.<p>You want populism and the horrible dictators that can come with that? Keep doing this. We should be trying to unify, not purge an entire political party from our lives. One that is needed to keep power in check.<p>Perhaps the republicans need to completely rebrand and even change their name, that’s totally fine and probably worth doing at this point. But two parties is still better than one. More than two that actually can elect someone would be even better.')
