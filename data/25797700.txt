Overall there are a lot of decisions (like the lack of a function to copy tables) that are based on the assumption that any given Lua code was written for and executing in an environment created by a programmer who is going to roll their own standard library, make any tweaks to the syntax they like, etc. And I agree that for that reason it&#x27;s not in itself a great language for learners, but that&#x27;s not exactly the same as being a great language for non-programmers.')
