I&#x27;m not sure I could leave Android for a different phone OS. Un-googled LineageOS seems like the best balance, but also it&#x27;s difficult to find phones that have great support. For example, I have an LG V20 running it, and the experience has been kinda buggy. Ultimately, I wish I could use it on a Pine64 PinePhone, but that effort looks to have stalled last year.')
