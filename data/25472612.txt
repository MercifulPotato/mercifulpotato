It&#x27;s a total all around bust. You&#x27;re just wasting money at that point.<p>If the interconnect is your bottleneck, you spend money on the interconnect to make it faster. Basic engineering: you attack the bottleneck.<p>You don&#x27;t start talking about slower systems and how they&#x27;re cheaper. Because that just slows down the rest of your system.<p>------<p>If you just wanted cores, you buy a 28core Xeon Gold. The point of 28-core Xeon Platinum is for the 8-way interconnect and scaling up to 8-way NUMA systems. The only person who would ever buy a Xeon Platinum is someone who wants 40GBps UPI connections at relatively low latencies. (or maybe even the 300GBps connections that IBM offers, but that&#x27;s a similar high-cost vertical-scaling system)<p>&gt; So you really have to be in a very obscure situation which can&#x27;t fit onto a dual socket Rome server, but can fit within a machine less than 2x larger. (28 cores * 8 sockets is less than 2x larger than 64 cores * 2 sockets)<p>That&#x27;s not even that hard to figure out! A 48TB Memcached &#x2F; Redis, which is far more useful than a 8TB Memcached &#x2F; Redis box.<p>A bit basic, but yeah. That&#x27;s the point: spend more money on hardware and then don&#x27;t spend much engineering time thinking about optimization. If 48TBs of RAM solves a problem that 8TB cannot, then just get the 48TB system.')
