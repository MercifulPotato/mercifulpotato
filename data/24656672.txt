Only restrictions are that you have to be a solid performer beforehand, and you have to find a team that&#x27;s either in that location or that&#x27;s willing to have you work remotely (many teams are happy to have remote workers, particularly ones who are high performers).<p>Anecdotally, I have never heard of anyone getting a job at a FAANG with that kind of salary working remotely from day 1. On the other hand, I have met several people who <i>started</i> on-site but switched to working remotely later. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not possible to do the former, but it seems like it&#x27;s way easier to work remotely for a FAANG if you&#x27;ve already proven yourself, which obviously doesn&#x27;t work if you have <i>already</i> moved to a lower CoL area and are looking for work.')
