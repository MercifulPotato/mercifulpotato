My solution to this (on arch linux) was to maintain a script that would open the stuff I need on specific workspaces. I&#x27;d always need the following to get work done:<p>1. Browser on workspace 1\n2. Pycharm&#x2F;IDE on workspace 2\n3. Terminals ssh-ed into the compute server on workspace 3\n4. Workspace 4 is empty - I use this as my scratch workspace\n5.
