I&#x27;m morbidly curious what the effects of all Western corporations banning slave labor would be.  I doubt it would result in liberation.  Would working conditions for the slaves worsen when they worked for local, lower-margin factories instead?  I can&#x27;t imagine them improving.<p>I have little faith in legal remedies to liberate slaves.  Arming them seems the only long-term effective solution.  Otherwise the man with the gun will order the slave back to work the second the man in the wig isn&#x27;t looking.  And the man in the wig will remain silent, to avoid revealing his impotence.<p>Slave labor is inefficient, so perhaps the best way is to topple inefficient slave societies through full-spectrum competition, from military to economic.  This pressure incentivizes efficient human resource utilization.<p>One thing&#x27;s for sure:  Individual Westerner guilt over whether to buy the next iPhone will add zero value.')
