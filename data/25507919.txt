The original nazis used “irony” and “edgelord” recruiting tactics in the same way that the modern neo-nazi does, with the same intents and purposes. There’s no difference in the tactics, just like there’s no difference in the contingent of concerned free-speech absolutists convinced that we need to listen to their “jokes” and take them in stride as they advance their radicalization campaigns. The “irony” is important, because it allows their recruits to performatively voice their hatred in a safe manner, much like a child riding a bike with training wheels. The goal of radicalization is to move them away from the irony, but keep the hatred.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thewrap.com&#x2F;daily-stormer-founder-ironic-nazis-andrew-anglin&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thewrap.com&#x2F;daily-stormer-founder-ironic-nazis-a...</a>')
