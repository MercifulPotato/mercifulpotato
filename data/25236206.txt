I personally have a bachelors in computer engineering.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s surviorship bias, but the people who dropped out are probably some of the best. There&#x27;s certainly some value in a CS&#x2F;CE bachelor&#x27;s curriculum, and occasionally, something would come up where knowledge from a course was useful; but mostly a 4 year degree in CS&#x2F;CE is a certificate of sticking to hard things that are computer related. You&#x27;ve probably got some project under your belt that shows you can stick to hard things that are computer related, even if it&#x27;s not as formalized.<p>If it really bothers you, work through The Art of Computer Programming by Knuth. If it bothers you a little, but not that much, maybe borrow it from a library and look through the table of contents and read a few sections that look interesting.')
