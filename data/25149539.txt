But after reading the first page of their installation documentation [0], was quite impressed! This is how installation documentation should be written!! Now, i want to play with it, just because of how the doc is written.  Who knows if i will keep things up, but apparently all it takes is to have really amazing documentation to interest me; go figure.<p>[0] = <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.funkwhale.audio&#x2F;installation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.funkwhale.audio&#x2F;installation&#x2F;</a>')
