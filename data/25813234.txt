On January 6 there was a man wearing a &quot;Camp Auschwitz&quot; hoodie with the word &quot;staff&quot; printed on the back, on national television. Do you believe this man is not a Nazi? And do you believe that Jewish people do not have a right to warn their coworkers to stay safe in light of people like this committing violent acts?<p>I&#x27;m genuinely curious to understand what part you believe is political here, because it seems like the employee&#x27;s message was entirely based in easily verifiable fact and genuine concern.')
