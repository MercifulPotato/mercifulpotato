Partly the issue has been getting good support for this in drivers and applications, and partly the issue is the base protocol doesn&#x27;t allow for a bunch of features by default (a lot of which in X were essentially massive security holes, since any X client can take screenshots, intercept keyboard&#x2F;mouse events globally, etc). These features are being added, but it seems as custom extensions in each compositor without widespread support.')
