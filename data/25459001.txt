Simple as that. The user doesn&#x27;t need to worry about how git manages its data internally.<p>&gt; I believe that Git becomes understandable if we peel back the curtain and look at how Git stores your repository data.<p>This strikes me as misleading in the same way this StackOverflow answer [0] is misleading. In terms of how git stores data, commits are not always snapshots. Internally, git sometimes uses delta compression to reduce storage space. This is of no concern to the user, conceptually a commit is still a snapshot, but it&#x27;s just not true that git naively stores each commit as a full snapshot.<p>Peeling back the curtain isn&#x27;t helpful to someone trying to understand the basic git model. Also, as the article makes no mention of delta compression or of &#x27;packfiles&#x27;, it seems to me it hasn&#x27;t pulled back the curtain at all.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;8198276&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stackoverflow.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;8198276&#x2F;</a>')
