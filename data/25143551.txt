You can just drop these widgets into your template and get going. Often with just 1 or 2 lines code if you&#x27;re using Yarn + Webpack.<p>With Tailwind you&#x27;re on your own for all of that unless you buy Tailwind UI and even then it&#x27;s only JavaScript solutions with the libraries the authors have chosen to use and it&#x27;s no where near as feature complete vs the JS widgets you get with Bootstrap, even if you only count what&#x27;s officially bundled with Bootstrap.<p>Both of those things are kind of problematic for someone who isn&#x27;t super strong on the front-end and doesn&#x27;t want to invest a lot of time designing these things from scratch (a full time job in itself). Especially if you want to use something like StimulusJS instead of Alpine or Vue, since Tailwind UI doesn&#x27;t seem to include any examples for StimulusJS. There&#x27;s a whole bunch of folks out there (like me) who aren&#x27;t building SPAs. We&#x27;re just using good old server rendered templates with sprinkles of JavaScript.<p>With that said I still prefer using Tailwind, but it&#x27;s not really near the level of productivity you get when buying a very well supported $30 Bootstrap theme (ES6 JS, Webpack, etc.) and get going on your project without having to worry about implementing every last line of JS behavior.<p>I&#x27;m sure Tailwind will get there with better JS support. I&#x27;ve seen some of Adam&#x27;s tweets on how he plans to address this problem but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a time line on when all of that will be ready to go, or if it&#x27;ll all be locked into Tailwind UI only (about $250).')
