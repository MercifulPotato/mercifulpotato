I have tinnitus, so the laptop fan noise becomes unbearable.<p>I&#x27;m enjoying using the Mac, I mainly develop in Rust, so the experience has been mostly good. I&#x27;ve had a few hard crashes of other software that restarted the machine, that&#x27;s fine though.<p>I still mainly remote into my beefy Windows desktop in the other room, but I haven&#x27;t needed to turn on my work laptop as Microsoft also updated Office to work on Arm64.<p>I didn&#x27;t know about Parallels, I&#x27;ll try it out, as sometimes I can&#x27;t remote into my desktop conveniently.')
