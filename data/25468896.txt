One point where I felt I&#x27;ve grown this year both personally and professionally was that I&#x27;m more confident that the things I&#x27;m spending time to work on are the &quot;right&quot; ones for me, and I spent some time musing internally about how I got to that point, and how to explain that process.<p>Glad it resonates with others :)')
