They do not control laws, enforcement, government spending and military command. Certainly at the size and wealth of many corporations, they do heavily <i>influence</i> legislation though, and that certainly is worth examining.<p>But individuals have a choice whether or not to <i>use</i> social media. I&#x27;m just one person: I use Instagram but only follow a few people that post photos I like (I&#x27;ll unfollow if a lot of posts diverge from photography), I avoid Facebook feeds completely and mostly avoid Twitter although the past few days have been an exception - I only visit one or two tech-related subreddits. This is just right now at a moment in time. Five years ago I would&#x27;ve said I use Facebook daily and Twitter extremely rarely and what is Reddit, and I&#x27;ve posted a few photos on Instagram but it doesn&#x27;t really interest me. It&#x27;s always a shifting landscape. (I once had a Google+ profile...)')
