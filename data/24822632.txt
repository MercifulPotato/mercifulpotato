Even when light is experiencing a gravitational lensing and looks to us from earth that it&#x27;s bending around a star or whatever, from the perspective of the light beam itself, it&#x27;s moving in a straight line. It&#x27;s entire reference frame is bent compared to ours (relativity) but nonetheless the correct view is that the light is still moving &#x27;straight&#x27; in it&#x27;s own reference frame.<p>Also if the light wasn&#x27;t moving straight that would mean it&#x27;s changing direction, which is the same as an acceleration, and a beam of light traveling thru a gravitational field feels no acceleration, because it&#x27;s not accelerating. Again from this view you can say light is moving straight and experiencing no acceleration, just like an object in free-fall doesn&#x27;t &#x27;feel&#x27; any acceleration, even though they are accelerating from the perspective of some other reference frame other than it&#x27;s own.')
