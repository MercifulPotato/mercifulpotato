If I&#x27;m reading the article correctly these were collected by the ASKAP telescope array in Australia which has a resolution of 30 arcseconds at 1.4GHz [1], which is only about twice as good as the human eye.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atnf.csiro.au&#x2F;projects&#x2F;askap&#x2F;config.html#:~:text=The%20initial%20ASKAP%20configuration%20is,30&#x27;&#x27;%20at%201.4%20GHz" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atnf.csiro.au&#x2F;projects&#x2F;askap&#x2F;config.html#:~:text...</a>.<p>To your point, though, when VLBI is used they can get ridiculous levels of resolution.  M87 was imaged at tens of microarcseconds of resolution, which is 4-5 orders of magnitude better than any optical telescope in operation today.')
