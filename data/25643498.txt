Knowing how to learn is a core skill I value and teaching that to the others is something I would be more than happy to do.<p>Ideally looking for a company &#x2F; project with a reason to exist and a good roadmap to make sure that plan happens. If your tech stack is not what I am used to; I consider that a plus (as I would love to expand my horizons as well).<p>Reach out and we can do a virtual coffee meeting. :)')
