They&#x27;re not stupid.<p>Why would we ever trust the messaging of a company that:<p>1. Has removed the headphone jack claiming there wasn&#x27;t enough room inside the phone for it.<p>2. While &quot;accidentally&quot; deciding to sell a $150 pair of wireless earbuds just as they removed the previous accessory.<p>3. Now has removed the charger, claiming that they want to reduce pollution.<p>4. While almost all their equipment is not reparable (which is much, much worse for the environment!).<p>5. And also &quot;accidentally&quot; introducing a $40 wireless charger just as they removed the old charger from the box.<p>Repeat ad nauseam.<p>Which one is more likely?<p>1.
