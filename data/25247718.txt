If you want to host a service the traditional way, you create a virtual host and a reverse proxy to your container (that is on a private network) or a service bound to a local IP. Currently I couldn&#x27;t find a way to automate that. Let&#x27;s say that could be done by a LoadBalancer, that is in fact controlling virtual hosts and reverse proxy entries for the pool of available IP addresses. For hostnames, there would be a pool of domains configured to resolve any host to that one IP.')
