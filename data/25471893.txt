What if you instead targeted Facebook groups for new parents, Youtube videos titled &quot;How to Potty Train&quot;, Instagram posts with relevant hashtags.<p>There is a big lie that Facebook and Google keep selling people. Advertisements do not need to be targeted at individuals, they need to be targeted to content. You don&#x27;t need to advertise to 20-30 y&#x2F;o female college graduates. You just need to target content that new parents would look for.')
