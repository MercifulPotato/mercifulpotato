I&#x27;m not convinced settings for kids books really tell us more about urban planning than they tell us about the the problem with not enough political situations being solved by encounters with handsome princes these days. And I&#x27;m pretty sure that <i>well established story tropes predate suburbanism and republicanism</i> is more of a factor in the popularity of certain types of fantastical settings than magic kingdoms full of trolls being more <i>walkable</i> than the cul-de-sacs kids often grow up in.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that the author acknowledges that there are in fact numerous kids&#x27; books set in suburbs, he just doesn&#x27;t like them very much. :D')
