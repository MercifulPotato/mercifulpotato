I think some people just enjoy running or lifting more.<p>I used to run regularly but I never looked forward to it. Even with goals like 5Ks or half marathons, I didn&#x27;t enjoy the experience of improvement. I had to drag myself out of the house to do it.<p>I look forward to and enjoy lifting weights (deadlifts, front&#x2F;back squats, presses, cleans, snatches). I enjoy the idea of being able to lift something that I wasn&#x27;t able to lift a year ago or even a month ago. And, even if I added just 2.5 lbs to my personal record, it is such an accomplishment in my head. I don&#x27;t drag myself out of the house for lifting. I cancel plans to ensure that I can lift.<p>Maybe it is the difficulty in tracking improvement. I find it hard to track how much I improved in running. To me, it isn&#x27;t discreet improvements over time because so much can happen during a running session (traffic, lights, people) which can vary results. Whereas lifting, it is usually in a more controlled environment and you add discreet number of lbs&#x2F;kg to the bar.')
