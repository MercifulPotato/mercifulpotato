Still &quot;free&quot; for iOS&#x2F;macOS users (paid for as part of hardware purchase), $6&#x2F;year for Android users (or whatever infrastructure with some margin costs). I mean, I have no idea exactly what uptake would be like versus &quot;free&quot; (paid for with your data). But given increasing awareness of the issue, and network effects from existing iOS&#x2F;macOS userbase, it&#x27;d be a significant option. And there are billions of Android devices, even at Apple&#x27;s scale potentially billions of dollars are year for minimal effort isn&#x27;t nothing.<p>I mean, I find this objection (which seems to come up multiple times, every single time iMessage-on-Android comes up) to be just so weird. Like it&#x27;s some huge mystery how anyone could possibly make money from a software service. You can make money from a software service by... charging money for said service. And as something that&#x27;s purely network-based, even the normal concerns about piracy and the like on Android are irrelevant. Apple can see if it&#x27;s a paying account and what devices it&#x27;s being used on server-side.')
