Your assessment is incorrect.<p>Shopify main app is a giant Rails monolith. They also have several hundred other apps as well (eg, App Store, partners, burst).<p>Shopify has done a good job on defining clear interface boundaries between various parts of the monolith, which makes changes more compartmentalized. As well, they’ve invested significantly in developer tooling to make developers more efficient. It’s not perfect and there’s always more to do, but ask any Shopify developer about the magic of ‘dev up’ or about ShipIt.<p>I’m not quite sure how or why you extrapolate that having a large monolith immediately equates to having a culture cantered around low productivity. Perhaps you’re projecting from your own experience?')
