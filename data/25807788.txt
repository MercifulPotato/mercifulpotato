Chemist can use various techniques to analyse a sample and tell what is its composition. After that they search for it in the literature and if they find that the given chemical was not described previously then it is novel. That’s it.<p>&gt; I don’t get it, how would you even discover a pigment?<p>The article answers this. “ Chemist Mas Subramanian and his team serendipitously came upon it while conducting experiments with rare earth elements as part of their work with semiconductors.”<p>That is to say they were experimenting and something turned out as blue.
