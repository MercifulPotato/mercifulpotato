Thats what I thought about one of my previous open source projects. I was a naive highschool kid back then I thought open source is great. Let anyone use it. Yay! The one fine day someone raised a PR (this was back in 2012 when CI was not very common). It looked OK and I merged it. The following weeks had me battling issues with people using the library. Eventually I abandoned the project cause I didn&#x27;t have the time&#x2F;funds&#x2F;motivation to continue working on it and there were better solutions available on the market.')
