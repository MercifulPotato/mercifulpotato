Taken from the real perspective from which the app should have been judged, iSH is not at the boundary at all; instead it&#x27;s the apps that do things like undisclosed A&#x2F;B testing and feature flags to hide things from review. So what happens is developers like us who are actually clearly within the rules as they are meant to be applied get caught in limbo at the whim of reviewers who misunderstand the guidelines because they aren&#x27;t written as they are supposed to be enforced.')
