It is for sure a very deep, shady network of people and entities.<p>At the same time he ran Manwin, he also owned several file hosting websites (some of which I wrote code for) he would directly promote on piracy &amp; porn forums under alias. Most of these were filled with child abuse and his policy was to remove the links but not the files when receiving takedown notices (as he paid out through an affiliate system for promoting these links). He cashed out on most of these when people started digging, but kept hold of some of the torrent trackers he ran.<p>About time people like this are revealed for who they really are. The piracy, not so bad. Turning a blind eye to child abuse, pretty bad.')
