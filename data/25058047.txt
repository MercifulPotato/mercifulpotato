If the inequality is increasing anyways, increase the amount of tax the high earners have to pay, and lower the one for low earners.<p>But if you&#x27;re one of those high earners (that let&#x27;s say works at Deutsche Bank) who sit in an office, you&#x27;re not gonna write a proposal for higher tax for yourself. So instead you focus on those other people, who are &quot;stealing&quot; your salary by not having to go to the office anymore.')
