When Intel shipped on-schedule, they updated regularly. Then Intel stopped hitting their targets by substantial periods, but not always the board – for example, the iMac uses lower TDP parts than high-end desktops so it didn’t matter that Intel had a high-heat chip out which gamers loved because they’d need a complete redesign to cool a part generating multiple times more heat.<p>Your critique is most accurate for the Mac Pro which had a big delay because the system design assumed the 2000s CPU&#x2F;GPU relationship would continue and needed a complete redesign to hit the thermal and expansion characteristics which make sense for the target market.<p>Now, it would be nice if Apple had some different designs which weren’t so dependent on hitting very tight thermal limits – I’d particularly like a Mac non-Mini for those of us who don’t need it to be super thin and would prefer more ports and never throttling – but they’ve found another way to hit those targets with what appears to be no compromises on performance.')
