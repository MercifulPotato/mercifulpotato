Many people have told me, &quot;Oh, don&#x27;t worry, just release it!&quot;<p>I feel grateful that you&#x27;ve not only built the tool and put it out there, but that you took the time to share with me a little of your story and that it sounds like you have also felt the weight of such a decision. I&#x27;m sure other people feel it as well, I just rarely, if ever, have heard someone articulate the saving a life vs taking a life aspects of such technology.<p>Thank you.')
