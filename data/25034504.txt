The most productive person is the person who writes the most code &#x2F; features, but usually the most important people don&#x27;t write code, they help others, whether that&#x27;s understanding problems or giving direction.<p>I still agree with the title, I give my attention to as much as I can handle, and no more. I have (restricted) notifications turned on, I try have interesting things around me, I tackle as many problems as reasonable at the same time, but slowly because I find the best solutions are where I&#x27;ve had a while to think about while in the shower for example, and how they interact with other problems.<p>PS: if you&#x27;re trying to learn something, disregard everything I said, focus is so important when learning')
