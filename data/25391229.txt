Item(by='solidsnack9000', descendants=None, kids=[25391318, 25391784], score=None, time=1607721985, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25391022, text='The laws of war don&#x27;t apply outside of war.<p>The military can&#x27;t use tear gas on the battlefield; military police can use tear gas against rioting soldiers and sailors. Soldiers can&#x27;t use hollow point bullets even in those calibers, like 7.62x51mm, where that is by far the most common type of bullet used by civilians because of its effectiveness in hunting; but police use hollow point bullets all the time, in part because they are more effective against unarmored targets (though less effective against armored ones) and in part because they are much less likely to pass through a wall and strike someone the officer can&#x27;t see.<p>These differences are not due to governments deciding that tear gas is not a chemical weapon or that hollow point bullets are not hollow point bullets, but rather because the laws of war apply in war and not elsewhere.<p>If you were serious about the war crimes thing, you&#x27;d have to acknowledge the Antifa and BLM committed war crimes by not having uniforms and clear insignia and by not distinguishing between civilians and non-civilian property when destroying things during their raids. There is no such thing as a body of law that applies to only one side. Talking about war crimes in this context really is disinformation: it confuses what those laws are about as well as the difference between international and domestic jurisdiction.')
