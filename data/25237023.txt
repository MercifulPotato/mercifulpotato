For the same reason that there are relatively fewer US casualties in any US foreign war (how many US civilian casualties were there in Afghanistan relative to Afghan civilian casualties?). Adding to that is the fact that Hamas hide among the Palestinian citizenry, making collateral damage all the more likely.')
