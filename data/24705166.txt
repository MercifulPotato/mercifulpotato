We would ideally want to work with the real numbers, but no computational model can represent all real numbers (by a trivial cardinality argument).<p>This is a fallacy. The standard model for Computable Real Analysis, Type Two Effectivity, supports computation over all real numbers. See: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Computable_analysis#Real_numbers" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Computable_analysis#Real_numbe...</a><p>Essentially, in TTE, a real number is an arbitrary stream of digits that can come from any source. Therefore any real number can be computed on.<p>Additionally, the ability to decide equality of floating point numbers is an illusion. Rounding errors can make numbers that ought to equal each other not equal each other.')
