By people like this you mean redditors doing internet sleuthing?<p>But redditors doing internet sleuthing could be anyone; from detectives, to judges,  to professional analysts, to trolls, to pr firms, to fraudsters and framers.<p>The evidence they use can be anything from high quality to low&#x2F; fraudulent.<p>And then we have the fact that the alternative official systems also have incentives&#x2F;disincentives and also get things wrong:  imagine writing about police or courts &quot;they once fingered the wrong person for crime X, so don&#x27;t put too much stock in it when it really matters&quot;.<p>if the Wikipedia article is anything to go by,  the Boston bombing case was a bunch of internet people reacting on a rumour of similarity to descriptors&#x2F; images released by the authorities.<p>whereas in this case,  a smart fellow follows a systematic and logical system to come to a reasonable conclusion.<p>I&#x27;d rather tell people to learn to judge evidence and the analytical thought that goes into making the conclusions.<p>Of course,  we mustn&#x27;t entirely discount the possibility that all this is just some PR stunt and this guy is in on it :p But either way, I&#x27;d say the better message is to learn to be skeptical,  think analytically, and judge things on the quality of the evidence and the thought process used to come to the conclusion.<p>&#x2F;soapbox')
