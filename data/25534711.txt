I went through something similar. Parents considered most people I would have called as friends not &quot;good enough&quot; and forbid being around them for better part of my childhood. Now, in my 30s I have a few people from work I occasionally hang out with but no one I consider a friend. Haven&#x27;t much dated either since seems like a chore.<p>I do wish sometimes that I was normal and had an active social life. Being single&#x2F;alone at my age is beginning to look weird.')
