Item(by='WnZ39p0Dgydaz1', descendants=6, kids=[24866000], score=12, time=1603422769, title='Ask HN: Has anyone moved from Kubernetes to Nomad?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='If so, what was your experience?<p>I&#x27;ve been operating a Kubernetes cluster for a while now, and I&#x27;m quite happy with it. It does what I want. However, the complexity cost is quite high. That&#x27;s especially true when developers who without much k8s experience need to interact with a local or staging cluster somehow to debug applications. And of course, the YAML and package management is hell despite (and partly because of) the many templating tools out there.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if Nomad could remove some of that complexity or whether it&#x27;s still early stage and a production setup is just as complex. I&#x27;m also wondering how easy it is to deploy common applications (Postgres, Traefik, Prometheus, etc) on Nomad - easy Helm installations are a big selling point of k8s.')
