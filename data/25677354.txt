One time I tried to buy a car and was having trouble with the payment. I tried to call them and it turns out that their support phone line closes at 3pm PT! How is that acceptable?<p>I&#x27;m glad they&#x27;re shutting down, because it&#x27;ll get me to actually fully switch over to another bank, which I expect to be a lot of effort.')
