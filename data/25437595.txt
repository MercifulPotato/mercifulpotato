Item(by='moron4hire', descendants=None, kids=[25438754, 25438762], score=None, time=1608079787, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25436502, text='This is something that I miss about forums of yore and sort of hate about HN, Reddit, and their ilk: the deprioritization of a post author&#x27;s identity. It took me way too long to figure out you were talking about the username of the person you were replying to. I miss being able to scan through a forum&#x27;s post listing and readily pick out names of posters I recognized after being involved in the site for a while. It was an additional signal of post quality (or lack thereof, depending on the user). Here, the username is hidden in a sentence of status text, on the same visual level of the number of minutes ago the post was made, all of which is rendered in a light grey font. It&#x27;s clearly intentional, and I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out why the forum owners don&#x27;t want users to be able to build a consistent identity.')
