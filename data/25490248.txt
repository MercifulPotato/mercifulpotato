(I think Ubuntu AppArmor stopped it dead in its tracks on its own, anyway.)<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;presentation&#x2F;d&#x2F;1yqWy_aE3dQNXAhW8kxMxRqtP7qMHaIfMzUDpEqFneos&#x2F;edit#slide=id.g22371f2702_0_108" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.google.com&#x2F;presentation&#x2F;d&#x2F;1yqWy_aE3dQNXAhW8kxMx...</a>')
