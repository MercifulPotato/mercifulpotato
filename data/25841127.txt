I&#x27;ve literally seen it claimed that mispronouncing someone&#x27;s name is violence.<p>We don&#x27;t have to pay attention to these people.  If you&#x27;re offended by someone&#x27;s speech, justt close your browser or app.   It isn&#x27;t as though aren&#x27;t a billion other webpages or tweets one can look at, and modern apps have block&#x2F;mute buttons - use them.<p>Instead of demanding someone else&#x27;s speech be abrogated, consider just being an adult.  And possibly reflect on how you came to be so fragile.')
