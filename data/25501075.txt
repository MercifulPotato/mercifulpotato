However this wake word detection is sloppy and turns on more often than it should. It&#x27;s filtered out on the cloud service side, but it creates a situation where extremely private moments are uploaded. For end users this means that you can&#x27;t be certain when it&#x27;s recording vs when it isn&#x27;t....<p>IDK how it&#x27;s implemented in cars, but the STT features I&#x27;ve seen require the explicit press of a button and IIRC it&#x27;s inferenced locally on the car&#x27;s hardware. Which is possible thanks to the car&#x27;s high energy usage and price. But it might depend on implementation and it might send telemetry back to the manufacturer.')
