Too much risk to reveal something just from the tools or devices present. The viewers would analyze every pixel visible and itâ€™s too much effort to clean up a real lab of what secrets it could reveal and a lot easier to build a real-looking lab out of things you can safely display.<p>Not sure if such a lab would be even open to all employees at Apple from what I hear.')
