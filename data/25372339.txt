Rhetoric against rich people is rather popular.<p>But yes, from an even further left point of view, full on abolishing of markets ain&#x27;t that popular.  (A few countries tried going in that direction throughout history, it never ended well.)<p>In the US the Republicans are against free trade, and the Democrats have their usually anti market stance.<p>About stuff since 2007: the economic difficulties in the years after mostly showed that when central banks refuse to print enough money, nominal spending drops, and the economy tanks.  (The Israeli and Australian central banks kept their countries&#x27; nominal GDP stable, and mostly avoided recession.)  But you are right that the perception in the mainstream does not agree with that perspective (as I mentioned, the mainstream is by-and-large anti-market.)')
