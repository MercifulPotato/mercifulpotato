I have talent to write really bad code in any language and make code as slow as I want. I can write code in ruby that would outperform code in C. The benchmarks like this don’t give you full picture of language possibilities. On top of everything we also need account for compilers and compiler optimization.\nNothing against rust. I write ton of code using rust, and advocating at my work. But this looks like a PR move to me.')
