Out of the box, <i>brand new</i>, they overheat already. HP software is absolute trash.<p>I literally use drivers from Lenovo because the ones HP provides are like 5 years old and they don&#x27;t plan on updating them.<p>Updating the BIOS is like playing Russian roulette, they seem to introduce more bugs than they fix.<p>But the hardware itself is nice, I&#x27;ve been using HP workstations for more than a decade. Quality has gone down somewhat (less metal, more plastic, less durable compared to early Elitebooks imo), but they&#x27;re still nice machines.')
