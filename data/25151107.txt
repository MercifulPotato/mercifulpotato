Nobody downloads music files anymore. Everyone streams...<p>That&#x27;s a sweeping generalization...\n  I like owning my music and not being in danger of losing it at the whim of a company or a country. The only danger to me right now is my library and its redundancies crashing.<p>If someone decides not to renew a contract, becomes too expensive for the service, moves to a country the service may not interact with, or decides to move to another service, I won&#x27;t lose anything.<p>If I choose to switch services, I won&#x27;t lose half my library.<p>I can get own music from obscure places or times services don&#x27;t service or consider. I bet you most services don&#x27;t have a lot of African music, no matter the decade. It doesn&#x27;t even have to be obscure, there are great mixtapes from the 90s and 00s that just aren&#x27;t on online services.')
