And I agree that it&#x27;s a very valuable tool. (Regulation is a very valuable tool as well. Which one works better depends on the particular situation, e.g. regulation is superior when levying the tax is difficult in the real world.)<p>Also, many people will argue that if a market is subject to such taxes, then it is no longer a free market. Perhaps you&#x27;re not one of them and would consider such people misguided ideologues (we&#x27;d agree on that). However, the existence of such participants in the discussion needs to be acknowledged, and it very quickly feels like you&#x27;re pointless talking about semantics.')
