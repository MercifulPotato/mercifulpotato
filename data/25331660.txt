It is nothing new.<p>That&#x27;s not really how knowledge spreads. Otherwise we wouldn&#x27;t have so many problems with fakenews and conspiracy bullshit.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think, and did not say, the article is bad. Just that it is nothing new.<p>Why does it matter whether it&#x27;s new or old? I don&#x27;t know much about vice.com, but it does not make the impression of a bleeding edge news-source, but just regular journalism. And with regular journalism it&#x27;s common to take up old topics to bring back awarness or illustrate whether things have changed in the meanwhile.<p>I mean even here on hacker<i>news</i> most heated discussions are also around year old articles and topics, not just the daily fresh meat.')
