You’re correct that they try to have a left-leaning approach (densification) based on right-leaning principles (fiscal responsibility). But I haven’t seen them “asking for a big pile of federal dollars.” They seem so be saying that the pile of federal dollars that the towns and cities are already getting should be spent more responsibly, ie on projects that can be sustained by the tax value they create.')
