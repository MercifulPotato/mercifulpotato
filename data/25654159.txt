I started hacking on the TRS-80 when I was 6 and IBM PC BASIC a couple of years later. Mainly because it was “just there” when you turned the computer on.<p>When my kid was 6 he had no attention span or desire to learn so I didn’t push it. Now he’s 9 and is asking questions.<p>I found that the best way to engage him is the old DOS game ZZT. It has a simple but complete OO language. And since you’re programming sprites, the notion of what an object is makes sense.<p>I taught myself OO with ZZT and I’m hopeful that it’ll click with him too.<p>Plus, it runs on the beat up laptop I let him use.')
