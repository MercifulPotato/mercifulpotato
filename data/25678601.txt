In StarCraft the portrait of your selected unit was a movie file (RAD smacker, I think? But I don&#x27;t have a copy of starcraft lying around to double check).<p>Supergiant Games&#x27; titles since Bastion all use RAD&#x27;s Bink codec to store offline renders of their character models (as movies) instead of traditional sprite sheets or realtime rendered 3d models, so they&#x27;re playing back dozens of movies at all times.<p>As another reply mentioned, it&#x27;s also standard at this point for loading screens to be movies.')
