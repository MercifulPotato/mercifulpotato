They allow centralization of vote counting, they are opaque mechanism and single point of failure which by themselves can cast doubt on the whole process.<p>The entire premise of democratic elections is that the government proves to the little citizen its supported by other citizens. A process which involves the government telling the little citizen the little citizen didn&#x27;t provide evidence of widespread fraud isn&#x27;t democratic, how can the little citizen hope to prove to the almighty government anything?<p>I&#x27;m sickened by the thought the same sham notion of elections can reach my country with the support of Facebook and Twitter.')
