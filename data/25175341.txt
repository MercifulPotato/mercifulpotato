The most simple examples I can think of are DNS and  Wikipedia.<p>User A makes a single request to download bulk DNS data or Wikipedia content, then makes it available on her loopback or local network.<p>User B makes a series of DNS queries for specific RR&#x27;s or HTTP requests for specific Wikipedia pages.<p>How do the behavioural fingerprints of User A and User B compare?<p>Trackers generally cannot see the individual DNS queries or HTTP requests for Wikipedia pages that User A makes over her loopback or to addresses on her local network.  However all of User B&#x27;s individual DNS queries and HTTP requests, including timings and context, are easily visible to a variety of trackers operating on the internet.')
