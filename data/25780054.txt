He says “we” are marching on the capitol, multiple times; too many to list here even. I include the full transcript for context.<p>If you wanted to cherry pick to show nonviolent intent, there is a much better passage than the one you picked (which I read as disavowing niceness, he is clearly implying that they are too nice and that’s why they are in this bind!)<p>He explicitly says “peacefully” when describing the marching at one point:\n“I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.”<p>However, if I tell someone that their country is under attack, that they have been too nice about it and have to show strength, and then say to march peacefully and patriotically, does the peaceful adjective whitewash the rest of the incendiary speech? Does it change that he falsely claimed electoral victory and called on his supporters to reclaim it in a show of “strength”? I would argue no, but it’s certain to be the key passage in his defense.')
