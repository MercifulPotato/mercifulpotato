I don&#x27;t have a great sense of where to draw the line, but somehow I feel the Julia convention crosses it.<p>I&#x27;m definitely not accustomed to this, and absolutely hate this behavior. Very frequently installing a dependent package or compiling one via one of these package managers is frequently a good way to build it badly, without respecting compiler flags, ignoring system paths, and so on. It&#x27;s also <i>hard</i> to customize or force the usage of a shared system library which has been built for the purpose.<p>Ask the package managers of any linux distro how annoying is to handle unbundling in these scenarios.<p>pip too.')
