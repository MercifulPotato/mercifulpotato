The previous federal law allows for opening between 6 until 20 on monday to saturday.<p>Since 2006 the states can overwrite this law locally and most did. But they are only allowed to open on at max 4 sundays each year. Many allow 0-24 but it&#x27;s culturally barely used. Out of the shops i lived closed to only one even opened from 7 till 24, which was right next to the biggest student housing.<p>Besides that, there are additional costs for employees after midnight, so it is not very attractive to open for the stores at those times.<p>This is vastly different in industrial production factories where shifts covering the full day are much more common.<p>For opening hours see: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Laden%C3%B6ffnungszeit#Regelungen_in_den_Bundesl%C3%A4ndern" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Laden%C3%B6ffnungszeit#Regelun...</a>')
