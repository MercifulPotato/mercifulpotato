But it sounds like you&#x27;re against the automated phone app thing?<p>Well, I am too.  My phone isn&#x27;t capable of running any of the apps anyway, so it&#x27;s kind of moot in my case.<p>Regarding lockdown, in my state (Victoria, Australia) we&#x27;re just now starting to loosen our lock down rules after a sustained (multi-month) period of lock down.<p>For us, it <i>worked</i>.  We&#x27;ve just had our 14th day of 0 new coronavirus cases in a row, and they shouldn&#x27;t be returning. :)<p>That was after starting into a J-curve of increasing coronavirus cases, hitting 700+ per day before the lock down started taking effect.<p>So, lockdowns + masks work.  And if we hadn&#x27;t gone down that path, we&#x27;d be heading to a dark place about now (like the US) and our economy would probably end up turning to shit. o_O<p>That being said, the lock down sucked.<p>We also had a curfew (8pm - 5am), to help manage it. Not being able to go out except for exercise or to buy food gets to a person after a few weeks. :(')
