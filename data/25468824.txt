Item(by='fossuser', descendants=None, kids=[25470203], score=None, time=1608309755, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25465865, text='I think you’re wrong, but I also understand your skepticism at first look (I asked similar questions).<p>The reason for a small cost associated with permanent user IDs (planets) is to combat spam and encourage reputation building without requiring real names if users don’t want to.<p>It’s a clever approach to this issue. One reason for the incentive to centralize on the existing net is to combat spam (since its zero cost to spin up millions of accounts to spam with, you need clever anti-spam which tends to cause centralized services to form).<p>The nodes higher up just route traffic, they don’t own any user data or do anything else. Users can “escape” to any of them for a provider so the “stars” (infrastructure nodes basically) are incentivized to provide good routing service for users in order to keep them.<p>The top of the hierarchy “galaxies” are basically governance nodes that allow changes to network policy based on a vote. If they became a problem stars could push back or jump off the network.<p>If you start with trying to come up with an incentive based design for a new network model that empowers users, but can actually work I think you start to see why these ideas are interesting.<p>On the existing net a lot of this stuff exists in an arguably worse form with less clarity (people route traffic, they also sell your traffic information, you have little control or choice over it).<p>The existing net also incentivizes centralized applications that collect user data. p2p open protocols don’t solve a lot of these issues around spam or basic usability (they’re DOA if a regular user has to run their own server).<p>Urbit’s design allows network updates to automatically get picked up across the entire network. Users control and own all of their data. It’s p2p by default and that complexity is invisible to users. It’s backwards compatible, runs on unix in a vm, but could run on its own custom hardware in the future.<p>It could allow people to have their own computing environment where they can send things like photos directly to others without a middleman like FB. The design means that software that runs now should run in ten years.<p>I think there’s a lot of potential, the tech is real (not vaporware), it’s open source, and you can play with it&#x2F;talk to the community of people on it.<p>I have no idea if it’ll achieve what they’re trying to do, but if anything were to succeed in this space I think it’d have to be something like Urbit.<p>---<p>Re: The first article you linked, I find CY&#x27;s politics&#x2F;writing (from what I&#x27;ve read) to be contrarian and <i>wrong</i> in a similar to way to Peter Thiel&#x27;s politics. That said, most people hold inconsistent views and people that think independently can be very wrong in one area and very correct in a different area (and people generally are wildly inconsistent in their views&#x2F;accuracy about everything). Thiel is often contrarian and right about investing and building technology companies even though (I think) he&#x27;s contrarian and wrong about politics.<p>While it can be useful to keep someone&#x27;s political beliefs in mind when evaluating something just to be aware of potential motivated reasoning, I don&#x27;t think that should allow you to dismiss everything else out of hand. Someone can hold both really good ideas and really bad ideas at the same time - similarly someone can hold true and false beliefs simultaneously.<p>When it comes to the author&#x27;s example (Thiel and Palantir) - I find their framing to be misleading. If they&#x27;re applying this kind of over-simplified analysis there then I expect they&#x27;re applying it elsewhere. Their essay is mostly an example of their own cognitive bias - they already have a position and they are cherry picking evidence to support it. The reality is more complex and nuanced than what they suggest.')
