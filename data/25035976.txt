A flagship iPhone costs $1000+. I would consider the Pixel 4a to be a &quot;bit cheaper high end Android phone&quot;. You can buy a stack of 3 Pixel 4a phones for $1050. Are you confident 1 iPhone can outlast 3 Pixels? If you go to mid range Android you can get stacks of 4-6 phones. You could get 4 Moto G Power for $1000. My $250 Nexus 5X has lasted me 4+ years now, so a stack of 4 of them could last me 16+ years before hardware failure. In reality though, Android&#x2F;app updates make my phone more and more sluggish over time and so I&#x27;m forced to upgrade every ~3 years to get a snappy experience again.')
