And weirdly, when folks don&#x27;t know, sometimes the placebo gives them reaction. Pretty much, side effects have to happen more often in the real thing than they do a placebo.<p>Sometimes it just doesn&#x27;t work to have double blind: LSD trials, for example, make things pretty obvious. It isn&#x27;t the case for the flue, though.<p>You are correct on the trials: most folks don&#x27;t get called. That said, living outside the city doesn&#x27;t exclude you from trials in general because they generally need participants with x and&#x2F;or y.
