Item(by='CogitoCogito', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603793058, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24904043, text='&quot;Right to repair&quot; isn&#x27;t really a universally fixed idea in its details, but one interpretation could be that a company needs to provide access to spare parts and documents to support repair by unaffiliated 3rd parties. That would not necessarily mean that the company would need to make their devices easily repairable (by for example making batteries replaceable), but instead require the companies to support unaffiliated 3rd parties in their repairing endeavors similarly to how they would do it internally. In a scheme like this, there would be nothing standing in the way of continuing to make thin devices.<p>That said, I do personally wish there were some sort of &quot;minimum repairability&quot; that would potentially put limits on how thin something can be if that made repair much more difficult, but that&#x27;s a bit of a side-issue to &quot;right to repair&quot; for me.')
