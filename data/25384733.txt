Censorship would just be a patch, and not even enough for the problems Facebook and other social media is creating. The issue is that Facebook has completely changed the incentives for what type of speech gets the most exposure. Now the contents of the speech do not matter, nor the source, nor whether it is true or useful or anything. Instead the metric is how much &quot;engagement&quot; it can create. Facebook will, by design, show on your timeline a lie that creates comments before a truth that doesn&#x27;t. And it will do this time and time again, and the effect of the repeated exposures to lies is that even if you don&#x27;t believe them, you will start doubting.<p>Society can&#x27;t keep up with that. It isn&#x27;t just that there are people with polarized opinions, it&#x27;s that you have people with completely different views of reality. Propping up lies is incredibly easy, and doing the necessary research to disprove those lies and spread the result is orders of magnitude more difficult. It&#x27;s impossible to keep up the rhythm.<p>The solution is not censorship, the solution is to force these companies to change those incentives. Stop with the automatic suggestions to get more engagement, stop showing content to people who didn&#x27;t explicitly subscribe to it, stop the uncontrolled spread of content of any type. We can live without viral memes, we can&#x27;t without a functioning society.')
