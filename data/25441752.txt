In an ideal situation, Visa and MC would decide that their reputation was at risk, cut off PornHub, and then PornHub would switch to a competing payment network.  But because of the high bar to entry (regulations which Visa and MC lobbied for <i>after</i> they gained their dominant position), it is almost impossible to start a new credit card company today.  All the startups like Stripe and Privacy sit on a different layer from Visa and MC. Cards from your bank are just Visa and MC with different artwork. Nobody has created a new credit card company in decades.<p>We can let Visa and MC have their freedom of association or we can let them have their protected position in the market, but we can’t have both.  It’s not working.  But because this case is all “somebody think of the children” then people are letting them get away with it.<p>What about the other instances that the EFF linked to where a porn site wasn’t doing anything illegal?  Are you going to have any options when it’s your (healthy and legal, but maybe niche) kink under attack?  What about when it’s not even porn, but Visa and MC decide that Discord is used to enable piracy, and cuts off payments?  Are you going to support these actions when a popular chat app with many legitimate users is the one affected?')
