Basically you now use the same cookie &quot;_octo&quot; both for session management and first part tracking:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;github&#x2F;site-policy&#x2F;pull&#x2F;336&#x2F;files#diff-8bae97bce5e2ee82f1411f462ede21a9964f4770dc1c905b1956d125a47db277R71" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;github&#x2F;site-policy&#x2F;pull&#x2F;336&#x2F;files#diff-8b...</a><p>EU guidelines require that you offer granularity of choice for different “processing purposes”.\nSee in this &quot;Guidelines on consent under Regulation 2016&#x2F;679&quot;\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edpb.europa.eu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;edpb&#x2F;files&#x2F;files&#x2F;file1&#x2F;edpb_guidelines_202005_consent_en.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edpb.europa.eu&#x2F;sites&#x2F;edpb&#x2F;files&#x2F;files&#x2F;file1&#x2F;edpb_gui...</a><p>In section &quot;3.1.3 Granularity&quot; paragraph #44. \n&quot;If the controller has conflated several purposes for processing and has not attempted to seek separate consent for each purpose, there is a lack of freedom.
