I fundamentally oppose secrecy for those in power. We are not afforded such privilege as citizens. There are existing laws, that would severely punish anyone harassing a judge. But a judge is part of the community. Judges need to be accountable to the communities they rule in. If they do something that would result in a violent mob showing up at their house.  \nLike for example, overturn an election unjustly.  Then we are already down the path of severe political instability. \nThe machinery of the state is set up to protect judges. If judges are being tracked down and killed in large numbers. Then its a sure sign that the state is failing too. In such a case, I would rather that the state fail quickly.<p>Having secret judges, secret tribunals, or anonymous judges, would only make oppression easier. This is what dictatorships do.<p>And your logic would equally fit any politician, as most have received death threats. And some have been harassed at their homes.')
