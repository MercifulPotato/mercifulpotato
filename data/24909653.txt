This is nothing new.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the fixation of catching people in an alleged lie..  What&#x27;s the difference whether they genuinely underestimated the time required to do something _they&#x27;ve never done before_ (testing on so many platforms) or whether they actually, completely unreasonably, decided to lie to everyone about having gone gold?<p>Not to mention that if they hadn&#x27;t actually gone gold, there are tons of outside parties who would probably have realized it pretty quickly (given the production work that happens), and we&#x27;d all have found out anyways.')
