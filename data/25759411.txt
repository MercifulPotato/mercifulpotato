Critical even.<p>But it certainly does not extend to my lounge room, Your right to freedom of speech does not mean you get to act like a troll or jerk in my house, or to expect to be able to behave in ways you think I should &quot;just scroll past&quot;. You will be asked to &quot;be nice&quot;, and asked to leave if you choose not to (and ejected of you continue and refuse to leave). Your &quot;rights as a troll&quot; do not superseded my comfort in my home.<p>Your (assuming you&#x27;re in the US) &quot;Freedom Of Speech 1st Amendment&quot; rights mean your government may not pass laws to inhibit your free expression. It does not mean your choice to freely express yourself will be free of consequences (as the well known &quot;yelling &#x27;Fire!&quot; in a theatre&quot; example illustrates), nor does it mean that owners&#x2F;managers of private spaces are required to put up with your free speech in their venues.<p>Whether an internet forum is closer to a private home or Speaker&#x27;s Corner in a public park is a good question. But claiming the forum regulars and owners should &quot;Just ignore the stupid trolls and go on with your life.&quot; is not the only possible answer to that.')
