There are a ton of <i>law school graduates</i>, but not enough <i>lawyers</i>. Between the two, there is a gating function of bar associations, getting hired at a law firm, etc. If that gate is too small, then you get the effect you observe where there are too many &quot;lawyers&quot; (graduates) looking for work while simultaneously not enough &quot;lawyers&quot; (working lawyers) available  to drive down prices.<p>Sometimes these artificial gates are good things. They can protect consumers from low-quality products whose quality is very hard to evaluate. The market you use to &quot;buy&quot; a lawyer is not efficient: lawyers are no commoditized and you don&#x27;t buy them frequently enough to have a good skill at evaluating them. An artificial gate like a professional association can help ensure consumers get access to a quality product, and that shitty products are prevented from entering the market and driving down the reputation of all producers.')
