In the present discussion, I assumed the context to be about CFGs instead of REs because that is most often what people are referring to when we talk about parsers in programming languages, though I admit that I could have been more explicit about this.<p>What you linked is an improvement of the Brzozowski derivative, but it does not constitute a parser for CFGs.')
