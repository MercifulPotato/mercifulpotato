Mixing men and women in the workplace has been a recipe for disaster time and time again. I&#x27;m not excusing the behavior of men who do engage in those actions, but it&#x27;s almost an expected outcome. We see this across the board, from desk jobs, to labor intensive work like construction or even the military.<p>Agreed that people look to those at the top of the society. In a hyper capitalistic world we live in today, the vast majority of those people are the ultra wealthy, who happen to almost all be men. Many of those men fought their way up, rightly or wrongly. Feminists and SWJ&#x27;s want to push women into that same space, claiming that men and women are the same, yet they don&#x27;t see the contradiction of having to hand hold those women in order for them to be able to compete there in the first place. They&#x27;re implicitly admitting that men and women are different, but they can&#x27;t deal with the cognitive dissonance.')
