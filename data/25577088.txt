From that I can only conclude that people want to get as close to the experience of perfoming the prevented act as possible.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a natural conclusion. Video games are a form of entertainment (or art). They are pretty young. There&#x27;s usually a period where an art form gets super into &quot;realism&quot; because it&#x27;s still a challenge and a way to communicate &quot;high production values&quot;.<p>Then pretty good realism becomes cheap and widely available - and the art form pivots to more expressive works that go beyond chasing &quot;realism&quot;. So why are high budget games trying to get more photorealistic? Because it&#x27;s currently an effective way to communicate &quot;high quality work of entertainment, worth at least 60 bucks&quot;. It has little to do with the actual entertainment value.')
