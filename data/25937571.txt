I also check TheDonald.win (now Patriots.win) on a regular basis. Both are constantly accused of racism and&#x2F;or white supremacy and yet I see none of either.<p>People use terms like &#x27;racist&#x27;, &#x27;nazi&#x27;, &#x27;fascist&#x27; and many others as synonyms for &quot;any person or thing I don&#x27;t like or disagree with&quot;. It&#x27;s also the media&#x27;s favorite new strategy for discrediting sources that contradict their chosen narrative.')
