I have older siblings with kids of their own, and I&#x27;m on the younger side of the extended family, so I was around a lot of kids regardless, watching the different dynamics.<p>I was conceptually well aware of the hard work it involved, the priorities needed etc, and to the best of my abilities set my own bar for that.<p>We had our first kid a few years into our 30s, very much by choice. I think it&#x27;s very difficult to conceptualize it through others kids. I was never really good with kids in general, but I believe (and have no reason not to) that I&#x27;m very good with my kids (in general, there will always be bad days behind the photo ops).<p>I can&#x27;t shut myself in my office for 8 hours doing a project, gaming, watching movies or just nap.<p>I obviously miss that on some level, but the reason I can&#x27;t do that (at least until they&#x27;re old enough not to want to hang out with me) is of such value that I don&#x27;t mind really. And that part is something at least I had no way of conceptualizing before having kids.<p>Absolutely don&#x27;t have kids if you don&#x27;t want to. I like to imagine I have a finely tuned radar to spot those families instantly, and it&#x27;s not about a love thing, because I think most parents do regardless, but about patience&#x2F;acceptance that this was your choice, and all of the great parts make up for it thousandfold.<p>I&#x27;m not a different person now, I&#x27;m just a person with baggier eyes, who frets a little less about things that don&#x27;t really matter. That can be done with or without kids, I think it&#x27;s merely that the latter forces the issue.<p>But I still binged Queen&#x27;s Gambit with our youngest using me as a glorified crib.<p>Not sure this rant had a point, but try to shut out friends, society, biology and just ask yourself whether you want kids. If you do it&#x27;ll be great, and if not that&#x27;ll be great too.')
