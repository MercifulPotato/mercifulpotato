It was a shit show from start to finish. There is so much mismatch between Intel&#x27;s strengths and what the industry demands that I don&#x27;t see Intel being successful in this domain if they make another attempt. Things would be worse now than in that attempt, as Intel has suffered significant brain-drain since then.<p>[two cancelled programs]:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;10288&#x2F;intel-broxton-sofia-smartphone-socs-cancelled" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;10288&#x2F;intel-broxton-sofia-sma...</a>')
