Now, what I want next is for ActiveX to be just as dead. Not ignored, but pro-actively support for it on all browsers to be dead as well.<p>Why Flash is dead but ActiveX is still supported? It&#x27;s a bigger risk than Flash from security point of view. I can, if I want, write a malware in ActiveX and feed it to visitors on my site if I see they have Windows as OS.<p>Now kill ActiveX just the same. My pet peeve!')
