The only reasonably priced building is via DIY kits, but it still end up expensive and even more so time consuming, so it suits those who like soldering more than making music. I&#x27;m excited for a few digital eurorack modules, like Erica Synths Black Wavetable VCO, but no one could argue that it&#x27;s affordable for a hobbyist.')
