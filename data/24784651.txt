You said you hated &quot;fan noise and excessive heat&quot;, not &quot;spending money&quot;. I&#x27;m just pointing out that this isn&#x27;t a reason to avoid a fast, x86_64 computer.<p>That said, I&#x27;m sure there are many modern laptops for a fraction of the price of a T480 which will do the job just as well, and a lot better than a Pi4. What is &quot;minspec&quot; anyway? You have to draw a line somewhere. Should I expect to run a modern DE on my smartphone from 2011? How about my desktop from 2005?<p><i>That</i> said, by the spec sheet, those machines should be easily capable of running Plasma. If you&#x27;re having problems, perhaps it&#x27;s not Plasma&#x27;s fault, but something to do with the blobby GPU driver stack?')
