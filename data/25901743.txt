Wanting to keep a liberal policy in place obviously isn&#x27;t conservative. Seems obvious, but point is, we can&#x27;t work backwards and say that if someone wants to keep something the same, that thing must be conservative.<p>Of course, this assumes that we&#x27;re talking about the usual political definitions of &quot;conservative&quot; vs &quot;liberal&quot;, which more or less correspond to &quot;right&quot; and &quot;left&quot;. If we&#x27;re talking about &quot;conservative&quot; meaning &quot;wants to status quo&quot;, then it gets really useless because the alternative is &quot;wants to keep changing things&quot;, which isn&#x27;t a political archetype that exists in reality.')
