Yes, it may be a little harder for you as a female founder. But it&#x27;s not going to be so much harder that it will make the difference between success and failure. Startups at least have this advantage over the corporate world: they are already so hard that the additional difficulty imposed by being a woman is rounding error in comparison.<p>As a female founder of a YC startup (bottomless.com, YC W19), I totally resonate with this. While it is true that being a female in tech can be difficult, those difficulties don&#x27;t even compare to how hard it is to get and sustain traction in a startup.')
