(The spammer will hope that you&#x27;ve re-used passwords so that the password in the leaked database is also one that you used on an important site. If so, this is a good reminder to use a password manager and not re-use passwords across sites; if you re-use passwords you can potentially allow someone who compromises a less-secure site to learn passwords that also work on a more-secure site.)<p>It&#x27;s possible that genuine extortion attempts along these lines happen sometimes, but they&#x27;re <i>extremely</i> rare compared to the relatively low-cost&#x2F;low-effort spam version that doesn&#x27;t actually require the spammer to break into anything.')
