Automatically assign a build number to every build for tracking purposes. Assign a semver number to every version you publish in order to give some concise signaling to operations folks and technical consumers about how the version behaves compared to the previous one(s). And, when applicable, assign a more creative version number for marketing purposes. I&#x27;ve always liked year-based numbering schemes for that purpose. It&#x27;s immediately meaningful, and encourages staying up-to-date by giving a reminder that you&#x27;re still on a version that came out 4 years ago.')
