I&#x27;ve seen the company migrate to MS Sharepoint from Box. I&#x27;ve seen them migrate everyone onto a platform called SuccessFactors (still don&#x27;t really know what it does, it&#x27;s for tracking your career progress I think).<p>There&#x27;s work involved. Someone has to write a guide to get users to sign up with the new service (even with SSO linked to your corporate account it&#x27;s not easy for most non-technical people). In the case of Slack, any hooks or bots created for any teams need to be turned off and people need to be informed well in advance of the shift and multiple times. Optional in-person trainings need to be provided. Some employees may have issues with the change (a missing feature in the new software that they rely on) and they need a forum (or even just someone to contact) where they can lay out these issues and get them resolved.<p>But that&#x27;s not that bad honestly. If moving from a platform gives you serious gains in uptime, it&#x27;s not that bad. I think Slack&#x27;s downtime problems are not so bad that most people will move yet, but they may soon get there.')
