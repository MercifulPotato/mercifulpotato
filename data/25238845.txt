I am looking for a new laptop and haven&#x27;t found anything similar to the MacBook Air (I hate the touchbar) for a similar price (the 16GB of RAM model). Anything similar is either a lot more expensive or the  build quality is a lot worse.<p>I travel and move around a lot (not so much now, but I still move around my country and to the office), so portability is very important to me. Another advantage of the MacBook line is that I can carry one Anker dual USB-C charger and charge everything I have.<p>Any recommendation is more than welcomed!')
