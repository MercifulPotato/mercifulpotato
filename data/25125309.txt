(irregardless of whether you are currently working on it or not)<p>I also have a number of opensource projects published. Some of them get picked up by the popular distros, and I know (most of them) are in the same situation so I may be inclined to help them out. However, I have to ponder what goes in the minds of the people who bombard me with &quot;Please add support for my odd usecase no one other than me could possibly want&quot; emails.<p>PS If someone sents you a patch to a 6 year abandoned project which you don&#x27;t even care any longer, just apply it without even trying to check if it builds. Most likely it does.')
