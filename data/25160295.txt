Reddit actually has an OK solution for that which highlights new comments since your last visit(s) but it is only available to moderators or paid users.<p>Another possible solution would be a better notification system - with forums you can typically watch a thread to get notifications for any posts but with Reddit you only get notfications for direct comments to your post&#x2F;comment.')
