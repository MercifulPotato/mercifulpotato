We got to see the rain systems in action--2000+ year old <i>road grading</i> and <i>rain capturing systems</i> (compluvium&#x2F;impluvium&#x2F;subfloor cistern) working as designed.<p>The Romans had water fountains on every block fed by pressure from the aqueduct, and they were all marked with different figures so that you effectively had a street address even if you were illiterate.<p>It was also quite stunning to me that the Romans worked glass, and it was common.  That&#x27;s just amazing to me given the temperatures and skill involved.<p>And, as people noticed, the art of the time was quite good.  These food stalls are decorated with quite workable figures as they had to be--common people weren&#x27;t literate.  And the art in the better houses was <i>actively good</i>.  The artists had working knowledge of their medium, tools and techniques--no crappy flat faces without depth and perspective here.<p>We are clever monkeys in any time.')
