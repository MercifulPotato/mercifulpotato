I agree 99.9% with the examples the author chose (db, k8s -- if you even really need it).<p>But a lot of third party code is rife with gotchas -- often excellent as development scaffolding but risky in deployment.  npm is notorious in this regard.<p>What does &quot;buy&quot; buy you?  1 - hopefully a lot of people are using the code in question so it will have fewer bugs.  2 - hopefully time to deployment<p>But in exchange you may be using a piece of software that might be robust in domain X but not in yours.  You&#x27;re signing on to a piece of code that may be excessively general for you, or inversely make assumptions that shoehorn you down an inconvenient path.<p>And of course now you&#x27;re on someone else&#x27;s config and development timeline.<p>So it&#x27;s a balance like any other.')
