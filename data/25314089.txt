Item(by='tpoacher', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607171810, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25313049, text='To be fair, it depends on your exact definition of manpages, which is not clear from the article.<p>If by &quot;manpages&quot; you mean locally stored documentation which goes beyond the simple usage and available options that you&#x27;d expect from a --help switch, then I completely disagree. I believe locally available documentation in an easily accessible form and compatible with a terminal is a must.<p>If by &quot;manpages&quot; you mean specifically &quot;it needs to be generated via groff or troff or whatever it is that generates a manpage, and is specifically for use with `man`&quot;, then fine, I can see the point. But the rebuttal here wouldn&#x27;t be &quot;because webdocs are better&quot;, and it certainly wouldn&#x27;t be &quot;because you can always bloat your --help switch to dump a mountain of text&quot;. If you have another structured way of delivering local documentation for your project, then so be it (tex does this with texdoc for instance).<p>Having said that, as far as standards go for local documentation with a useful and consistent structure and interface, manpages is definitely #1 and worth considering in your project, and most definitely before &quot;webdocs&quot;.')
