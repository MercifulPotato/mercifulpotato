Item(by='sxv', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604547836, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24993462, text='I tried to listen to this but the basis of their argument is &quot;if one person dies it&#x27;s too many&quot;, which is a knee-jerk reaction that fails to weigh the possible options and outcomes in a thorough manner. Note that the hosts are not specialists in this field and the vibe of the podcast is more comedy than science. I also take issue with your opening: &quot;no competent medical professional ever&quot;, which is doomed to be a faulty generalization, and a name-calling one at that.')
