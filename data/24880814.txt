It leads to formation of resistance forces, kills your soldiers, stops the occupation from progressing.<p>Transportation is free because you took over the railways. Building concentration camps is free because it&#x27;s done by literal slaves who have no choice anyway, and is done with local materials taken from existing housing. It&#x27;s not like Nazis were paying market prices for any of this.<p>Like, I have no idea why were even arguing about this. Go and visit Auschwitz, it&#x27;s all explained in the museum there. Read some books about occupations of Lvov or Warsaw - Nazis very quickly stopped executing people en-masse because it was more trouble than it was worth. You can say you disagree, but that&#x27;s just arguing with facts.')
