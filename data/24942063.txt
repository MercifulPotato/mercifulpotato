I&#x27;ve managed a full recovery, but in the days following the accident, I lost my intuition of time. It&#x27;s difficult to explain: I knew, logically, that I had lunch before I had dinner - and I had memory of doing both - but I couldn&#x27;t &quot;feel&quot; that lunch was before dinner. It&#x27;s pretty hard to explain and it was pretty weird to experience, but this symptom faded away after a couple of days.')
