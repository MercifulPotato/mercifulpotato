I am not a user of Kubeflow, so might be misinterpreting it. But here is my understanding.<p>Requirement:\nUse the notebooks used on laptops in production. Be able to scale as needed. Multi-cloud.<p>Kubeflow:\nKubeflow basically breaks down the notebook into chunks of images, which run as separate pods. These pods are scheduled by Argo workflow - called pipeline. Kubeflow serving enables you to expose the note book as an API. You can schedule different pods w&#x2F; different specs, including GPU.<p>If that meets your need, then you need a simple way to run on laptops - look for miniflow.<p>There is a tool that is translate from notebook to images directly, so your data scientists do not need to write YAML. Look for miniKF + Kale.<p>Hope this helps.')
