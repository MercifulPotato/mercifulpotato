People have been asking for common-sense coordinated and effective measures that we can all rally around (like wearing masks).<p>It’s hard to find persistent daylight between those two things. (For the record, I wear masks outside and in grocery stores, which are the only shops I go to. I find this at least 75% common sense.)<p>When it comes time though to force someone who doesn’t want to do what <i>you</i> find common sense, where’s the impersonal, referenced only to ground truth, line that says that’s ok under force of law, but other similar-appearing things, well <i>those things</i> would be authoritarian, but <i>these things</i> are just common sense we can all rally around? If everyone is already rallying around something, you don’t need any government force of law to make it happen.<p>Apply this to guns, drugs, abortion, climate change, restaurant capacity during COVID, or whatever topic people tend to have their own individual “common sense” about.')
