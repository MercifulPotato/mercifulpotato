The owners have demolished the middle (Nordstrom store #2 is almost completely gone) to make way for the hockey practice facility and several new office buildings, a couple of hotels, and apartments.<p>With, as you might imagine, retail on the bottom and a lot of walking space in the middle.<p>&gt; You canâ€™t throw a stone without hitting a mixed use box!<p>Sure, because developers and individuals have figured out that mixed use, if done OK, means stuff is more accessible.  The problem is that we&#x27;ve only a handful of places where we zone to build mixed use so the spaces are super expensive because developers like to maximize profit.<p>We gotta catch up on housing, though.  The close-in &#x27;burbs are zoning for offices offices offices and not for people to live there.')
