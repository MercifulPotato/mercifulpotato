However, Apple seems to be going in the direction of having many many hardware accelerators builtin to their SoC and integrated into their software ecosystem.<p>There is little evidence that Apple has built anything truly non-standard in the M1 so far, the closest thing they have is the TSO mode, and that&#x27;s not an optimisation since it provides <i>stronger</i> guarantees (and thus lower performances) than normal. That cost happens to be recouped tenfolds when emulating a TSO architecture (aka x86) rather than having to do it in software, but that&#x27;s got nothing to do with ARM workloads.')
