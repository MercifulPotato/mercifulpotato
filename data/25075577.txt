That page crashed <i>every time</i> I tried to read it in Safari; I literally had to use another browser besides Apple&#x27;s in order to take in an Apple product page. And I reported to Apple, they had mildly helpful front line support suggestions for troubleshooting... as if it was my problem, not theirs.)')
