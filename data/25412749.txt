It seems possible that women got elevated scores there (as for example girls are known to get elevated grades in school), as no money is at stake for the judges, but the elevation bonus goes away once real investor money is at stake.<p>Other factors might play into it, too (just as with the gender pay gap, which is not at all what it seems), but it takes more time to parse the paper.<p>In any case, the suggestion to use the results to beat other investors by specializing in women seems sound. If you believe the study, why wouldn&#x27;t you?')
