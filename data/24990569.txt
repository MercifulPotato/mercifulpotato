Specifically when it comes to early childhood trauma it might help to find a therapist trained in EMDR which is a technique that focuses on helping you overcome this behavior that feels natural.<p>Something to note: you may not get along with your first therapist, it&#x27;s honestly very similar to any personal relationship you have, if that&#x27;s the case, it&#x27;s totally fine to let them know it&#x27;s not working out and find someone else. BUT: don&#x27;t make that decision after your first meeting, especially if you&#x27;ve never tried therapy before you&#x27;re gonna find it weird and off putting, if you can power through that and you still find you&#x27;re not gelling with the therapist that&#x27;s when it&#x27;s ok to pull the plug.')
