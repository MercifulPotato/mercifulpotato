But I have a device I&#x27;ve designed that communicates to PC using interrupt transfer at the rate of 250 requests&#x2F;s. I&#x27;ve watched it then over oscilloscope and it is stable like a rock. Sure if you overload PC it might get into trouble but it is a game like application so when the app is ran PC is not doing much else. I recently ported the same thing to Raspberry Pi 4.')
