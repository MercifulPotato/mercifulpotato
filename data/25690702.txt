Just write &#x27;ballots&#x27;. Or write &#x27;ballots that were sealed because the counting stopped, but then re-opened when the counting resumed&#x27;.<p>&gt; You didn&#x27;t read the other sources I linked, which contain sworn statements from two observers, as well as articles published by several news stations stating that observers (and news) were told to go home because they were done for the night.<p>Yes. Thats what the video in the tweet said. Thats basically what I wrote when I described what the video said.<p>&gt; You aren&#x27;t interested in holding a dicussion, just labelling. Typical anti-intellectualism coming from the political party that won the election.<p>The source that you cited contradicted your claim of &#x27;hidden ballots&#x27;. You are a liar.')
