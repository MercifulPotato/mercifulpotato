I&#x27;m getting at the point that distributing those liquid assets across more individuals will lead to an increase in the magnitude, distribution, and frequency of aggregate economic expenditure (i.e. monetary velocity). It&#x27;s tricky because, as you referenced, there are markets for fixed resources which could be negatively impacted if that debt to income ratio gets too large for the majority of market participants. Although I think the trajectory of consumer markets further favors my view point as purchases are transitioning from physical goods to services and digital goods.<p>In that same vein, I believe profit-motivated investment is only reinforced by a greater diffusion of economic expenditure. The diffusion only increases the frequency of opportunity available for firms to enter an arbitrary market.')
