The article started out just describing a single employee abusing their unrevoked access to their previous company&#x27;s systems, but it&#x27;s mind-boggling that executives and huge swaths of the company would openly and actively participate. That sounds more unethical than even the shadiest of the Uber &quot;intelligence gathering&quot; revelations.')
