I spent a lot of time at a very large company that has always had a &quot;WFH if you want&quot; policy. By and large, the highly productive people were doing a hybrid work-from-office 3-4 days a week and WFH 1-2 days a week. In contrast, the people who self-selected into always WFH were almost exclusively slackers who took advantage of the situation to watch Netflix or sit at the pool all day and get nothing done.<p>I know it&#x27;s just an anecdote, but I think it&#x27;s important because this is probably what executives are most worried about. It doesn&#x27;t take very much effort to find people posting on Twitter that they love WFH during COVID because it means they get to sit at the beach all day. I&#x27;ve got people on my own timeline that choose WFH because they see it as a chance to slack off without supervision.<p>A single slacker on a dev team of 5-10 can completely ruin the team&#x27;s output, and (speaking from experience) it&#x27;s <i>really</i> hard to prevent, oversee, or correct a slacker situation remotely. You might say &quot;then fire them if they&#x27;re a slacker&quot;, but once you&#x27;re at the point where you&#x27;re ready to fire them, the damage and lost productivity has already been done.')
