I believe faith is the most central question of life. My best friend who is a scientist is uncomfortable using the word faith to describe his worldview. That is, he will believe the scientific evidence until new evidence comes to light. Whichever word you want to use I believe everyone makes a choice on why we are here and has to live with the not yet known. Will there be life after death? We can&#x27;t all be correct. I hope you make progress on your journey as I find it bizarre that anyone would not care deeply about this matter.')
