Item(by='shannifin', descendants=None, kids=[24940366], score=None, time=1604047491, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24939906, text='True, but if you&#x27;re comfortable saying &quot;I can&#x27;t help you with that&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m not really interested in doing that right now&quot;, doesn&#x27;t seem like it would be much of a problem. At least not if you give something away for free; if the ones asking for help are &quot;customers&quot;, I can see the dealing with distractions feeling more obligatory, but even that seems solvable if you just sell it with the caveat that only minimal support will be provided, or something, and let potential customers take it or leave it.')
