If you fit a model and don&#x27;t explicitly constrain against &quot;un-physical&quot; results like negative correlations, you&#x27;ll end up with them.<p>Constraining against them won&#x27;t improve your models fit (usually by definition), and it doesn&#x27;t always improve robustness (at least for situations near average)-- because they&#x27;re acting to debias the model in ways that you otherwise don&#x27;t have enough degrees of freedom to address.<p>A negative correlation here is also potentially historically supported, in the sense that sometimes DEM&#x2F;GOP candidates are philosophically reversed in some way relevant to the state.  As in, &quot;The only way a GOP would get elected in X is if they had the DEM position on subject Y which would make them lose state Z, who cares as much about that subject as X but in the opposite direction.&quot;<p>Now-- it doesn&#x27;t seem likely case in this election (e.g. Trump is not (currently) a massively pro-choice republican), so it probably shouldn&#x27;t apply here-- but it&#x27;s isn&#x27;t hard for me to imagine how a negative correlation might show up out of the historical data.')
