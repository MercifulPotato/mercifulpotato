Since the initial salary i was hired with was even lower, it has never quite caught up - job hopping might address that.<p>But even so, the average net salary in this country is even lower than that (overall, not for software developers) and i don&#x27;t have kids or a car to take care of, hence others could also have those expenses to consider.<p>Thus, factoring those in, it might indeed take a substantial amount of time to create any savings. For example, i presently have 25kâ‚¬ in my bank account, though it has taken about 4 years to get there.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that people in US or other places also don&#x27;t have similar factors to deal with, like healthcare costs or student loans.')
