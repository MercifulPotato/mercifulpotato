I guess some plans may still have limits.<p>And yep, they charged for calls you received too: You might get 500 minutes of talk time under a given plan, and incoming calls counted against that. I think my first cell phone plan in 2001 was about $50&#x2F;month for 400 minutes, no texting because I couldn&#x27;t afford a phone that supported it or the added cost in the plan.')
