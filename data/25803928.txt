Since big-O notation is about how the complexity grows for large inputs, you can assume the input is arbitrarily large, and you&#x27;ll notice that the complexity is completely determined by the fastest-growing term.<p>You drop the constant because it doesn&#x27;t alter how the complexity grows as the input increases.')
