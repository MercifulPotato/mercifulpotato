I believe the following are all true:<p>- Tesla&#x27;s build quality is quite bad<p>- I hate Elon now because of his nonsensical tweets and trying hard to stay cool and relevant<p>- Tesla&#x27;s false promises on Autopilot and Full Self Driving is a disgrace. They are at-least 20 years away from anything resembling close to L4, but still somehow siphon $8k from buyers with a false promise<p>- Model 3 is the BEST car I have ever driven. It is awesome, and I would recommend anyone in a heartbeat')
