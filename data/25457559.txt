There are lots of strangers who have come to Los Angeles: Pumpkin and Honey Bunny, Butch and Fabienne, Brett and Flock-of-Seagulls, the Gimp, etc. Marsellus is no stranger to Los Angeles, but he is a bit out of his element at the pawnshop. Vincent has returned home after a journey abroad, as has Captain Koons. Jules is at the beginning of a journey and will soon leave Los Angeles...<p>Of course there are &quot;townies&quot; like Marvin, Lance and Jody, the Wolf and Raquel, Kathy Griffin, Maynard and Zed, Esmarelda, etc. who mostly serve as foils to those on journeys, but that&#x27;s perfectly normal. Mia was once a stranger in town, but she liked it enough to stay.')
