I built the 2D map for Calla because I was still in the middle of converting all my VR work from Unity to WebXR. But pretty soon, VR will be possible.<p>Technically, Calla is just the library for driving Jitsi and adding spatialization. You can do whatever graphics you want with it. The graphical elements and the interactions are all up to you to build, separately from the teleconferencing.')
