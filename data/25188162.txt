The more niche (or custom) software is the more resistant it is to porting. There&#x27;s going to be a lot of Wintel based stuff which is a quick and dirty port from Windows with few Mac native elements. The years where Mac was Intel compatible made the platform more attractive to people who worked in a mostly Wintel environment. There is almost no incentive for those who ported software to the Mac because it was easy to now port to ARM.<p>So there are two sides to that: those people are going to hang on to their Intel machines longer and they&#x27;ll want Intel compatibility when they finally buy ARM machines. This is important to Apple because it can shrink the pool of potential customers.')
