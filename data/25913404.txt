Except for a gym membership I can go 24&#x2F;7 down the block (5 min walk) get access to 8 C2 rowers, a bunch of barbells, dumbbells, treadmills and spinning bikes as needed, as well as a sauna and space to train in many different ways with friends. Covid will blow over, blowing 300 bucks on a subscription for such a narrow training gear will just not feel like the right tradeoff.<p>(Former competitive rower here, so YMMV.)<p>Alright, off to the gym. :)')
