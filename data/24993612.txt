But I think some basic automatic systems to at least add the new releases from major labels is needed for such database.</i><p>They don&#x27;t exist. Look at SoundExchange, the US organization that handles music royalties from streaming. They don&#x27;t even have complete records on the releases for which they collect money! You&#x27;re talking about a myriad of Hollywood-accounting companies (if that) that were fired up and dismantled willy-nilly, for decades.<p>Oh, that Japanese label that put out two 45s in 1962...where would that be recorded except in the collections of music fans who own them? That&#x27;s what Discogs is based on. You want those records to be in the database? Buy them and put them in. The fact that you don&#x27;t is what you&#x27;re describing as &quot;limited areas of interest.&quot;')
