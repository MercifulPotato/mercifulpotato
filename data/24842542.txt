They are niche operations that are practically invisible to anyone outside of the industry. I didn&#x27;t say you can&#x27;t buy Linux pre-installed, I said you can&#x27;t go into a big-box store like Best Buy to do so, and that there&#x27;s no significant consumer support infrastructure.<p>There&#x27;s also the strong possibility that at least some of these places won&#x27;t exist anymore at some time over the lifetime of the computer. Purism is only a few years old, with ~ $1million in revenue&#x2F;year. It uses its own flavor of Linux, meaning support options are extremely limited. System76&#x27;s website is itself half-broken, with 500 errors when I attempt to customize a system.<p>You cannot point to niche operations and claim it to be a viable mass-market option. I&#x27;m not saying it isn&#x27;t possible to get there, I&#x27;m saying it doesn&#x27;t exist today, which means it is not an option for mass-market consumers. If tomorrow a million Apple users said &quot;Enough! LittleSnitch is the straw that breaks the camel&#x27;s back!&quot; and decided they wanted to shop for a desktop linux system, the market couldn&#x27;t handle it.<p>Remember, I&#x27;m not saying Linux can&#x27;t be successful on the desktop, I&#x27;m saying that it is not a mass-market option right now for users frustrated with Windows&#x2F;OS X.')
