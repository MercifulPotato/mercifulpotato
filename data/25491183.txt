The problem is there&#x27;s a surplus of these people, most actually aren&#x27;t talented enough to achieve that, and for those who don&#x27;t have a natural market fit with what they do, they&#x27;ll have to compromise their vision.<p>It reminds me of artists getting priced out of a gentrifying urban center. It takes away the character of the neighborhood, but who is to say their art is good, worth fighting for, and that they&#x27;re more deserving of their apartment than someone with enough money to afford the apartment.<p>Basically, I don&#x27;t want to subsidize someone&#x27;s hobby&#x2F;lifestyle. I completely support them doing what they want, I just don&#x27;t want to hear complaints that there&#x27;s no money in it.')
