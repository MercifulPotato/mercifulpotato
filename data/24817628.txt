Storing large amounts of electricity isn&#x27;t trivial, but neither is building a backup powerplant (or really anything at that scale). In my region there are multiple grid level battery storage facilities with batteries from decommissioned electric vehicles and as far as I know they&#x27;re also financed through EEG-money.<p>I haven&#x27;t yet done the research to see how much of that storage we&#x27;ll need, but I&#x27;m crazy enough to claim that <i>of course we can do it</i>. Though, also certainly, that will increase the systemic cost of solar power.<p>But nothing is free and the transition to renewable energy is inevitable and needs to happen as quickly as possible.<p>It seems rather convenient that the average electricity consumption is also lower when the sun doesn&#x27;t shine.')
