A new feature might involve adding a new api in &#x2F;api, and updating the mobile apss in &#x2F;android and &#x2F;ios, as well as the webapp in &#x2F;app. You might also mention the feature in the documentation (&#x2F;docs), as well as the website in &#x2F;www, and so on. All of those changes happen as part of a single merge to master (or whatever branch system you prefer) and are discussed in a single issue. Simplicity is the whole point, so you just assign the whole issue to a milestone and you&#x27;re done.')
