The moral systems by which his characters conduct themselves have been a scaffold for my own when my parents fell short. It&#x27;s writing that exceeds itself past the only sensual, becoming symbolic glories to remember continually as I live. I can&#x27;t praise him enough. It&#x27;s so odd to have as a tension an author of fiction staining me on one half and the Buddha&#x27;s early teachings on the other. It&#x27;s a tension I treasure.<p>I have one criticism of him and it&#x27;s a strong one -- I hate it because it has locked out just about every woman I&#x27;ve introduced to his corpus: his treatment of women. So very many of them: Chenille, the fire nymphs, just about every one Severian sleeps with save for dear Thecla, Chenille-as-Scylla, the prostitutes of Fifth Head, Jahi, Jolenta, Hyacinth, Jesus there must be a legion more I can&#x27;t recall just now... So many of them are vampish, buxom women who are either put on a pedestal or written to be beauteous victims. That&#x27;s not to say strong women don&#x27;t exist in his books: there are a few but it&#x27;s by and large the men who are written as whole people. One woman runs around for a few hundred pages stark naked with a flimsy premise as to why.<p>If readers can repeatedly forgive him for these excesses, his writing can transform the way you see the world and the purpose of living in it. A small excerpt: &quot;We believe that we invent symbols. The truth is that they invent us; we are their creatures, shaped by their hard, defining edges.&quot;')
