They&#x27;re wrong, we won&#x27;t, and we&#x27;ll end up with endemic covid which would kill tens or hundreds of thousands of people each year. What these people are missing is the fact that 40% of the people needing ICU are under 60; and most people in ICU didn&#x27;t need any help with day to day living before they went into hospital. Lots of these people will need help for several months after they leave. A few will need support for years. That means they&#x27;re going to be poorer, and that plunges their family into poverty too. Poverty has huge health implications.<p>This doctor says it better than I can: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;rupert_pearse&#x2F;status&#x2F;1342020644247130113" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;rupert_pearse&#x2F;status&#x2F;1342020644247130113</a>')
