She doesn&#x27;t have a cell phone, only a landline. I would guess many if not most older people are similar. If the replacement service doesn&#x27;t work with landlines then it&#x27;s dead in the water as a replacement and will only function as an additional option. Going to stay that way for a while as (my assumption is) the group 70+ likely have a large population without call phones.<p>Not to mention rural communities without adequate cell service.')
