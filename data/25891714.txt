Over the course of a few years I built my own 3d engine and SDK, using only Java and the OpenGL API. By the time I got to a state where an actual game could be made (sort of a point and click adventure) I fell out of love with games altogether.<p>If you want to actually make a game, use something like Godot, Unreal or Unity. If you want to do all the ”fun parts” of designing a rendering pipeline, implementing shaders, inventing a scripting language but not actually make anything, roll your own engine..')
