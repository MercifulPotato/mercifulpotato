I got into this game specifically because of the ability to work flexible, remote, and part time hours. Does it limit who I can work for? Sure. Has it mattered? Not really. 16 years in I&#x27;m earning a very comfortable middle class income working 24h per week, and the most I ever did was FT for six months, and 80% time for a year and a half. Most of my career has been 60-75% time.')
