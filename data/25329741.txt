After a while she&#x27;d start packing&#x2F;bringing a couple of small plants with her each time she visited.<p>Nothing too exotic, just things like spider-plants and some indoor vines.  She&#x27;d lightly-wrap them with newspaper and then stick them in the middle of her suitcase surrounded by clothes.<p>So pretty much all the plants we took from Scotland to Finland were ones she&#x27;d already moved in the opposite direction a year or two earlier!<p>I know some countries have restrictions on plants&#x2F;animals and similar things, but it never seemed to be a concern for her travels.')
