You would also have needed an arrival quarantine and post-arrival testing.<p>I wonder what percent of asymptomatic positive cases pre-arrival testing actually catches. I’m sure that number also changes depending on how many days before traveling you’re allowed to get the test.<p>And to actually prevent COVID from entering the US, I think you would have needed all of that fully in place in January, or perhaps earlier.<p>Effectively what this would have meant is a total border closure for several months at the beginning of the year. I’m not sure if that would have literally been impossible, but I think it’s totally fathomable why that didn’t happen.')
