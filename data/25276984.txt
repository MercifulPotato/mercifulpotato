Faster to write and easier to understand than calling out to a pen external lexer.<p>Not THAT being said I will contradict myself: when you are writing a tiny language like that itâ€™s easy to accidentally add dependencies like context-sensitive behavior.  Which means if things grow to the point where you need a parser generator it may become much harder.')
