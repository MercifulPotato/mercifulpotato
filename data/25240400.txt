That&#x27;s so backwards it&#x27;s funny.<p>This is a company that erodes computing freedom and ownership. They&#x27;ve co-opted the commons, and they built it all on the back of open source. And I&#x27;m picking on them?<p>Apple fans will say that Apple created billions of dollars of commerce opportunity. But it would have happened anyway without Apple.<p>We&#x27;d be in a better world if we had an open app standard that worked cross-device and consumers had choice in distribution channels.<p>We don&#x27;t need to be &quot;protected&quot; by a company or big brother. Especially if such protection is just a cover story for controlling commerce.')
