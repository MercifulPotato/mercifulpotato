I have been working in related field wherein my primary responsibilities included shipping data from edge to cloud among many other things. I have worked in vehicular IoT(connected electric vehicles), building IoT and am currently also involved in MQTT ecosystem(broker, client, test-suites) development in RustLang. There are HVAC systems communicating upstream across multiple US locations wherein my code runs and thousands of EV-vehicles with real time sensor data pushed to cloud where real-time tracking, alerts and intelligence is built. Let me know if you would be interested. I have also contributed to BACnet Python project with new features. Note: I am not a US citizen or have authorisation to work in US.')
