Back in the day when I played Magic&#x2F;Yugioh, I&#x27;d start with a janky common card and see how much I could turn it into. You have to exploit differences in how people value cards: the valuations of cards online mostly follows the way competitive players value them, but there are tons of people who play casually and others who just chase shiny&#x2F;cool looking cards. It was relatively easy for me to turn a janky card into another common card that was useful in competitive decks (ex: fissure&#x2F;smashing ground in yugioh), and trade those for janky holos with competitive players, which I could then turn into more useful&#x2F;valuable holos with the collectible&#x2F;casual crowd, and so on. It&#x27;s super fun to do a few times just to know that you can pull it off.')
