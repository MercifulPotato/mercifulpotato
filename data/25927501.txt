They seem to be just a bunch of words now with little meaning.<p>Before, I used to consider scientific papers... well, scientific and would try to base an informed opinion on the abstracts and conclusions. After reading blog entries like these and actually reading some papers (especially soft science papers which are easier to understand), even as a layman, some glaring mistakes can be spotted.<p>Popular scientists like Dawkins and that black astronomer are happy to point out the glaring problems in other areas of life, but it&#x27;s looking more and more like the scientific field doesn&#x27;t have its shit together either.<p>On a scale of bullshit to trustworthy, where stuff like Breitbart and ThePinkNews live in swamps of bullshit, scientific publications and papers seem to barely reach &quot;believable&quot;. One always has to question &quot;who payed for this research&quot;, &quot;who reviewed it&quot;, &quot;which country is this from&quot;, &quot;what reasons could there have been to do this research&quot;, &quot;are these results too good to be true&quot;, &quot;who would benefits from these results&quot;, etc.<p>It seems like one really cannot trust anybody or anything and has to constantly keep their wits about themselves.<p>Will we ever be able to clean up our act? What can we do?')
