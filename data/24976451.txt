I would still like to note that there was clearly a change in the 2020 model to increase variance as a function of time to the election when compared to the 2016 model. I think this is substantively the same.<p>Some of the top comments are making the same mistake, probably because they aren&#x27;t aware of this twitter beef history (and I envy them), so I&#x27;m putting this in a separate comment.<p>These comments are all pointing out that Taleb&#x27;s criticism is of something that Silver&#x27;s models don&#x27;t do:<p>&gt; the election were to happen today, what is the probability of each candidate winning?<p>What people seem to be forgetting, is that Silver&#x27;s 2016 model explicitly did this. Taleb made his criticisms starting in 2018 (even published an options pricing paper on the subject) then Silver changed his model for the 2020 cycle so that it no longer was an &quot;if the election were today&quot; model.<p>I can&#x27;t say for sure whether or not Silver changed his model because of Taleb, buuuuut he deserves at least a little credit here. Yes, I know Taleb is a colossal asshole people love to hate, but he&#x27;s usually right about these sorts of things.<p>Here is a pretty fair and balanced take on it for those who would like to read more: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;towardsdatascience.com&#x2F;why-you-should-care-about-the-nate-silver-vs-nassim-taleb-twitter-war-a581dce1f5fc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;towardsdatascience.com&#x2F;why-you-should-care-about-the...</a>')
