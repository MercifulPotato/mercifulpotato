Most Deno packages are imported from GitHub (or deno.land). Neither NPM nor GitHub want to lose your code.<p>&gt; Left pad was promptly fixed! That&#x27;s an argument for a centralized package manager, not against.<p>This is not an argument for a central package <i>manager</i>, but an argument for a central package <i>repository</i>.<p>Deno is already a &quot;central package manager&quot;. Similar to NPM in Node development, Deno is the default tool to download code in Deno development. Both with Node or Deno, you can download code in other ways, too. Nobody forces you to load code from URLs via import statements or NPM packages via npm install and commonjs require. (Also, when it comes to executing random code from the internet, Deno has a sandbox. Node doesn&#x27;t.)<p>And yes, well maintained package repositories are great. Whether centrally or decentrally managed repos are better is up for debate, though.<p>In any case, if you want to use NPM packages in Deno, I&#x27;d recommend <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.skypack.dev&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.skypack.dev&#x2F;</a>. It&#x27;s &quot;NPM packages from a URL&quot;, so, as we have established earlier, it&#x27;s just as much reliant on trust and potentially unstable as anything in life, but at least their left-pad is patched...')
