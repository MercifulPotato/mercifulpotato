It&#x27;s a vote counting operation. The counting volunteers say they found a pile of ballots with identical signatures and the woman running the vote is telling them to ignore it because it&#x27;s not their role to flag this or investigate it. In a vote audit.<p>The video description text has a transcript of what&#x27;s going on.<p><i>The female counter asks, “So when we’re done with the audit, there’s still the opportunity to challenge the fact that we have multiple ballots with the very same signature?” she asks. “I don’t know if ‘challenge’ is the right word,” the SOS official says ... “And again, we know that you have a concern with this precinct,” she tells them, explaining, “That’s not your role at this very moment,”</i><p>A video of counting volunteers discussing fraud they detected and being explicitly told to drop it is very far from &quot;just talking at a desk or something&quot;.')
