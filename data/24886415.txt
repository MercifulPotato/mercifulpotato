Trump said specifically he would denounce any group the moderator wanted. He has denounced white supremacy over 20 times on video over the past 4 years. Why so many times? Because the Democrats lie so much about him that the media keeps asking the same question. The same question was even asked at the 2016 debate with the same moderator. Then you have literally thousands of videos of people carrying antics flags, shouting BLM, and lighting things on fire, looting, etc. proud boys are not white supremacist either, they have plenty of black members and their leader is Hispanic. All it takes is a little time googling to find ANY of this or watch a legit news organization like Fox News that actually show the videos and tapes. It’s insane how many people claim Fox News to be fake or stories to be fake, but they literally show video evidence of all the violence meanwhile other media will say it’s “peaceful protests,” but for those of us there we know these protests shouting “No peace” are not peaceful.')
