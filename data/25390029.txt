Item(by='bachmeier', descendants=None, kids=[25390827], score=None, time=1607716133, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25389894, text='&gt; The idea that industry ought to pay for it presumably comes from a background where universities are private an expensive.<p>In the US at least, where even public universities are ridiculously expensive, there&#x27;s no way to keep the current system running unless our grads are able to get jobs that pay well when they graduate. Indirectly industry is paying for the courses taught by universities. In the current environment we need to prepare students for employment.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d like to live in a world where these kind of courses were government subsidised and available for free or cheap.<p>I think we&#x27;d be better off as a country (US). I also think that ship has sailed and it sank to the bottom of ocean a couple decades ago.')
