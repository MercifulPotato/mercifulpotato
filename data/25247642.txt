There are different opinions I have read that I wonder their thoughts on: some percieve the market is doing great and will do better as we head out of quarantine with these vaccines, some percieve an incoming correction and recession due to some hollistic snapshot of economies internal and international; some speak of incoming devaluation of the dollar. I just wonder if things like these are weighed heavily when thinking of going public, and I wonder if they should or shouldnt be. I know little of economics and markets so I cant say.')
