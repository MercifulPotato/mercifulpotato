I didn&#x27;t do extensive research on mine, I just looked at what the local well service company supports, because they come and swap out the consumables for a pretty reasonable fee (which keeps me from forgetting each year...).<p>The main criteria for me was having a 3&#x2F;8&quot; line from the tank to the spout, so that water comes out quickly.<p>I did supplement the stock 4 gallon tank with a 14 gallon tank (which barely fit under my sink). That allows the water to run for about 7 minutes, which seems to be plenty for both heavy use and to supply the ice machine.<p>So far I&#x27;ve had good luck with APEC brand RO stuff from Amazon. The original RO equipment is Millenium brand from Hellenbrand.<p>I use an inline remineralizer for the water to the ice machine. That is apparently helpful to preserve the pump. I also use a carbon filter for taste.')
