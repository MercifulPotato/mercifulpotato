I once dropped in on a consulting client (at the request of an investor on the board) and did a quick assessment. The assessment was holistic and marketing was one of many enterprise value levers, so did a rough check.  The marketing firm, very similar to the Uber commentary in the underlying podcast above where he found 20,000 installs coming from an app with 30,000 MAUs, I calculated claimed performance which back of the envelope would  imply you could capture the entire US vertical for that industry for sub $X0M of annual spend. I knew that space very well, and well that just was not possible.<p>My quick question kicked off a large tap dance in which some finger pointing occurred and a “new attribution formula” was introduced.<p>The vendor got fired.<p>This was sort of a reasonably sized entity, with some sophistication. But think about it, unless you’re tech native, your VP of marketing has no granular data abilities in 2020, and unless you have a pool of SQL capable analysts lying around, AND you’re going to insist to validate on your own, it simply doesn’t work.<p>So you trust the vendor. But wait the vendor gets paid X% of what you spend. Hmmm, would they realllllly work super hard to make sure the results are real if they are not easily found out to be falsified? This is a paranoid stance, obviously. But intrinsically structurally flawed.<p>The Uber guy on the podcast straight up said he wouldn’t buy a dollar of programmatic ads without a big data team internally and a policy of (loosely quoted) “we need that file to check and if you don’t send it to us we’re cutting you off”.<p>That’s just a lot of work.')
