Wealth is purely relative.<p>It&#x27;s probably more useful to think about the problem in terms of social cohesion. As wealth inequality increases, social cohesion decreases---the wealthy dehumanize those less wealthy, and the less wealthy lose faith in the fairness of the system. Eventually you get to a point where the &quot;poor&quot; (who may in fact be quite rich, historically speaking) don&#x27;t feel any investment in social order, and find it more efficient to take from the wealthy than to create new wealth, since the greater proportion of any marginal wealth they do create goes to the wealthy anyway.<p>See for example the Ultimatum game for a similar micro-economic effect, where individuals reject unfair outcomes even if it means losing money (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ultimatum_game#:~:text=It%20was%20first%20described%20by,accept%20it%20or%20reject%20it" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ultimatum_game#:~:text=It%20wa...</a>.).')
