Why are you giving this particular one such outsized proportion?<p>You didn&#x27;t see this sort of reaction in 2000, and that was far far closer.<p>And to be clear, this election was 306 to 232. That is considered a landslide in my book (meaning my 40+ years of living). And in percentages, you can see just how poorly Trump performed in this election - 51.4% to 46.9%. 2000 was 47.9% to 48.4% (technically a negative 0.5% difference).<p>So I think your argument is completely disingenuous.')
