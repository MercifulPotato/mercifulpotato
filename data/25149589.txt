If it comes back to you, its yours forever. If it doesn&#x27;t, you hunt that bitch down and kill her.<p>That&#x27;s just awful. Yikes.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not saying I hate her. I just hope she gets fingered by wolverine<p>This one I find hilarious. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s sexist either, it&#x27;s clearly targetted at a single person he doesn&#x27;t like, not women in general.<p>&gt; If you ever wanna know what a woman&#x27;s mind feels like? Imagine a browser with 2857 tabs open, all the time.<p>Again, this one is just awful. It wouldn&#x27;t even be funny if it wasn&#x27;t sexist on top of it.<p>&gt; The reason women will never be the ones to propose is because as soon as she gets on her knees, he will start unzipping.<p>Isn&#x27;t this also sexist against men? The main joke here is the &quot;men just can&#x27;t keep their pants up&quot; cliche.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m no gynecologist, but I know a cunt when I see one.<p>I can totally see this being used to insult a guy. :%s&#x2F;cunt&#x2F;dick&#x2F;&lt;CR&gt; and the joke still works the same, so no, not sexist.')
