Religion has been keeping society work, stay stable, and find purpose for citizens in history; modern economy does exactly the same, it meets our needs for fulfillment, lead people to behave in certain manner, and keep countries stable. They are vital for our society. You can tell when economy is good, everything is rosy, and people are nice, there was no polarization. It ignites our greed and then fulfils it, we feel happy and willing to follow its lead.')
