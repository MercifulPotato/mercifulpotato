Because Seattle&#x27;s police dept was under a consent decree, any changes to tactics and weapons needed to be approved by the judge who is monitoring the dept. The judge felt the Seattle police might actually get significantly more violent if they couldn&#x27;t use chemical weapons and indiscriminate projectiles on non violent protestors.')
