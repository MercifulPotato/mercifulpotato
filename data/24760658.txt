A Django project doesn&#x27;t care what architecture it runs on so long as Python is compiled for it, ditto with Node and RoR and all the other interpreted languages. Java should also be fine as long as the runtime works on the arch since it&#x27;s only bytecode anyways. Really the only people who would need to care are the people deploying Rust and C binaries, but I&#x27;d guess those people are already used to compiling for different architectures anyways (you need to build for Amazon&#x27;s Linux AMI to run a binary on Lambda, for example).')
