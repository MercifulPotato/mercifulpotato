This video is over 13 years old though, so current optics are probably much more advanced than what was deployed in iraq. Near-future drones can also probably use 5G networks to transmit higher resolution videos. I don&#x27;t think anyone can hide from this, even if they don&#x27;t have anything to hide. False positives seem extremely likely and if the domestic drones won&#x27;t shoot, they still will very likely be reporting a lot of crimes and violations that didn&#x27;t actually happen. The guy in the video who the operators claimed was carrying an AK-47 that was also an RPG, was actually a reporter carrying a camera and laptop.')
