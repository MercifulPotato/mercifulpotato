It also helps your service know how much <i>it</i> needs to scale and size itself if a team gets in touch and says &quot;Hey we are making Service X - the default your service offers is 100 QPS but we think we will need 1000 QPS - can you support that?&quot;.<p>In a small org where you know&#x2F;roughly-know who is doing stuff then it is probably less of a concern as you can go walk over to their desk and have a chat about what they are doing or let them know they&#x27;re sending too much traffic etc.  This is harder to do with an org with 10s of thousands of engineers spread across the globe and in different timezones - you might suddenly get huge amounts of traffic at 3am from a team on the other side of the planet who just launched a feature you had zero idea about, and they&#x27;re hammering you with 100x the QPS you usually get.')
