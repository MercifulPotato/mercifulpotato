Termux has sshd (you have to start it manually once, then it stays running until Termux is killed or the phone is rebooted).<p>With ssh-copy-id it takes a single command (1-line script) to rsync the phone&#x27;s DCIM directory to my main machine for further processing.  Nothing needs to be done on the phone at all other than to lightly nudge it to wake it up so sshd sees the connection attempt.<p>Downside: Android security clampdowns mean termux can&#x27;t see the SD card.  So I can only sync down the phone&#x27;s internal camera directory and that&#x27;s where I have to store the new pictures and videos.  This means space occasionally runs low and I have to move stuff to the SD card.  But in the future, they probably won&#x27;t allow Termux to even work any more in its current form - no &quot;exec&quot; of executables that werent&#x27; installed as part of the apk.<p>Why do all this?  Because I&#x27;m old school. My phone is an extension of my data ecosystem, which lives on (redundant and backed-up) hard disks in my home computing setup.  I don&#x27;t even let the phone sync the photos to the cloud.<p>Admittedly I&#x27;ve found no other practical uses for it; all the interesting stuff is blocked by Android security (e.g. back up or otherwise process your call&#x2F;SMS history).')
