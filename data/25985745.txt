They are the counterparty for both sides. So the seller&#x27;s counterparty is the clearinghouse, not the buyer, and the buyer&#x27;s counterparty is also the clearinghouse. The clearinghouse requires broker margin accounts so that they can close out a trade when there&#x27;s a failure. And the amount of collateral depends on risk.<p>(This is also why GME trading was halted by some brokers--assymetrical trades and increased volatility meant there was greater risk for trades in those stocks for those brokers, so the clearinghouse demanded more collateral from the broker. Broker doesn&#x27;t have that collateral right away, they can&#x27;t make the trade.)')
