My hunch is that xpath expressions would be awkward to work with.<p>I&#x27;ve done too much xpath, xquery, xslt, css selectors. For my own work (dog fooding), I settled on mostly using very simple globbing expressions. Then use the host language&#x27;s &#x27;foreach&#x27; equiv for iterating result sets.<p>Globbing&#x27;s double asterisk wildcard is the feature I most miss in other query engines. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Glob_%28programming%29" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Glob_%28programming%29</a><p>Looping back to command line xpath: there&#x27;s always some impedance match between the query and host languages. IIRC, one of the shells, like chubot&#x27;s oilshell or fish?, has more rational expression evaluation (compared to bash).<p>You especially see this with regexs. It&#x27;s a major language design fail that others haven&#x27;t adopted Perl&#x27;s first class regex intrinsics. C# has LINQ, sure. But that&#x27;s more xquery than xpath. And I&#x27;ve never liked xquery.<p>In other words, &quot;blue collar&quot; programming languages should have intrinsic path expressions. Whatever the syntax.<p>YMMV.')
