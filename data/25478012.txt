More generally, rail through mountain ranges made use of scarce passes and built expensive tunnels and bridges. There are some examples of abandoned route segments that can still be walked (and maybe biked) on in whole or in part--for example near Steven&#x27;s Pass in the Cascades. But I imagine the main routes through major mountain ranges are still in use. There are gaps in Montana too and a small one in Washington.<p>I assume it&#x27;s the same reason people bike on I-5. If there&#x27;s a good route through the mountains, either a major road or rail or both is likely using it.')
