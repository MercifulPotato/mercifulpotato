Item(by='reitzensteinm', descendants=None, kids=[25417204], score=None, time=1607948072, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25415324, text='(Spoilers obviously)<p>I didn&#x27;t enjoy reading The Looking Glass War, but it stuck with me in a big way.<p>A lot of the other novels are about intricate chess games, where you spend the time waiting for the other shoe to drop that clicks everything in to place.<p>TLGW continues with the format, but the other shoe just never drops. There&#x27;s no payoff. The novel ends. That&#x27;s a shit thing to read, and I&#x27;ll never reread it.<p>But it makes the rest of the novels more bleak and sinister. You get the feeling that while the author is focusing on the Smileys and Karlas of the world and the games they play, TLGW is what happens when normal people take the reins without interference - and that&#x27;s the norm. It&#x27;s the author pulling away the veneer of glamor around the world of spying that he&#x27;s intricately built up.<p>That&#x27;s just my interpretation, though. It could just be a shit novel.')
