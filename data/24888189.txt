Do you think Israel is respecting Palestinians&#x27; human rights? Or is Saudi Arabia respecting human rights? Of course not, and yet they are the US&#x27;s best buddies. The US even had an agreement that put a stop to Iran&#x27;s nuclear program and soothed the tensions with the West, allowing Iranians to improve their living conditions and hopefully at some point ditch radicalism. They threw it in the bin, because what the US fears is ultimately a non-aligned country with the strenghts to stand against external aggression.<p>What the US really wants is not respect of human rights or better living conditions for the people (see Libya, see Iraq, see Palestine, see the bloody civil war in Syria). What they want is to reduce every non-aligned country to either vassal or rubble.')
