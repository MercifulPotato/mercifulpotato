Item(by='CRConrad', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608572548, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25496926, text='Corollary: When a suspect or defendant is freed because there is no actual proof (technical evidence), or above all when evidence is disallowed because their rights have been violated, that&#x27;s called “a (mere) technicality”.<p>Intentional or not, very very likely to condition the audience into regarding civil rights and rules of evidence as “mere” anything. Goes back to at least _Hill Street Blues_ and _Baretta,_ probably _Kojak_ too. Likely much farther than that. (Though _Columbo_ didn&#x27;t display this attitude, at least not as flagrantly, IIRC?)')
