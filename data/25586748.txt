I sometimes wonder if elected office, if not any and all kinds of public service, necessarily selects for people who don&#x27;t care too much about their own personal privacy, and what the consequences of that are. There&#x27;s no way to get there without essentially throwing away whatever dregs of anonymity you&#x27;ve managed to hold on to.<p>So, while I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m any of those things you list, and I&#x27;ve often thought that I would love to run for office some day, just glancing at the paperwork required to show up to the race is typically enough to turn me off of the idea for a while.')
