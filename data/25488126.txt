I tried to solve this by moving all Nextcloud data into iSCSI disk but RAM &amp; CPU became a problem once I started adding more files. After a week or so, I tore everything down and went back to a VPS instance.<p>It might works better with Raspberry Pi cluster on Kubernetes, though. (This very Raspberry Pi is now happily running as a DVB  streaming server.)')
