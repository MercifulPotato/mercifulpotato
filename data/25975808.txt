But if true, I might be more inclined to agree with you.<p>What you did argue is that<p><pre><code>    a key use case for federated messaging platforms is to evade censorship\n</code></pre>\nWhich is wholly different, in that the usage is at fault, not the protocol in and of itself (in the same fashion that Bitcoin was not designed to facilitate drug trade, even if it’s a key use case driving its valuation).<p>But we also know that illegal activity is a key use case of the internet, of email, of encryption and a wide variety of other decentralized and federated technologies. This is hardly a good justification because you’ll ban all sorts of good things.<p>The only thing that protects your argument against everything else is that you arbitrarily limit it to non-established technologies — in the name of all that is good and wholesome, you would kill anything like the internet, email, etc, that is not itself the existing technologies.<p>A web browser is only more legitimate because the internet is more broadly used. Which isn’t much of a case for legitimacy.')
