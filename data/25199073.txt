Note that California is higher than Texas despite horribly restrictive gun laws.<p>My point was more that people are less likely to abuse them as some exceptional item, at least as far as I&#x27;ve seen.  Criminals will always use them; I was more talking about the likelihood of someone to draw a gun in a tense situation, which I can&#x27;t measure.  But people who view them as tools and know how to use them understand that one ought not to draw a gun unless he intends to use it.<p>All that aside, I don&#x27;t support gun rights because rates of certain crimes are below some number.  We would call it silly to support a right to privacy only insofar as terrorism does not exceed a certain threshold and to say that such a right disappears.  In the same way, I don&#x27;t believe crime rate should have any effect on our right to keep and bear arms.')
