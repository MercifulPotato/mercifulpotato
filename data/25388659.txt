Note that I am not the GP, I left only two comments concerning it.  I happen to think that your feelings vindictiveness are justified.  I&#x27;m just saying you shouldn&#x27;t deceive yourself into thinking your feelings of vindictiveness are something else.  There is nothing wrong with an emotional response and I&#x27;ve not insinuated otherwise.  Feeling vindictive is healthy, but self-deception harms yourself.  I hope my position is now clear to you.')
