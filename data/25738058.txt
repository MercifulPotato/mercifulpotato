Many products are not truly recyclable, but tell consumers they are.  Sometimes they are only partially recyclable, or other times the recycling is technically possible but economically infeasible and consequently doesn&#x27;t actually happen.  Corporations know this and have promoted recycling to equal footing as reuse and reduction.  They would rather people consume more and casually throw broken products into their recycling bin, naively believing they&#x27;re being responsible consumers.')
