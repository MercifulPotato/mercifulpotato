They don&#x27;t owe you anything and you can stop using it at any point in time (which I actually encourage you to do - but for a completely different set of reasons). You watch content, they show you ads and get money for the ads. That&#x27;s it. You don&#x27;t like the content or the lack of content you are free to, again, move to another site&#x2F;platform&#x2F;social network&#x2F;etc.<p>It&#x27;s amazing to me how much people are willing to entertain this charade that was started after the elections. It&#x27;s also amazing to see the mental gymnastics involved to explain some of the things that were done and&#x2F;or said. This is not 4D chess.<p>Youtube should get to do what they want as long as they operate withing the laws of the countries they are running their service within. I still have not seen the law that was broken here.')
