They may offer added security but do not keep your requests private. ODoH attempts to keep your requests private from the resolver only. A benefit which is a good step but doesn&#x27;t ultimately keep your dns private from your ISP.<p>This is the major flaw I find with such claims of encrypted dns. Your isp can still see which sites you visit, oDoH or not.')
