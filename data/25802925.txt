Just to be clear I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s malice as I don&#x27;t believe that. I&#x27;m just saying the end result is the same so one should consider them a hostile actor for purposes of threat modeling.<p>No worries at all! I interpreted your post the way you intended; and I agree fully being also in InfoSec.<p>Going by how you phrased your original post, you&#x27;re probably more patient and&#x2F;or well-intentioned than me as I&#x27;m farther along the path of attributing mistakes by big, powerful corporations to malice right away.')
