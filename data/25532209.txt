That&#x27;s a huge advantage. Choose to trade on EU terms with the single market, or choose to trade on other terms with different international targets.<p>That may not be precisely what you want, but it&#x27;s not a <i>bad</i> deal for the UK, it&#x27;s just a different set of terms.<p>Plus, the EU will do better without us. We&#x27;ve always just complained and delayed their desire for further deep integration between countries.<p>To paraphrase Boris&#x27; quote of &#x27;Having a successful, independent UK over the channel isn&#x27;t a bad thing for the EU&#x27;, well neither is it bad for the UK to have an independent EU to trade with, where they can crack on with what they want to do without us disrupting it.<p>Edit: people seem to be taking this as me &#x27;selling&#x27; brexit.
