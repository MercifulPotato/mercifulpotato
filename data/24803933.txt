Managers need to be human &amp; kind.<p>2. Shielding their team from crap (as someone mentioned already)<p>3. Don&#x27;t pitch one team member vs another - this is toxic. Instead nurture their strength. Our competitors are outside the team, not inside<p>4. Cheer lead&#x2F;Sponsor for the team outside. Genuinely back your team.<p>5. Always expect your team members are smarter than you - give them that trust. Thank them for things they teach you.<p>6. Managing is more like parenting college kids  (not toddlers&#x2F;middle schoolers). You want them to survive worst and replace you if needed. So you too can grow. But avoid micro managing.<p>7. Learn to have tough conversations - This could be for their&#x2F;team&#x27;s improvement.')
