Personally, I run a bit of a hybrid setup.<p>My new Dell XPS 13 came with Ubuntu pre-installed (which I replaced with Void Linux) and for the most part allows for a lot of tweaking. When I&#x27;m at home, I connect to my eGPU unit with one cable, allowing me to use my secondary monitor, a proper mouse, and external hard drives (although internal is already 1TB SSD). The eGPU unit is a Razer Core V2 with a GTX 1060, which is good enough for VR games, which play well on Linux these days surprisingly. Then a lot of my stuff is self-hosted in the cloud anyway, like a media server, backups, servers for development, even an IRC bouncer. I also run my own smart home software on a raspberry pi.<p>So while at the moment this might not be typical for an average consumer, the trend towards edge computing will really make the laptop into an &quot;internet appliance&quot; as the author says, and the browser an OS. Hell, with 5G, cloud gaming for VR may even be viable, and then we&#x27;re back to the equivalent of terminals and mainframes.<p>The only real issue then is the ownership of these services â€” I don&#x27;t agree with the author that everything will become a SaaS and no more open hardware will exist. It will always exist as long as there&#x27;s a demand for it, you just have to accept that it&#x27;ll be more expensive and less consumer-friendly. E.g. I have to accept that I can&#x27;t hotplug my eGPU on Linux like you can on Windows, and I need to pay for my servers. Spotify and Netflix will always be cheaper than any legal means of acquiring media otherwise specifically because of their size.')
