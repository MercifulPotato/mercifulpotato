What I see a lot of is people pointing out that the definition of &quot;journalist&quot; is very very loose in 2020, and that has an effect on the arrest stats.  Many many many people have watched with their own eyes, live on video, what&#x27;s been going on through the course of this year.  We&#x27;ve seen CNN and ABC reporters shot with rubber bullets and accosted on live TV, but we&#x27;ve also seen a lot of &quot;journalists&quot; throwing rocks and molotov cocktails on live stream and doing other criminal acts.<p>There is a healthy and natural cynicism and suspicion of what appears to be a lop-sided reporting of the occurrences during the protests and riots in 2020.  That suspicion may benefit people who are pro-authoritarian because they can play on it, but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean those who are suspicious are pro-authoritarian themselves.<p>The article does a lot to try to explain what it &#x2F;doesn&#x27;t&#x2F; classify as a journalist, but never says what it does classify as a journalist.  Those definitions are central to the point of the whether or not these stats are actually meaningful in any bigger sense than to say &quot;well duh, of course more people were arrested during a year of protest and riots&quot;.')
