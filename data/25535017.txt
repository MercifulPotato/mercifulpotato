Individualism is ordinarily set in opposition to collectivism, but it&#x27;s the bastardization of both that have created the problem.<p>On the one hand, social clubs have been evaporating. Bowling leagues, rotary clubs, ham radio clubs etc. They&#x27;re fading, and this predates 2020. These things are compatible with individualism -- it&#x27;s freedom of association. But in practice people aren&#x27;t doing them as much anymore.<p>On the other hand, the bureaucratization of social assistance. If you need help you don&#x27;t go to people in your community who already know your face and the specifics of your plight, you fill out a form on a computer and some algorithm decides whether you get a supermarket gift card.<p>Both of these trends are isolating but it&#x27;s not because of where we put the trade off between individualism and collectivism, it&#x27;s because we&#x27;re doing both of them poorly.')
