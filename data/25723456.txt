Item(by='dang', descendants=None, kids=[25723722], score=None, time=1610331317, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25721692, text='These topics are being massively discussed on HN right now and have been the whole time. Obviously we&#x27;re not trying to suppress them. It sounds like you didn&#x27;t see it, but at the time I merged these threads last night, there were something like 8 or 9 major duplicates of this story between the front page and page 2, all essentially the same discussion. That&#x27;s a failure mode for HN and something the community most certainly does not want.<p>When there&#x27;s a Major Ongoing Topic (MOT), we merge duplicates and downweight follow-ups [1] until there&#x27;s Significant New Information (SNI) [2]. That&#x27;s been the approach ever since the Snowden avalanche of 2013 [3], when many users rightly complained that HN was overrun with copy after copy of the same discussion, and a stampede of copycat submissions repeating the same things, media outlets reporting on each other&#x27;s reporting, and so on.<p>You can argue that AWS is in a different category than app stores and that therefore this article was indeed SNI. I actually agree with that. But as I said, the thread wasn&#x27;t any different. There&#x27;s also the aspect that part of our job is to prevent this site from going into meltdown and destroying itself in hellfires of flamewar rage.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=follow-up%20by%3Adang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=follow-up%20by%3Adang&amp;dateRang...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=%22significant%20new%20information%22%20by%3Adang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=%22significant%20new%20informa...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=by%3Adang%20snowden%202013&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que...</a>')
