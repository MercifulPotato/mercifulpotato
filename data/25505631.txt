Item(by='pdimitar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608640403, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25505503, text='Yes, both are often confused. Many people, me included, distinguish them by using &quot;kefir mushroom&quot; and &quot;kefir drink&quot; (which is the product of milk + the mushroom). I had the option to buy pre-made kefir drink but decided to go the harder road of taking care of it and feeding it myself. Gradually found my own best practices and now I get 2L of it every 4 days. (Rough dosage is a handful of mushrooms for 1L of milk; something like 15 grams or so.)<p>Just 2-3 sips make me feel like no coffee ever could. It&#x27;s an instant health improver. And this is coming from a jaded cynical programmer. Trust me, I am not selling anything and this is not a cult -- I just wanted better health. Kefir helped a lot.<p>---<p>A quick guide on how to work with the mushroom, if you need one:<p>You put it in a well-closed container with milk and you could open it up to &quot;breathe&quot; 1-2 times for several hours during the entire fermenting period (for me it&#x27;s 4 full days and I open it once for 5-6h). You stir it every 12 or 24h (for me the latter). You&#x27;ll quickly see why -- the water should fall to the bottom of the container and you get this slimy substance on top. <i>NEVER USE METAL CUTLERY OR METAL STRAINER OR HOT WATER WITH KEFIR!</i> I use wooden spoons to stir and sip it but plastic works just fine.<p>Some people store the stuff in a fridge but that makes it way too slow to ferment (2 weeks I&#x27;ve been told). I keep both of my jars in a normal room.<p>After the fermenting period is over, filter the product through a non-metal strainer (I use a plastic one). I opt to stir the mushroom + some thick milk left on the top of the strainer until any leftover product drains fully through the strainer. Put the product in a bottle (or any closed container). Then let the product (the fermented milk you filtered) sit in a fridge for ~12h or so (but it&#x27;s still ready to drink right away, it just ferments a little more when left alone without the mushrooms inside it and my experimentation has led me to believe that makes it stronger; other people on the net say the same).<p>Now wash the mushrooms with cold water, thoroughly (I simply wash the mushrooms with a wooden spoon while cold tap water runs on top of it; do it while it&#x27;s still in the strainer, makes it much easier to wash since any leftover water + milk gets drained and isn&#x27;t getting in the way). Put the mushrooms back in your container (which you should also wash, with cold water), put new fresh milk, and you&#x27;re done.<p>Every now and then the mushroom gets too big. You can put away some of it and freeze it in a small container with some milk (just enough to cover it, doesn&#x27;t have to be 1L, I use several very small plastic jars akin to those used for blood or sperm donations). You can later unfreeze them (don&#x27;t force it; leave it unfreeze by itself which could take 12-24h easily), wash it well with cold water and you can use it. Can&#x27;t advise you on when and how -- you&#x27;ll find out for yourself. A good rule of thumb is that it&#x27;s better to risk having too much mushrooms in the milk and not too few (because that will basically net you a mediocre yoghurt and nothing else).<p>I have 2x 1.5L jars and my fermenting period is 4 full days. Usually takes me 15 minutes to do the whole thing I described.<p>Hope that helps. If you have any doubts about your gut health at all (and as a modern human in the 21st century I think we all should) then give homemade kefir a fair try. It substantially improved my life.')
