Item(by='1996', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607460536, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25347915, text='For people who do not care so much about the privacy, you should consider a &quot;simpler&quot; mode.<p>This would also let you work around the network effect: simply send a text (for people without dataplans but infinite text) or an email with the GPS coordinates + a link to the google map (or OSM, or bing maps..) in one click. Not much data required.<p>Even better: add a &quot;tracking&quot; mode to automatically send the coordinates every minute, as an email reply (to create a thread) which could be useful when you are going to roam the bars and don&#x27;t want (or won&#x27;t be sober enough) to update your friends of where to meet.<p>I would also like GPG encoding: again, to work around the network effect, GPG encode the email before sending it. Useful for emailing myself or hacker friends.<p>I would seriously pay for that, especially with the option to run the AGPL backend on my own server (the client should have a field to optionally select another server)')
