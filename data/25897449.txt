They are not arterials &#x2F; collectors. And you rarely need a full reconstruct. So even trusting the given quotes, you generally are good with the &quot;resurfacing&quot; column, and you can aim well below the smaller price for arterial&#x2F;collector.<p>If I take my local prices, resurfacing 1 mile of a 6 yards wide road, is less than $250.000. And that&#x27;s with full refurbishing for a pretty damaged road + a new asphalt concrete surface! If you just do preventive maintenance with single-layer or bi-layer that can be 5 or even 10 times less...<p>(Sorry about the probably imperfect technical terms translations).')
