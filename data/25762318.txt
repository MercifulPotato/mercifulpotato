An &quot;open&quot; ISA doesn&#x27;t force anything else to be open.<p>So, use cases like Western Digital, where they can quit paying ARM a percentage of every hard drive they sell, for example.<p>As for technical advantages, each RISCV vendor has their own choice of how to implement, so it&#x27;s hard to say anything broad that applies to all RISCV implementations.  The Berkeley BOOM project is hitting really good DMIPS&#x2F;MHz numbers.  LowRISC has some interesting memory tagging and &quot;minion core&quot; ideas, etc.<p>Edit: I left out perhaps the most important reason RISCV has a lot of hype.  They&#x27;ve been successful getting first class support from the Linux kernel maintainers.')
