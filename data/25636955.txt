Their mission is rather a personal quest to create music that is pure, stays true to their core values, and continues to push boundaries.<p>These are the artists who speak from the heart, inspire future generations, and refuse to conform to the profit-hungry mainstream. We believe the music they make is a true and authentic reflection of their inner state - pure artistry without compromise.<p>Discovering music like this enables us to explore our inner-self, expand our consciousness, and grow together within a vast and rich musical landscape. It is vital that we support these artists in the most simple and effective way; by purchasing their music and sharing their message with the world.<p>Formaviva enables undiscovered talents and musical experimentation that is inaccessible on mainstream music platforms. We believe in the ability of music that is emotionally driven, and we work towards supporting artists in their creative endeavors by enabling and creating tools for such music distribution and its monetization.<p>Back-end Developer:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;formaviva.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;backend-developer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;formaviva.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;backend-developer</a><p>Front-end Developer (required Ember.js experience for transitioning to React):\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;formaviva.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;frontend-developer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;formaviva.com&#x2F;jobs&#x2F;frontend-developer</a>')
