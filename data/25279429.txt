Someone can&#x27;t vote in a state unless they  are residents of that state, subject to the laws and jurisdiction of that state. For example - what does it mean for DC residents to vote in, say, Virginia, for a Federal election. Who defines the Congressional districts? Do you pre-dictate to Virginia that it gets a Congressional district that matches the boundary of DC? What if that district has radically more or fewer residents than other districts in the state?<p>I&#x27;m seriously considering your proposal and not mocking it, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any more or less sensible, on its face, than creating a new &quot;state&quot;. Note, I put &quot;state&quot; in quotes because I don&#x27;t see why we can&#x27;t dictate in that state constitution that the state is administered by Congress.')
