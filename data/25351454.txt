This means that the outer ear won&#x27;t color the sound, which means that you don&#x27;t need to correct for that (which is what modern autoequalizers do). Of course this is a bit less natural, but carefully tuned drivers work around that excellently.<p>Fourth, they are wired, which removes the need for processing the audio signal. Modern DACs are practically indistinguishable from perfection, so that&#x27;s not an issue.<p>Fifth, they use balanced armature drivers instead of dynamic drivers. This means that they are not affected at all by resonance and other effects.<p>This is why Shure IEMs can do both better isolation and better audio quality than even experimental smart headphones. They simply eliminate all the issues by physical means.<p>The one issue that can&#x27;t be quite fixed is that Soundstage won&#x27;t sound as wide as would be possible with open back headphones, but these are closed headphones with ANC so it probably won&#x27;t be any worse.<p>Basically, the point is to remove the physical issues so that you don&#x27;t have to fix them in software. This is a lot more cost efficient and, for things like ANC that can&#x27;t be done perfectly, gives a better result.')
