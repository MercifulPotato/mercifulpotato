I&#x27;d clarify to say that patents <i>are</i> considered anticompetitive practices.  However, they were (as originally envisioned, but certainly not since State Street, possibly earlier) anticompetitive practices that were specifically and purposefully limited in two ways:<p>1. The filing of a patent requires the filer to disclose the operation of the patented invention such that any art-practiced person could replicate it.  Any non-disclosed secrets are protected only under trade-secret law, where the thing is secret only until the secret is out.  That&#x27;s how Coca-Cola has kept the Coke recipe a secret for generations.<p>2. The patent is enforceable only for a limited period of time (20 years), much like copyright originally was (14x2).  Due to innovation pressures, and the fact that companies recognize they build on one anothers&#x27; works, that enforcement window hasn&#x27;t been extended.  Instead, companies rely on patent thickets to keep competitors out for the proscribed period of time.<p>As mentioned above, modern patents aren&#x27;t actually subject to these limitations.  Modern drafting lawyers do everything they can to exclude required information in the patient itself so that it can&#x27;t be used for reproduction, while still claiming patent enforceability on the result.  Additionally, patents are also awarded for a vast array of inventions that would&#x27;ve been previously considered unpatentable descriptions of ideas (software and process patents in particular).  See Jefferson (e.g., knowledge and candles) for some of the original reasoning behind the system.<p>In other words, since there&#x27;s no billion dollar industry buying laws requiring fewer and smaller patents, the scope of patentability keeps increasing to the benefit of already entrenched players.')
