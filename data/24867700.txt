[0] And unless you&#x27;re walking back on every one of your comments and opinions in this thread I think I was spot on with my assessment.<p>My friend, it&#x27;s not my &quot;hard to follow&quot; writing style that you&#x27;re stumbling on, it&#x27;s that I made a more sensible argument than you did. You are plucking an argument out of thin air, floating on conspiracy and innuendo without any real evidence, or at least something that passes Occam&#x27;s razor. Like that you can build anything, doesn&#x27;t make it true.<p>Look, I&#x27;m not even saying you are wrong, because I have no evidence either way. Just that the (far) more plausible explanation is that anyone running <i>from</i> a superpower is running <i>to</i> another superpower. It&#x27;s the <i>only</i> thing that makes sense. He did what he had to do to survive.<p>You&#x27;re trying to build that into &quot;he must have been a Russian puppet all along&quot; because &quot;people&quot; have been saying it so you must be right. But then you complain that &quot;people&quot; also say he got stranded in Russia, so they must be wrong. So I ask you, is what &quot;people&quot; say only correct when you want it to be correct? You selectively go between &quot;people support my views so I must be right&quot; to &quot;people contradict my views so they must be wrong&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, that&#x27;s no way to have a civilized and productive discussion.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24864900" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24864900</a>')
