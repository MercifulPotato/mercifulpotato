If it had been my prime email account, I would have cared.<p>I see this as theft.  It&#x27;s not like Google ever throws anything away, so if they cancel your account, they are literally stealing your data from you.<p>We can&#x27;t force Google to give service to people they don&#x27;t want to, but they should be <i>transparent</i> about it, and at the very, very least, there needs to be a way for you to retrieve all of your information if they close your account.<p>In a government of laws that tried to protect the average person, this would have been a given.  Unfortunately, America has never had that.')
