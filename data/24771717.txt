For example, you can&#x27;t put pornography on Youtube, but it&#x27;s still reasonably easy to find a video with nudity. It&#x27;s easy to lose a lot of time trying to craft the perfect definition, but you can get 80% of the benefit with a rigid and conservative definition. So I don&#x27;t think you need to remove content that &quot;arguably&quot; breaks a policy, you just content that &quot;explicitly&quot; breaks it. This hopefully causes folks to the extremes will take their content elsewhere (to a hopefully much smaller audience).')
