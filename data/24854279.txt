A few shows were really excellent but there was a ton of hapless “big star” plus cheap comedy or lame variety shown. T-mobile gave it for free, had it not I would not have paid a dime. The Shape of Pasta was an outstanding  travel&#x2F;foodie show in same vane as Anthony Bordain’s show. A few of the thrillers were good and that’s about it.')
