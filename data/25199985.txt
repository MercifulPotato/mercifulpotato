Companies that employ &quot;Front End&quot; and &quot;Back end&quot; engineers are very different than NeXT, which had products from asic to high level.<p>If you work at a hardware company, even in a role that&#x27;s very far from hardware, you become aware of this stuff because it effects you. Even if you don&#x27;t understand ASIC at all, you still know about, oh, such and such process node has this issue, because it impacted our schedule and somebody told me about it at a lunch table. And you may not even know how to solder, but you can say, oh this needs rework, 0 ohm resistor at point such and such to make the display work, because you need to know it to go to the lab and have the work done.<p>Really the thing I understood the least working at a company like that was actual productization. You hear about something you worked on a year and a half ago being a tablet, or an embedded device, and you&#x27;d be like, oh, that old thing is just being released now? And it&#x27;s in that form factor? huh.')
