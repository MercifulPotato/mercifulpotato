It’s titled “How Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin Vaccine <i>Works</i>.” Yet the article itself says that there isn’t enough data from Phase 3 trials. Doesn’t that mean that its efficacy is unclear? The body of the article doesn’t do a good job of making this clear. A layperson might get the impression that it works but the data just hasn’t come back yet.')
