You only mentioned about it in an edit, it&#x27;s disingenuous to suggest that I intentionally ignored it.<p>My comment was talking about the actual header in the first place. And I posted the edit about the sticky header like ten minutes before your reply. But maybe you didn&#x27;t refresh the page, so whatever. If I was disingenuous I wouldn&#x27;t have labelled it clearly as an edit, unlike the site which isn&#x27;t clearly labeled as a corporate blog, until you scroll down.<p>&gt; 2. It says &quot;DuckDuckGo News&quot; even before you scroll down the page.<p>&quot;DuckDuckGo News&quot; is only a category among many. A privacy advocacy group blog can&#x27;t have a category called &quot;DuckDuckGo News&quot;? Hell, many people&#x27;s personal blogs have Google, Microsoft, Apple, etc. categories.')
