They are great for storing data that doesn’t change much or changes minutely with every transaction.<p>Sure, that&#x27;s fair, because it&#x27;s an &quot;eventually consistent&quot; database. It&#x27;s not intended for transactions that need to be validated and enforced immediately, because it is not ACID compliant. I think the solution here is to simply not use it for that. Use it for what it was intended for - data that is okay to be eventually consistent, which does not include financial transactions and the like. The value of eventually consistent databases is much more apparent in transactions that do not require immediate consistency, such as a friendship status.<p>To exemplify this, imagine someone changes their status to say, &quot;You&#x27;re not my friend anymore.&quot; The database will eventually show everyone that the person in question is no longer your friend, but in the meantime, people aren&#x27;t going to be double-spending because you decided that you don&#x27;t like someone anymore.')
