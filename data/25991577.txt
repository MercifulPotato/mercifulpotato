The actions here are sending and\ndropping the notification, and the state describes a set of features about the person and the notification candidate. There\nare rewards for interactions and activity on Facebook, with\na penalty for sending the notification to control the volume\nof notifications sent. The policy optimizes for the long term\nvalue and is able to capture incremental effects of sending\nthe notification by comparing the Q-values of the send and\ndrop action<p>&gt; The training data spans multiple weeks to enable the RL model to capture page adminsâ€™ responses and interactions to the notifications with their managed pages over a long term horizon. The accumulated discounted rewards collected in the training allow the model to identify page admins with longterm intent to stay active with the help of being notified.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1811.00260.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arxiv.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;1811.00260.pdf</a>')
