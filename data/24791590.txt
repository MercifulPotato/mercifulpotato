If I have to come into the office 1 day a week, then I still have to foot the bill for a home office within driving range of the office, which sucks.<p>I think at once a quarter you&#x27;re starting to look at the ability to live on the other side of the country and fly in when necessary, which I think is much more price efficient.')
