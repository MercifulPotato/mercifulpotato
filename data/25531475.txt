I’ve played it on and off for decades, but it had been a while. After playing Doom 2016 I got curious how the original would stand up. With gzdoom, it was one of the best games I’ve played in recent years, better than Doom 2016. The navigation, movement speed, sound effects, enemy ai, map design are just brilliant. Lots of features don’t look impressive today, but judged from a “how fun is it” perspective, even the buggy ai is fantastic and gives massive replayability - decades of it apparently as long as you take 5 year breaks here or there and add mouse look')
