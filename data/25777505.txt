Data stays local, no ability to upload it online at all, and all processing is done without ever needing the internet.<p>That&#x27;s a key criteria if I ever was thinking of getting a smart wearable, I&#x27;m not going to generate even more data that can be profited from and potentially used against me.<p>It&#x27;s increasingly looking like storing data is a huge responsibility (although, if it <i>is</i> ever leaked, sadly humans don&#x27;t tend to see prison time for this crime).<p>What we need is a clause that says &quot;if this data ever touches the internet whether accidental or otherwise the CEO goes straight to jail, are you sure about this?&quot;.<p>Sadly, I think society as a whole is just &quot;used&quot; to this by now and a second thought is rarely given, disappointing this merger was approved, especially when the EU is investigating several &quot;anti trusts&quot;, why give them even more power?<p>Oh well, I&#x27;ll see you fellow HN readers on the next &quot;major data leakage from misconfigured MongoDB and nobody is punished&quot; thread.')
