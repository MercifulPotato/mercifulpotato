They can bike, walk, and use public transport as much as possible, but still use a car. It&#x27;s trivial to find out what cars have the least emissions, but what type of car would it be if you consider the total lifetime environmental impact, and the second-order affects from the used market that occur because of one&#x27;s choice? How would a total environmental impact metric be measured (combination of all CO2 emitted, rare metals mined, etc)? How would you find the details involved in the calculating the metric?<p>The priority is understanding it for average use, not as much the case where the car sits most of the time with little emissions at ~500 miles (800 km) &#x2F; year.<p>From perusing HN over the years, my inclination was towards an old, low emissions hybrid like a Prius. I realized this was more of a gut feeling and wanted to understand it better based on hard numbers and what metrics are most environmentally concerning.<p>Is it a used, high-mileage, low-emissions hybrid? Used BEV? New BEV?')
