Then I feel cornered. &quot;This isn&#x27;t my fault, I can&#x27;t escape it, and it&#x27;s just going to _keep happening to me like it always does_.&quot;<p>As soon as I think of any way to deal with something, or even if someone else says &quot;Yeah this sucks, let&#x27;s never do this again&quot; I feel relieved.<p>Like the time I bought some cheese sauce packets, not realizing they had been cut by a box cutter at the store and were leaking. I was angry until I realized I could just take them back to the store and exchange them.<p>So the hard part is suppressing my anger until a solution appears. I don&#x27;t know the trick to that yet.')
