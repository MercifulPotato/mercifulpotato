You could have picked xcp-ng, hyper-v, or just run a small Linux machine with QEMU-KVM that you could SSH in or VNC into and change. This would allow SCP or FTP capabilities for your ISOs and images. I&#x27;ve personally never used Proxmox, but I&#x27;d like to know how you ended up picking this one over other solutions. Why ditch ESXi?<p>How do you end up managing using the same VMs? Do you have a template and you clone the template? Or do you have a way of just running both a template VM and an application VM, and have the app VM use the template VM for most of it&#x27;s OS level needs. If you end up having 10 VMs, how do you properly update?')
