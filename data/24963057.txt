A decent fountain pen is a completely different experience.<p>I&#x27;ve mostly switched over to Staedtler Triplus fineliners for general writing - they&#x27;re much easier on my hands&#x2F;wrists[1], but retain the convenience of ballpoints.<p>[1] I have a joint disorder, and writing more than a couple of lines with most ballpoints will make my fingers and&#x2F;or wrists hurt. I can write for 20-30 minutes with the fineliners before they trigger the same issue.')
