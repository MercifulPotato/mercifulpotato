It would take a major mistake (or intentional action) to fail an orbital capture maneuver in such a way the asteroid would hit Earth instead. Most possible failures would just leave it hurtling through space, or orbiting the Earth in a suboptimal way. A correctly executed capture does not, at any point, pass through the state in which asteroid&#x27;s trajectory would make it hit the planet - so one of the best mitigations would be designing the mission in such a way that engines fail safe, and any kind of deviation from mission parameters leads to engine shutdown.<p>Of course, the very capability of altering trajectory of asteroids creates risks of its own, similar to the capability of splitting atom.')
