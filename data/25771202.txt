The waste. If I have some amount of cash in my wallet, what I&#x27;m able to do with it will depend on the market that&#x27;s available to me. Maybe I won&#x27;t be able to afford the same things others do in other places, but I should be able to take some advantage of it. Dying is dropping that cash down the gutter. It&#x27;s utterly wasteful, to put it politely.<p>I disagree. Go outside someday and pick up a stone. Chances are there are no other stones exactly like it in the entirety of the universe. Perhaps someday it could inspire something great, or be used to end someone&#x27;s life. But realistically it will likely just be a rock that sits there. Just like millions of other rocks.<p>Assuming the best is a romantic notion, but you just don&#x27;t know either way. But ask yourself this... if that rock were to suddenly vanish from existence, would your life really be any worse for it? Or could you just find another rock?<p>&gt;At the very least, couldn&#x27;t you seek someone terminally ill and live to fulfill their dream? Live the life they wanted? It could be a simple one. Doesn&#x27;t matter if you don&#x27;t manage to fulfill it, just part-way is fine<p>...Imagine you saw someone doing something that you loved. But you could see on their face that, at best, they derived no joy from it. At worst they didn&#x27;t want to be there, that it was something outside of their control that compelled them.<p>Forget the other person for a moment. Could you honestly say that seeing that would make you happy?<p>FWIW I did look into being a living organ donor. There&#x27;s a rather extensive psychological evaluation that goes with it though and you need to have a fairly strong social support circle for them to even entertain the idea. Can&#x27;t imagine why a bunch of doctors wouldn&#x27;t want someone that has no support circle to undergo a major surgery that would leave them too weak to do much on their own for weeks and very much vulnerable to a potentially lethal post operation infection.')
