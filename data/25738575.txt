Every game of this magnitude of complexity has shipped broken, even way back in the nineties. The Elder Scrolls series in particular comes to mind. Back then, you&#x27;d get patches from print media.<p>The games that didn&#x27;t ship broken simply weren&#x27;t that complex. Console games never were that complex. PC gamers gamers accepted this in order to be able to (sort of) play through an experience that was at the edge of what was possible. There was no Digital Foundry to count pixels and analyze frame drops. If you hit 20FPS most of the time, that was considered &quot;playable&quot;.<p>If a game like Cyberpunk 2077 can&#x27;t ship broken, then it can&#x27;t ship at all. It can&#x27;t even get produced. Nobody is going to put hundreds of millions of dollars on the line to <i>maybe</i> ship next year, forever. Nobody except maybe the Star Citizen community.')
