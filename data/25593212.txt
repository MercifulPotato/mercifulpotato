This is similar to how in the classical case you can use n bits to express at most 2^n different states.<p>Which one of the basis states we end up measuring depends on the squared of the complex amplitude of that state (Born rule). Therefore, if you were to simulate a quantum computer, in the <i>general case</i> you would need to keep track of these complex amplitudes belonging to the states, every 2^n of them. Because of the real and imaginary parts this amounts to 2*2^n=2^(n+1) numbers.')
