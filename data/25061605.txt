Part of the model&#x27;s calculation is that 8.8 points or whatever requires an enormous polling error to swing for trump.  I do agree that other polls should get criticism&#x2F;improve their methodologies to avoid the ~5 point margin in FL, or the 7.7 margin you listed.  And, I even think that they may not get as much criticism as their errors warrant because many of these states were off by 6+ points but still went for Biden. Still, Trafalgar has a unique methodology that should be understood better before they are extolled as the &quot;best pollster&quot;.  And, Trafalgar is not immune to similar polling errors, just in the other direction, and with a wrong result.  The delta may be more important from a statistical methodology standpoint, but these polls are measuring winner take all states, and &quot;The Trafalgar Groupâ€™s Robert Cahaly is an outlier among pollsters in that he thinks President Trump will carry Michigan, Pennsylvania, or both, and hence be reelected with roughly 280 electoral votes&quot; is a pretty poor prediction based on their data.  Does this mean that their data is necessarily poor? No, but it isn&#x27;t a good sign.')
