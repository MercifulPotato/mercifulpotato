Filtering means that the population was more homogeneous than real world populations.<p>2. Talent matters more the larger project you work on as a very big part of being fast is designing good abstractions to simplify the problem.<p>3. Not counting people who didn&#x27;t complete the project means that we remove the long tail of worst developers. If you do include the worst developers productivity which was 0 then it isn&#x27;t 10x, it is infinite x.')
