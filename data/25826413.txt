Item(by='bschne', descendants=None, kids=[25826759], score=None, time=1611002680, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25826251, text='Joined yesterday after it started taking off in part of Europe for some reason or other.<p>First impression is that it&#x27;s nice that people talk longer, don&#x27;t cut each other off as much as in other debates, etc. but it definitely sounds like mostly berlin tech entrepreneurs &amp; VCs (and some tech-adjacent politicians&#x2F;journalists&#x2F;...) at this point, and the &quot;diversity&quot; on panels is somewhat superficial (people from mildly different backgrounds who think alike vs. people from whatever background with deeper differences in viewpoints). That being said I also randomly ended up in a room with improvised music &amp; poetry, so there do seem to be different things going on.<p>I can see myself using this if the content diversifies further into different topics, e.g. I&#x27;d enjoy loose discussions about e.g. academic &#x2F; more technical topics, etc. For now it sounds mostly like your run of the mill panel discussion at a big tech conf., which can be inspiring for a bit but not everyday.')
