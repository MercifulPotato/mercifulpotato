I’m still unsure how active I’ll be able to be in the future due to it.<p>In my case it’s autoimmune; my body has decided it’s going to destroy itself from the inside out. Arthritis, psoriasis, GI issues. It’s getting worse fast enough that I’m being transferred to a hospital for care (Military, stationed overseas) and preparation for retirement.<p>I had a bad day yesterday; out taking care of errands to leave and everything flared. Sometimes there’s no discernible reason. It damned near floored me, but since I don’t have a vehicle I had to walk the couple kilometers back. It’s hard to describe how much ongoing pain changes who you are. It’s a constant struggle to not be an asshole because DAMNIT JUST LEAVE ME ALONE. It’s overwhelming and demoralizing. That’s before we get to the questions of what can you still do to make ends meet.')
