I&#x27;ve used a recording pulse oximeter when sleeping a number of times and the pulse seems to reliably predict when I get to sleep but nothing else, not even when I am awake vs. sleeping.  IMO, there is no possible way a pulse measurement could replace an EEG.  I am also not convinced that sleep tracking would be helpful at all for most people, at least beyond keeping a log with a basic estimate of how much sleep you think you got and how long you were in bed. And even that seems only rarely useful, mostly because I&#x27;ve found it isn&#x27;t obvious when I&#x27;ve had a month where I slept quite a bit less than usual.  So maybe the helpful part is putting it in a spreadsheet and doing some statistics.  But for most people I would guess that doing any sleep tracking would cause some disruption and be more harmful than helpful.')
