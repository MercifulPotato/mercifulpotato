(Section 3. contains the infamous terms for Leasing for Permitted Developer Services with the 24hr restriction). I don&#x27;t know if such terms would hold up in court. If I read the thing correctly, the the EULA forbids people from lending their MacBook to a friend, or even resell it, which strikes me as quite absurd.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;sla&#x2F;docs&#x2F;macOSBigSur.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.apple.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;sla&#x2F;docs&#x2F;macOSBigSur.pdf</a>')
