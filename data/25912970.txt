Reference is sometimes made to an undocumented Motorola 6800 instruction, but the term is from the Big Iron era, and has nothing to do with personal computing. It&#x27;s really from the &quot;Blinkenlichts&quot; era, when people commonly put up cartoons in the machine room showing a floating-point adder as a snake in a birdbath.<p>By the way, Big Iron&#x27;s abilities in the physical world were real. I occasionally operated a System&#x2F;360 with 4 2311 disk drives, 7.5MB monsters with the form factor of washing machines. When running the IBM sort program, these clunkers were apt to move around the machine room.')
