So, I do travel abroad a lot.<p>When I lived in the US, I had an individual plan through Costco (Delta Dental) that was quite a good deal. It was a Dental HMO plan, though. Really, the only thing I noticed that it did not cover was implants. However, Costco only offers it in a handful of states: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.costco.com&#x2F;dental-insurance-services.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.costco.com&#x2F;dental-insurance-services.html</a><p>Alternatively, you can get an individual dental plan through Delta Dental Plan in any state here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www1.deltadentalins.com&#x2F;individuals.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www1.deltadentalins.com&#x2F;individuals.html</a><p>In both cases above, if you get the Dental HMO, it has no annual or lifetime maximum dollar limits, no waiting periods, or pre-existing condition clauses.<p>Anyways, I used my American dental insurance to get cleanings, X-Rays, and fillings. I go to Europe a couple times a year at minimum anyways, so I use that to my advantage by getting more advanced dental care there.<p>Dental implants, especially Swiss implants, can be 8 times cheaper than what some dentists charge in the US. A Swiss implant, when all said and done, costs about $1000 USD in the more eastern EU countries.<p>You may want to check out this website: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whatclinic.com&#x2F;dentists&#x2F;worldwide" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whatclinic.com&#x2F;dentists&#x2F;worldwide</a><p>I would stick to European Union countries, as the quality of materials is very high. There is some website like the link I posted above, that has implant success rates posted, by dentist. I just do not remember the website&#x27;s name. Anyways, you take your time and do extensive research before you choose your dentist.<p>Anyways, I have a very rare immune-mediated disease affecting my autonomic nervous system, which affects salivation, so my teeth are totally jacked up, even though they look really nice. I also have type 1 diabetes, and it makes my teeth naturally more prone to infections. So, cost-wise, I am screwed when it comes to dental care. I know somebody with the rare disease I have, that has about 20 implants in her mouth.<p>But, if your teeth are really jacked up, and especially if you need implants (of course it is better than dentures), it is way cheaper to go to European Union countries. This is even for 1 implant. If you may need thousands of dollars in dental care, you may be better off going to the European Union to get that care.')
