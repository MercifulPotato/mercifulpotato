The temptations to abuse power so great, the feeling that it is necessary to steer the world in the &quot;right&quot; direction by holding onto office so immense, that any centralized election system will be abused.<p>The decentralized election system of the US is extremely resilient to tampering from the top. I <i>personally believe</i> the decentralized nature of the US election system is vital to its democracy. Think of the decentralized election system as a check and balance on power rather than a fair count of each person&#x27;s vote. That said, I think the US needs to do away with the electoral college middlemen and replace it with a direct vote tallied by each county that is reported by each State. The US also needs to make gerrymandering illegal')
