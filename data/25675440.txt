Nintendo has clearly earned a reputation for first party games above any other manufacturer. Nothing really competes with their first party games like BotW, Animal Crossing, Smash Bros, and so on.<p>I can get Call of Duty on PC, Xbox, Playstation. I don&#x27;t really see how that&#x27;s a compelling case for the Microsoft platform. The latest Xbox seems better than the PS5 in my opinion on hardware and price, but the PS5 still seems like a better buy because they have exclusive games and the Xbox Series s&#x2F;x does not.<p>I&#x27;d say among gamers it&#x27;s pretty universally agreed that the Switch is not a competing console with PC&#x2F;Xbox&#x2F;Playstation. It&#x27;s an &quot;And&quot; console. You don&#x27;t get a switch as an alternative to one of the above consoles, you get it as a supplement to the others. Unless you&#x27;re a casual gamer, in which case you probably just get the Switch.')
