I don&#x27;t use deduplication though which makes a huge difference.<p>So almost every OpenZFS community video&#x2F;talk I&#x27;ve seen recently has included a like like &quot;friends don&#x27;t let friends dedup&quot; or something to that effect... I think dedup is considered unnecessary&#x2F;dangerous these days with how good compression is. Not sure exactly what the dangers were, but I know that I wouldn&#x27;t even turn it on.<p>&gt; I chose Ubuntu 20.04 as OS since they are pushing ZFS support. Did consider FreeBSD as well where I had a positive experience in the past but since they are switching to OpenZFS anyway I stuck with Ubuntu since I&#x27;m running Debian derivatives on all my servers.<p>Same, I used to run lots of different OSes but I&#x27;ve settled down on Ubuntu for everything now, and OpenZFS having good support is what makes it possible there.')
