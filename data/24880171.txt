I end up liking this tile editor so much that I spent more time adding isometric features to it. Both because I love isometric maps and it seems to please people playing the game.<p>So, as in right now, I have a tile map editor (in a usable state) and a 2D engine that is not near close to be used, and I don&#x27;t know what to do with neither of them.<p>Anyways, isometric maps would hugely improve the looks of these 2D games. I would consider adding this options to your platform as well.<p>1 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;victorqribeiro&#x2F;tileEditor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;victorqribeiro&#x2F;tileEditor</a>')
