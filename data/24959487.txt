Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604238640, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24958476, text='&gt; To my ISP, NAT obscures device browsing history (assuming there are multiple people and devices within a household). To the best of my knowledge an ISP has no realistic way of engaging in mass browser fingerprinting.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of information that an ISP could silently listen in on, e.g. user-agent header, pre-STARTTLS cipher suites. And realistically how many people are there in a household, and how much do they reflect on each other? What&#x27;s the threat model where this is a realistic improvement in your privacy?<p>&gt; Sure, they can likely recover some amount of information by engaging in browser fingerprinting but right off the bat it makes their job harder.<p>&gt; Security and privacy both involve layers. Every bit of information leaked is a concession to an adversary.<p>Weak privacy measures are worse than nothing just like weak security measures. Putting in effort to obscure one or two bits is a false economy. One solid layer (e.g. Tor) will protect you far better than any number of weak layers.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t believe you. Shitty software is harmed by it. If you have concrete examples to the contrary, I&#x27;m open to them.<p>Everything peer-to-peer is made needlessly harder, and the result is centralisation that hurts the overall internet. E.g. in a non-NAT world, hosting a multiplayer game and letting your friends join is easy; with NAT, it&#x27;s hard enough that people rely on the manufacturer providing servers (which they won&#x27;t do indefinitely) instead.')
