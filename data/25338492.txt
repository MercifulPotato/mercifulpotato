Not sure how it could be impossible to use an electric range to &quot;properly&quot; cooj.<p>I find it MUCH easier to simmer at a low temperature with electric, and I prefer the dial a temp, over dial a volume of natural gas.  You don&#x27;t have to tinker nearly so often.  Want a nice slow boil, just set the temp, watch it run at 100% till it reaches the temp, then throttle back as the temp is reached.<p>Similarly when cooking any kind of reduction you don&#x27;t have to keep tinkering as larger fractions of the water cooks off.')
