To take the US tax system as an example it’s much more progressive than the flat tax starter you’re describing, where all income is taxed at the same rate. This does not stop inequality.<p>&gt; In 2016, the bottom 50 percent of taxpayers—those with adjusted gross incomes (AGI) below $40,078—earned 11.6 percent of total AGI. However, this group of taxpayers paid just 3 percent of all income taxes in 2016.<p>&gt; In contrast, the top 1 percent of all taxpayers (taxpayers with AGI of $480,804 and above), earned 19.7 percent of all AGI in 2016, and paid 37.3 percent of all federal income taxes. The top 1 percent of taxpayers accounted for more income taxes paid than the bottom 90 percent combined, who paid 30.5 percent of all income taxes.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taxfoundation.org&#x2F;america-progressive-tax-system&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;taxfoundation.org&#x2F;america-progressive-tax-system&#x2F;</a>')
