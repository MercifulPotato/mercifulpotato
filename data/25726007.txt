I hope that you&#x27;re able to reflect on this in the next few years as Donald Trump&#x27;s legacy will be similar to that of Nixon, if not worse. And deservedly so. I don&#x27;t believe any further conversation will be in the spirit of Hacker News&#x27; rules. I&#x27;m sorry your leader tricked so many of you and then immediately threw you all under the bus.<p>At moderation, I realize I&#x27;ve gotten to a point that you may consider &quot;flame bait&quot; and I&#x27;ll admit, my tensions are high due to the reprehensible nature of many of these comments and how sad I am for my country. I&#x27;m happy to have my comment removed of it doesn&#x27;t follow the guidelines.')
