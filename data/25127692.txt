The point of view isn&#x27;t directly relevant to the story being told. Certainly it helps, but one could imagine a story told from the daughters point of view where the black characters were more active. That&#x27;s the criticism GP is leveling, and it&#x27;s nuanced and well informed, and as far as I can tell you didn&#x27;t actually understand it fully. Lashing out at them as ignorant when you failed to grasp the point they were making is really rude.<p>There book might fit in a curriculum where you look at the representation of black people in media over time, say how they go bad or caricature to sort of flat and irrelevant to ultimately complex and human, but that&#x27;s probably a college level course, if only because it would require devoting 3-4 books to the same subtopic.')
