One of these conditions is that the companies in the market must be competing.<p>&gt; <i>You would be ok with different tax rates for different size corporations?</i><p>You mean like how individuals are taxed at different rates dependent on the size of their income?<p>&gt; <i>A committee &#x2F; agency to decide what is or is not an oligopoly?</i><p>We already have that: the court system. I&#x27;m not describing anything new here. Competition law in the US dates back at least to the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890.<p>&gt; <i>So, someone coming up with a new app that does something never done before, that would be a monopoly or oligopoly, right?</i><p>Having a monopoly by itself is fine; you just can&#x27;t leverage that monopoly to artificially inhibit competition.')
