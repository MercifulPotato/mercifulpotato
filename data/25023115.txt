The question I&#x27;m asking is, does that help America?<p>If you want to help America, it seems to me that allowing American businesses to grow the American economy is a straightforward means to do so, and telling American businesses to move their work elsewhere is a straightforward means to do the exact opposite.<p>Meanwhile, if you want to help H-1B immigrants to not be taken advantage of (which I personally think is at least as important), stop handcuffing them to their employers - do not give employers the ability to threaten them with deportation along with unemployment, and allow them to change jobs while being sponsored for a green card. Then they can compete freely in the labor market as well as citizens can, and their wages will rise naturally. Anything short of that is more government fiddling in the market, usually to the benefit of those who have won the game of regulatory capture.')
