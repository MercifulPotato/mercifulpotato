This isn&#x27;t a UI problem, it&#x27;s datastructures and algorithms. There are plenty of desktop apps with similar issues (representing a complex problem as a set of constraints and writing a solver to find a solution, and querying the solution for the data to display to a user).<p>I don&#x27;t reject that there are troubles in concerting real world data into a representation for the constraint solver. But this isn&#x27;t untrodden ground, and there&#x27;s no reason a front end developer should need to care about it. The problems you&#x27;re describing are far behind the UI; and if they&#x27;re not your organization has immense problems.')
