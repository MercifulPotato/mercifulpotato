Nothing is more passive-aggressive than a flashing &quot;12:00&quot; Just be blank, it&#x27;s fine.<p><i>- Quality-feel dial for function, or possibly buttons for this.</i><p>Stick with buttons for the functions, but make them real buttons that move, not membrane switches with no tactile feel. There can still be a membrane cover over it for ease of cleaning<p><i>- Dial could be pushed for start or other feature. Push again for pause. Push and hold for reset.</i><p>This must be done right, though. I hate a lot of multi-function dials that both spin and depress, because they often make it too easy to accidentally twist the knob a bit as you&#x27;re depressing it. Detents should be solid and deep to avoid this.<p><i>- Door opens downward, horizontally mounted.</i><p>Heh, I&#x27;d rather it swing upward, so it&#x27;s not in my way as I load or unload the oven.')
