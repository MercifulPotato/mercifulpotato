But I am still left wondering-- in one sentence, what is the product?  It&#x27;s great that you list the benefits of the product.  What is the product itself though?  I am left wondering, &quot;Is this product a map of colleagues where it shows their headshot&#x2F;avatar along with a message?&quot; -- i.e. is the product&#x2F;service actually the map at the bottom of the HelloHailey website?<p>Thanks!')
