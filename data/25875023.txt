But my casual following of the space leads me to believe that a high-performance open baseline of these architectures will be available and customization&#x2F;special purpose of these archs will be for purchase.<p>I&#x27;m hopeful some of the benefits will be contributed upstream.<p>As long as there is some competition in the architecture space (ARM, x86, risc-v), the more likely builders will share gains upstream to compete against rival platforms.<p>That&#x27;s my wishful thinking at least.')
