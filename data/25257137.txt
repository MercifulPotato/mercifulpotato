Why should my internet bill triple over the span of a few years while speeds decrease unless I call, wait on hold for a day, and ask to cancel service?<p>- There weren&#x27;t an aspect of double dipping -- why are we being charged for peak bandwidth (with absolutely no guarantee of reaching those speeds) and _also_ being charged for exceeding bandwidth caps equivalent to a few dozen minutes of full use? Why is that &quot;extra&quot; bandwidth more expensive than buying several extra full internet plans?<p>- It didn&#x27;t open the door to metering different content sources differently based on the ISP&#x27;s monopolistic whims.<p>There are physical bandwidth limits, and those need to be allocated somehow, but the status quo isn&#x27;t great.')
