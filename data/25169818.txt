Every desk in the building is equipped with aeron chair and multiple monitors. Yes every single one in the whole skyscraper (10 000 employees).<p>That includes multiple floors full of developers. On our floor the entire department had quadruple monitors (24&quot; IPS Dell UltraSharp monitors if you&#x27;re interested). Allegedly we&#x27;re privileged because the norm is only 3 monitors for developers, the story goes that when the department was opened almost 20 years ago the head decided that developers would get proper equipment or the department wouldn&#x27;t be opened.<p>Back to Dell, many companies are simply procuring equipment from Dell. The most classic display they sell is the Dell UltraSharp 24&quot; IPS display, which is really good and really affordable.<p>London is the biggest tech hub in Europe with the most tech companies, quite of few of which are very serious about equipment because tech culture. I&#x27;ve not seen a company that didn&#x27;t have dual displays since I moved here. I can&#x27;t imagine a company that can&#x27;t buy a display if you tell them what do buy. I don&#x27;t want to jump into &quot;just leave your company&quot; because it&#x27;s a bad HN trope, especially in COVID times, but come on, if your company can&#x27;t procure a display&#x2F;chair you can find a better company.')
