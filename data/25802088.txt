However, <i>scattering</i> (aka diffusion) should be a <i>waaay</i> lower priority at your first-reflection points. In fact, if you&#x27;re absorbing with enough mass at these points there shouldn&#x27;t be much high or mid-range energy left to scatter. And for the low-mid and low freq energy that isn&#x27;t being completely absorbed you&#x27;d need a hilariously-large diffuser to scatter wavelengths of those size. So don&#x27;t even worry about diffusion paneling of any kind on your front walls. Just absorb, absorb, absorb at your early-reflection points.<p>I personally use several 5.25&quot; GIK Acoustic panels with another 5&quot; air gap between the back of the panel and the wall. At my listening position I have them placed on the wall to my left, my right, and have several panels hanging above my head with as much of an air-gap between them and the ceiling as I can allow to absorb the ceiling-reflections. There&#x27;s more nuance to how I determine the exact positioning, but that&#x27;s the general layout.<p>--------<p>I&#x27;d also like to reinforce the idea that for anyone who needs to make critical audio decisions you should <i>absolutely</i> be investing the time, money and effort to get your room treated&#x2F;tuned to it&#x27;s full potential. Otherwise it will undermine every decision you make until you do. You simply cannot make good decisions without A) excellent monitoring (speakers) and B) A properly-tuned room. To ignore either of these is to deceive yourself. Consider it your highest priority before you even consider spending money on additional hi-fi audio gear beyond your speakers. If you can&#x27;t hear your speakers honestly and with minimal interference from the room then there&#x27;s little point in focusing on the finer details.<p>---------<p>If you really want to hear how your room is affecting your audio then play a low and steady note (say a 60 Hz sine wave) and then walk around your room while it&#x27;s playing. Listen for how dramatically the volume of this <i>single</i> note will fluctuate as you change position. It will likely vary from overbearingly loud to near-total silence. Now consider that every other note that you can possibly hear - from the lowest sub to the highest buzz) will also be subject to these kinds of boosts and dips in volume. Then you&#x27;ll have some sort of idea of what you&#x27;re up against.')
