Instead..they watch videos.\nI also can&#x27;t stand inner company politics. If I never have to talk to my colleagues it&#x27;s the best.\nWhen I joined that company there was one guy who said, &quot;we&#x27;re all freaks here, what kind of freak are you&quot;.\nI never saw myself as a freak.\nThe company imploded in the new economy bubble because management thought that spending 250k on Reamon (the singer) was a good investment. Then they didn&#x27;t have enough money to pay their developers that were by 9&#x2F;10 from Russia or Romania, imported. We sued and never saw our money. The product was sold to T-Online (Deutsche Telekom) as the TOM (T-Online Messenger) and the CEO fled to Switzerland with the money he made from the sale. We didn&#x27;t see 1 cent.\nWhat&#x27;s also interesting, on paper the chiefs like the CTO and the head recruiter earned 20fold of what the code monkeys earned.\nIt was also a family business and they called themself a company that was noted on the stock exchange but in reality wasn&#x27;t registered there.\nThe brother of a, at that time prominent TV moderator was an investor in that company.')
