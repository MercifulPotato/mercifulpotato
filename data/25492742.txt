Item(by='wolverine876', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608534293, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25490759, text='Might you consider a tabletop RPG game (TTRPG) rather than a computer game? Espionage, more than anything, is about human nature, unexpected situations, creative use of information, and matching wits with other people. The significant advantage of a TTRPG over a computer game is that the &#x27;AI&#x27; for a TTRPG is human. No AI can come close for creativity, versatility, and of course human nature.<p>To add an essential distinction: I mean OSR-style (Old School Renaissance) TTRPGs. For those familiar with &#x27;modern&#x27; TTRPGs, like the 5th edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, OSR interactions are minimally defined by rules - powers, stats, skills, proficiencies, etc.- relatively few of those exist. Most of it is free-form improvisational interaction between the players and dungeon master (DM). For example, if you want to find something in a room, you don&#x27;t roll something based on your perception score (you don&#x27;t have one); it&#x27;s up to the player, who can do anything at all. You tell the DM what you do (&#x27;I examine the bookshelves more closely - what condition are they in?&#x27;), and the DM tells you how the environment responds (&#x27;the old shelves don&#x27;t sag at all while there&#x27;s a thick layer of dust on them, except in a couple of places&#x27;); (&#x27;what books are in those spots? I stand to the side and nudge one gently with the tip of my walking stick, at arms length&#x27;) ... There are plenty of guidelines for the DM to deal with all the different situations, but it&#x27;s really up to help the DM to respond. The players, as I said, can do whatever they want without even knowing the rules for many purposes.<p>Another way of conceiving of it is that it&#x27;s a collaborative story where the player controls the protagonist and the DM controls the rest of the world, and they improvise together - both experience a lot of dramatic tension, not knowing what the other knows, plans or will do. Hopefully, I&#x27;m describing it well enough that you can see how it would play very well for an espionage setting.')
