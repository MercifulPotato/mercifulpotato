If this actually worked (and the global dependencies didn&#x27;t interfere with each other), this could pave way to a binary cache over the Internet so that we don&#x27;t need to recompile the same crates over and over and over again for each project.<p>Kind of like Nix and its binary cache, but for Rust. I mean, Nix handles global packages just fine (unlike Python and Ruby). An Internet cache for Rust could be hosted by the Rust team (for public crates on crates.io) or be provided as a service for private code like Cachix[0].<p>PS: I know there is sccache, but it isn&#x27;t suitable for a global binary cache.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cachix.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cachix.org&#x2F;</a>')
