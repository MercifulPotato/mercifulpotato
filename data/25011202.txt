Item(by='duskwuff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604697102, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25006215, text='&gt; Anyone have some insights on what a registrar usually needs to do to add a country&#x27;s TLD?<p>ccTLDs are the Wild West. It&#x27;s hard to generalize -- practically every ccTLD does <i>something</i> weird that makes it difficult to support, though.<p>A few examples of areas where ccTLDs behave significantly differently from gTLDs are:<p>• Many ccTLDs require registrants to have some form of personal or business presence in the country. The requirements for how the registrant must prove that presence can vary.<p>• Some ccTLDs have unusual processes surrounding domain expirations and renewals. For example, under some ccTLDs, domains always expire at the end of a month, rather than exactly a year after registration. Additionally, some ccTLDs restrict when domains can be renewed -- for example, .au domains can only be renewed within 90 days of their expiration, and .eu domains cannot be renewed within 5 days of expiration.<p>• Domain transfers can get weird as well. gTLDs have a standardized process for domain transfer authorization; ccTLDs often modify this system or replace it entirely.')
