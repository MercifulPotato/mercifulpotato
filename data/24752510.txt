There&#x27;s now a warrant out for your arrest and an additional charge, and you&#x27;ve torpedoed pretty much any chance of leniency.<p>If it&#x27;s a serious enough crime, they <i>will</i> come looking for you, and you will not be offered bail a second time. If it wasn&#x27;t too serious, they might not come looking for you, but you&#x27;ll have an active warrant so any traffic stop, background check, etc is going to be a huge problem for you. Arguably a worse punishment than whatever you would have gotten if you just showed up at trial.<p>Maybe if you&#x27;re planning to never visit that state again or if you&#x27;re leaving the country entirely and never want to return it might work out, but generally committing additional crimes after you&#x27;ve already been caught for one crime isn&#x27;t a good idea.')
