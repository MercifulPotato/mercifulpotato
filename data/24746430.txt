The app is now cluttered with too much suggestions  about restaurants, places and suggestions I have no interest about on the moment.<p>I recently re-installed Here maps (which I loved on windows mobile) and my country railway app has built-in bus data so it can help plan travels as well.<p>I didn&#x27;t saw any hints about it in the article but are they going to build an app around it ?<p>Edit: ah, they don&#x27;t have public transport schedules yet.')
