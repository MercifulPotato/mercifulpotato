(I doubt &quot;most&quot;, but I also doubt &quot;most&quot; for any single language once you include JS for front-end&#x2F;&quot;full stack&quot;, Java for &quot;back end&quot;, and Python for ML&#x2F;DS focus.)<p>Bootcamps sell themselves based on employment placement, not cool technology or deep knowledge. In this regard RoR, Java, and even PHP are going to be bootcamp milch cows for years to come.')
