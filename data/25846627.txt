From what Iâ€™m reading, telegram messages were initially sent between offices by telegraph. In later years, the word has come to simply mean a message that is delivered by the post quickly, regardless of their internal transfer method between offices (which could be telex or later the internet). The list may not be wrong, but it is not on topic.')
