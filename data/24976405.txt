I know lots of Steam users, many more than 5. I know zero Brave users. Really, there&#x27;s no way it is anywhere near as popular as they claim.<p>&gt; &quot;The average CTR (click-through rate) for a Brave Ads campaign is 9%, well above the industry average of just 2%&quot;<p>Again, another huge red flag. There&#x27;s nothing special about Brave browser. It just means there is some adversary, like bots, clicking ads, or they are lying.<p>I&#x27;m sure people will downvote this, or talk about whom they know uses Brave. Whatever. I would love to see a real audited number here.')
