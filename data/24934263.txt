Here&#x27;s an example [1]. Frankly I don&#x27;t see said decals even in the non-branded entrances[2]<p>They&#x27;re going to have a very hard time convincing the commissioner that people were in fact aware of these decals AND any &quot;privay policy&quot; therein. A simple survey would easily show that people are completely clueless about it (anecdote: I used to frequent CF malls quite a bit when I was in Toronto and never saw anything of the sort, even despite being the type of person that might actually read random stuff posted at entrances).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@43.7788812,-79.3447734,3a,75y,148.54h,94.37t&#x2F;data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s5B1G-auvoo88FoFpyBxnBQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@43.7788812,-79.3447734,3a,75y,1...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@43.7789409,-79.3444783,3a,75y,186.41h,89.72t&#x2F;data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sjhm0Trt4WroYDcqQTdJgDw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;maps&#x2F;@43.7789409,-79.3444783,3a,75y,1...</a>')
