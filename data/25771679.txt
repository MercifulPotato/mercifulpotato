They didn&#x27;t ban the constant death threats from teenagers against each other and random celebrities they felt like canceling that week. They didn&#x27;t ban the people who coordinated to loot a drug store in my neighborhood even though I reported them. They didn&#x27;t ban rioters in Chicago who live streamed torching businesses. They didn&#x27;t ban people who were literally convicted of murder.<p>But they sure got together fast to put up billboards in destroyed neighborhoods bragging about how they helped elevate protests. And they sure were proud of coordinating against right wing wackos in DC.<p>TOS are never enforced consistently and GAFA is a neoliberal technocratic echo chamber that feigns social progressivism in order to coordinate anti-labor, anti-speech actions.')
