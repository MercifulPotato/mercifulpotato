A DO is a doctor, full stop. Aside from there being different organizations, there is no difference between what an MD can do and a DO. In fact, a DO is trained in OMM while an MD is not. DOs have <i>more</i> training than MDs, not less. A lot (I think most, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure) of residency programs are combined and will accept either credentials. Many are still DO-only.<p>Med schools conferring a DO degree have identical admissions processes to those conferring MDs. It may be unintentional but the wording of the quoted phrase makes it seem like if you can&#x27;t get into an MD program you will either go &quot;down&quot; and apply to a DO program, or not go into medicine.<p>&gt; <i>there&#x27;s something disturbing about the fact that GPs and family doctors have to invest so much time and undertake so much debt just to become professional symptom Googlers</i><p>I&#x27;m not defending the ludicrous price of medical school (which is due in large part to the AMA&#x27;s physician cap that you mentioned), but even mediocre GPs are much more than &quot;professional symptom Googlers.&quot;')
