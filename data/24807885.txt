Also, Python is much worse in this: any call can be monkey patched at basically any point during the execution, but people do not (usually) use this as an example of poor language designing. You expect the programmer to use the language features considerately.<p>BTW, in C++ every call is resolved at compile time, and the compiler could tell you what you are exactly doing at each line, including whether your examples are function calls or casts. If you dump the right table in GCC the information is there, although it&#x27;s a pity there is no convenient way to access it. Cppexplorer helps a little bit, but I always find it difficult to understand. It&#x27;s a problem of tooling, though, the language is well defined.')
