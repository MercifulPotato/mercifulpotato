As far as I can tell, the lawsuit really does exist.<p>Straight up fabrication is not the only way to disinform, and it&#x27;s in fact it&#x27;s a pretty shitty way to do it, since it means your disinformation collapses at the slightest scrutiny.  To make fabrication effective, the fabrication needs to be laundered to give it credibility (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tR_6dibpDfo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=tR_6dibpDfo</a>), which takes time and effort.<p>A more effective way to disinform is to pluck out a true story that&#x27;s not representative and amplify or twist it.  That will seem more credible to those who give it just a little scrutiny, even if it&#x27;s just as wrong as a fabrication in some ways.<p>In this case, if the NY Post has a bone to pick with Twitter, it could troll through lawsuits against it until it found one that made scandalous claims, then report those as hard facts.')
