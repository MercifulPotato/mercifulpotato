I&#x27;m saying that solid state batteries are decades out to be commercially viable. And one indicator of how far out is their lack of existence in day to day items like phones. The reason why you want to pay attention to that is because for batteries, big batteries are just small batteries joined together. So if you don&#x27;t even have a small battery, like in a phone, on a commercial level, the big ones, like for an EV, are nowhere near mass commercialization. Sure you can make a couple of cars a year and sell them for 200k, but that&#x27;s nowhere near the rosy picture the article posts. My bet, we don&#x27;t see any mass commercialization in this decade.')
