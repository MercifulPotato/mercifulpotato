I can open the PC and swap out power supply, HDD&#x2F;SSD, 5.25 inch devices and expansion cards without any tools. Only the motherboard, CPU (depending on heat sink design) and cooling fans are screwed in. And there are even spare screws inside the case for unused slots&#x2F;devices. And while somewhat unpopular, they use custom connectors that reduce the number of cables (modern PCs don&#x27;t really need the fat ATX bundle), and cables are cut to length, and the case has holders for each cable - virtually no cable management needed.<p>I wish consumer devices were that easy to maintain and upgrade.')
