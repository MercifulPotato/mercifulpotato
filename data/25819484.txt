Google doesn&#x27;t own or control &quot;the internet&quot;. They can change Google Chrome however they want; so long as they are plenty of us who don&#x27;t want whatever crap they are peddling we can and will continue to use the internet as it has existed for a long time.<p>2. Web browsing is not &quot;the internet&quot;. I get that headlines are all about grabbing attention by basically stating overblown lies and then backtracking in the details, but come on now.<p>3. Cookies aren&#x27;t going away. They are necessary for how a majority of websites with login&#x2F;sessions work.<p>4. 3rd party cookies are crap, and they may well be limited by most popular browsers. That is fine and doesn&#x27;t affect normal web users. It affects advertisers to some degree, but no more than adblockers do.<p>5. So long as Google is involved in it, they are going to try to keep advertising profitable for themselves. So whatever &quot;it&#x27;s good for everyone&quot; nonsense they are peddling its just them trying to prevent the public from shutting down the crappy internet advertising that most of us internet users have hated since it began.<p>6. It doesn&#x27;t sound like they are working to prevent fingerprinting. That is the direction things should go imo; we need to get rid of all ability to identify visitors period. There is no reason why anyone needs to know what websites I visit or why, and I think there are plenty of people who agree with my desire in that regard.<p>7. I&#x27;m on the side of those calling to abandon Google and their nonsense. They can&#x27;t be trusted any more.')
