When you&#x27;re all about an hours drive away in different directions it&#x27;s really handy to keep track on people&#x27;s progress without disturbing their driving.<p>Two bits of feedback if you don&#x27;t mind:<p>1) I only realised the other day that the tracking link didn&#x27;t automatically change between activations (I now realise I can do it manually).<p>2) When meeting up with someone in the middle of nowhere recently, I noticed that it&#x27;d show their location on the map, but not mine. As I didn&#x27;t know where I was, having a blue dot of my location so I can estimate their distance would be really handy.<p>Thank you again :)')
