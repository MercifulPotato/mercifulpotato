It is much harder to make sure people will receive your mail and it not be in their junk mail. I&#x27;m still seeing lots of email to mailing lists, with impeccable message content, ending up in spam based on mail server reputation or content similarity metrics. If you&#x27;re running an organisation that can be very costly. If only a fraction of your recipients mark you as spam you&#x27;ll get lots of misses.<p>Handcrafting your own internet stack is very libertarian, but it doesn&#x27;t scale to anyone without access to deep tech expertise. Even governments decide they can&#x27;t run mail any more. And  I would argue that this isn&#x27;t something you can fix about email. The problem is that the next system isn&#x27;t federated at all -- it&#x27;s balkanised and monetized: WhatsApp&#x2F;Messenger, iMessage, Duo, Telegram, etc etc.')
