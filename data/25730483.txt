Item(by='jhardy54', descendants=None, kids=[25730575], score=None, time=1610380130, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25730379, text='&gt; You can split it so that each subgroup of the five can reconstruct the entire phrase.<p>How? Example: Split a secret phrase (&quot;correct horse battery staple&quot;) between 4 friends with a quorum of 2.<p>- Alice: correct<p>- Bob: horse<p>- Carol: battery<p>- Dave: staple<p>Great! But that&#x27;s a quorum of 4. How do we reduce it to 2? Each person needs two words:<p>- Alice: correct horse<p>- Bob: battery staple<p>- Carol: correct horse<p>- Dave: battery staple<p>But what if Alice and Carol want to get the secret? Or Bob and Dave? Well, each person needs the entire secret.<p>- Alice: correct horse battery staple<p>- Bob: correct horse battery staple<p>- Carol: correct horse battery staple<p>- Dave: correct horse battery staple<p>...but now the quorum is 1, and all of them just have a copy of your secret. If you want to be able to have arbitrary quorums, you need cryptography.')
