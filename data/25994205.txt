But having seen how things are playing out in Seattle has definitely given me more nuance to my support for this.<p>The major one is that decriminalizing drugs cannot mean decriminalizing crime(theft) done to support addiction. Seattle has moved in this direction which has thrown its legal system into utter chaos as it has pretty much legalized petty crime for a certain class of people.<p>Being compassionate does not mean letting people do whatever they want.
