It was dry, factual, scientific.<p>Which services banned Trump&#x27;s recent medical report? I would have assumed &quot;Twitter blocks Trump medical record release&quot; had been in the news and cannot find a single story about it. There was this tweet from Trump (not his doctor) that got flagged as containing COVID-19 misinformation, but was not deleted[1]:<p>&gt; A total and complete sign off from White House Doctors yesterday. That means I can’t get it (immune), and can’t give it. Very nice to know!!!<p>There&#x27;s a good reason Twitter flagged this: Trump is full of crap and idiotic tweets like this will literally get people killed. COVID-19 recovery definitely does not provide immunity to reinfection.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;policy&#x2F;technology&#x2F;520550-twitter-labels-trump-tweet-on-coronavirus-immunity-as-misleading" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;policy&#x2F;technology&#x2F;520550-twitter-labels-...</a>')
