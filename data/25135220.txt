Item(by='barnacled', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605695621, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25135156, text='RE: climate hysteria I was actually responding to the parent who was saying this was nowhere near enough.<p>RE: Viability, I mean perhaps I worded that poorly - I think it&#x27;s _possible_ to do it, I just think it will be exceptionally difficult (there are many roads that are not so simple to just dig up, huge HUGE disruption caused, etc. etc.) and require probably £100&#x27;s of billions.<p>My issue is more that the govt have absolutely not addressed or even mentioned that, and many engaged in this debate won&#x27;t accept that this is a requirement.<p>&gt;I think you take a commonly-seen approach that tends to argue that any even moderate efforts to deal with the problem are too extreme.\nNot at all. I simply do not consider a multi-£100bn investment requiring basically every single residential street in Britain to be dug up and every single substation upgraded (not to mention other parts of the grid that will need upgrading) to be moderate and dislike when people talk about this govt action as if that isn&#x27;t required.<p>Actually I would 100% advocate for only hybrids by 2030 (which the govt actually does advocate), but not a banning of hybrids by 2035 as it also advocates. Also more govt pressure to make hybrids considerably more efficient (they are already pretty impressive). Perhaps look at banning hybrids also by 2050? Or some reasonably practical timeframe.<p>I&#x27;d also want to start the program of increasing charging points and substation infrastructure but on a more reasonable timeframe, but be honest about it and get the ball rolling NOW, not in 2030. Something like &#x27;every X streets must have at least Y charging points&#x27; could be a start. Practicality.<p>What I&#x27;d also want to look at is - more nuclear, more renewables, investigate means of reducing usage of flights, investment into public transport (outside of London it sucks big time, and more generally e.g. trains are the most expensive in Europe + also the least reliable), more advocacy for work from home, greater subsidies in decarbonisation, but more than anything using economic pressure in league with other countries to pressure (and also not only pressure but help via aid) highly polluting developing countries to reduce carbon output.<p>There is plenty that can be done, I just don&#x27;t think hand waving + denial of costs will actually achieve anything. In fact I think it HARMS the climate change cause more than anything.')
