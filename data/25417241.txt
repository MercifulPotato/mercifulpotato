My jurisidiction on the eve of the <i>corona pandemic</i> actually passed a lot to ban full-face covering, worded neutrally, but everyone knew it was about certain Islāmic garments. Supposedly it was necessary that every citizen&#x27;s face be publicly recognizable, yet now we all cover it with masks to no problem whatsoever.<p>Even without a pandemic, a man should have the right to obscure his face in public and be unrecognizable for whatever reason he might desire.')
