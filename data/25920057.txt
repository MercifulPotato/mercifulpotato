Can anybody share their experiences or perhaps in production?<p>Datomic and Crux uses datalog which from the online learning wizard appears to be pretty useful at writing very detailed questions about data in the present and past, it does appear to have a very high learning curve.<p>On the other hand, Mariadb offers Temporal Tables which seems to be what I&#x27;m after and its still a normal MySQL table that everybody is familiar with, concern being scalability and whether if there are anybody in production using it.<p>Timescaledb seems orientated for storing ticker data but unsure what is query functionality is but if its built to scale for lots of writes perhaps this might be the optimal tool. I am not sure if it offers immutability.<p>Crux is also an interesting open source alternative to Datomic but at this point not sure what its offerings are over Datomic.')
