The correct solution is to teach people not to mis-use it.<p>We have had plenty of words that have drifted in meaning, only to be replaced by a new word that means exactly the same thing as the original word originally meant. There are several circumstances that cause this to happen. One is if the meaning of the word is mis-understood. There isn&#x27;t any reason to believe that the replacement word will be any better-understood, so it will likely drift in meaning as well. Another is if the word becomes seen as offensive in some way. Then a new word replaces it with the intention of meaning the same thing, but in a non-offensive manner (which the original word originally had anyway). The new word will also soon afterwards become seen as offensive, and another replacement will have to be introduced.<p>It would be much less confusing if words just kept meaning the same thing.')
