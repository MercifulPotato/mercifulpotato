Item(by='pkorzeniewski', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611756308, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25925926, text='I try to buy as little new furniture as possible and instead look for antiques - they&#x27;re better in every way, the build quality, materials, appearance etc, and often you can get them quite cheap. It&#x27;s also less wasteful than buying crappy stuff that won&#x27;t last decades and you won&#x27;t end up with a bland interior straight from IKEA catalogue. Yes, it takes some time to find what you need and often you need to make some restoration, but in my opinion it&#x27;s absolutely worth the time for the reasons metioned above. To be fair there are some items that make more sense to buy new and we have several things from IKEA, but overall the majority of furniture in our house are antiques.')
