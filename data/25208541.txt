Item(by='Mizza', descendants=None, kids=[25208863], score=None, time=1606307744, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25208326, text='I actually have a degree in psychology with a concentration in neuroscience, so I took a range of hard-science neurology classes and the required &quot;softer&quot; classes, and I came away with the belief the field is, largely, a sham. There are exceptions, but even some of the &quot;hard science&quot; subfields are really just soft-science with technological window dressings.<p>I mean this at both low and high levels. At the low level, there are field-wide issues with reproducibility, p-hacking, sample size and selection, deliberate ignorance of compounding variables, etcetera. At the high level, the field simply cannot do what it claims to be able to do - explain the emergence of the mind and its role in behavior decision making, and will not be able to do so with the current approach that it takes, and it has very little to show in the way of falsifiability and predictive power.<p>The utility of even the basic stuff like operant conditioning breaks down outside of all but the most constrained lab conditions, but it is largely not discussed for the same reasons I mentioned above - it is too uncomfortable to admit. I think the politics surrounding the &#x27;Rat Park&#x27; experiment[0] is an illustration of this.<p>There are counter-examples - behavioral and drug therapies which &quot;work&quot; (although it&#x27;s often hard to say _why_ within any definitive proof) - but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re enough to shore up the whole field against this criticism.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rat_Park" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rat_Park</a>')
