The display server &#x2F; compositor is also the &quot;window manager&quot;.<p>Client applications have their own buffer they draw on, and they negotiate the details of its handling with the compositor which manages the <i>composition</i> of all client buffers (and other data, such as input events) to form the final result.<p>I suppose it&#x27;s technically possible to write a protocol that involves a third client process (a &quot;window manager&quot;) to draw something around another client&#x27;s buffer and tell the compositor how to position things, but that sounds like a nightmare to synchronize.')
