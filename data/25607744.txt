Dealing with children is incredibly taxing and difficult. Teachers are [in my country] underpaid and under-appreciated and I believe this kind of rhetoric doesn’t do them justice. People began to appreciate teachers during the pandemic’s home schooling period, but that seems [anecdotally] to have dropped off since children have returned to regular schooling.<p>&gt; when I hit college and realized &quot;Hold on, I can just get up &amp; go?.&quot;<p>Because you were [likely] an adult now who needs to be able to regulate their own behaviours.
