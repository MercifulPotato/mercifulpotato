It&#x27;s common for people in Seattle to point out that they don&#x27;t file police reports for theft because it&#x27;s a bunch of work waiting on the police to arrive (it can take hours) and filling out a police report only for the police&#x2F;prosecutors&#x2F;judges to literally do nothing about it. So anecdotally, people say property crime is underreported.<p>Also, police departments and mayors have every incentive to keep reported crime lower. The LAPD, for instance, has a history of underclassifying crimes to maintain appearances that their city was safe: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;crime&#x2F;la-me-lapd-reclass-20141226-story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;local&#x2F;crime&#x2F;la-me-lapd-reclass-20141...</a><p>Also, the OP specifically pointed to 10-year statistics, not 20. Isn&#x27;t it at all concerning that we&#x27;re erasing all the progress we&#x27;ve made over the course of decades?')
