You can host sshd without root, or host sshd but disable root login. Rooting and setting a password, or opening remote command channels for that matter, are separate things. Root allows you to shoot yourself in the foot more than you could otherwise, but you do need to pull the trigger.<p>The default root methods just enable apps to request root, after which the user gets a prompt.
