I didn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t need GPIO. I actually want more GPIO so I could connect a &quot;hat&quot;, an infrared port, a cooler and still have spare pins for actual tinkering.<p>Another cool thing available exclusively with Raspberry Pi is polished Raspbian OS coming with free Mathematica and other goodies.<p>Hardware codecs also feels nice and, AFAIK, you don&#x27;t get them with x86.<p>At last but not at least (this arguably is the most valuable part actually) it is THE SBC. This means it&#x27;s easy and efficient to target for a developer (incl hardware developers) and easy and efficient to share problems and solutions for the community.')
