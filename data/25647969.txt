Daylight saving time gives you more daylight during the hours people are awake, but only because it forces everyone to wake up earlier!<p>We already have major issues with e.g. making teenagers wake up earlier than most of their bodies are tuned for at that age. How much worse is it going to be if they have to get up an hour <i>earlier</i> in the winter? (Remember: what our bodies consider &quot;early&quot; is dependent on when the sun rises, and not the numbers we put on our clocks.)<p>And just to top it off, you&#x27;ll be forcing a lot of kids to walk to school in the dark.<p>---<p>Edit: To be clear, it&#x27;s not just children!<p>On weekends and holidays when people don&#x27;t have to work, how much of the population do you think wakes up right when the sun rises, in order to maximize their daylight? I certainly don&#x27;t have any data on this, but I would guess a large majority take the opportunity to sleep in.<p>Having extra daylight seems really nice at first, and it is. Unfortunately, shifting clocks doesn&#x27;t actually create more sun, it just creates a societal mandate. My view is that we <i>already</i> start our workdays too early, particularly when you take commute times into account.')
