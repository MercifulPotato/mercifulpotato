Unfortunately we have a significant collection of old demos and games targeting SVGAlib, but at this point it&#x27;s probably best to just run them in a virtualized linux environment lacking any graphics drivers so SVGAlib can run the show on a faked VGA.  For such apps where source is available, it&#x27;s better to just port to something like SDL.')
