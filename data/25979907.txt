Articles like this, and ones about privacy (there&#x27;s some overlap), always focus on LGBT, activists, whistleblowers etc but people in more mainstream groups participate in identity compartmentalization as well. Sometimes they&#x27;ll open an account for their pet, other times they&#x27;ll just share less intimate details on more open platforms. I&#x27;ve long thought PGP and derivative keys are a good solution for this.')
