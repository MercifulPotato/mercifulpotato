He&#x27;s pretty angry about this change.<p>I somewhat understand Google&#x27;s stance on this, as it&#x27;s a service that should be allowed to make money even on people who don&#x27;t want to make money. They don&#x27;t really have such a way to opt out of pretty much any other service of theirs that has monetization.<p>But at the same time, there are people who have so heavily invested into the YouTube ecosystem with certain expectations for a very long time, and pretty much have their entire business on there, so they can&#x27;t very easily take their business elsewhere if they&#x27;re unhappy with the change.<p>This isn&#x27;t a &#x27;Netflix raising their subscription cost&#x27; scenario, where users can just cancel their subscription and sign up for a different service. It would be a massive undertaking to shift their backlog of videos onto another service, and they&#x27;d lose all their existing subscribers and have to build it up elsewhere.<p>So in that respect, it&#x27;s kind of a shitty move by Google.')
