What are they getting in return? Don&#x27;t say &quot;food, shelter, and education&quot; because in your scenario, they already get those. What are we doing to incentivize these people to provide food, shelter, and education for everyone else?<p>&gt; I think that is the point being made when people talk about abolishing work and offering all the basics for free. I believe its a correct premise aswell. We are not talking about luxury.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about luxury either. I&#x27;m asking where the food, shelter, and education for everyone is supposed to come from.<p>&gt; As soon as we hire people we provide them with all these basic perks, they are not conditional, because we believe if we are sending soldiers to fight we better provide them with the best chances of succeeding.<p>They are conditional upon satisfactory performance of the duties they were hired to perform.<p>&gt; Its the same idea society-wide. If you mean you fire the employees that don&#x27;t perform you&#x27;d be right, but governments could create brackets.<p>You want governments to provide better food and shelter for certain people? Who gets the best food? The people in charge, or what?<p>&gt; The point is, in this day and age there&#x27;s no reason why we couldn&#x27;t provide every citizen of a developed society all these basic things.<p>For a few months, maybe. Who is supposed to work to replenish the food once it is eaten?<p>&gt; You could argue shelter is the most expensive but there are examples like Singapore solving the issue society-wide.<p>Actually I think shelter is the easiest, food and energy are the ones that are going to be consumed until they are gone and would need to be rationed&#x2F;allocated.')
