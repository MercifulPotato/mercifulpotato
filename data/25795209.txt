For all the same reasons you should worry about cows being expensive (even if milk is still cheap), you should worry about real estate being expensive (even if rents are low).<p>In the case of a household, those mean that you can&#x27;t take some of your production, and save it for the future in capital goods -- the same kind of thing that happens when more of your income has to go to the same necessities.<p>In the case of a central bank, those mean that the injections of money aren&#x27;t (currently) effective for stimulating economic activity, but are simply causing a wealth transfer and rallies in whatever stores of value remain. That is the same signal it needs to get back as when consumer goods become more expensive: you are not relaxing a limiting factor on economic growth.<p>Edit: toned down')
