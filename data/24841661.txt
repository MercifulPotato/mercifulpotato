Conventionally you also lose the lowest and highest IP address in a block to the network number and broadcast address (you can free those up, but it might confuse devices or admins)<p>So for every split or subdivision you make, you lose at least 3 addresses.<p>Conventionally you also split a network at a specific bit boundary (CIDR) so each network has 2^n IP addresses in it. If you went for n=4, you have 16 addresses and already lost 3 to the above factors, so now you have 13 addresses left.<p>If you happened to have 14 machines attached to that network, you need a network with 2^5 = 32 IP addresses, and you&#x27;ve got 15 unused IP addresses with no way to give them back to a higher level.<p>All quite similar to why a phone area code may not be able to make use of all phone numbers inside that area, but have no way real practical way to give them to other networks.')
