We spent countless days weeks and months in meetings, spitballing all kinds of ideas, building prototypes, and coming up with &quot;innovative&quot; ideas for new dating app products. In the end it turns out the only thing users really want is a picture, a name, and a  paragraph. Everything beyond that is in the realm of direct human interaction. Any kind of artificial friction you create between people that is any more complex than that just ends up being annoying and driving away casual users.<p>The problem with dating apps is not a technological one. It all comes down to who&#x27;s using them. Wherever the women go, the men will follow. This is why Bumble has been so successful. Catering to women is the only way to have a successful dating app. At any given time, there&#x27;s a curve of adoption for dating apps, and they all go through the same lifecycle. Cool&#x2F;new&#x2F;hip&#x2F;cheap&#x2F;free with a 50&#x2F;50 young male&#x2F;female ratio and no bots -&gt; established&#x2F;revenue generating&#x2F;mature users with fewer women than men -&gt; bot ridden scam with no real women. At any given time there are three major apps that fill these roles. Right now it&#x27;s Hinge -&gt; Bumble -&gt; Tinder.')
