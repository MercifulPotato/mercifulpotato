I have taken the route of giving them exposure to it and occasional incentives to go a bit further, but never pushing it much beyond that. I wonder if technology these days is just so advanced that they do not see the link between the basics that programming starts out with and the apps they use day to day. For me, at 10 I could write a program myself in basic that was within range of the actual games and professional applications that were being made at the time. That is just so far from possible these days.')
