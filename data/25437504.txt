It looks like it&#x27;s landscape photographers but I as one I feel a little bit confused. Let me explain.<p>I&#x27;m a hobbyist landscape photographer and I&#x27;ve invested almost a decade into both my craft and the tools I use. You start out learning exposure, aperture, shutter speed and then mastering composition. As you do this you try to get outside and find good spots offering great composition and light which is science in and of itself. Then you start splitting hairs over various lenses and camera tricks to get the right depth of field and the sharpest image and learning about all the different camera settings you didn&#x27;t even know existed to help you on this journey.<p>I understand that I&#x27;m very biased, but I see phone cameras fall short here. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you can learn some of these basics on a phone camera, but it will get you a quarter of the way there until you&#x27;re forced to switch to a proper lens and ultimately a DSLR. I see nothing different in this post. These compositions are great but the quality is lacking pretty severely. You can get a much better quality with a basic kit lens and a cheap body which will cost you half the price of an iPhone.')
