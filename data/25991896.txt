All the batteries it comes with are perfect for the common use case, and the small &quot;bubble&quot; around it (ex: DRF) is as good as it gets IMO.<p>The tooling around REST APIs are lacking compared to Flask and FastAPI, but wrangling what&#x27;s available (drf-yasg, oauth2lib) to suit my needs is better than migrating to another framework I think.')
