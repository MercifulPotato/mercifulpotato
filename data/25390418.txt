In fact your response like this is exactly what I was asking for in my comment.<p>You are right, the &quot;at least hear me out&quot; argument is often used as defense to say something very questionable. The reason I phrased it that way though is because I am very close to one person who is as far right leaning as you could expect any reasonable person to be, and very close to another who is as far left as possible. I&#x27;m kind of forced to be in the middle if I want to maintain both of these relationships.<p>So to myself, I was using those 2 people as stand-ins for everyone else who might share their views. Both are very smart, both have very strong opinions that have been reached through a longstanding evolution of very small differences core values, and both are so deeply vested in their views that they wouldn&#x27;t even be able to talk to each other.<p>So my comment was an appeal to anyone who feels that way about the other side, because I see no other way to fix the extreme polarization of ideals in the US.')
