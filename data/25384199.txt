Google ranks pages (decides what to hide), Twitter and FB do the same with feeds. Advertisers infest any corner of the net, like cockroaches. Political parties buy targeted ads in huge amounts and generate tons of self serving press to put into our feeds.<p>We need to put the filtering &#x2F; ranking function back into our hands. We need a browser that can learn our preferences and enforce them, while protecting our privacy as well. Ad block lists are a start, but they only filter ads and don&#x27;t re-rank the feeds.')
