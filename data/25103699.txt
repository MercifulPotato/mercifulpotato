Frustrated with the black &amp; white view from umvi I responded with my extreme view. I&#x27;m sorry about that.<p>I agree with you that companies should, if they can, contribute back to open source, either with funds or time spent contributing to the project.<p>I only responded like that because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s either &quot;companies take open source and never contribute&quot; OR &quot;companies take open source, overwrite the license holder and doesn&#x27;t credit the author&quot;. I think the issue is much more nuanced than that, but I let my feelings write my previous comment.')
