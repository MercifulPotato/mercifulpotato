And JM is not even doing full permaculture, e.g. not using multi-height crops (i.e. ground covers  through plants of a few more different heights to top canopy trees, 100 or more feet tall), so as to use more of the available  sunlight and underground nutrients (shrub roots can go deeper than herbs, and trees even deeper, and what is brought up from deeper can be shared with shallow-rooting plants via compost, chop-and-drop, etc.). And he still makes fairly high profits per acre &#x2F; person &#x2F; year, i.e. overall. He has many videos about his work, both the technicals and commercials, on YouTube. Search by his name as well as for a great series titled Les Fermiers.\nAnd some examples higher on the axes of land area as well as  permaculture and &#x2F; or regenerative agriculture,  vs. &quot;just&quot; organic farming, include:<p>- Gabe Brown, 20+ years at it, 4 or 5000? acres, mixed grasses (grains) and broadleaf crops, cover crops, livestock (beef, pigs, etc.), land getting better each year, saves hugely on synthetic fertilizer and pesticide (see a chart in his Treating The Farm as an Ecosystem video), profits better too, and higher than his synthetic-using and tilling  neighbors and state averages (ND, USA), and  going up the value chain, so getting more of the final consumer dollar vs. middlemen. The average take for &quot;conventional&quot; US farmers is quite low, he says. Oh, and he does not need or take govt. farm subsidies, as many others do.<p>Has many videos too, search for his name. Check the comparative stats and photos.<p>- Richard Perkins, Sweden. \nNot sure of area, but above a few acres at least, maybe 25. Mixed stuff again. High profits again. Videos again. Many years&#x27; good results again.<p>- Last but one of the best, Geoff Lawton  (NSW, AU), long time permaculture expert (learned from Bill Mollison), doer, 66 acre Zaytuna Farm, is real mixed farm plus demonstration site, yearly trains many interns, consultant (to small orgs through to countries). Ditto for many of above points like axes, diversity, profits, improving over time, cost savings, etc. etc.<p>Edited for typos.')
