I’d consider the MacBook Air to be the single most successful laptop of all time, and for good reason. For many people it’s basically the perfect compromise of size, weight, power and battery life. (Also, while the Air is thin, it is certainly not fragile). The current M1 Air is a really great machine. And while it’s not powerful enough for my work (data scientist - waiting for a 16 inch MBP, or perhaps I’ll get a larger thinkpad and put Linux on it), I am not going to delude myself into thinking that my needs are in any way representative of the average consumer. A good ultra book is perfect for people browsing the web and using office apps who want good portability.')
