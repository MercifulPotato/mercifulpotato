Item(by='betamaxthetape', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603045661, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24819744, text='&gt; What about my bank? They have &gt;100M users, and with an app&#x2F;service portal, they&#x27;ll be required to be &quot;interoperable&quot;. I don&#x27;t want my bank or my bank info to be interoperable.<p>Here in the UK we have something like that, called Open Banking[1]. IMHO the most noticeable benefit to consumers is that many of apps from the UKs largest banking providers now allow you to view your accounts from <i>all</i> your banks through their app (traditionally you could only view accounts you held with that bank). I believe that some budgeting &#x2F; spending-tracking apps also take advantage of it to amalgamate information from all of your accounts.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openbanking.org.uk&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openbanking.org.uk&#x2F;</a>')
