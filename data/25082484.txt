A 1MB image you upload might use 10MB or more of space amongst their servers.   (eg. 1.5 RS encoded copies in each of 7 datacenters).   Oh, and theres a good chance it&#x27;ll be stored on SSD rather than hard drives because while you might think you only access that 1MB image once per decade on average, the reality is it probably gets read once a month (resyncing new devices, scanning quickly through the webui, ML models rebuilding search indexes, re-striping to new SSD&#x27;s or rebalancing, etc.).   Once a month reads for 1MB of data become spindle (IO) limited rather than space limited for hard drives, normally making SSD&#x27;s cheaper cos spindles are <i>expensive</i>.')
