Consider the following:<p>We still cannot treat many well understood diseases, including tuberous sclerosis, allergies, asthma, etc.\nWe don&#x27;t know the exact cause of multiple sclerosis, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, type 2 diabetes, etc, despite studying those diseases for decades.\nWe can&#x27;t help you keep the color of your hair or regrow your missing teeth, despite tons of money dedicated to such therapies by the industry.<p>And articles like these talk about combating aging - a combination of development, damage, and likely an evolutionary mechanism, within 10-15 years. I cannot help but be skeptical.')
