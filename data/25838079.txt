I clearly want some moderation (taking down illegal stuff, border line illegal, and etc) but if your choice is &quot;moderate all or not at all&quot; (as my understanding of pre section 230 is) then no one is going to moderate anything at all. I&#x27;m not trying to defend Facebook here, but I feel completely ignoring any of the nuance to the situation is disingenuous. It&#x27;s not like you can moderate a billion people, you could only do your best (I&#x27;m not saying Facebook is doing their best). Removing the nuance of the situation to make an easy argument is exactly the problem that got us here in the first place so let&#x27;s not continue it.')
