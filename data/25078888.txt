Dual-Wi-Fi, small travel routers will run for quite some time on a USB battery pack.<p>I&#x27;ve been meaning to do this for some time anyway, due to the pervasive spyware that&#x27;s embedded in most iOS apps, which Apple explicitly permits in the App Store.  One travel router device should serve me for phone+tablet+laptop.  I&#x27;ll probably have it just do LTE+WireGuard back to a server I run, and then do all of the filtering&#x2F;monitoring on the VPN server.<p>It sucks that it&#x27;s come to this.  Hopefully Apple can find their way back.  I have a machine running KDE Plasma, which is worlds better than it was in years past, but still has enough rough edges compared to macOS&#x27;s mirror sheen that it&#x27;s annoying to use.  I&#x27;m keeping my intel rMBP 16&quot; I just got as it&#x27;s likely the last machine of this quality level that will be able to run such a system.')
