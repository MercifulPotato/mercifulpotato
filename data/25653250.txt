Just because of the technical issues?<p>Statistically speaking it will likely end up being the safest variant of the 737 family simply because we live in an era where death in a commercial airline accident is approaching the level of a statistical anomaly. There are many reasons for this that are external to the actual nuts, bolts, and bits of the airplane.<p>Now if you&#x27;re arguing all 737 variants are the shitiest airliner out there for passenger comfort, well I&#x27;ll jump on board that argument!')
