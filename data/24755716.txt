I did that just yesterday. (Monogame was initially created to match XNA 4 API).<p>I didn&#x27;t even try porting my 10 year old XNA game until a year and a half ago, and I was able to get it compiled and running with 90% functionality (again shaders and storage was broken) in just 24 hours.<p>And they just had a major new release that, among other things, supports .Net Core, just two months ago, yet I&#x27;m still able to do this.')
