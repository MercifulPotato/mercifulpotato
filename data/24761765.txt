Your comment made me think about the last time I actually heard an aircraft landing, and it made me think that the aircraft have also gotten quieter while landing. It certainly seems to me that even when they fly overheard now, they&#x27;re somewhat quieter. My only guess is that the planes are flying lighter, and thus can run their engines a little bit slower and thus reduce the noise?')
