Sorta-like COTS. This dovetails nicely with the &#x27;non-cloud&#x27; idea.<p>* Just slap advertising on the web edition and hope it works :)<p>&gt; The space is also complicated with regulations that are not easy to translate from one country &#x2F; state to another. So an open source approach may not work perfectly.<p>Agree, but I&#x27;m adopting a &#x27;wait and see&#x27; approach.<p>&gt; However, I&#x27;d love to see some Open Source options that can piggyback on existing services, e.g. QBO api, so we can avoid paying the advanced features that are expensive, a lock-in and leaves something to be desired for customizability.<p>Oh, interesting! I didn&#x27;t know QuickBooks had an online API. Thanks, I&#x27;ll look into it.')
