If you don&#x27;t have anything to put up as collateral, you don&#x27;t have anything to loose by skipping bail.<p>The flip side of that, is if you are really poor you have less resources to use making your escape, so maybe the bail system is less needed.<p>But just because the bail system doesn&#x27;t work well for poor people doesn&#x27;t mean its also broken for middle class people.')
