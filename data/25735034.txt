For example many large appliances have 1 year warranties. After that you have to pay to repair (which is often 25-50% of the cost of new and not guaranteed) or toss it and buy new. If there were required warranty service based on waste generated from an item, eg a refrigerator must be warranted for 20 years, then you would see much better reliability and repairability.<p>Smaller, cheaper, more tech heavy items might have shorter required warranties, but the point is that you need to align the incentives by forcing manufacturer to bear the cost of the repair.')
