Its not surprising to see the size of iOS grow so dramatically over the last 10 years.  Some may so bloat, but i&#x27;d say it reflects the iPhone&#x2F;iPad&#x27;s evolution into a device that is integrated deeply into our lives.<p>Just look at how much space fonts are taking up in iOS14.  My hunch is that reflects a growing set of emoji and support for hundreds (thousands?) of alphabets. It&#x27;s hard to call that bloat.<p>Also initially I was surprised to see the networking code take up so much volume, but that also makes sense. I can only imaging how much custom code is needed to ensure a solid connection with the hundreds of wireless carriers around the world.')
