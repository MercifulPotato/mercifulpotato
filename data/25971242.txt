(Extreme case: change white-on-black to black-on-white. Or more generally, swapping foreground and background colours would usually be adequate, unless there&#x27;s a serious lack of contrast in the first place.)<p>Or add an underline, or a border around the element. Point is, there are safer options than font-weight; changing weight is pretty fragile unless you tightly control other aspects of the design&#x2F;content.')
