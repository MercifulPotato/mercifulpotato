But it clearly did not anticipate this disaster when it announced its arrival would be livestreamed on television.<p>Is the new government that has been created known as a unity government? Seems yes, the piece further explains<p>&quot;Mr Saeed&#x27;s new cabinet was formed in an effort to heal a long-running rift between Saudi-backed government forces and militias loyal to the separatist Southern Transitional Council, supported by the United Arab Emirates.<p>The two sides are supposed to be allies in the civil war against the Houthi movement, which controls the capital Sanaa and much of north-western Yemen.&quot;<p>Explaining the name &quot;unity cabinet&quot;, it seems to be an effort to unify the non-houti sides.<p>You may not think it&#x27;s a legitimate government, but it seems to be the one recognised by the international community, whether we like it or not. We recognise all sorts of nasty governments, from Venezuala to North Korea, from Russia to Turkey. I don&#x27;t see any judgement on which side is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; (or &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;worse&quot; as it may be).<p>To summarise<p>Who -- Houti Rebels<p>What -- attacked an airport<p>When -- Yesterday<p>Where -- Aden Airport<p>Why -- because they are fighting against the internationally recognised government<p>The BBC has covered the conflict in Yemen a fair amount, here&#x27;s a story about the background of the rebels.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-middle-east-31645145" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-middle-east-31645145</a>')
