That event accelerated our decision to have kids, and as a result our first daughter was born a few days after I turned 27.<p>The reasoning I came to is that given the probabilities of how children are conceived, if my dad didn&#x27;t have cancer, our first child would have been someone else than our daughter.<p>So basically wishing anything different for my dad would be wishing that my daughter didn&#x27;t exist.<p>And I guess that made his death easier for me to accept.')
