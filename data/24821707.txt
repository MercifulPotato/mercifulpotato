Doug Woodman&#x27;s basic idea dates back to 2002 or maybe earlier. His early iterations of ultra-mobile cameras were slightly successful but not yet the winning version.<p>By poking around, subject to the uniquely loose&#x2F;tight constraints of what he could fund selling beads (!) and early prototypes, he bought himself a lot of time to try to get it right. Perhaps it was a case of available technology needing the better part of a decade to catch up to his vision.<p>With a big, impatient burst of SV funding at the start, version 1.0 of GoPro might have been a Segway-like flop.')
