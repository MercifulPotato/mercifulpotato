It&#x27;s an incredible read. The research is a bit out of date, but the truths still hold. If anything, the age of the research is somewhat helpful. The phenomena these days are more subtle, and many of us work in companies with flatter hierarchies than the 25+ level pyramids the author studied. So the distance in time forces you to reflect on what has changed and whether the results are relevant to you.<p>You will recognize so many of the situations as reminiscent of things you have experienced and haven&#x27;t been able to put into words. It is 100% worth the read.')
