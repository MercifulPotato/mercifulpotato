The purpose is to allow Variable-Length Array (VLA) notation to be used.&quot;<p>Notation for what?<p>&quot;Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) should be self-documenting when possible.&quot;<p>And why is that?<p>&quot;This not only makes the code&#x27;s purpose clearer to human readers, but also makes static analysis easier. Any new APIs added to the Standard should take this into consideration. &quot;<p>On top of that, if you bother to actually read the ongoing C2X mailings, there are no plans to bring VLAs back to life, besides adopting the syntax to describe function parameters.<p>Most devs that take security seriously actually take the effort to know the details of the devil that we have to deal with.')
