I&#x27;ve done various side projects of my own and also was extremely lucky enough to land a entry level position at a small data science-related company through someone I know. Unfortunately, that company ended up going under right about the time corona-virus hit and I have yet to formally work as a proper software developer.<p>I&#x27;ve been looking through employment sites and things have been difficult for me because I&#x27;m coming from such a different work background (I have been professionally cooking for 4-5 years after graduating college).<p>I&#x27;d like to figure out how to get my foot in the door in order to get a proper start on becoming employed. I&#x27;m completely willing to work for free in order to gain experience and to learn what it takes to become employable.<p>If there is anyone here that can benefit from having helper for Python-related work, I would love to make myself useful for free. My goal is to learn and work towards becoming employed in this new field.<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.')
