Cheap as beans, and (unlike HP), toner cartridges don&#x27;t cost more than the printer itself.<p>Can&#x27;t upvote this enough.  Get a B&#x2F;W Laser Printer with replacement toner that is reasonably priced.  Brother is also really good about having original&#x2F;authentic toner easily available.  I&#x27;ve got a Brother B&#x2F;W MFC with duplex printing and I&#x27;ve had zero issues for the 3 years I&#x27;ve had it.<p>I used to have a Samsung B&#x2F;W Laser printer.  Not only was the toner expensive, but I could never actually get it.  Even the &quot;Authentic Samsung&quot; toners were fake.  And I could never get anywhere close to the advertised printed pages.<p>I gave up on inkjets years ago.')
