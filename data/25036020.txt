The problem with their services is that they are NOT worth it. They aren&#x27;t high end. Their services aren&#x27;t the best. They&#x27;re middle of the pack (music, movies, TV) or trailing (cloud, search, productivity software, AI). So all their finely-tuned marketing&#x2F;operations machinery geared to sell &quot;the best&quot; don&#x27;t work for their services.')
