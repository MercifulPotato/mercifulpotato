See, for example, the correlation of lockdowns and cases in France. Allowing people to make their own choices doesn&#x27;t work to deal with a pandemic because a very small subset of the population can cause the vast majority of cases, negating any personal effort made by the rest.<p>The argument isn&#x27;t that institutions are perfect and never make mistakes (or politicians), but rather that overall they&#x27;ve taken reasonable measures to deal with the current situation.<p>&gt; To be fair, the CDC hasn&#x27;t done a lot of public communication either<p>The CDC (and the FDA) have published tons of documents about recommendations, vaccine efficacy, etc.<p>&gt; Masks are bad--no wait, masks are good! Lockdowns are bad--no wait, lockdowns are essential!<p>As the pandemic progresses, we learn new things about it and adjust. This is exactly what you should expect from your institutions: give you the best info available at the time. This is the full quote:<p>“There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask.

At the time, folks were recommending disinfecting groceries. This doesn&#x27;t mean the advice at the time was bad, that&#x27;s hindsight bias.')
