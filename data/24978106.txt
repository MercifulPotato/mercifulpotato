This plays extremely badly with classical FP, and Reactor specifically, because 1. the Reactor &quot;monad&quot; (Mono) can&#x27;t wrap null and 2. flatmapping an empty monad is not the same as flatmapping on Some(null) for example.<p>- Kotlin has no syntactical support for flatmap&#x2F;map, like Haskell or Scala.<p>- Kotlin has no pattern matching, inline types are still experimental, and it&#x27;s type system is limited, it is clearly targeted at the UI&#x2F;Android folks who are not interested in expressing their data in a static way. Making sure that people don&#x27;t shoot themselves in the foot is great for the average Joe developer, but not so great for library writers.<p>Having said all that, it&#x27;s still better than Java, but it&#x27;s 2020, ZIO is past 1.0 and Scala 3 is around the corner. I&#x27;m really looking forward to 2021...')
