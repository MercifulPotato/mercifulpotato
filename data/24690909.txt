I didn&#x27;t say anything about sticking a PRNG between Lemire and the entropy source.<p>If I&#x27;m generating an RSA key pair I&#x27;m going to pull kilobytes of data <i>from the entropy source</i>, not a PRNG, and that data volume will be a fixed multiple of some word size that means that every bit I take has a purpose.<p>If I need a non-multiple of the word length worth of entropy <i>from the entropy source</i>, no standard library I know of handles that. C, Java, a few others always fetch 32 or 64 bits of data and then throw most of it away, even if the system call might allow finer increments.<p>If I need 6 bits or 200 bits, I have to stick a CSPRNG in there or throw entropy away. If I do the latter (which people often do by default) I&#x27;m robbing bits&#x2F;second of entropy from something that may really need it, like TLS or especially SSH. I&#x27;ve found myself in testing situations where it was faster to regenerate a VM&#x2F;reflash a Pi microSD than wait for &#x2F;dev&#x2F;random to catch up, due to iterating on a writing a script that uses scp or keygen calls. I haven&#x27;t seen a production issue in a while, and never that severe (eg, HTTPS throttling), but it&#x27;s happened to somebody I&#x27;m sure.')
