Item(by='jfengel', descendants=None, kids=[25646343], score=None, time=1609858922, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25645602, text='The thing he&#x27;s arguing against is the Chicago&#x2F;Austrian school of economics, whose response to just about every monetary policy measure is &quot;But inflation!&quot; UBI would cause inflation; raising the minimum wage would cause inflation; worker protections would cause inflation; government borrowing causes inflation.<p>That kind of economics gained popularity in the 1970s, when inflation caused genuine hardship. It left a kind of economic PTSD -- especially among people who have money, because inflation erodes the value of savings. The response is a trickle-down economics, where the best way to help the poor is to ensure that the rich have lots of money so that they can give poor people jobs.<p>So the Internet is full of &quot;But inflation!&quot; and often &quot;But hyperinflation!&quot;, usually based on an argument from the first two weeks of economics class where you&#x27;re shown supply and demand curves. But economics classes go past two weeks. There&#x27;s a lot more to it than that, and the data simply don&#x27;t support that argument. The fact is that consumer inflation is very low, and has been for a long time, despite intensive intervention from the central banks.<p>It <i>is</i> more complicated, and there has been inflation -- most notably in the stock market, and to a lesser degree in other assets (including real estate and cryptocurrency). The stock market has inflated to ludicrous levels, not just in tech assets but as a whole. But not at the consumer level, for a variety of reasons -- a lot of things have become cheaper to produce, and despite tax cuts for the wealthy wages haven&#x27;t gone up. The wealthy don&#x27;t eat more or live in more houses with that money, so they&#x27;re not competing all that much for regular consumer goods. They take all that extra money and buy stocks -- trading them to each other rather than actually starting new businesses.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s what he&#x27;s arguing against. It should shortcut a whole line of knee-jerk &quot;but inflation!&quot; arguments. But it&#x27;s been true for decades, and this isn&#x27;t a new observation, so it doesn&#x27;t really change anything.')
