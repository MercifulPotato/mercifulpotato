I used to read everything he wrote. I loved his Lisp books. I totally bought into what he was selling. I really admired the guy. He made greed morally acceptable and I was a confused kid. He said that in &quot;the real world&quot; all the petty drama that makes nerds unpopular would go away. (It ain&#x27;t true. Unless you&#x27;re in tech in the 1990s, the corporate world is <i>worse than</i> high school.) I considered applying for YC. Looking back, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t. I know too many people who flew too close to a garbage fire in the Mountain View sky they thought was the sun and are still recovering, 5–10+ years later.<p>The fact is, I don&#x27;t dislike Paul Graham. I think he got out of his depth. Y Combinator, though, is a sleazy institution with a record of ageism, atrocious founder quality— the number of YC-backed people who&#x27;ve turned out to be spousal abusers is shockingly high— and marketing-sans-substance. I actually think that most of YC&#x27;s atrociousness happened in spite of PG&#x27;s influence and probably set in after he was a major factor.')
