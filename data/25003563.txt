From a practical point of view, the thing that Pijul&#x2F;Anu both do is not &quot;automatically resolve conflicts&quot; but rather &quot;allow repo operations to happen even in the presence of conflicts&quot;. In Git, if you&#x27;ve got a conflict, Git will require you to fix it before doing anything else. In Pijul or Anu, you can continue applying changes—possibly creating more conflicts!—in a way that&#x27;s guaranteed to never throw away changes. At the end of that, a human still needs to resolve those merges manually.<p>I don&#x27;t think it is really true that git requires you to fix conflicts before continuing. There are strategies that can let you emulate deferred merging. I rarely let merging hold me back.<p>If I don&#x27;t have time to merge into master, just do git push server master:synced&#x2F;master.')
