We spend Billions on &quot;interdiction&quot; and &quot;enforcement&quot;, even though the vast majority of folks who do use drugs that are currently illegal don&#x27;t have a dependency problem, and treatment on demand for the small number that do would be significantly less expensive;<p>2.  Putting someone in prison costs tens of thousands of dollars a year, and that person isn&#x27;t contributing to the local economy where they lived, a double negative impact on the economy;<p>3.  The stigma of a felony conviction usually makes most better paying jobs unavailable to folks convicted, further reducing economic output;<p>4.  Building ever larger prisons and hiring more and more prison guards, administrators, etc. takes money away from other, more productive endeavors, often limiting economic growth due to lack of infrastructure, better quality of education and a host of other factors.')
