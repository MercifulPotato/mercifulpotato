Mostly. But that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m talking about.<p>I&#x27;m talking about those cases when people pile 5 layers of abstraction just so they don&#x27;t have to learn something, but get done with the job a little bit quicker. They don&#x27;t try to understand neither the inner workings of these layers nor the CPU&#x2F;memory&#x2F;storage cost. If it means you write fewer code, it goes into your project. Thus you end up with &quot;desktop apps&quot; that are websites, with all the amazements (&#x2F;s) of the modern web development, packaged with an insanely complex thing that a web browser is â€” just so the bullshit unrealistic &quot;business requirements&quot; are met. Or laggy, bloated mobile apps that get updated every week with no discernible changes. These just scream that the people behind them have no clue what they&#x27;re doing.')
