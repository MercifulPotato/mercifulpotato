The complexity of the product also plays a strong role.<p>Much the same can be said of coding.  Being able to issue a command in a shell or compose a function in a spreadsheet is probably the closes analog to sewing on a button, but how many people can even do those things?<p>We live in a world where our phone&#x27;s calculators are typically as powerful as a four function calculator from decades ago, perhaps with a subset of functions found on a scientific calculator.  How do we expand our minds beyond that limited scope if vendors are afraid of creating software that allows us to compose anything more complex?  With the status quo, we have to seek out options and those options are mostly targeted at professionals.<p>Similar things can be said for other domains.  While writing of coding, I was actually thinking of graphics design and word processing and databases and the many other domains that have been over simplified by modern consumer applications.  For the most part, their functionality has been simplified to the point where you can perform a very narrow range of tasks and have very little scope of the imagination.  For example: that database that backs your address book cannot be adapted to catalogue your books, or the online word processor that is fine for writing reports is poorly suited for preparing a book for publications.  Sure, there are professional alternatives out there.  On the other hand, it seems as though people has a lot more flexibility with the software of the 1990&#x27;s than the 2010&#x27;s.')
