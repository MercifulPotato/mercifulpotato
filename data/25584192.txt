It&#x27;s just restating generic &quot;drone&quot; SEO nonsense over and over. There&#x27;s not even a real name of the product.<p>The photos of the item are pretty clearly photoshopped stock imagery.<p>The description is full of grammatical and punctuation errors.<p>The brand has no online presence beyond its Amazon listings. It doesn&#x27;t even have its own Amazon brand page.<p>It may be asking too much of the general consumer to look at these signals, but they seem pretty obvious to me.')
