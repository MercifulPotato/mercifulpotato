There may still be a truth of the matter about the value of `BB(800)` or `BB(27)` (as the case may be), since ZFC hardly encompasses all truth, but calling such a number an &quot;exact figure&quot; is a bit like claiming to know the birth date of Julius Caesar down to the millisecond: Implausible to start with, and the closer you look the more you wonder, &quot;what does the question even <i>mean</i>? Relative to what standard?&quot; (In the one case, &quot;of time&quot;; in the other, &quot;of mathematical truth&quot;.)')
