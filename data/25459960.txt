If you&#x27;re going to have potentially hundreds of preview versions deployed per script, you can&#x27;t eagerly push it to every server worldwide.<p>But in turn solving that problem and raising that limit will also open up Cloudflare Workers for more potential use cases. Currently if you want to deploy multi-tenant applications with customized per-tenant code on workers you would run out of scripts and need to set each tenant up with their own workers account.')
