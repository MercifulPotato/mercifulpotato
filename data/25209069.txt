My father-in-law farmed 800 acres in Saskatchewan Canada, which I&#x27;m sure was large enough to qualify it as part of the 1%.   It was a hobby farm, he had a full-time off-farm job.<p>800 acres in much of the world is a massive amount that can grow a massive amount of food.    For Northern dryland wheat farming it&#x27;s a very small farm.   A more typical size for the area is about 10,000 acres.')
