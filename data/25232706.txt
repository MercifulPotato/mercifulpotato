And they’re bringing in AMD now to compete. Where M1 really shines is client-side applications like video handling, ML inference, and crazy branchy nearly single-threaded code. Servers can afford to run much lower clock speeds (see GCP n1 family, for example) because web serving is an embarrassingly parallel problem. Sure, some ARM might help lower costs of internal things like S3, but Graviton2 isn’t <i>that</i> incredible compared to the M1-vs-Coffee Lake comparisons going on in the laptop world.')
