Item(by='hedora', descendants=None, kids=[25196059, 25195315, 25195199], score=None, time=1606186837, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25193259, text='After going through the process of building a house in CA, I believe we should decriminalize offering of bribes, but not solicitation of bribes.<p>$100K’s of dollars (&gt;&gt; 10% of the total project cost) have been extracted from us by various bureaucratic processes that are outside what is explicitly specified by the law.<p>I am confident that this would not have happened if we were well politically connected, and had friends that worked at PG&amp;E.<p>I honestly don’t know if we were “just supposed to know” that we needed to make some specific charitable or political donation or something like that, because no one has explicitly solicited a bribe from us.<p>If it were legal to offer bribes, I could go online, and search for information on who to pay off, and to what ends.<p>Even better, California could fix the law to eliminate these gray areas.  In the Apple case, they could move from “may issue” to “shall issue”.<p>In my case, there could be bounds on permit review durations, and also the cost &#x2F; benefit of “environmental” regulations: if some ask is too expensive homeowners could “buy credits” by doing something else that would be more effective for the same amount of money.<p>To be clear, the money they extracted from us for “the environment” will substantially increase our carbon footprint, impact on local wildlife and on the watershed — we planned to voluntarily spend that money to mitigate those impacts because we’re extremely concerned about the environment.  Now, we’ve been forced to waste it in low impact ways.  I’m not upset that we were forced to spend the money.  I’m upset it was wasted.')
