The onboarding is typical of non-hipster F&#x2F;OSS. The setup guide for servers isn&#x27;t &quot;run murmur.exe&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;run openssl commands to generate a private key and generate a CSR&quot; and the setup guide for clients is &quot;if you lose your client certificates, you potentially lose all ability to connect, and permissions&#x2F;rights, hope there&#x27;s another admin&quot;.<p>Also, the access tokens option seems absurd from a UX perspective. Instead of just asking for a password with a remember box, you go to Server &gt; Access Tokens and paste a string in and it&#x27;ll attempt it the next time you&#x27;re prompted for a passworded channel or server. Small things like that.<p>But it has the absolute lowest latency I&#x27;ve ever seen for VOIP, beats Discord significantly in quality, latency, and security (mTLS auth, client certs, pin your own CA for server, you control TLS on both ends). From a strictly engineering POV it&#x27;s excellent. It also has some pretty amazing features for voice control, passing audio downstream&#x2F;upstream into parent&#x2F;child channels (eve players might get what I mean for fleet ops).<p>TeamSpeak tries to do too much, with chat, filesharing, and now no one really wants to host TS3 other than it being concentrated on a specific few like OVH because half of TS&#x27;s server services can be misused for reflection spoofed DDoS attacks.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what Ventrilo is these days. They would not sell you a personal use licence at all - you had to sign up to &quot;resell&quot; a minimum of several thousand slots, and increase your purchase every contract period, or they would terminate all of your licences. You aren&#x27;t permitted to run a community, nonprofit server for yourself, and at $1-2&#x2F;slot&#x2F;month a large community server would never happen for cost reasons.')
