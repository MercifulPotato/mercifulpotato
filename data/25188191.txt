Keyboard layouts suck for coding (makes it harder to start with what you have), not enough english skills for proper autonomous learning and searching, a lot of bureaucracy that makes starting and running a software business more difficult, and people thinking that they have to be math geniuses to succeed. This reduces the overall amount of talent, so you&#x27;re basically left with entrepreneurs who can&#x27;t code and full-blood C++ programmers who started at five years old.')
