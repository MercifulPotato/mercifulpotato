There are so few pump pads. I would have loved to have done this with a 9 button pad for ddr&#x2F;piu but the main issue is that the buttons are different sizes in those games.<p>One thing I wish I&#x27;d done differently is just used MDF instead of plywood, my piece ended up being slightly warped which makes it annoying to use on hardwood, but it plays fine if it&#x27;s sitting on carpet.')
