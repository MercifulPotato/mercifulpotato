I wanted to make the correspondence as familiar as possible to JS programmers.<p>You&#x27;re probably right I should have called function expressions <i>fn</i>.  You can alias it with <i>(macro fn lambda)</i> though if you prefer that.<p>First I hear of Lumen!  What a coincidence that they started at the same time.  It seems their language is an &quot;overlay&quot; entirely separate from both Lua and JS which only runs at compile-time, kind of like Lua is to Terra <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;terralang.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;terralang.org&#x2F;</a>.  I think that means Lumen can&#x27;t load macros from JavaScript modules at compile-time like eslisp can, but I&#x27;m not sure.  I&#x27;ll do some reading.  Thanks for the link.')
