You get your own land and a detached home with plenty of space to do mostly whatever you want. Woodwork, swimming in a pool, running around with your dog, playing loud music and movies, hosting dinner parties, whatever. It&#x27;s so much more comfortable for people who don&#x27;t have urges to just &quot;hang out&quot;.')
