I simply like that they&#x27;re not either party.</i><p>This seems absurd. If your political reasoning puts you in a situation where Trump and Sanders are both options for you then your system is broken - they are antithetical to each other in style, philosophy, character and most importantly <i>policy</i>. Based on your logic, if both parties rejected Stalin then you&#x27;d be in favor of him.')
