When questions about his people&#x27;s contacts with Russia and related people came up and what information might have been exchanged.   His response was that he was sure other candidates would take any help &#x2F; information from Russia if offered.<p>That struck me as one of those situations where you find that people who &#x27;cheat&#x27; are more likely to greatly over estimate how many people actually cheat.    But it certainly served the reverse cargo cult issue here too.<p>Interestingly enough when it came out that nobody in the Trump administration had informed US intelligence services that a foreign agent agent was offering them help... it also came out that every presidential candidate staff had reported some such contacts, with the exception of Trump, and Bush Sr.   .')
