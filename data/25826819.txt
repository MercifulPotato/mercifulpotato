For sporting events, people even want to see what other fans are saying. You can see an explosion of activity in related subs on reddit: For example, r&#x2F;tennis during ATP 1000+ events, or r&#x2F;soccer every weekend.<p>There&#x27;s always drama and there&#x27;s always an urge to find out what others are thinking right at the moment; or in a few cases, the urge to share what you are thinking, as well.<p>I&#x27;ve been on r&#x2F;tennis many a time to know how much redditors complain that the expert analysis post-match or the commentary during the match wasn&#x27;t any good, and that they&#x27;d rather prefer some other commentator who&#x27;s unfortunately not employed by the Network that owns broadcast rights in their country.<p>I believe clubhouse is an interesting clone of Reddit, Twitter &#x2F; Instagram, and YouTube.<p>I imagine Clubhouse <i>Live</i> where folks listen to experts chime in real-time as events unfold; Clubhouse <i>Roundtables</i> where experts invite themselves and aren&#x27;t beholden to the Media companies selecting the panels; Clubhouse <i>Stations</i> where folks tune in to listen to &quot;Networks&quot; broadcasting high-quality content.<p>The key innovation is Clubhouse is voice-only: Voice is faster and substantially low effort than text. With voice (unlike with video), there&#x27;s substantially less pressure and more comfort.<p>You&#x27;re right that as the community grows, it&#x27;d keep getting harder to surface quality content, but that&#x27;s a good problem to have and almost every major Social media has that but are doing just fine. I hope Clubhouse doesn&#x27;t turn grow to be as disappointing as <i>Quora</i> has.')
