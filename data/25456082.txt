If they&#x27;re shut down for any significant period then they&#x27;re gone for good.<p>Honestly, that sounds like hyperbole.  You&#x27;ll have to give examples, and not something like retail or restaurants.  Honestly, with a little imagination and expertise (and most importantly the political will to deal with the problem), I think it doable to make the legal changes necessary to pause most business like that with little damage, just as long as the aid is there.  For instance, make 2020 something like an intercalary year.  IMHO, this stuff only seems impossible if you tie your hands and restrict yourself to a limited number of first-order interventions.<p>The situation we have now is something like an ER doctor who&#x27;s too busy playing on his phone to save the life of someone who&#x27;s been shot, and who then turns around and loudly blames &quot;guns&quot; for that unnecessary death.')
