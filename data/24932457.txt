Basically, the $$ they&#x27;ll pay for a specific procedure or service.<p>In many cases, those rates were not available to the public, or even to providers.<p>When I was working to setup a private medical practice a while back, a billing company we worked with gave us the advice, &quot;If you ever get paid 100% of what you bill for a procedure, you need to raise your price for that procedure.&quot;<p>So, as an example, imagine that you were, say, a GP billing to remove a skin tag in your office.<p>You can look up Medicare&#x27;s &quot;allowable&quot; for the procedure, which is about $45 (though can be different based on a while host of other factors. The &quot;rule of thumb&quot; for simple provider billing is to add 15% to the Medicare Allowable.  So, you&#x27;d set your fee schedule at ~$52.<p>A patient comes in with commercial insurance, and you bill $52, and typically you&#x27;d get paid somewhere between $45 and $52 for that procedure.  However, if a commercial insurance ever paid the full $52, you know that their actual rate is higher than $52, so you&#x27;d be smart to raise your fees to make sure you capture that provider&#x27;s whole allowable.<p>So, you maybe raise your rate to $62 - and the next time you have a patient who needs the same procedure and is covered by that provider - you see if they pay the full $62 or a portion of it.<p>This is basically the &quot;why&quot; behind a good portion of inflated medical billing.  Medical providers are required to have a fixed fee schedule and essentially bill every patient the same amount for every procedure, regardless of who that patient is covered by.<p>Of course, most providers have a &quot;cash&quot; rate for patients who are uninsured as well.<p>You can see how at the very least, opaque pricing leads to inefficiencies in the system. This is an absolute step in the right direction that I expect insurance companies to fight against tooth and nail.')
