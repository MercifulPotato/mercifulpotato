Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=[25346313], score=None, time=1607439362, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25345741, text='It would not be difficult to assemble the same kind of narrative based on plentiful evidence of the same abstract psychological behavior, except from the radical left.<p>I happened to read a BLM post on Medium once, and I now get a daily email of several blog posts that are at least as delusional as the above beliefs about how all white people are not just racist, but <i>fundamentally and immutably</i> racist.<p>Underappreciated (and rarely discussed in the media) is that this sort of radical content amplifies the sentiments of those who are on the alternate end of the spectrum (and vice-versa), in an ever intensifying negative feedback loop.  I often wonder if politicians and forum&#x2F;media commentators are completely oblivious to this notion, or if they are aware of it but have some sort of a &quot;the ends justify the means&quot; thing going on.  I also often wonder why there is essentially zero initiative whatsoever to reach out to these communities and establish some sort of a dialogue, as is done with peace talks with warring terrorist organizations - again, has this idea literally never crossed a single person&#x27;s mind...or has it, but the utter lack of public discussion of the idea is a ~&quot;strategic decision&quot; of some kind? (That it never seems to  come up even in forums suggests the former is the more likely of the two explanations.)<p>Human consciousness is a hell of a drug.')
