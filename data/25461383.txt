Item(by='pluc', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608244320, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25460094, text='&gt; * When engineers and QE are doing their regular dev+testing work all day long, do they use actual videos from the site, or are there &quot;tame&quot; videos used for dev+test so as to not be so distracting?<p>Real videos. People not wanting to work directly in contact with pornography is a huge problem to recruitment.<p>&gt; * Similar to above, how much of the day (like, how many hours) would a regular developer or tester be looking at the content? Do people become totally desensitized to it? Like, I know people say &quot;it&#x27;s just a regular job&quot;, but I have a hard time believing people aren&#x27;t aroused by it, at least part of the time.<p>Depends what you do, a regular developer probably doesn&#x27;t look at a lot of porn except when testing their stuff in a near-prod setting. Some people watch porn all day (eg video editors) and there&#x27;s a high turnover rate there.<p>Oh, and the work environment was oddly corporate.')
