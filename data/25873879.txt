We have a lot of shallow computation graphs (really the same few graphs on different datasets) and a few deep graphs which need incremental updates. The cost of an ad-hoc solution is less than the perceived cost (maybe the real cost) of adopting an additional language.<p>&gt; Other<p>Broad classes of algorithms will basically expand to being full re-computations with this framework (based on a quick read of the whitepaper), and adopting a tool for efficient incremental updates is less enticing if I&#x27;m going to have to manually fiddle with a bunch of update algorithms anyway. E.g., kernel density estimation needs to be designed from the ground up to support incremental updates; a naive translation of those algorithms to dataflow would efficiently update some sub-components like covariance matrices, but you&#x27;d still wind up doing O(full_rebuild) work.')
