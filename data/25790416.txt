I tell my students to just get it read ASAP. After that setting up your environments or $PATH becomes much more comprehensible. Git becomes much more comprehensible. Life as a developer is much more pleasant.<p>The article author should take time to understand the command line environment they work in, simple as that. I&#x27;ve had the exact same struggles the author has had. I&#x27;ve had Ruby, JS and npm implosions, multiple times. It would be nice if the languages and tools documented their errors better. All tools should strive for better, more beginner friendly documentation. But if you&#x27;re a dev right now knowing Unix has to be table stakes.')
