The marketing team needs to know when the landing page &#x2F; qr code (whatever) is implemented, because they need to plan their marketing budget. The customer care agent that gets shouted at because feature xyz is broken &#x2F; not working as the customer expects, would like to give the customer an answer when it will be fixed. The customer care manager is also worried about her team members‘ retention.<p>So having a rough or concrete time line &#x2F; roadmap is helpful for these parts of the business.<p>I also believe that a feature request is incomplete without an estimate. It is like a friend asking you to go buy him a car. What does he need a 3000$ subaru from 2003 or a 2021 Ferrari? Of course the friend can give you an insanely accurate list of specifications, but giving you a budget + some guidelines will probably be more effective for your friend and more fun for you. Especially considering that you know much more about cars (read software) than your friend. Knowing the budget you will be able to make much better choices.<p>If you take the allegory of a quote (which I think is correct) then you need to consider that the haggling process always also includes scope of the product. „I‘ll give you 5000$ for the car,  but only if you include a free car wash“.\nAnd you can always use an estimate as defense against feature creep. „We are running low on budget, I suggest descoping xyz into the next iteration. Otherwise we won‘t be able to ship on time“. If on time is not defined then you can never have this conversation.')
