The point of moving open-source off of LTS is to move open source onto the bleeding edge to provide testing, not to just withhold 6.2 entirely.<p>&gt; Starting with Qt 5.15, long term support (LTS) will only be available to commercial customers. This means open-source users will receive patch-level releases of 5.15 until the next minor release will become available. This means that we will handle Qt 5.15 in the same way as e.g. 5.13 or 5.14 for open source users.')
