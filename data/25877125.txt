I don&#x27;t have the knowledge to fully understand the implications of this, but it seems it supports reports that fasting has positive effects on aging-related brain degeneration.<p>I fast semi-regularly (I&#x27;m just finishing up a four-day fast), and it amazes me how often we by default reach for something (e.g. pills) to put into our bodies to solve or improve something, when sometimes the answer is to _not_ put something (i.e. food) in it (at least for a little bit). It&#x27;s also a great exercise in self-control and discipline.<p>^1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;24905167&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;24905167&#x2F;</a>')
