I can&#x27;t possibly understand how so many people in this thread are preferring server rendering frameworks. As soon as you have a non hello world application (= complex state shared across multiple components &#x2F; page) a SPA application is so much easier and productive. And Next brings this experience back to public facing frontends because it supports prerendering along other things.')
