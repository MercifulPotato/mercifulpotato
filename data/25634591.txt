Every large company I&#x27;ve worked for has had recovery plans in place, including scenarios as disturbing as &quot;All data centers and offices explode simultaneously, and all staff who know how it all works are killed in the blasts.&quot;<p>You not only have backups in place, you have documentation in place, including a back-up vendor who has copies of the documentation and can staff up workers to get it up and running again without any help from existing staff.<p>And we tested those scenarios. I&#x27;m not sure which dry runs were less fun - when you got paged at 3 AM to go to the DR site and restore the entire infrastructure from scratch... or when you got paged at 3 AM and were instructed to stay home and not communicate with anyone for 24 hours to prove it can be done with out you. (OK, so staying home was definitely more fun, but disturbing.)')
