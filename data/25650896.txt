It is inspired by my experience making interfaces on the web and on the desktop.<p>My experience is primarily in C++ (Keywords: C++17, C++14, C++11). Also comfortable working with straight C (Keywords: C89, C90, C99, C11), although less experience with The C Way™. I have working knowledge of Python, and have piddled around in Common Lisp and Haskell but nothing non-trivial unfortunately. TypeScript currently has my interest.')
