And yeah, once you &quot;discuss an end date for your employment&quot;, a &quot;Freistellung&quot; is a completely normal event.<p>Now in Germany that would result in payment continuing until the official end date.  In the US things are different, but I don&#x27;t have any information that this didn&#x27;t happen (she just moaned about access to company systems, and that is normal in a &quot;Freistellung&quot;).')
