Item(by='vram22', descendants=None, kids=[25096687], score=None, time=1605391823, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25095413, text='If by your [1] you mean flatulence, Indians (and some other Asians) eat many kinds of legumes (including many kinds of beans, like rajma, lobia, French beans, etc.), on a regular basis, and I, at least, have not heard of flatulence as a common thing among them due to that. Only if you indulge a bit too much in say chana (chickpeas, as in chana masala or puri chole or bhature chole), do you sometimes get gas. Possibly the Indian masala&#x27;s spices used in those dishes help with digesting the beans, in fact they probably do, since they are the common ones used in Indian cooking, some of which have known digestive benefits, such as cumin, ginger, coriander, asafoetida, etc.<p>(BTW, tip: just a pinch of asafoetida a.k.a. hing, really improves a dish; the zing of hing :)<p>Also, I saw a video about nutrition by some scientist, who  said that peoples (i.e. nations) who eat beans regularly, develop, over time, the ability (maybe via better gut flora) to digest them more easily, without gas being generated.')
