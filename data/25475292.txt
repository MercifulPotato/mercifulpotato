Eg. 5cm of aluminium stops only 30% of the galactic radiation. (Heavier elements (e.g. gold) are scattered by incoming particles causing incoming heavy ions which cause even more damage.)<p>So practically it would still experience significant radiation.<p>But having the main compute for Mars remain in orbit with the relay isn&#x27;t a bad idea.')
