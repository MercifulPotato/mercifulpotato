The code from affiliate sales has nothing to do with you, the end user. It identifies the affiliate, in this case Brave. There is no user information there. Their claim then is in perfectly good faith.<p>I think you&#x27;re confusing BAT with the affiliate links which are two distinct things Brave has done. BAT I agree with you on there is still tracking there or otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t be able to attribute the money to you. Affiliate links though do not have the same connotation and is the subject under discussion in this comment chain.')
