For single core, the 5nm M1 beats previous generation 7nm x86 handily.<p>For the current generation (which is almost impossible to buy) it&#x27;s a push.<p>For multi-core workloads (mostly niche use cases) high core count processors perform better.<p>I assume when the M1x comes out, it will similarly dominate the multi-core workloads, if it does have the rumored 32 cores.')
