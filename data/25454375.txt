Just came here to say that I use them with much pleasure, they help me building functional (view) components which map their internal state or external state (pulled in via custom hooks or 3rd party hooks such as useQuery() from Apollo GraphQL). And a view&#x27;s side effects are made explicit with useEffect(). Awesome, love it.')
