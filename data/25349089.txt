I have children in public schools, where I think transgenderism is being promoted by teachers stating their preferred pronouns and asking student what their pronouns are, and by the presence of a LGBTQ club. I wonder if the fraction of trans teens is lower at Catholic schools that do not approve of transgenderism.')
