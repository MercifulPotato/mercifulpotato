How much work is it to effectively send messages? How much work is it to effectively consume messages? I feel like this dichotomy ends up deciding so much about the human effects that eventually arise from these software decisions.<p>I do a lot of work with people in China, and my main complain with WeChat as a &quot;do everything&quot; medium is that it is 100% set up to prioritize the sender. In practice, this means set up to prioritize the boss. It is an absolute disaster for those on the receiving end: it&#x27;s nearly impossible to keep track of and effectively act on incoming information. You must respond RIGHT NOW or that information is essentially lost.<p>In the end, I believe a messaging channel that requires <i>more upfront work on the part of the sender</i> ends up providing knock-on positive effects for everyone involved. But due to the generally ego-first thought process of all human beings – and the absolutely ego-first though process of most bosses – the channel that affords the least friction in sending appeals the most.<p>Everyone likes to think of themselves as being on the originating end of the firehose.')
