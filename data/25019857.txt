The use of force by US government ( be it state or federal ), has actually decreased over the last decades ( not to look very far back, check historical records of civil rights and unions in US to get an idea of how things were handled in the past ). The only real difference now is that it is on video. But yes, I am arguing there is less of state violence now.<p>The nation vilification is nothing new in US ( Bush &quot;With us or against us&quot; that made US population hate Muslims -- up until then average American barely knew; Disney WW2 propaganda just to name a few better known examples ). These days, it is China ( among others ). Do you see a pattern?<p>Increasing protests. I can give you that. BLM protests are probably biggest event in US political scene since Tea Party . That said, I am not sure, they are bigger than civil rights movement or Vietnam war protests. They are more visible due to social media. Thankfully, they seem less widespread though.<p>Blatant racism. Honestly, I am not sure if racism is a function of &quot;By what measure is the US more divided than in the past?&quot;. Quite honestly, I would venture to suggest that today&#x27;s racism is waay lower than at any point in US history. That said, this is just a guess.<p>Nationalism. Again, I am not sure if racism is a function of &quot;By what measure is the US more divided than in the past?&quot;. Historically, US gets more nationalistic as things go downhill ( WW2, red scare to name a few ).<p>So.. I am not sure you have a point here. US is obviously divided, but the things you listed are not a function of that division.<p>edit: added China to the example list')
