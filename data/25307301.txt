I think it was a huge selling point that the languages felt similar, and felt comfortable to those who already knew C and&#x2F;or C++.<p>In those days I was doing a lot of pasting from one language to the other, and editing &quot;int&quot; into &quot;var&quot; etc. Java and JavaScript were similar in that, compared to C and C++, you just sort of forgot about pointers and pointer syntax. (even though they still sort of existed).<p>They sure seemed to me to be related. This is obviously most true for light use of the languages (JavaScript especially was designed for very light use)')
