Even people who are aware of the correct usage frequently get it wrong (see comments here). There has to be a better term for this.<p>The &quot;incorrect&quot; use is actually useful (which, I guess, is why the phrase has been co-opted for it). There are statements that &quot;beg the question&quot; and that&#x27;s a useful phrase to have (and a much clearer use of it). I shall continue using it for this :)')
