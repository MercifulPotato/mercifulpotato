The PWA app you can install on your phone would work for a few days and just appear to stop working until you reinstalled it. Then with Mozilla firing devs including the devs who work on their core product (Firefox&#x2F;Browser Engine) and then spinning WebThings out into it&#x27;s own thing, I have decided to stop using it because I don&#x27;t believe it has much of a future because the management appears to have gone off the rails.<p>I will reevaluate it in a year, if it still exists, because it&#x27;s actually a pretty nice platform to use.')
