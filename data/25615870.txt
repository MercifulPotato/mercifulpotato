Item(by='dheera', descendants=None, kids=[25615997], score=None, time=1609617318, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25615768, text='Yeah so I tried to get that shot about a dozen times on various farms before I finally found some horses that seemed tired, lethargic, and didn&#x27;t move too fast.<p>I also had to stand there for a good 15 minutes in the biting cold before they stopped being interested in me and kind of just stood there.<p>They still occasionally turned their heads though so I quickly snapped my visible light image with a DSLR in one hand on a tripod and scanned over the horse part with the thermal camera in the other, before patiently scanning the rest of the scene. The horses in the distance though still did move, as you can see in the separate thermal&#x2F;visible images in the repo.<p>I had to do a similar thing for the erupting geyser. 2 quick thermal shots in rapid succession for the eruption in one hand, DSLR in the other, then scanned the rest of the scene. Took about maybe 20 tries at least.')
