This would leave the EU relatively defenceless because only France has a truly independent nuclear deterrent - the UK&#x27;s deterrent is effectively part of the US arsenal - and the EU has very few conventional forces of its own.<p>But Putin&#x27;s plan appears to be to destabilise the EU from within by promoting extremist far-right governments with more or less obvious Russian influence and anti-EU sentiments.<p>See also Brexit, Poland, Hungary, and the Ukraine, and the - so far - less effective far right movements being promoted in France, Italy, Portugal, and so on.<p>This is much cheaper and more effective than sending in the tanks. You can promote regime change with a few social media troll factories and by buying or otherwise persuading local politicians.<p>It&#x27;s not a coincidence that the threat of a hypothetical EU army was one of the main pro-Brexit talking points sold to British racists, or that significant funding for Brexit came from Russia.<p>As for goals - for Russia it&#x27;s partly about revenge, and partly about the destruction of Western liberal values. Putin has said as much in public on a number of occasions.')
