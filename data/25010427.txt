The cheaper printers people are buying are cheaper because the manufacturer makes it up on the egregiously priced ink.<p>It depends on how much printing you do, but I doubt it&#x27;ll take you 10 years to recoup or longer than the life of the printer. Has anyone done any numbers?<p>How much are you paying for a cheap HP printer anyway? I don&#x27;t buy em, I&#x27;m not sure what they go for.
