We have plenty of stainable ways to provide for ten billion plus humans.&quot;</i><p>We certainly can (and must) do much, much better at operating sustainable economies and reducing our per-capita environmental footprint. But it is unhelpful that the global population is still growing rapidly, consuming ever more land and resources.<p>Thankfully, as economies develop and standards of living increase, birth rates tend to decline. Current trends suggest the rate of population growth is slowing, and we will eventually reach a stable population some time between 2050 and 2100.<p>I&#x27;m certainly not suggesting we should be telling people they can&#x27;t have children, but anything we can do to encourage sustainable family sizes and bring forward the date when we reach stability is generally a good thing.')
