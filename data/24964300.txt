If they&#x27;ve already sold a hundred at $60k, that&#x27;s $6M in revenue. I feel like they&#x27;d want to raise a lot more, or try to remain profitable. The $3M seems like they&#x27;re taking on dilution (and expectations) for an relatively low amount of money, when their product is $60k and has a fair amount of traction.')
