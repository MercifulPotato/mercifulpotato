IIRC there are 50,000 - potentially millions of &quot;kinds&quot; of proteins found in a human, and the &quot;shape&quot; of most of them is unknown, and that determines a lot about how they work.<p>So imagine you gave an iPhone to someone in the 1800&#x27;s, they wouldn&#x27;t understand how most of it works, but this may be analogous to them finally figuring out some key aspects of the transistor. So it&#x27;s another tool in the toolbelt and like all good tools will be used in all sorts of unpredictable ways.<p>Someone else I&#x27;m sure could do a lot better at explaining how important shape is to understanding the function and behavior of proteins.')
