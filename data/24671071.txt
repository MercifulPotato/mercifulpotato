For free.<p>A good bug-report isn&#x27;t merely whining, it&#x27;s a contribution to the quality of the project. It takes some amount of time and effort to file a decent bug-report, and it helps the project better achieve its goal. It&#x27;s less valuable than a good quality pull-request to fix the issue, but it still counts. (The same is true of good quality feature-requests, but to a much lesser extent in my view.)<p>That&#x27;s different from someone having a sense of entitlement. Unless you&#x27;re on their payroll, you aren&#x27;t obliged to prioritise their bug. More generally, you aren&#x27;t obliged to continue your involvement in the project in any way.')
