I can confirm that the very academic-oriented educated elite overwhelmingly underestimates the complexity and difficulty of farming from an intellectual point of view (not to mention the grueling physical labor 7 days a week).<p>I sometimes wonder if this is why (or part of why) there’s so much resentment from conservatives towards liberals. Liberals tend to paint conservatives as uneducated, dumb, etc., but anyone who’s run a profitable farm knows that your typical elite college grad would immediately fail at it even if they had unlimited free physical labor to do the manual work for them. Operating a profitable farm requires a vast and fairly arcane knowledge base by today’s standards.')
