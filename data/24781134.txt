Unfortunately, in Firefox I occasionally get rendering errors when the tile I&#x27;m pointing at is highlighted. Sometimes weird things happen after clicking a tile and then pointing at a neighbour[0], but mostly it looks as if re-rendering ‘dirty’ areas and updating the framebuffer are somehow getting out of sync[1].<p>It&#x27;s not super annoying, though, because moving the pointer over the affected tiles accusatorily[2] cleans them up.<p>On an even more hair-splitting note: The tile grid looks slightly wonky instead of perfectly regular. (The borders&#x2F;gaps between hexes have different thicknesses.) I think this is because the coordinates of vertices are rounded to integer pixel coordinates before rasterisation? I&#x27;d suggest trying this: Instead of going for exactly regular hexagons, deform them very slightly so their vertices have integer pixel coordinates. Due to the zoom feature this isn&#x27;t the most trivial fix ever, but on lower-resolution displays it would look a lot neater[3].<p>Oh, and a feature request: There should be alternatives to ‘mouse wheel’ and ’middle click &amp; drag’[4] for zooming and panning. Input devices on which performing&#x2F;emulating these actions is inconvenient (or even impossible) aren&#x27;t all that uncommon. (E.g. how do you middle drag on a trackpad?) Panning could be done with a regular (left) drag. For zooming, there could be −&#x2F;+ buttons in a corner, or hotkeys, or right dragging, or dragging while holding a modifier key. Not using scrolling for the zoom function would be nice for players with input devices that have omnidirectional scrolling: They could use that for panning instead. I think it would be fine to keep the defaults as-is, but an option to switch it up in the ‘ESC’ menu would be nice for accessibility.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.paste.pics&#x2F;AE7L2.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.paste.pics&#x2F;AE7L2.png</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.paste.pics&#x2F;AE6X1.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.paste.pics&#x2F;AE6X1.png</a>\n[2] Fun fact: Firefox&#x27;s spelling checker doesn&#x27;t believe that this word exists and suggests ‘satisfactorily’ instead.\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.paste.pics&#x2F;AE7JD.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.paste.pics&#x2F;AE7JD.png</a>\n[4] Which should actually be called ‘middle [button] drag‘, but I&#x27;ll spare you the off-topic rant ;)')
