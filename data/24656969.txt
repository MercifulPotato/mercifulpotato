When most people say IO bound what they really mean is &quot;There&#x27;s a hot CPU but it&#x27;s across a network&quot; ie: &quot;I wrote really inefficient SQL queries, therefor I&#x27;m IO bound, therefor I don&#x27;t have to care about CPU&quot; - and the process pushes further and further downstream as every service talking to one of these &quot;IO bound&quot; services also becomes &quot;IO bound&quot;.')
