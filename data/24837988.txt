Like something that can compete with Zoho Creator, but is actually engineered in a sane manner, and offered at a sane price. It would take the market by storm.<p>Most of the solutions out there either are stunted by no-code workflow that severely limits what you can do (ala Casio), or are code-behind solutions that are poorly engineered, fragile, and require deep platform knowledge and far too much coding to accomplish simple tasks (ala Alpha).<p>Zoho Creator is the happy medium, but it&#x27;s cludgy, badly organized, has terrible support, missing key functionality, and its engineering choices are mind-numbingly stupid.<p>We need an Access for the web, but nothing comes close.')
