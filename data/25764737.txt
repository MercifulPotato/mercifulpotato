Public option and private and all healthcare benefits need to go to salary.  It would make workers able to change jobs easier, businesses able to start and compete with others&#x2F;countries easier, and would reduce ageism as well as going direct to consumer it would help the fixed pricing market of healthcare&#x2F;medical services and supplies.<p>We don&#x27;t get our auto&#x2F;home&#x2F;life insurance through work, why our most private healthcare&#x2F;insurance? It is a legacy thing that needs to end and is harming wage increases, competition and worker&#x2F;labor freedom.<p>Removing healthcare from employer responsibilities is actually pro-business and pro-worker and encourages the competition we need in that industry&#x2F;service.<p>Side note: For some reason I really don&#x27;t like Dropbox color schemes and fonts&#x2F;typography. Feels like it was made in a machine with billions of AB tests but ultimately looks jarring. I miss the nice clean branding and the little illustrations.')
