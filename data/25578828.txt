One should never drive in front of AT&amp;T&#x2F;Oracle stadium when an event is ending, as the traffic is insane and part of the road is closed to allow for the mass of pedestrians.  But Maps interprets pedestrian traffic as car traffic and shows that section of the road as green and moving <i>faster</i> than the sections with actual cars, and tries to direct you down it.')
