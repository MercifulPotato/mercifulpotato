You are right in pointing to all the &quot;boring&quot; stuff that is considered state of the art in chip design being the main reason why these chips are impressive. Apple seems to have pulled all the right strings in that regard. But there is a point at which you can&#x27;t execute the known optimizations any more perfect than you already do - when you&#x27;re already using the best available lithography, implementing all the well-known architectural benefits like big&#x2F;little, big caches, wide decoders etc., you eventually hit a brick wall and the only thing that will get you further are new and creative tricks like the ones discussed in the linked tweets. Each may just add a little, but together they add up to a noticeable improvement with regard to a competitor who also executed all the standard stuff well, but maybe did not think about these particular new optimizations, or might not even be able to implement them due to not being in control of the entire vertical ecosystem.<p>That &quot;competitor&quot; btw is not Intel - they already fail at the basics - but AMD.')
