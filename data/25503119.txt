Being anonymous plays a role in some corners of the internet, but the ones that are contributing the most to the cultures you mention above don&#x27;t depend on anonymity. They&#x27;re being perpetuated and propped up by very knowable online identities, and I highly doubt the folks doing the propping think they&#x27;re safely anonymous.')
