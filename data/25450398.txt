And the source is defined as &quot; the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it&quot;.  A pointer to the upstream tarball plus a poorly organized directory with 58 patches in it isn&#x27;t &quot;the preferred form of the work ...&quot;.  SRPMs are an easy way to make sure that you got it right, that the source really corresponds to be binary.  Attempting to add speed bumps risks getting it wrong and providing a way for pissed-off developers to make trouble.')
