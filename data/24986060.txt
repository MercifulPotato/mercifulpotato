There&#x27;s no way they could make sure something is done &quot;right&quot; - besides checking that the final product fulfills the requirements.<p>From my perspective a manager&#x27;s job is to enable me to do my job, get me the things I need, when I need them, and act as a shield between myself and people who want to waste my time - by attending meetings with leadership and customers.<p>And if they did that, I would call them a great manager.<p>However if they waste my time with endless meetings, where I need to explain technical things they lack the foundational knowledge to understand, because they want to exercise close control over the process to make sure it&#x27;s done &quot;right&quot;, then they&#x27;re killing my productivity and are a terrible manager.')
