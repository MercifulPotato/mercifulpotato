Sometimes consolidations result in cost reduction synergies that partially get passed back to consumers. Elimination of inefficiency is good for everyone including the consumer. Of course there’s downsides of consolidation but I think there are upsides too.<p>An example that comes to mind is Tesla’s acquisition of SolarCity. Another is Amazon’s acquisition of Twitch or Google’s acquisition of YouTube (it seems prohibitive to run video streaming services sustainably&#x2F;profitably without the infrastructure efficiencies of Amazon&#x2F;Google).')
