The NSA sent so many keywords that the BND basically stopped checking, and looking at it in an investigative committee of the german parliament they found a massive amount of clear domestic espiomlnage (keywords like &#x27;Siemens&#x27; or product&#x2F;technology names). Basically the BND was too incompetent to realise they were enabling US espionage on their own companies. Insane but true. You could and should blame the BND but honestly what kind of partner is the NSA if you can&#x27;t even trust them on such basic level?<p>Even more surprising that DK hasn&#x27;t been paying attention to any of that apparently...')
