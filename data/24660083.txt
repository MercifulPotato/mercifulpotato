I don&#x27;t see a reason why should I make less for the same job just because I&#x27;m from a different country. What if you are a digital nomad? In the end it should be more about who YOU are, not what country you are from. I see a big difference between people from different countries even if the education level and years of experience seem to be the same. You will see difference in education even between cities.<p>Knowing that the market is getting even more global it only encourages me to ask for more money, not less.')
