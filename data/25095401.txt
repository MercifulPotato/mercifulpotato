I recommend people reflect on their values (causing pollution and animal suffering) and aim to decrease consumption of animal products to whatever level they are comfortable with. It can be a long process, and we all should be more supportive in helping people align their actions with their values.<p>Needless to say these kinds of conversations are better when the person is receptive and interested, not when you first meet them.')
