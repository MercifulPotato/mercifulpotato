After ~5 years max, these will be unusable.</i><p>First, why would it have to be &quot;user-replacable&quot;? You could take it to Apple, and they&#x27;d replace it. Or you could take it to any third-party repair shop (after 5 years you wouldn&#x27;t have a warranty to care about invalidating this way anyway).<p>Second, so? People buy all kinds of perishable products... Especially in technology, when after 5 years there will be better wireless headphones out there.<p>&gt;<i>Yet another throw-away product from a self-proclaimed environmentally friendly company.</i><p>Youn don&#x27;t really believe company&#x27;s sociatal&#x2F;enviromental concerns, right? This is empty talk. If a company was &quot;environmentally friendly&quot; they would just close.<p>Nobody really needs AirPods or whatever Apple and others sell else over the environment, even if they were user replacable. Even more so when the first imperative of any company is &quot;sell ever more stuff to ever more people&quot;...')
