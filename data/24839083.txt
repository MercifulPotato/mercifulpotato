Not all stereotypes are untrue.<p>When someone says chinese people have slanty eyes it&#x27;s a stereotype but an aspect of it is true. Many many chinese people do have slanty eyes. When most of china says American blue collar workers aren&#x27;t hard working, when china manufacturing out performs the US, when every chinese person I know won&#x27;t hire an American worker... Trust me... Is it racism? Yes but a large aspect of it is true.<p>People like you don&#x27;t like to believe certain things so you&#x27;re unable to use anecdotal evidence to verify anything. You hide behind science and demand quantifiable research. As a chinese person I don&#x27;t need science to verify the racist statement that more chinese people have slanty eyes than white people, because I don&#x27;t hide from reality. It&#x27;s a truth that is real.  Many things are obvious without science.<p>The problem with other people like you is you hide behind racism as well. The reality of this world is that not all people are equal and all races have certain idiosyncrasies in behavior and physicality originating from either genetics or culture that fit a general truth. When someone says something racist or stereotypical that asians are generally shorter than white people or asians have slantier eyes or asians do better in school or asians are harder working... If you analyze these statements and are unbiased you would know that these statements illustrate a truth about reality that you are denying yourself of because of self inflicted blindness. I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re white and I can tell you as much as I don&#x27;t like to hear a white person say things about slanty eyed chinese people I have to objectively admit it&#x27;s true EVEN without scientific evidence because I can make judgements about the world without it. So when I say that my people think americans workers are lazy, slow and unskilled workers you tell me how much of it is true and how much of it is made up for no reason.<p>Maybe you don&#x27;t like to hear that my race and many chinese people think americans are lazy. Maybe you don&#x27;t like to think that an aspect of this is true. Whatever. At least maybe you&#x27;ll understand one thing: Foxconn does not give a flying shit about building a factory in the US. They don&#x27;t care and they have no intention of doing so because if they did they could make it happen but they don&#x27;t. This is a company that built millions of iphones... they wouldn&#x27;t have the comical screw ups you see in the article if they gave a shit. Hopefully your mind can digest this fact without scientific evidence.<p>As for your own anecdotal experience in Asia I can only say that if you&#x27;re white then your experience is colored. Asians will treat you extremely differently, and likely you won&#x27;t hear an asian call you a lazy factory worker. They won&#x27;t even hire you for such a role, most likely you&#x27;ll be hired to be in some bs management role or teaching English if you&#x27;re a white guy in china. Your experience will be largely shielded. The stuff you heard chinese people saying unfiltered in the conference room is something you won&#x27;t hear just the same as how I don&#x27;t hear all the shit white people say about asians. I have to live in the US for at least a decade before I sniff out aspects of the crap that&#x27;s talked about among white people in private. But consider this, there is a huge anti racism movement in america that goes to the point of absurdity. I can&#x27;t say anything about a race even if it&#x27;s true because it will be construed as racism. So even in many white circles the individuals either keep their traps shut if they have racist thoughts or they buy into the whole movement. Which one are you?<p>Oh and it&#x27;s legal to talk shit about your own race in this movement. I can say asians have slanty eyes because I&#x27;m asian but if a non asian says it than he or she is a racist. Pretty logical rule.')
