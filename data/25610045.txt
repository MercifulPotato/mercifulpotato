I&#x27;m mostly excited I don&#x27;t need to find the latest way to get Flash working in Linux every few years.<p>However, there are a few flash games I have as SWF files that I still enjoy playing, but I&#x27;ve never gotten a standalone SWF player to work well.  Does anybody have a solution for running SWF files in a browser in the future or am I going to have to keep a Firefox executable from last decade running in (network-less) Virtualbox?')
