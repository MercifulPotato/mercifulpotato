I think it was basically because early versions of protobuf didn&#x27;t actually support using a message type as field type, so instead people would declare &quot;string&quot; fields and then manually encode&#x2F;decode another protobuf type into that field. When the ability to explicitly use message types as field types was added to the language, they wanted to use it in those existing protocols without breaking compatibility, so the design was fit to the pre-existing practice.<p>I argued for switching to group encoding for submessages when working on proto2, but was shot down. It was a long time ago, but I think the counter-argument was some combination of &quot;it&#x27;s not worth the breakage&quot; and &quot;the ability to lazily parse sub-messages is too valuable&quot;.')
