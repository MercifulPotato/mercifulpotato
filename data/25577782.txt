And everything.<p>Nothing, because no matter what task the generalist robot is assigned to, it&#x27;ll always be theoretically possible to design a custom-built specialist robot that&#x27;s better at that one task.<p>Everything, because no matter how much better your sock-drawer-organizing robot is at organizing socks, it&#x27;ll never be able fold my clothes or make my bed or clean my windows like the generalist robot can. I&#x27;m not going to purchase thousands of different robots for thousands of different tasks when I can just buy one that will do all of them.')
