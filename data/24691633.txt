I guess all stores carry it but it&#x27;s rather a niche product. However, during recent years we have gotten something that&#x27;s sort of in between UHT and regular milk. I don&#x27;t know exactly what the process is, maybe they it&#x27;s just pasteurize it for a bit longer. You need to keep it refrigerated but it will last for weeks. Some people claims it taste a bit different. To me it tastes the same as regular milk. It tastes nothing like UHT though.')
