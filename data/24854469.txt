By wide area, I mean the various sources of heat in any industrial plant.<p>Also, industries would not really prefer if you want to have equipment to tap waste heat at various points in their shops.<p>Even in the example you give, of a turbine outlet, it is economical and practical, only because the heat is concentrated in the exhaust. However, most plants that have turbines, do recoup energy from turbine exhausts.')
