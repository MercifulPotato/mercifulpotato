The original use case for this tool is daily self-prioritization and I wanted to keep it really, really simple. \nPlanning in general is overwhelming and I wanted to take that pain away, coz I found myself spending longer in planning than actually doing. By only considering the impact&#x2F;urgency of a task, you take away the effort&#x2F;time cost and only focus on the task at hand, irrespective of how much time it takes. As an example, if you have a task that is extremely high impact and high urgency, will you drop it in favor of another task that is quicker but lower in impact&#x2F;urgency?\nSince you are defining your own task, the expectation is that your mental model takes care of impact&#x2F; effort and (somehow) fuses that information into one value.<p>I will keep your feedback in mind and think of a nice way. Thanks for the kind words')
