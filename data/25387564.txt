That&#x27;s because what is happening is not &quot;censorship&quot;, but &quot;moderation&quot;.<p>That is also the case with YouTube removing content. It is not &quot;censorship&quot;, but &quot;moderation&quot;.<p>It doesn&#x27;t feel like moderation though, does it?<p>YouTube is not like a forum where a short public list of users make the decision to remove a comment. We&#x27;re talking about a private list of employees removing videos, probably even indirectly via algorithms; and very few alternative places to post videos.<p>Those who are worried about YouTube &quot;censoring&quot; political discourse should already be worried about YouTube &quot;moderating&quot; discourse in general. What we really need are alternative platforms, each with different moderation goals.')
