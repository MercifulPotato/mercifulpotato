Previous generations we&#x27;ve got players like IBM making the chips for the Xbox 360, PS3, and GameCube. AMD made the CPUs on the Xbox One and Playstation 4, along with the upcoming Xbox Series X and Playstation 5.<p>The only somewhat modern game console I can recall with any Intel Inside was the original Xbox, with what was essentially a Pentium III Coppermine CPU. Other than that, they haven&#x27;t really been a player in console gaming for nearly twenty years.<p>They will really begin to feel the pinch from these latest Ryzen CPUs in the desktop gaming market. AMD had definitely been eating more and more of the value market, but Intel had still been holding the IPC&#x2F;clock rate wins so it often had a little bit of an edge over AMD for those who don&#x27;t mind to spend a little premium to get the highest framerates. This launch may make this no longer be true.')
