Cool.  Awesome.  You agree with the person you responded to on that specific issue.<p>To be even more specific, it seems like you agree that it would not require &quot;0 lines written by a backend developer&quot; in order to do something like &quot;taps into data that&#x27; only available from an external service etc.&quot;.<p>&gt;  you need the data, you have to get the data<p>Thats great that you agree with the other person that it does not require &quot;0 lines&quot; in order to do something like &quot;taps into data that&#x27; only available from an external service etc.&quot;.<p>&gt; But that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that client needs data<p>Awesome.
