At the same time, your situation sounds like an actual nightmare to me (also being an introverted person), and the accounts of others in Europe and Russia sound even worse.\nWhereas we in the USA were, relatively speaking, having a great time in 2020, travelling all around the country (flying is so much better - cheap tickets on short notice and no middle seats), enjoying the mountains and parks; most of the year, dining in restaurants, going to gyms, etc. The only thing I do miss are board-game meetups, well and travelling to Russia to see family (and I guess now that we have a re-entry test requirement, I&#x27;ll also miss other international travel, there are enough sensible countries to have made it possible before that). In proportion to the risk, I am taking 10-20x of the precautions I take with flu before I get a shot... instead of almost none, barely any :)<p>I am happy you are doing well with the situation but do wish you guys luck in sorting the lockdown mess ;)')
