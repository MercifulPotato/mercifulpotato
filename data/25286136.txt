Modern raytracers require more processing power because they generate better images. Likewise, compilers of 2020 have awesome static code analyzer which they did not have in 2009.<p>&gt; But doing the same thing should never become slower. Starting up an application should never take longer than it used to. If a feature is going to cost start-up time, I would rather not have it.<p>No feature, no matter how great, could ever justify a slowdown to start-up time? That seems like an absurd position to take. Also, if you read the link to the “law” about software taking up more compute resources over time, you’ll find that the origin is Intel’s Andy Grove complaining that Microsoft wasn’t taking advantage of newer, more powerful chips.<p>Also the title is just kind of rude and dismissive to software engineers - it’s not true that noone at all cares about performance.')
