[1] ICE engines typically only put out peak horsepower at higher RPMs. A Honda Fit has a peak horsepower of 128. However at 2000 RPM the Fit only has 27HP, like this Kandi K27. [2]<p>At similar gross weights the Kandi with the pedal to the metal will accelerate like a Honda Fit driven casually or a truck with a trailer. Enough for 55 mph highways, city streets, or the slow lane of a 65 mph Freeway.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auto.howstuffworks.com&#x2F;how-does-horsepower-figure-into-electric-cars.htm#:~:text=Just%20like%20a%20gasoline%2Dpowered,to%20put%20things%20in%20motion.&amp;text=The%20main%20difference%20is%20immediate,but%20that&#x27;s%20actually%20peak%20horsepower" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;auto.howstuffworks.com&#x2F;how-does-horsepower-figure-in...</a>.<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.automobile-catalog.com&#x2F;curve&#x2F;2018&#x2F;2566010&#x2F;honda_fit_ex_6-speed.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.automobile-catalog.com&#x2F;curve&#x2F;2018&#x2F;2566010&#x2F;honda_...</a>')
