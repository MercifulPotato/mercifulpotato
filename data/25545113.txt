Let me tell you that whilst those topics are useful, they were pretty tailored and if I&#x27;m being 100% honest, I don&#x27;t even recall the majority of them.<p>My day to day job is piping APIs together and making sure we deliver features on time.<p>On the rare occasion that I need to use a data structure or an algorithm to optimize for Time Space complexity, I&#x27;ll either use a community built package or a language level feature. I&#x27;ll never invent my own because whatever I come up with will be half baked anyway.<p>Knowing all the above is useful for passing interviews but not much use in your everyday life unless you are doing something other than SWE such as R&amp;D or data science.<p>Just my 2c.')
