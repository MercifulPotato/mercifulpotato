The primary purpose of a search engine is to provide links to content related to the user&#x27;s search. This gives the content providers visibility. From my understanding this law requires that the search engine pay for listing some media companies as relevant search results. The law also makes it illegal to simply not list those media companies as relevant results. This strikes me as utterly ludicrous.')
