Item(by='Theodores', descendants=None, kids=[25014564], score=None, time=1604747325, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25014025, text='&gt; I own several Raspberry Pi computers (1, 2 and 3)... All of them sit in a box, unused. I’ve played with them, then put them away. Part of that is because the performance hasn’t been that great, but the form factor is a major factor. It feels like the Raspberry Pi 400 has the power I need (for casual projects), and comes in a form factor that I can happily leave plugged in on my desk.<p>Amazing how the addition of a keyboard changes things, with the keyboard being a great box. The snazzy design is definitely a further add that lures me in to wanting one. I too have Pi&#x27;s in boxes, unused.<p>What I would like is a backlit keyboard version. I am already spending £100 on keyboards so this is achievable. I would program mine so that the keyboard appeared over bluetooth to my main computer from where I would ssh into my Pi to do things like run a web server. For a long time I have wanted to do local development of web projects on a separate box so there is a clear break between client and server but everything is local.')
