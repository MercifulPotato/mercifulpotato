My degree is chemistry from a good-not-great institution. Since getting into SE, I&#x27;ve progressed to technical leadership very rapidly.<p>I have dedicated myself to applying for jobs, but it&#x27;s not that much work. It&#x27;s about making sure you advertise matching strengths.<p>I make sure my CV only has the minimum information needed to sell this. Then only job of my CV is to get a callback. After that, it comes down to my interviewing.<p>I also have an extraordinarily high success rate. I&#x27;ve applied to 8 SE jobs in my career. 7 of those led to interviews, 4 to jobs. Of the three interviews, 2 of them I chose not to progress with (i.e. they didn&#x27;t reject me, I rejected them).<p>Maybe my strength has been applying to realistic opportunities. My first jobs were low paying roles in non-tech companies.<p>Remember that your strongest selling point is your most recent experience. As a fresh graduate, your university matters the most. As soon as you have your first job, your experience here will dictate your next step.<p>Since my first job, I still get asked about how I transitioned from chemistry to SE, but the tone has changed. People don&#x27;t expect me to justify the change, they want to hear about the similarities, differences, and strengths that have translated. It&#x27;s become one of my favorite interview questions to answer now.')
