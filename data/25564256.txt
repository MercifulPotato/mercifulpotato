The only constraint is that excessive spending by any sector of the economy, whether households, firms, or public, could cause inflationary pressures. &quot;<p>Again: the government is completely free to control any assets it wants to control (as long as they are denominated in local currency). The constraints would be &#x27;politics and inflation&#x27;.')
