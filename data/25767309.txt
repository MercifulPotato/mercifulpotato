I have their old model from a few years back, and it&#x27;s been serving quite well for all my needs. The OS is their custom version of OpenWRT, and you can do stuff like LXC, Wireguard and all that quite easily.<p>The only problem is the ARMv7 hardware, which doesn&#x27;t really cut it with modern Internet speeds anymore, especially with Wireguard.<p>That said, I can&#x27;t wait for pfSense and opnSense finally support Wireguard. And pihole should finally get a FreeBSD version. I&#x27;d much more prefer the sense systems over the wrt, but the time is not yet here.')
