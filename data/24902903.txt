This is not true.<p>For an analogy imagine a town that with an arsonist setting lots of homes on fire.  It is obviously true that &quot;storing gas in your hose contributes to houses burning down&quot;, but &quot;getting rid of gasoline in house will not fix the fires&quot;.<p>For clarity I consider &quot;the algorithm&quot; the sophisticated ordering of your follower&#x27;s posts, and the recommendation of new followers.  This means getting rid of &quot;the algorithm&quot; mostly means going back to the 00&#x27;s when post where sorted by date, likes, or simple formula that combined the two. Content still went viral, and people still sorted themselves into information silos.  This meant people spend more time searching for content, but I don&#x27;t see any real fundamental difference that is going to result in less polarization.<p>The underlying problem is <i>people communicating with other people</i>.  I argue if we got rid of the internet it would not get rid of this polarization and spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories.  In fact you saw many similar problems prior to the <i>Civl War</i>, when the fastest method of communication was a telegram.  People still distributed pamphlets, formed clubs with like minded individuals, gossiped, and spread rumors and falsehoods.<p>I think people grab on to idea &quot;the algorithm is causes polarization&quot;, because it puts single thing, presents a specific solution (change&#x2F;get rid of the algorithm), and has an specific, abstract group of people to blame the owners and employees of the big tech companies.  People don&#x27;t like it what the problems affecting their lives are caused by dozens of interacting forces and there is no clear simple solution, but rather a lot of work in a lot of areas.<p>As an aside drop in disappearing manufacturing jobs and illegal immigrants.
