Such a book (or whatever book-like device, i.e. a list of inputs with corresponding outputs) that allows a person to interact with someone in a language they don&#x27;t speak is an absurdity, it cannot exist.<p>Yup, that&#x27;s both true and a pretty convincing rebuttal of the Chinese \nRoom.<p>&gt; But the notion is not far from the bone-headed simplicity of early AI and machine translation efforts.<p>So, what? No one, anywhere claimed that those early efforts were self-aware or had understanding, nor are they what the Chinese Room is even notionally directed at: it was directed at the limit of possibility, not the then-current implementations.')
