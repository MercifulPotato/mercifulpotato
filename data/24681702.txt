Maybe that&#x27;s a good thing, but I always find it interesting that people just point the finger at the manufacturer and not the consumer that ultimately buys the products and tosses it (usually without properly recycling it). It&#x27;s the same kind of garbage as trying to blame Exxon for extracting petroleum and ignoring the SUV in your driveway.<p>&gt;In any sustainable system Apple should either be the first interested in repairing those devices or forced to do it.<p>You don&#x27;t even know what&#x27;s wrong with these devices.')
