People are willing to end their family ties due to becoming a fan for a political figure. I don&#x27;t care which side you are on, but to be hateful against someone close to you, literally an individual that would, I don&#x27;t know, give&#x2F;lend you money to eat if you&#x27;re broke, just because they &quot;support&quot; someone. And yes, it&#x27;s a two way street, which makes it even sicker.<p>99% of people will never meet these humans playing government. Which is all they are. Flawed humans.<p>No matter how good or bad you think a politician is, you shouldn&#x27;t revolve your life around them and their ideals. Just basing your personal ideals on someone else&#x27;s bullshit marketing platform just so you can have an easy category bias against people is pretty fucked up. In truth, if you&#x27;re a pro-politician anything, you&#x27;re generally a complete idiot. Yea, unpopular opinion. But that was the real lesson from WW2. Don&#x27;t follow any type of political trend or leader, no matter how well intentioned because the road to Hell is paved in good intentions. Make your decisions for yourself and judge people on their own character and actions. But hey, everyone loves a good witch hunt mixed with a lynching.')
