What do you mean by &quot;nearly unplayable&quot;? I&#x27;m certain you don&#x27;t actually mean that based on what I&#x27;ve seen of the game.<p>Of all the obvious criticisms of the game, it&#x27;s that they couldn&#x27;t build out the world to meet the narrative hyped by trailers.<p>Frankly, I have no clue what the generation of consoles have to do with the problemâ€”the game looks great, at least for a release so early in the generation.<p>Fuck the studio for their labor practices but the product ain&#x27;t the problem.')
