(Basically equivalent to them paying to have an extra room built into your house that you only go into to work, but for urbanites where that’s impractical.)<p>&gt; camaraderie of a team<p>I don’t know about you, but my work Slack has about a similar level of camaraderie to any Discord group-chat I share with my friends.<p>&gt; we often play a game before going back to work<p>Online games exist!<p>(Though arranging this is kind of finicky; it requires that everyone already have a particular online-game client installed and signed up. There’s no “pick up and play” kind of group gaming available here.<p>IMHO there’s a niche to be filled in collaboration software for one that seamlessly supports sharing entertainment — playing games together, watching TV&#x2F;movies together, etc. — embedded within the workspace view itself.)<p>&gt; grabbing lunch with co-workers<p>I mean, you could just keep talking to your coworkers while eating lunch, if you like. Make a #breakroom or #lunch channel.<p>You could even make it a video call, if you want to induce the same physical pain in people with social anxiety at the idea that people are watching their eating habits. :P<p>Certainly, none of these things are low-friction at first, or particularly low-friction even in the steady-state <i>today</i>. But they’re things where the friction <i>could</i> be greatly lowered. If tons of people are going to stay remote, that’s going to provide a good market for companies to create new products for.<p>(I’m betting on VR groupware, myself.

Literal “virtual offices”, with an unlimited number of unboundedly-large virtual spaces in which to position whatever shared or private app-window views you like. Especially if consideration is made for it to also gracefully degrade into a less-immersive analogous view — e.g. a 2D infinite-zoom layout of all the open app-windows — for people accessing it on screens.)')
