So it is essentially showing the busy areas in the store and areas that are not receiving as much traffic. Wouldn&#x27;t that be also reflected in sales data (i.e. items in low traffic areas have less sales volume?), which is maybe why they&#x27;re there in the first place...?<p>How is this type of data actionable. Is there a team of middle managers that looks at this type of data and decides to continue rearranging their stores? It seems like the product layouts in my local grocery stores have hardly changed in the last decade, so I think I must be missing the point here.')
