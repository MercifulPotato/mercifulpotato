I forgot mine.<p>Safety wise, if you are afraid of bears you need to be confident enough to handle flares, a large handgun and a large calibre hunting rifle. There are alot of bears, I saw three while I was there though none were close to major settlements.<p>We did get shown sole CCTV footage from the dock where a bear came down and broke into and ate a crate of frozen whale meat off the dock, that was fun.<p>Oh and take or get a Greenland dog from one of the kennels to go with you anywhere - they can tell when a bear is near. They aren&#x27;t pets though, don&#x27;t expect them to behave like a lapdog.<p>If you like beer be prepared to take quite some money for it.')
