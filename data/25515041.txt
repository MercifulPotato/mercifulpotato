Resolving disagreements between co-founders I tricky.<p>I would request OP to assume good intent and ask the following question.<p>&gt; What are you giving me in return of my 40% of the stock ? Why is that a fair price ?<p>I do not know, but it is perfectly possible that the other person might have a good answer. If you have already made up your plan you guys can agree on some kind of plan where you divest your stock over a period in one way to another.<p>I have a suspicion that the other co-founder probably does not want OP around for whatever reason. But OP can help him by simply taking a break while keeping the stock.')
