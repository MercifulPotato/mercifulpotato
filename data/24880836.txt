There&#x27;s a reason Uyghurs are being interned en masse, where Tibet only gets heavy grid surveillance and policing. There were hundreds of terrorist attacks over the years causing thousands of death by Uyghur extremist in China, including one TianAnMen. Terrorism is by far the largest factor because the baseline guarantee by the state should be safety, so Beijing grossly overreacts, with full support of the masses. Not just the Han mind you, no one likes their planes hijacked or train stations knived.<p>&gt;Money<p>The issue is you can&#x27;t pay people to secularize. You have to brainwash. XJ is just repeat classic CCP political work + indoctorination + work camps. The dirty secret being that on balance, they work. Last I read China sunk 2.1 Trillion RMB &#x2F; 300 Billion USD for the entire &quot;security apparatus&quot; in the region over the last few years. I mean I guess they could just cut every Uyghur a 200,000RMB &#x2F; 30,000USD check and tell them to renounce Islam. Maybe you&#x27;ll get some takers, but not the extremist, the primary group of concern, at the cost of pissing off 99.2% of the country. So we have education and vocational training and a little gitmo for recalcitrants.')
