That&#x27;s a well known technique for finding the roots of polynomials.<p>&gt;<i>This being said, I am not aware of interpolation search being actually used productively in software today. If you have a reference to such an artefact, please share!</i><p>This is also my response to that note in the article, interpolation search has been well-known in the numerical methods world since ancient times. ;)')
