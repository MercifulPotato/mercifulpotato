Advertising itself is fine.<p>I block ads because:<p>- They are often bloated with CPU-intensive JavaScript that makes my web experience less than smooth. I demand that scrolling and other UI actions be imperceptibly fast, and 90% of the time I find it&#x27;s ads that are the culprit in making them perceptibly slow.<p>- They are often loaded with tracking and fingerprinting spyware. I blocked Facebook ads as soon as they started showing me stuff that I had searched for on eBay and Amazon. Like, WTF. Big nope. I was fine with the ads, but not that level of tracking and sharing user data across companies.<p>As such, I block ads in protest of the above. But if I establish a mechanism that clicks the ads in the background, they don&#x27;t have to know whether it is me or a robot that clicked them -- as far as they are concerned my residence is a black box, and there are some intelligent beings inside this black box that click the ads, some of those intelligent beings are made of silicon and some are made of carbon, and they don&#x27;t need to know the chemistry of what being caused the click. At some point in the far future of civilization and humanity, I expect biological chemistry to be abstracted out, and laws in place to not discriminate on the chemistry of a being, and economies will have to be rebuilt around that assumption. I&#x27;m just living that future now, and as far as the big companies are concerned, they can start thinking about new monetization models now that better align the collective incentives of my blacxbox with theirs.<p>Traditional ads don&#x27;t influence my purchasing behavior much either. I&#x27;m not their typical consumer. So it wouldn&#x27;t have made a difference. My purchasing decisions are based more on a combination of first principles and friend&#x2F;coworker recommendations.<p>Now there&#x27;s the issue of how ads might drive revenue, and that&#x27;s how the internet is kept free. Sure. But I think there are other ways to drive that than the current iteration of ads. Social-media-ify it, gamify it, make it fun, and I&#x27;ll actually want to interact with the ads. Make me have to play a game to get a $1 Starbucks discount, and I might play -- and go to Starbucks! You see, carbon-based lifeforms love coffee, and love games, so the possibility of a discount on that might actually make me want to play the game.<p>But none of this tracking-spyware-CPU-bloat-while-I&#x27;m-trying-to-do-something-else please. Plain &lt;a href=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;blah&quot;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, no megabyte-sized images, and no cross-site sharing of user data? If they can agree to that, I&#x27;ll stop blocking.')
