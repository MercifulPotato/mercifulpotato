I believe recently Amazon admitted to storing all these records IIRC (please correct me if I am mis-remembering it).<p>This is not entirely correct the way I understand it. While they&#x27;re listening as in, the mic is active, the full text processing is not happening until the trigger word. There&#x27;s a reason Siri is called Siri (distinctive pattern, easy to pick up before applying a stricter check). The issue with the recording was that the device thought it heard the trigger word and the mismatched sample was still uploaded.<p>What I don&#x27;t believe is happening is actual background conversation processing by the assistants on purpose. (There are going to be tech slipups) Simply because the moment that&#x27;s revealed, they&#x27;ll get a regulatory ban hammer they really do not want. It would also chew through either your data or battery and be easy to notice.<p>I don&#x27;t put that much faith in TVs though for example...')
