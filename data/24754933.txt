Take a look at the map and see for yourself - perhaps it is still happening when you read this.<p>I also specifically remember 9 years ago during my aforementioned undergraduate report obtaining spreadsheets from the UK National Grid with time segments containing the direction and amount of power transferring via each interconnect (you&#x27;re going to have to take my word for it... my copy of that data is long gone). These also showed exactly what I described, power being imported and exported simultaneously.<p>I expect there is a reason for this, perhaps arbitrage but maybe more likely some minimum power has to flow to keep connected sensors&#x2F;relays&#x2F;whatever from misbehaving, or some other engineering reason.')
