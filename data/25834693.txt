I suspect that TSMC runs into the wall that is quantum physics at around 1-2nm. Considering that TSMC has said that they will be in full production of 3nm in 2022, I can&#x27;t see 1nm being much beyond 2026-2028. What happens then? Does a stall in die shrinks allow other fabs to catch up?<p>It appears to me that Intel stalling at 14nm is what opened the door for TSMC and Samsung to catch up. Does the same thing happen in 2028 and allow China to finally catch up?')
