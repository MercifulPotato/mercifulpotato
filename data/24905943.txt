Almost no one sees a problem with that because they believe it takes expensive equipment... until you go, take a 600mm+ tele lens and <i>prove</i> to them that their sensitive information can be stolen for under 200$ worth of camera rental fees.<p>Or, remember the immigration debate in 2015? The picture of three year old Alan Kurdi on the beach and its consequences in politics? Never underestimate the power of images and videos.')
