For a Pro, it would be 1.200TBW.<p>Unfortunately, neither of my disks are that big. Home is on a 256GB SSD which boils down to 300TBW. System SSD is a bit older 120GB OCz Vertex 3. This model doesn&#x27;t have a TBW rating.<p>As a result, if I don&#x27;t do anything heavy, it&#x27;d last for a century in the best case. I&#x27;m not sure about OCz though. It reports 100% life remaining but it&#x27;s from the skunkworks era of the SSDs so, I can&#x27;t be sure for anything.<p>The numbers climb very fast when you start to develop stuff and enter compile -&gt; test -&gt; debug  cycle. So, I&#x27;d rather have that endurance and use it while developing software rather than eating it while doing daily stuff.')
