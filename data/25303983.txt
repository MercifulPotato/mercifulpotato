Can you also easily send email from any mailbox? And is there blocking&#x2F;accepting from specific senders?<p>In TricepMail, messages to e.g. hn@loh.tricepmail.com versus ignore@loh.tricepmail.com are separated in the UI, and you can configure the &quot;ignore&quot; mailbox to block all incoming messages. You can also setup mailboxes that accept messages from specific senders only.<p>TricepMail also has everything (and a bit more) that you&#x27;ve listed under &quot;Web interface&quot;. TricepMail isn&#x27;t meant to be used for trash&#x2F;throwaways, but you can use it for that if you want. It&#x27;s meant to compartmentalize real email for the demands of today, especially for things like the FCC requiring email addresses on applications.<p>For example, I would consider incoming email from the FCC to be extremely important (definitely not trash), but I wouldn&#x27;t want to use my usual personal email address for this. I would still want to see it without going through all the hassle of setting up a separate email server and&#x2F;or using a separate email client. I want everything in one simple, organized place. This is why I created TricepMail.<p>I&#x27;ve starred your repo. Looking forward to seeing its progress. :)')
