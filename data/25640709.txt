We had a live session via thunderbird but there were no channels of support. Luckily we were able to register her old mobile number to achieve a password reset, thanks to a helpful phone provider and NOT google.<p>My mailserver is marked as spam by gmail, a helpful HN commentor pointed out it may be my lack of ipv6 which appears to be the cause. I have no idea why ipv6 would indicate that I’m not a spammer, I can’t ask google because they don’t have a support line.<p>I understand others have far more expensive (read: &gt;1m$) problems with google specifically, and I know I’m not alone here.<p>I just hope that by continually airing grievances with lack of (useful) customer service by major providers, they end up caving and investing in customer support.<p>Until then, fuck you google.')
