Then again, Trump is still the sitting president and therefore the <i>effective</i> head of his party (even tho, thankfully, at least some of his party are now abandoning him). I wonder what would happen if the Trump campaign switched to RNC-operated stripe accounts, with the RNC&#x27;s blessing...<p>As for Google + Apple + Amazon (+ probably every other cloud provider and virtually every other hosting company) cutting off Parler or refusing their business in the first place: Parler was accused of not moderating &quot;enough&quot;. This in itself is not yet criminal, given section 230 (which in this context ironically Trump wanted gone so bad he tried to hold the military budget hostage over it), and the definition of &quot;enough moderation&quot; was kept vague enough by Apple and Google and Amazon that Parler couldn&#x27;t possibly ever comply if they wanted to.<p>The same argument about under-moderation can be made against facebook, e.g. when they aided - or even enabled - the Rohingya genocide, which saw thousands of people killed and hundreds of thousands of people displaced. Even the UN directly pointed fingers at facebook. Facebook admitted to their role[1], but came up with a bunch of lame excuses like that they do not really have any content moderators that understand the language.<p>People dug up quite a number of screenshots (anecdotal evidence) of abhorrent things written on Parler to justify them getting punished. But I found that not really convincing to single out Parler like that. If I went digging on Twitter or Facebook, or could see what people tell each other in Whatapp of Telegram groups, I would find the exact same things. I have reported things on twitter in the past, like people making extremely thinly-veiled death threats or inciting violence, and twitter&#x27;s response has been sluggish and often in favor of the people talking about &quot;nooses&quot; and &quot;you&#x27;ll get what&#x27;s coming to you&quot; in the same sentence.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;06&#x2F;technology&#x2F;myanmar-facebook.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;11&#x2F;06&#x2F;technology&#x2F;myanmar-facebo...</a>')
