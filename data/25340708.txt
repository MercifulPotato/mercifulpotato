The captain reported on the radio,&quot; everyone stay put.&quot; and for the most part they did, even while the captain was escaping the ship. 299 people drowned that day, many of them the local school in Anson. I remember walking past the highschool that very night and seeing the crowd of the bereaved. If more of those people chose to disobey a very strange order on a ship, more would have lived.<p>It&#x27;s important to know when a situation has really become an emergency and normal rules like, &quot;listen to the captain even if he doesn&#x27;t make sense&quot; stop applying. The earlier you are able to recognise that shit has hit the fan and enter emergency rule breaking mode the better.<p>In everyday life, I definitely notice that people do not take say, fire alarm seriously and act quickly enough. Don&#x27;t be a deer caught in the spotlight, forge your own path and take these things seriously your life may depend on it (even if its 1% chance that that alarm is a real one).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sinking_of_MV_Sewol" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sinking_of_MV_Sewol</a>')
