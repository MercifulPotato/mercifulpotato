The gritty bits are in the server, leaving editors to do the syntax highlighting and project management.<p>This sounds great, but Emacs doesn&#x27;t ship with support for them, and Emacs&#x27; built-in package management is kinda unfinished.<p>To get good C support, for instance, I would;<p>1. Install straght.el for its use-package implementation<p>2. Pull in the lsp-mode package (or eglot, I suppose)<p>3. Install ccls somehow, because Emacs won&#x27;t<p>4. Pull in the projectile package, because the built in ede is kinda cumbersome<p>5. Pull in magit, because the built in  vc mode is nowhere near as good<p>6. Configure lsp-mode to grok ccls<p>7.
