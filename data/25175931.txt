Item(by='kazinator', descendants=None, kids=[25176570], score=None, time=1606033937, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25175251, text='&gt; <i>Having a single rapid workflow for saving an edited PNG.</i><p>You mean instead of two rapid workflows?<p>1. File -&gt; Overwrite Existing &lt;whatever&gt;.png.<p>First time it is used, there is prompting. After that, no prompting. Has no hotkey.<p>2. Or use Export As, which has a Shift-Ctrl-E hotkey.<p>The first time you use Export As, there is prompting. But after the first use, the &quot;Overwrite Existing &lt;whatever&gt;.png&quot; menu item (for workflow 1) disappears from the File menu and is replaced by &quot;Export To &lt;whatever&gt;.png&quot;. This action has no prompting at all, and has Ctrl-E as the hot key.<p>Workflow 1 has less initial prompting than 2; it goes straight to the Export dialog (for setting parameters) without prompting for a filename or overwrite confirmation; it&#x27;s good if you&#x27;re editing many images and saving just once.')
