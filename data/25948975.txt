Certain things are never okay. But being intolerant and demanding tolerance is a shitty move as well. And it is nowhere near as clever as the people who try this think it is.<p>The discourse about whether and how much we should tolerate the intolerant is old and has be well discussed by post WWII philosophy. If we want to defend the freedom of all, we need to restrict those freedoms for the people who try to get rid of them.<p>Or as a neo nazi once said to me: &quot;we want to establish the old power again, so we can silence you. until that happens, we want free speech&quot;.')
