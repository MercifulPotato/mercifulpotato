Donkeys are extremely territorial, and snap into this fit of pissed off rage when an intruder threatens their territory or what they identify as &#x27;their&#x27; herd. Usually a well-acclimated herd will understand the donkey as their protector. If being ran down by this raging anger-beast doesn&#x27;t spook a predator enough, a donkey will stomp it bad enough to bring new meaning to the phrase &#x27;ass-kicking&#x27;. I&#x27;ve never seen a pasture-mated donkey scared by much of anything other than loud noise, they&#x27;re brave and loyal to a fault.<p>Great Pyrenees dogs are amazing defenders as well. I&#x27;ve seen those put the brakes on some prowling coyotes and put a chase on them so hard that they defy physics to get over a fence. Exceptionally friendly to humans, and other dogs, outside their pastures. One of the good boys used to visit for pets and treats. :)')
