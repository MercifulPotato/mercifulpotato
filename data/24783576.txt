I would have thought that the outer layers would start to compress the inner layers, relaxing some of their stress.  Is the a mech-e 101 type of link you could pass along to help get me up to speed?  Or maybe you are saying that 3.6 GPa times the ratio of 100 mm to 1 mm gets us to the 360 GPa mark?  So you don&#x27;t need to have layers of Kevlar as your &quot;anvil&quot;, you could use something else more rigid, and just wrap one layer of Kevlar around it and develop the needed pressure.  Thanks.')
