The thing I would say first is that building for online courses is tricky and you have to approach it very differently to offline classroom teaching. Trying to shift directly from offline to online usually results in things not working well - as many are finding during Covid. In many ways building an online course, especially if you are using video, is more like being a producer than a pure teacher&#x2F;trainer. Especially were you use video, people expect a high standard so that takes a lot of work and one thing you have to keep in mind is that it&#x27;s very hard to change video once it&#x27;s up there in many cases - so it can be harder to keep things updated.')
