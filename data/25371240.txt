Reducing the quantity of JS in favour of letting the browser just do its job, is one of the best investments I can make against technical debt. JS can&#x27;t be abandoned completely, but I measure every kilobyte jealously, and graceful degradation to baseline browser behaviour is my north star; simply <i>using</i> baseline browser behaviour is by definition my optimum limit for long-term productivity.<p>Thirdly; for folks depending on assistive browsing technologies. Yes, they do work in the face of dynamic web pages &amp; SPAs, but many screen readers are still at their best when tabbing through plain HTML with a sprinkling of ARIA markup.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s also a simple yet versatile mechanism. Good for anything from FAQ items to dropdown menus, even with default styles.')
