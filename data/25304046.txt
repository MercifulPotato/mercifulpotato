The astroturfing isn&#x27;t even subtle and the same few dozens of accounts dominate the front page day in and day out. The content on the frontpage, r&#x2F;popular, r&#x2F;all is starting to congeal into screenshots of tweets.<p>The mods of the biggest subreddits don&#x27;t seem to care if the content that gets posted actually lives up to the title and purpose of the subreddit. At this point I&#x27;m convinced Reddit&#x27;s platform is being used as a propaganda tool, with the goal of bombarding users with the same views in every major subreddit.')
