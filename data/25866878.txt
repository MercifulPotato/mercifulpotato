Item(by='musicale', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611276923, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25866781, text='&gt; artists are promoting merch because selling albums&#x2F;EPs doesn&#x27;t pay the bills. It&#x27;s fascinating what merch people will buy too - tapes, signet rings, â‚¬30 caps, bags...<p>Pretty much this. The music is basically promotion for the merch, which actually makes money.<p>Cassette and vinyl sales are also important because in addition to the nostalgic (hissy&#x2F;scratchy but also warm and saturated) &quot;analog&quot; sound the physical recording is a fun collector&#x27;s item and something you can show off.<p>Hopefully live shows will return at some point as well.')
