Yeah, a lot of times you can pick up a new programming language by playing around with it. I don&#x27;t think most people will have much luck learning say, advanced mathematics by just futzing around and skimming Wikipedia though.<p>Even topics like ML (an example referenced by the original post) benefit greatly from an understanding of theory and fundamentals. Yeah maybe any random dev can hack together a model by downloading scikit-learn and throwing data at it, but you&#x27;ll probably get much better results if you take the time to learn about concepts like cross-validation, overfitting, etc.<p>The &quot;just do stuff&quot; attitude has its merits, but there&#x27;s also something to be said for working from first principles and learning some theory to back up your applied skills.')
