Item(by='luckylion', descendants=None, kids=[24776448], score=None, time=1602677949, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24775571, text='&gt; Imagine learning that the growth exactly resembles of actions of WWII Nazis against Jews, only now by Zionist Jews against Palestinians.<p>If you learn that anywhere, I think you&#x27;re talking to antisemites. It&#x27;s really not the same, it&#x27;s not similar beyond &quot;a state does stuff, Nazi Germany was a state, Israel is a state, so it&#x27;s the same&quot;, but that&#x27;s not a useful comparison.<p>&gt; If you&#x27;re German, you might feel especially emotional about it, given the shared history.<p>I&#x27;m German, I don&#x27;t feel especially emotional about it, and I often do feel like that the obsession with Israel is more about &quot;see, the Jews are doing it too, we&#x27;re not so bad&quot; and less about &quot;what a terrible thing&quot;. Exactly because most people are very upset about Israel doing stuff and completely ignore far worse things being done by others.<p>As for Turkey: you don&#x27;t need to go back to the Armenian Genocide. Turkey still occupies parts of Cyprus, is de-facto annexing parts of Syria and is working closely with what has been formerly known as ISIS, currently sending them to Azerbaijan to fight against Armenia.<p>The point is: if a vendor would say &quot;we don&#x27;t sell to Israel because of ethics&quot; but sells to countries that are ethically far worse, their problem obviously isn&#x27;t ethical in nature. Their problem would be Israel. Nevertheless, FinFisher didn&#x27;t, so it&#x27;s hypothetical. They probably didn&#x27;t sell to Israel either, because Israel has no need to buy, having a strong security industry with lots of vendors for offensive tools.')
