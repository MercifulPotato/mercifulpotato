The first rank is called &quot;assistant professor,&quot; followed by &quot;associate professor,&quot; and then &quot;full professor.&quot;  Associate and full are tenured ranks, which is why there isn&#x27;t much hiring at that level.<p>Also, one would expect any open position at a US university to be advertised, most likely in <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i>.  This is something perhaps only someone who&#x27;s got a little familiarity with the academic job market may know, so, I suppose one could be forgiven for not knowing it, but I would assume that one would at least google for open positions at Harvard to find out if it really exists.<p>That said, na√Øve or not, I also don&#x27;t think victim blaming is a productive thing to do here.  All it does is discourage people from speaking out about their experiences, which means we can&#x27;t learn from them.  It may also discourage people from seeking help when they think they might be getting phished.')
