Yes, it took that long!<p>I noticed that although apartments stay listed for months,\ntheir price hardly drops; at least in more residential areas.\nEventually, some will lower by just as little as ~$100 after \n~1 month of listing.<p>I think landlords prefer to keep the units vacant rather than\nadjust the rent. They think&#x2F;hope things will go back as they \nwere next year. Honestly, I would not be surprise if they do.<p>Though, they perhaps confuse stock market with real economy.<p>That said, newer, remodelled, bigger (+office) units go almost immediately.<p>The average old SF dump stay listed longer. No surprises there.')
