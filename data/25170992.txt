Once you have used a gantry type CNC, the router is too limiting. One problem is needing to recalibrate the reference surfaces with their tape, but the big one is clamping and fixturing. With the shaper, you need to have it touch the work, or at least rest on a reference plane. With a gantry machine you can hold small pieces and cut all the way around them. Basically, the shaper is only good for internal features, while a cnc router is good for internal and external features and can also do 3D contour work.')
