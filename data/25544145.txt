Suet or vegetable oil minced with crickets(or other mass raisable insect grubs??).\nThey would have to be on poles to stop predators and would have to suit the birds habits, with the ability to feed hovering birds as well as perchers. It will take some research, but lines of these just off roads would provide a number of lines of feeders that could be maintained via the road, with a liftable hopper top I think many birds would adapt to this lifeline during their migration. It would involve many tons of food for the migratory season and to be established in advance.')
