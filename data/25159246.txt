After a few meetings, the issue of a name came up and we arranged for a face-to-face meeting to brainstorm.<p>I didn’t want a name like, <i>System Administration Software Inc</i> because what would we do if we ended up writing software for garage door openers.<p>I suggested picking a catchy name that wouldn’t identify what we made too narrowly.<p>Among the names I proposed that I still remember over 30 years later were <i>Apache</i> and <i>Emerald City Software</i>; someone else proposed <i>Veritas</i>. None of these were unanimously liked by the group. I then recalled a unique hostname used by a friend and suggested <i>Tivoli</i>, everyone liked it and the name is still used today.<p>There was one wrinkle, when I went to the state’s Attorney General’s office to register the name for incorporation, I discovered that there was already a Tivoli Inc in Texas. (I didn’t realize that there was a small town in Texas by the name Tivoli.) So I tacked on another word and the company’s new name became <i>Tivoli Systems</i>.<p>Out of the original group, only two of us actually started the company. We quit our jobs and went all in.')
