I was 12 and in 6th grade at the time.<p>After being kicked off of AOL for that and other DoS related crap related to these silly &quot;progs&quot; I was making, I had to get a different local dialup ISP and find a new way to chat (IRC).<p>People used to send the IRC CTCP &quot;VERSION&quot; command to see what IRC client you were using, and the folks in the leet haxor chats such as #2600 would make fun of you for being a newb if you were on mIRC (and thus Windows) and not Linux or *BSD.<p>So I had to figure out Linux so I could be cool, which was kindof a pain in the ass in 1997 still. Hardware support for things like ethernet and video cards often required recompilation of the linux kernel just to get it working etc. I learned a lot from that and often stayed up until 6 in the morning much to my parents concern and dismay.<p>But luckily for me, who did poorly at school for lack of interest and didn&#x27;t go to college, the computer&#x2F;coding thing turned out OK for me.  I&#x27;m 36 and work at one of the big companies and make a pretty good living as an SRE. Somewhat ironically, I work at Microsoft now.')
