You are presumably writing some other, higher-level language. I would fully expect you to know that language in detail and even better to understand the performance implications of the choices you make in that language. Knowing the lower level details helps there, but it&#x27;s not 100% required.<p>With git, it&#x27;s something you _directly_ interact with so I would expect you to understand it in great detail.')
