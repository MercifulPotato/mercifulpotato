A few times a week when I discover an artist I like, it&#x27;s one click to look at their entire back catalog, listen to it sequentially, browse the artist bio, click through to the artist&#x27;s social media to see what projects they&#x27;re up to, right click and view who produced the tracks to find similarly-produced tracks, etc!<p>&gt; it was something you waited for<p>I follow many artists and look forward to their upcoming albums. Why should my wait be extended by manufacturing, supply chains, my schedule to go to a shop, or my own budget to own physical media?<p>And I say all this as both a heavy Spotify user and a listener of vinyl records. I always get the albums I enjoy most on vinyl for higher fidelity active listening and the physical visual artwork that accompanies the disk.')
