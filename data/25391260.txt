I got a second hand one for cheap. It&#x27;s easily a decade old, possibly more, judging by the armrest mechanism (which had a redesign, mine is old). Using it every day for two years, on top of what it already had. Still looks brand spanking new.<p>In case something breaks, I can easily replace any component. There is a healthy replacement parts market. In fact, the person that sold it to me was essentially living off &quot;flipping&quot; Aerons - they would get them wholesale from companies, and then refurbish them.<p>If you are buying them new, they are covered by a 12 YEAR WARRANTY. Parts and labor.<p>The AirPods price would be totally justified if they were even remotely like this. Make the battery user-replaceable (even better if they are swappable, for more run-time) and provide user-replaceable parts, plus a healthy warranty, and this could be potentially the Aeron of the headset world.<p>It isn&#x27;t, though. The battery is the most egregious issue. Sure, we can understand why Airpods don&#x27;t have replaceable batteries. Not that it&#x27;s impossible, but at least it&#x27;s understandable - they are tiny. It&#x27;s also possible to understand why Macbook batteries are not easily replaceable - they occupy most of the internal space and are rather fragile.<p>I don&#x27;t know what Apple&#x27;s excuse is, this time.')
