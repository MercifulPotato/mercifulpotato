Well-meaning citizens say &quot;Well, we trust the police so if we just let them use their discretion everything will be all right&quot;. That has the predictable effect it has everywhere in the world which is that the police then choose to monetize that discretion.<p>Similar things happen in the planning department and public works department in San Francisco. Supervisors will receive half-price homes laundered through their parents, that sort of thing. Pretty transparent for the Third World (where sophisticated criminal agents will extract some of the value if they know you have some ill-gotten gains) but certainly sufficient for present-day US (where rule of law is generally available).')
