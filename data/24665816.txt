To add some color to the use case:<p>We&#x27;d like to use a pub sub system to store binlogs from databases (as done in projects like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;debezium.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;debezium.io&#x2F;</a>).<p>We&#x27;d like any team to be able to bring a replica database online by starting from the beginning of time and playing back the binlogs.  And then to keep playing any future binlog messages to keep the replica current.<p>For usage like this, we could in theory keep all past messages on GCS, and then access the old messages on GCS and then when those are up to date, get the messages from pubsub.  Or we could keep them on GCS and replay them on pubsub in the future if we wanted to.<p>But in a perfect world, I&#x27;d prefer the pubsub system to handle this, and allow a consumer to start at the beginning of time and get up to date, and stay up to date in a simple way.')
