This made the computer lab a whole lot more popular during free periods than it had been previously.<p>Two interesting bugs that I recall:<p>* Mathematically rotating pieces around an axis was a terrible idea, but it produced some entertaining artifacts (and made placement <i>much</i> harder!). I replaced the math by precomputed rotation maps for each piece, which was much better. My first pass at the maps introduced a displacement bug, so you could spin the pieces counterclockwise and they would walk in the negative X direction.<p>* I got an angry bug report in the lunch room from a kid who had no reason to know my name. He was having a really great game, and then his score started decreasing with every piece. He felt like his record high score had been stolen from him, and he was upset! I asked &quot;what was your score??&quot;. He said &quot;I don&#x27;t know, but by the time I noticed, it was over 30,000 but it was going DOWN!&quot;. Aha..[2] :)<p>[1] I&#x27;m sure the statute of limitations has expired on my appropriation of copyrights and trademarks.<p>[2] Back in the day, &quot;int&quot; meant &quot;signed 16-bit integer&quot;, which is not the proper data type for a score counter.')
