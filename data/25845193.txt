It still works with no issues even though both times I had to disassemble completely and wash all parts including motherboard. The mineral water got between lcd leaves so I had to separate, wash and dry individual layers of LCD.<p>My tip is to always have IPA, distilled water and tools to disassemble and clean your laptop.')
