The ability to promise to buy&#x2F;sell stocks in the future at a given price has become so accepted as an ordinary feature of stock trading that we generally cease to notice how revolutionary of a concept it actually is. It&#x27;s hard to see any rationale for prohibiting such arrangements - they are entirely consensual, and appear to have no additional impact on things that instantaneous buy&#x2F;sell orders wouldn&#x27;t also have.<p>But this is an illusion. The ability to go short&#x2F;long on a stock is <i>completely</i> different from the ability to buy&#x2F;sell it, despite it being based on all the same mechanisms. It&#x27;s a truly radical concept that has slipped under our radar because it could be described without any new concepts or terms.')
