We will ruin our lives for it. It is not that it is &#x27;not special&#x27; but rather the antagonism (being stuck on someone and never being able to really full reach them across the abyss of the real)that creates our subjectivity.In love we recognizes ourselves AS universal (vs as an example of universality)through the act of falling, risking, trying to mean something.
