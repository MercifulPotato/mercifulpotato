I&#x27;m way more worried about the complete and utter lack of using existing intelligence that was served up on a silver platter and continues to be. That completely destroys any argument for expanding surveillance right there, without even considering human rights or legal angles. If they can&#x27;t even act on what&#x27;s given to them, or what they already know, maybe that should get the laser focus for the indefinite future.')
