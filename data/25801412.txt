Having worked for a startup that consisted of probably half ex-thought workers I can attest that yes some of the development processes and infrastructure we created were commendable. Some others were just absolutely frustrating. However I feel the only metric that’s really worth mentioning is that after a couple of years, there was practically no product to show of, not a single paying customer and the company slowly burned through its entire runway and faded to (more) obscurity. Yes I’m convinced that the ideological stances such staff took were directly correlated with the business failure. I think the only positive result was focusing on building an ivory tower meant everyone’s CV looked more impressive.')
