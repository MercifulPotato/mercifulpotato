You can also use <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vector.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;reference&#x2F;sinks&#x2F;loki&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vector.dev&#x2F;docs&#x2F;reference&#x2F;sinks&#x2F;loki&#x2F;</a> to send your logs to our Loki API. Vector is very cool in our opinion and we’d love to see if there is more we can do with it. What are your thoughts?<p>(2) As for cost, our super early experiments (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opstrace.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;pulling-cost-curtain-back" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opstrace.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;pulling-cost-curtain-back</a>) indicate that ingesting 1M active series with 18-month retention is less than $30 per day. It is a very important topic and we&#x27;ve already spent quite a bit of time on exploring this. Our goal is to be super transparent (something you don’t get with SaaS vendors like Datadog) by adding a system cost tab in the UI. Clearly, the cost depends on the specific configuration and use case, i.e. on parameters such as load profile, redundancy, and retention. A credible general answer would come in the shape of some kind of formula, involving some of these parameters -- and empirically derived from real-world observations (testing, testing, testing!). For now, it&#x27;s fair to say that we&#x27;re in the observation phase -- from here, we&#x27;ll certainly do many optimizations specifically towards reducing cost, and we&#x27;ll also focus on providing good recommendations (because as we all know cost is just one dimension in a trade-off space). We&#x27;re definitely excited about the idea of providing users useful, direct insight into the cost (say, daily cost) of their specific, current Opstrace setup (observation is key!). We&#x27;ve talked a lot about &quot;total cost of ownership&quot; (TCO) in the team.')
