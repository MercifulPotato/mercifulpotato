It turns vaccine development into a software problem, instead of hardware problem. For instance, we&#x27;ll be able to rapidly roll out new flu vaccines for the latest strains and produce them on demand, rather than making a guess at which ones will be circulating a year ahead of time and committing to mass production of those.')
