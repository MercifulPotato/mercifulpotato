The number of people who need 16GB of RAM? Very large. The number who need 32GB is at least an order of magnitude smaller. The number who need 64GB another order of magnitude smaller. The number who need 256GB of RAM or more is likely in the low thousands or even hundreds.<p>Making a custom package for those kind of numbers becomes prohibitively expensive.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t mean to pick on you as you&#x27;re not alone in what is a very natural skepticism. However, it is somewhat amusing to watch the comments about the M1 over time. When Apple announced the M1 based products many critics were crying impossible, faked, rigged benchmarks, etc<p>I&#x27;ve figured from the start that Apple wouldn&#x27;t make this transition unless there were a significant win here. In my above comment, I think I made it quite clear that I expect Apple&#x27;s upcoming CPUs to outperform Intel.<p>I&#x27;m just not as certain the delta between Apple&#x27;s top end CPUs and Intel&#x2F; AMD will be as great as the delta between the M1 and the Intel CPU it replaced. So for example, the M series chip might be 20-30% faster than the Intel in the 16&quot; MacBook Pro, not double the performance as it was in the MacBook Air.')
