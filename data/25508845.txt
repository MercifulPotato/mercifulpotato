At the same time, convenient easy-to-use predefined types are made for the people who want simplicity without too much configuration. Most of the time you will be just fine with using the predefined types. They can be found at the top of the &quot;lwlog.h&quot; file.<p>What is yet not implemented is:<p>• Portable colors (the colors are only handled with escape sequences, there is still no cross-platform coloring since some consoles do not support escape sequences)<p>• Async logger<p>• UTF support<p>I have done benchmarks against spdlog, and you can take a look at them in the README in the repository<p>Also benchmarking is not done correctly in the main repository. I have benchmarks in my private dev repository and I am benchmarking either with picobench or nanobench. So if you want to benchmark, do NOT rely on the Benchmark.h file in the project (it&#x27;s a temporary file that is meant to be removed)<p>I would be very glad and honored if you drop a critique, an opinion, an idea, or want to contribute to the project: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ChristianPanov&#x2F;lwlog')
