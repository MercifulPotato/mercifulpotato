A constant reminder that wherever you turn, it&#x27;s a FB property.<p>With Google&#x2F;Apple&#x2F;Microsoft it&#x27;s quite straightforward, everything they make is clearly their style, their brand. This is not the case with Facebook&#x27;s properties, they don&#x27;t have a unified design language or branding. So adding a unified splash is a step in &quot;marking it&#x27;s territory&quot;, I just hate the feeling of that.')
