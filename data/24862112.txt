The more popular the technology is, the more complaints on the internets you gonna see.<p>My largest complaint about graphics compute is inability to spawn threads in runtime. DispatchIndirect and append buffers often help to workaround, but still limited, not really an equivalent to CUDA’s dynamic parallelism.<p>&gt; rather than anything better or worse about either model<p>Not sure what do you mean by that?<p>CUDA exposes more stuff (dynamic parallelism mentioned above, intrinsics to shuffle data across threads, and a few others) but still, the model is pretty much the same. These CUDA’s triple angle brackets directly map to Dispatch arguments, and [numthreads] values in HLSL.')
