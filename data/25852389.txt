The United States form a federal government, not a unitary state; that means the several states should be represented.<p>&gt; If the senate were proportional, we could simply abolish the electoral college with little loss; just let congress elect the president and be done with it.<p>Alternatively, state legislatures could appoint electors.  Or maybe they could appoint two electors, and the people of the state could vote for the rest.')
