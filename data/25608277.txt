The group that sued the city of Charlottesville so that the fascist &quot;Unite the Right&quot; rally could happen in a place that the city said would be hard to maintain order&#x2F;peace instead of in a nearby park where the city had already issued a permit, as a result of which, the fascists killed someone?<p>Again, I have thought and reflected and dug. I donated to the ACLU for many years. I used to believe that they engaged in a noble cause of protecting the right of people with unpopular opinions to express their unpopular opinions. I used to believe that protecting the rights of the Nazis in Skokie protected all our rights. I now believe that it primarily protects the rights of the alt-right in Charlottesville to demonstrate and to kill, and I now believe that the ACLU&#x27;s free speech advocacy, however well-intentioned, isn&#x27;t good for society and leaves us all less free. And the last time they called me to ask if I&#x27;d &quot;resume&quot; my membership, I told them they have blood on their hands.<p>If the lawsuit the ACLU filed (<i>Kessler v. Charlottesvile</i>) hadn&#x27;t happened, the fascists would still have been equally able to <i>express their opinions</i>. The city just wanted the rally in a different spot to reduce the risk of violence. In retrospect, the city was right, the ACLU was wrong, and Kessler got the violence he wanted.<p>I don&#x27;t think there is any genuine danger (<i>especially</i> thanks to modern communications technology) to the ability of fascists to advocate for fascism, to make sure that the policy proposals of fascism remain known to the general public. What remains is a genuine danger to the ability of fascists to <i>actually engage in</i> fascism, which they call &quot;exercising free speech,&quot; and they dupe organizations like the ACLU into helping them with it.<p>(Note I&#x27;m not claiming the ACLU is intentionally fascist. Outside of free speech advocacy, they do a lot of effective work to oppose fascism. But on this particular issue, their <i>effect</i>, regardless of intent, is to support fascism, and their notable work is supporting fascists who think their right of &quot;free speech&quot; has been violated.)<p>I intentionally keep my filter bubble quite broad. I read far-right forums and they love free speech. I read centrists and they think free speech is a great idea and will some day defend the. And I see far-left activists who gain nothing from the concept.<p>If you have an example of the font of free speech actually serving to protect any rights beyond the right to enact fascism, I&#x27;d be very curious. My position could certainly evolve further, but this is where it is now.<p>(BTW, it took me a long time to reply because HN blocked me with the &quot;You&#x27;re posting too fast. Please slow down.&quot; message, because I got downvoted too much in the last few minutes. If you think free speech is a virtue, please email the moderators and tell them that they should remove that feature and also stop greying out downvoted comments - downvoting for disagreement is explicitly permitted on HN, and the last thing an advocate of free speech would want is unpopular ideas to be literally unreadable! But the fact remains that HN is a better forum than e.g. 4chan because of its censorship mechanisms, and that&#x27;s in fact one of the things that makes me believe free speech is not a virtue - even though I&#x27;m frequently one of the targets of that censorship because I frequently post unpopular ideas. I genuinely believe this community&#x27;s ability to censor me makes it better.)')
