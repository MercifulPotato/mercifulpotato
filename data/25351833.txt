I have bose supersport, been using it for a couple of years perhaps. Battery lasts weeks, connects to both my work and personal phone as soon as I turn it on, and hit play on either device. And, I don&#x27;t remember ever facing any connectivity issues either, just works since the day I paired.<p>I am not sure what other features airpods have but if this is &quot;the&quot; feature, you can have it even in products for about a fifth the price since years.')
