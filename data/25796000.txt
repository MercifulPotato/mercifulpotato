I&#x27;ll try answer your questions without much commentary:<p>Is everyone required to join? No. Following Janus, they might not even be required to pay dues. However, the union contract will apply to everyone in the bargaining unit (generally all non-management) regardless of membership.<p>Is Amazon required to negotiate? Yes, they&#x27;re legally required to make good faith negotiations. Whether or not they actually do this is an open question, as companies regularly stall here.<p>Can Amazon simply close the plant? Not legally, no. They would probably end up owing the workers quite a bit of money if they did. Whether or not they take that course of action may be a business decision.')
