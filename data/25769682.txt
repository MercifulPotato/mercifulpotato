They still use pseudo SLC (storing one bit in every flash cell as 00(0) or 11(1) and correcting up or down on read back).  They also will work with you so you can track BOM changes as they internally change the cards so you can track failure rates.  They also give you access to tons of internal perf counters so you can do preventative maintenance (ie. swap the card if it&#x27;s getting long in the tooth).  They also just generally treat you as a business partner rather than a consumer, wrt support and what have you.<p>It costs a pretty penny though.  $40 for a 2GB non micro card was the last quote I got.')
