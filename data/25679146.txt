But unless I am deeply wrong, TCP&#x2F;IP, GSM, LTE, DVB, even FM radio and PAL were standards that only became dominant after governmental bodies sanctioned as standards and no one misses AppleTalk or Novell&#x27;s IDP because of &quot;government meddling&quot;.<p>Even still, the argument is not for killing private protocols or stopping private companies to innovate and develop new technologies. It&#x27;s &quot;just&quot; that these innovations should be made <i>on top</i> of open standards instead of displacing them. Don&#x27;t forget that Google Talk and even Facebook&#x27;s messenger started on top of XMPP. They closed purely for business reasons, not technical ones. Had the FCC told them &quot;do whatever you want with your network and your client, but anyone speaking XMPP should be able to communicate with your users&quot;, we wouldn&#x27;t be in this mess.')
