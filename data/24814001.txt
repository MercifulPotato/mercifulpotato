That begs the question, a fundamental cognitive mistake.<p>The current consensus model does not deserve any privilege over any other model that also accounts for the same body of evidence. The degree of privilege afforded to it is exactly the inertia that prevents progress.<p>Science does not need for there to be a consensus model. Nature doesn&#x27;t have one. Insistance on a single model when more than one meets requirements is purely human pigheadedness, and a primary impediment to progress.<p>None of this means that low-energy fusion happens, or doesn&#x27;t. But the vociferous attacks on reports of what looks like it are the absolute antithesis of science. Science says only, &quot;Try it again, more carefully.&quot;<p>Ordinary evidence.')
