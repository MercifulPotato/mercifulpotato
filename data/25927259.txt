Not having the ⊥ arrangement took a little time to get used to.<p>I considered some fancy QMK (keyboard firmware) hacking to keep the inverted T, and have the key above ↓ change between Z and ↑ depending on the keypress before, but decided it wouldn&#x27;t be practical.  However, the Z is for Dvorak. A Qwerty layout, where it would be &#x2F;, might cause less trouble.')
