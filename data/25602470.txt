I think that this is a consumer issue as well. For example, as you said, I think unapproved listings are more prone to misrepresent menus and hours, especially the latter during these turbulent times. In one extreme instance, I&#x27;ve also seen a delivery site start listing a restaurant that has never been open for business.')
