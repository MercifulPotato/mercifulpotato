You can send them an error message with arbitrary JSON attached (cause of error, but also details on the logged in user, device, browser, etc). And then yes, generally a generic &quot;Try again or contact support&quot; error message presented to the user. It works quite well if&#x2F;when they do contact support because you can lookup specifically what errors have been triggered by that user.<p>Of course anything is better than nothing. When I took over this codebase its error handling strategy was &quot;Don&#x27;t show an error message at all and just keep retrying until it works&quot;. Which was fine for transient errors, but a nightmare when something did go wrong: the user report would usually be &quot;the loading spinner just keeps spinning forever&quot;, and that was all you had to go on. Nightmare.')
