Press right to highlight the status column, shift-f and I get a count (+histogram) of the statuses. Three have failed. Hit enter on that row and I can see specifically which ones have failed. This takes a few seconds (I just tried and did it under 5 from running the above command).<p>If I knew I wanted the failed ones I could have grepped or similar but I can then order by most restarts, etc.<p>This is a tiny part of the functionality but it&#x27;s an example of &quot;there&#x27;s some tabular-ish data but what&#x27;s there?&quot;. Load X, histogram, filter, sort is probably 90% of my use-cases.')
