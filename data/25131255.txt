I use a text-only browser that relies on the OS to do DNS resolution.<p>But imagine your DNS is filtered.  Would you still want only a single source, e.g., your ISP?  In that case, wouldn&#x27;t you want multiple sources?<p>When in a DNS-filtered environment, e.g., a hotel, DOH <i>outside the browser</i> can actually be useful.  For example, I can retrieve all the DNS data for all the domains on HN in a matter of minutes using HTTP&#x2F;1.1 pipelining from a variety of DOH providers.  The data goes into a custom zone file served from an authoritative nameserver on the local network.  Browsing HN is much faster and more reliable when I do not need to do recursive DNS queries to remote servers.  The third party resolver cache concept is still really popular, but IME most IP addresses are long-lived&#x2F;static and &quot;TTL&quot; is irrelevant.  I rarely need to update the existing RRs in the zone files I create and the number that need to be updated is very small.<p>DOH servers are not the only alternative source of DNS data.<p>Ideally, I prefer to avoid third party DNS altogether.  Nor do I even need to run a local cache.  I wrote some utilities that gather DNS data &quot;non-recursively&quot;, querying only authoritative nameservers and never setting the RD bit.  It is very fast.  The only true &quot;single source&quot; of DNS data is the zone file for the particular RR at the designated authoritative nameserver(s). Everone else is a middleman.<p>I am not a fan of applications doing their own DNS resolution, even if they use DOH.  But I have found the existance of DOH servers, i.e., third party DNS caches served over HTTP, can be useful.')
