And this would be kind of pointless if some allocations circumvent that, wouldn&#x27;t it?<p>The deeper rationale is that some systems like to assign fixed memory pools to subsystems. These may be reset or destroyed at certain points in the applications life cycle and the general expectation is that this frees all memory used by said subsystem. If you still want to use the STL in that context, you need to provide custom allocators for everything that potentially allocates.')
