I&#x27;ve been working with React Native for over 2 years straight now, and I&#x27;m hesitant to move on from an ecosystem I know really well and a toolkit that finally feels comfortable.<p>But I also know React Native is hacky, slow, constantly has changes and breakages, sometimes stupid styling things are nearly impossible, etc. And if Flutter is as much better as people say, then I&#x27;d love to try it. Any plusses&#x2F;minuses I should know before diving in?')
