Cheap entertainment, toys, staple foods.<p>Meanwhile the insane price increases are in critical needs, medical care, housing, college education.<p>In my mind that graph is pretty strong evidence that there really is massive inflation and the idea of “asset inflation” does exist, contrary to the author’s lead point that it should be seen as normal growth of value.<p>For most people, if you show them this data and said, “see, low inflation, don’t worry...” they are rightfully going to be pissed off. “Low inflation” except in everything that really matters for health, home ownership and betterment for my children.<p>I guess I should just thank the monetary policy overlords for my cheap Netflix while we all die of cancer under the thumb of landlords and all our economic participation from labor dwindles and continues to lose purchasing power for what we most need.')
