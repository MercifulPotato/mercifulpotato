If we have unaccountable agencies in government there should be mechanisms to dissolve them. I&#x27;m not saying this is what will happen, but the aim should be decentralizing power.<p>If there are failings in government, it&#x27;s best to address the problems there. I&#x27;m not saying corporations won&#x27;t expand its power over government if given the ability to do so, it&#x27;s absolutely in its best interest to do so. The issue is they shouldn&#x27;t be able to in the first place. A corporation is in essence an absolute dictatorship, and really shouldn&#x27;t be given the power to exert an ideology over anything other than the purview of running the organization.')
