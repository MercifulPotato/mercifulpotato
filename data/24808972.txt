Because they&#x27;re less repressed they&#x27;re more fun, almost a guaranteed good night out, but they push &amp; push &amp; push and don&#x27;t know when to stop, and won&#x27;t stop (except for a short while) if you warn them, until finally the relationship (platonic I mean) gets too much and you finish it. And they can get quite upset about it, this no-emotions thing for sociopaths doesn&#x27;t really match what I&#x27;ve seen. They seem to be empty inside, an unfillable hole, but certainly not emotionless.')
