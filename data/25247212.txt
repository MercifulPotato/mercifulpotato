He quote the IPO documents... which I don&#x27;t think is a document usually used to complains about fees ;).<p>Roblox is free too, so you need to pay for the platform somewhere, which means it has to be part of the microtransactions. I expect to pay for Android and iOS while I buy the device, not during the subsequent multiple microtransactions, thus that platform fee is double dipping.')
