It would, however, provide very strong evidence for most such claims. The primary problem with actually implementing it in general is the risk of getting unlucky if you have a very large payout. Say you claim $100,000,000,000. Even if it is an accurate assessment, somebody could randomly luck into a vulnerability that would normally actually take $100,000,000,000 to find and suddenly you are dead since it is highly unlikely you are one of the few companies that can actually survive such a payout. You could alleviate that to some degree with insurance in the middle range, but it is highly unlikely that would work at the very high payouts. Luckily, in this case, a payout of $100,000,000 is actually within FireEye&#x27;s reach given their revenue and market cap. In fact, they lost more in market cap on this breach news than such a payout. So, if their claims are actually true, this is an entirely feasible and useful demonstration to run.<p>Personally, I think if they actually announced a $100,000,000 prize they would be breached within a week on the outside. At $100,000,000 people can burn dozens to hundreds of zero-days to be the first to get the payout and still come out ahead. Even at $10,000,000 I doubt they would last more than 1 month. At $10,000,000 the prize would be the most attractive bounty in the entire industry by a factor of 3-10x and people could still burn some zero-days and still come out ahead.')
