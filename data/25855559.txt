If he did not want a drink though, he could say no because then it would not be true that they all wanted a drink. But he wants a drink. Therefore he says he don’t know, because it will depend on whether the other two want drinks or not.<p>Same applies to logician number two. She is still missing info about the third logician and therefore says she doesn’t know.<p>The third logician now knows that both of the other two want drinks, and so can answer that all of them want drinks.')
