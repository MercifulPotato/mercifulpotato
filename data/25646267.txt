Eliminate 2 of those use cases via financial surveillance and I will be happily surprised if the 3d survives, or if any similarly robust marketplace springs up from the ashes.  Because the bitcoin ecosystem is such a mess, it&#x27;s not worth saving, in my opinion.  It&#x27;s a feature, not a bug, and it gives all alt-moneys a bad reputation.<p>I don&#x27;t like dragnet-style financial surveillance, in general. If it bothers you when applied to bitcoin for philosophical reasons, it should bother you more when applied to other alt-moneys with less nefarious uses.')
