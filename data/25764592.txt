Yesterday afternoon, while teachers were at the building, 3 youth (caught on camera thankfully) went to my wife&#x27;s school and physically cut the internet cabling going into the building, it was unable to be repaired by today. The servers hosting their various learning software are inside the building(s) at the middle and high school, today they had to use a waiver and completely cancel school since teachers can&#x27;t actually assign work and the like.<p><i>facepalm</i>')
