In the worst case, it would crack the windshield and the driver would stop.<p>&gt; <i>what happens when you distract those drives with an aerial nuisance</i><p>Many people look at birds while driving with little notable effect. It feels like the distracting-traffic argument is really just a couching of the real gripe, which is more like &quot;weird new thing bad&quot;.<p>&gt; <i>Things don&#x27;t have to be universally safe to point out a safety flaw with a specific variable</i><p>Sure, but we can compare relative safety. It&#x27;s a bit odd to pick on a slightly-unsafe activity due to its proximity to a much unsafer activity. In general anything involving an urban landscape is going to have traffic&#x2F;buildings&#x2F;infrastructure adjacent. And so if we go by a standard of possibly affecting those things, there would end up being no permission for anything new.')
