Which are overall a privileged group. So I got to thinking about what it means to be heard in today’s world. I think that for a lot of conservatives in a digital world it can feel like their voice or the voice of people with their beliefs aren’t heard. Certainly you can find little echo chambers of conservatism, but when you go to the big news sites, the front page of Reddit, or Twitter it sure looks like everyone leans left. Couple this with the leader of your movement getting little notes on all his tweets to at what he says isn’t true or getting removed. I can see how it feels like your worldview is getting silenced, hence a riot. So I wonder if these movements by Twitter are ultimately counter productive.<p>Just a half baked idea, but some food for thought.')
