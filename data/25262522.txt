Timing side channels may reveal the key and not any of the old messages. The key could be guessed if it was inadvertently generated with a weak random number generator. The attacker could have an <i>older</i> backup of your device, which contains the long-term key and the older messages, but without forward secrecy they could then use the long-term key and traffic captures to decrypt the <i>newer</i> messages that weren&#x27;t in the older backup.')
