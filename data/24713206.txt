I remember he told me a story of how, when HP printers were built really solidly, the CEO had a meeting where he demonstrated this by standing on the printer, and it didn&#x27;t budge. The takeaway to this wasn&#x27;t, &quot;Hey, we make a great product. Look at this!&quot; It was, &quot;Hey, we make too durable of a product. We should cut costs because this is costing too much!&quot;')
