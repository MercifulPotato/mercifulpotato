HTTPS-calls aren&#x27;t particularly computationally expensive, why does 10s or lower poll intervals not exist for cheap? I expect that for most of these monitoring services, redundancy and fixed development costs are much more expensive than the actual underlying infra, so the marginal cost of extra HTTP calls is probably low. Why not offer high resolution as an offering to set you apart from the competition?')
