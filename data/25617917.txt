It was always interesting that Pixar went with VDI because it meant the CPUs that were being used as desktops during the day could be used for rendering at night. Roughly speaking. The economics made a lot of sense. A guy from Pixar came to Teradici and gave a talk all about it. Amazing stuff.<p>Interesting contrast with other companies that switched to VDI where it made very little sense. VMware + server racks + zero clients compared to desktops never made economic sense, at the time. But oftent here is some other factor that tips things in VDI&#x27;s favour.')
