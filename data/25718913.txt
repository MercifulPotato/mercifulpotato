If your views do not align 100% with either party, you are increasingly marginalized. See the treatment of Donald Trump (a republican outsider, and not a traditional conservative by any means, but not a democrat in principle either) by the Republican party. For the past four years, republicans have refused to pass bills due to not matching ideological purity tests from Trump. The best example of this is DACA (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2018&#x2F;01&#x2F;09&#x2F;trump-meets-congressional-leaders-immigration&#x2F;1016369001&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.usatoday.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;news&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2018&#x2F;01&#x2F;09&#x2F;trum...</a>), for which Trump has repeatedly asked for a legislative solution that gives these children legal status. Because that is not the exact party line of the GOP, they didn&#x27;t like his solution. And then along with that, he wanted the wall of course, which doesn&#x27;t fall into line exactly with the democrats, so now, despite DACA and secure borders being an issue many care about, no political party would take them up due to ideological purity.<p>On the democrat side, see the treatment of Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard (Both non-traditional democrats in different ways) by their party.<p>Honestly, after seeing both how the GOP and Democrats treated Trump, Sanders, and Gabbard, I find myself supportive of all three of them despite them having a very different views. I simply like that they&#x27;re not either party.<p>It increasingly seems that both parties are becoming incredibly dogmatic, and anyone who doesn&#x27;t fall in line is simply barred from public discourse or elected office. It is increasingly true that in order to even get to elected office you need the support of a party.<p>In my state of Oregon, the democrats and republicans actually mandated that you be part of a party before being elected to office. You can no longer run as an independent. It&#x27;s so bad, some people made an &#x27;independent party&#x27; just to be able to have non-democrat or republican candidates on the ballot, but this suffers from the same issues as parties, in that those individuals still need to be &#x27;nominated&#x27; by a select group of people annointed by the party organizers, which means even the independent party has a bias, even if they try to minimize it.<p>We need major electoral reform, nationwide, but it doesn&#x27;t benefit any party to do that. What I would like to see are protesters from both BLM, Antifa, or whatever and the capitol protesters (not the rioters of any group please...) band together for a change and demand a better means of governance from their legislators. The people need to band together on common principles, instead of being divided by stupid policy points.')
