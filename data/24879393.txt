Obviously this is a biased sample, but it&#x27;s kind of amazing to me how a company that was admired and beloved not too long ago is just reviled now: by governments, by their users, by their customers (i.e. advertisers).<p>I really have to wonder what morale is like in Google-land. So much of their corporate ethos was built on what great things they do for the world, and now with this constant drumbeat of basically everyone saying &quot;we hate you, you suck, I can&#x27;t wait until you get broken up&quot; has to be weighing on employees.<p>And note this is <i>not</i> just a &quot;people hate all big companies&quot; thing. Sure, people have tons of gripes about Apple and Netflix for example but nowhere near the level of broken trust&#x2F;expectations that has happened at Google.')
