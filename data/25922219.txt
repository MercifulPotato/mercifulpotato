The initial contact goes through the consumer support folks, who are clueless the service even exists. The preferred solution is actually getting on the Comcast Xfinity reddit site to reach a support tech who knows what&#x27;s going on. After that you&#x27;re handed off to a Comcast Small Business support agent, who is a real person who maintains contact with you throughout the process (which is a bit involved because it can require permitting, etc.). After that you get a support number that goes to the Metro-E NOC, which is phenomenal. But the billing website still goes through the customer online portal, which doesn&#x27;t quite understand what&#x27;s going on.')
