The reason that there was too much protein in the meat was that there was not enough fat; carbohydrates are simply not available in Siberian winters.<p>Also, paleo diets don&#x27;t aim for ketosis. Those are called <i>keto</i> diets, and for most people they&#x27;re just a short-term rapid weight loss strategy (also useful long-term in epilepsy and possibly some autoimmune disorders). Paleo by contrast is supposed to be a long-term maintenance diet that usually doesn&#x27;t aim for rapid weight loss.<p>Also, the downsides of &quot;too much protein&quot; have been well-known in pretty much every paleo discussion community since forever, since it&#x27;s a well-known fact of experience among many athletes. The idea that protein toxicity is a problem in practice for paleo is silly (it wouldn&#x27;t even make the top ten if you listed the real flaws).<p>I would not advise following paleo diets in the form they&#x27;re commonly presented -- they place too much emphasis on the wrong things and contribute to the iconoclastic miasma that has been suffocating Western societies -- but the article&#x27;s comparison is, nonetheless, completely off-base.')
