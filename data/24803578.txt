And dynamically linked libs are a complicated thing, so it&#x27;s both yes and no there, at least on some OSes, while on others it&#x27;s a clear no :)<p>&gt; Neither, it&#x27;s pass by copy from what I recall.<p>Pass by copy is the same thing as pass by value.<p>In C and Pascal the definitions are pretty clear, but people insist on using them on other languages where they don&#x27;t make sense. Let&#x27;s extend it a bit: is Haskell a pass by value or pass by reference language? What about Prolog?<p>About breakpoints, they usually have hardware support. But since Java runs on a virtual machine, I have no idea it the buck stops at the JVM or if they use the hardware interface.')
