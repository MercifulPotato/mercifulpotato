I already have 1 through 0, and two more keys on the same row, so I map them to Layer 1, which I have both a momentary and toggle version of on my deck. I put F11 to the left and F12 to the right, not that it matters.<p>So for just F5, it&#x27;s as easy to type as %. For, say, Ctrl-Alt-F4, I hit layer, then Ctrl-Alt-4, then layer again.<p>I grant that someone might make much heavier use of function keys and find this inconvenient. I don&#x27;t miss them in the slightest.<p>An integrated trackball might be nice, although I&#x27;m not sure where to put it that would be comfortable. I have a trackball to the right of the keyboard, this suits me fine.')
