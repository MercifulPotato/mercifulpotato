Body fat dropped from ~24% to ~10% on the fast and now up to ~18% after 2 month bulk, so I added more muscle mass, but I had a lot of work as well so I was not able to hit the gym as often as I&#x27;d like and I had extra calories.<p>The biggest surprise to me was I was way more focused and attentive but I couldn&#x27;t sleep much (sometimes 4 hours max). And at some point I got &quot;keto rash&quot; but it faded away eventually.<p>I think if you do the fast and then break the fast with stricker caloric diet and more protein you can gain lean muscle mass, but I got worried when I reached 58 kilos as people started pointing out how skinny I got..so I started bulking up again..')
