IMHO in these times DW is still a calm, non-biased and pleasant new source. They are not bombastic, &quot;breaking-news&quot; all the time sort of site. They have news from across the world presented in a matter-of-fact way like the old times (sometimes even delayed by days). So I still think it is tax money well spent :)')
