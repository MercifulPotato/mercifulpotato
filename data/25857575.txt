This is not capable of being measured by any of the yardsticks for manual work.<p>It&#x27;s true that &quot;What gets measured gets managed&quot; by the converse is also true - if you focus on one metric only, the rest will fall into disarray.<p>It&#x27;s good to keep your eyes at the gauges when you are flying, but just as the map is not the territory, the measurement is not the real thing.<p>People love metrics, because they give them an illusion of control over a complicated, real world, messy reality. The core of the problem is unfortunately human bias to simplify. We as a wider tech community are contributing a bit introducing yet-another-dashboard.<p>But as you rightly point, the metrics people pick are the ones that are easiest to measure. NOT the ones worth measuring. In fact I published a post quite similar to yours: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;piszek.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;24&#x2F;metrics&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;piszek.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;24&#x2F;metrics&#x2F;</a><p>To broaden the theme, I would even argue that Taleb is complaining about roughly a similar set of problems: Gaussian curve is an oversimplification as well and has caused a lot of suffering when misapplied.<p>Despite all of these caveats, there is a benefit to having a focus (like MRR you are mentioning). Having a singular focus can be transformative and can make one developer more effective than 30-people team with no real direction.<p>In that sense, there is benefit to metrics. As with all real-world things, I think the only solution is a dynamic equilibrium, where you change from one approach to the other to cover your bases.<p>As I wrote in the beginning of this comment, the Team I Lead (we build simple ecommerce tools) was tasked with maximizing MRR and the side-effect of having that focus was that we ignored the one-off sales features that our customers wanted desperately.')
