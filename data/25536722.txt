From what I&#x27;ve read, most multiplayer games use around 80-100 megabytes&#x2F;hour, but I&#x27;ve read numbers as low as 50 and as high as 300. A Netflix 4k video stream has a bitrate of around 6.75 gigabytes&#x2F;hour, and a Zoom call will use somewhere between 500 to 1500 megabytes&#x2F;hour for a one-on-one (and somewhat more for group calls). So work-from-home is an order of magnitude more bandwidth hungry than online gaming, but still reasonable for a country with good Internet infrastructure. High quality video streaming is the real killer indeed.')
