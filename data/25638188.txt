It also has to retrain him&#x2F;herself for free on itÂ´s own spare time and by the time it reaches 35&#x2F;40 it tends to be let go by not raising his&#x2F;her salary anymore or by putting him&#x2F;her in lower status position. (Not to mention working as a contractor for years, etc.). These are the kind of problems unions are expected to fight for.<p>But every time someone mentions unions they go after the salary cap, time of service, etc, discourses.')
