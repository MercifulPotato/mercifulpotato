He still thinks governments can&#x27;t ban crypto if they wanted, he is very wrong about that. He also thinks that governments would allow a crypto to rival a state currency.<p>The most likely success story for crypto is it will be only for banks while regular people will be banned from owning it. There is simply no way a government will allow irreversibly hackable assets in the wild. There are no limits to the damage entities can do with anonymous GDP-scale wealth.')
