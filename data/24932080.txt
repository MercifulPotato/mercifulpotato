Literally we&#x27;re excluding people and calling them Stasi members because we disagree with them.<p>If you want people to be kind to each other, and if you&#x27;re against cancelling people for their opinions, it&#x27;s got to start somewhere.<p>I also want to speak to your two other examples, Linus and RMS.<p>WRT Linus, I personally know many talented people who wouldn&#x27;t touch Linux development specifically because of him.  It&#x27;s cool that Linus has made your life better.  He&#x27;s also made a lot of people&#x27;s lives worse.  Where&#x27;s their due process?<p>WRT RMS, I take issue with the idea that he was not given due process.  In fact he was allowed to stay for years, despite harassing women and acting inappropriately in his position.  The Epstein email was a last straw.  But also: What makes you think he wasn&#x27;t given due process?  He says he was &quot;pressured&quot; by MIT and resigned.  Do you think he couldn&#x27;t have fought it?  It sounds like he decided not to fight it.  That&#x27;s different than not being given due process.<p>Again with RMS, it&#x27;s clear that his behavior was deeply upsetting to a lot of people.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;selamjie.medium.com&#x2F;remove-richard-stallman-appendix-a-a7e41e784f88" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;selamjie.medium.com&#x2F;remove-richard-stallman-appendix...</a>  Where&#x27;s their due process?  How do they factor into your calculus of who&#x27;s worthy of our compassion?')
