Quite clearly, all of this stuff started a while ago, and has escalated quickly since then.<p>Slippery slope is less about a direct cause, and more of a direction.  IE, it is talking about how things are escalating.<p>&quot;AWS terminates its relationship&quot;  I would consider major internet infrastructure kicking off a service with millions of users an escalation from where we were a couple years ago, which was more along the lines of &quot;a couple nazis are kicked off of twitter&quot;, yes.<p>Quite clearly it is a more significant action to take down a service with millions of users, than it is to ban a couple people on twitter.<p>&gt; There&#x27;s multiple platforms drawing a line on acceptable speech<p>And those platforms has escalated things over the last couple years.  In the past, there was less people being kicked off of various parts of the internet&#x2F;critical infrastructure, and now there are more people&#x2F;services being kicked off of critical network infrastructure.<p>That is an escalation.<p>Even yesterday, I did not even consider that AWS would get involved in this somehow, and now look where we are.<p>What is going to happen tomorrow, I wonder?  Or the next day and the next?  I could not guess at this point.<p>Will ISP&#x27;s start kicking people off?  Possibly.  Maybe even phone companies and common carriers will start doing it (even though if a common carrier did it, this would literally be illegal).<p>TBH, It really does not feel like that much of an escalation to say to that ISPs or common carrier might start doing this eventually.  They don&#x27;t feel significantly different than other critical infrastructure.<p>Take your guesses now about what is going to happen next, and see if you were right.')
