I&#x27;ve noticed we don&#x27;t get the &#x27;best&#x27;<p>That doesn&#x27;t match my experience. Several of my classmates who went to major Canadian medical schools also had offers from &quot;top&quot; US schools but stayed in Canada because the quality of education is good and they didn&#x27;t want to pay $300k+ for their degree. Maybe there&#x27;s certain top specialists that can only be found at Hopkins or Mayo in the US, but that&#x27;s not where most Americans are going (even within the 1%).<p>The doctors I&#x27;ve seen in Canada are equally competent to the American ones in my experience (at &quot;good&quot; but not &quot;world-class&quot; clinics), but I will concede that the American ones take more time with their patients and seem more aggressive with testing and treatment.')
