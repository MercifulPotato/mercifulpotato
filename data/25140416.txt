Open your garage door on a still winter day, standing in the warm air with one wall removed, exposing you to sub-freezing temperatures, and you&#x27;ll feel cold even if the air is still warm.  Stand in the high-temp air blast of a torpedo heater in a cold shop, with the ceiling, concrete floor, walls, and other equipment still frigid, and you&#x27;ll feel cold even as the hot air melts the plastic bits on your clothes.  Blast the AC in a hot car, and you might be breathing air at 40F&#x2F;5C from the vents, but you&#x27;ll still feel hot until the vehicle interior trim is cooled by the air.')
