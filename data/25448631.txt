With ARM, it&#x27;s far more competitive and margins are far lower. With Nvidia owning ARM, it seems likely we&#x27;ll see more ARM CPUs from them. Samsung, Qualcomm, and Mediatech also have ARM CPUs all the way down to a few dollars per CPU. Intel isn&#x27;t going to be able to come in and charge $50-500+ unit the way they do with their x86 chips.<p>Unless Intel can reboot Moore&#x27;s Law on Intel, they are going to get hit hard over the next few years. Even if Intel makes the move to ARM, their profitability will take a huge hit from the ARM migration.')
