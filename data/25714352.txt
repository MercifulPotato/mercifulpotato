I was raised in the UK where 10cm of snow pretty much means the country is shut down for a week (interestingly the same happens in &#x27;extreme heat&#x27; of 30c).<p>Where I live now there was 30cm of snow in the last couple of days and everyone is happy and playing outside, and tomorrow will be work as usual (well for covid). Most major roads have been swept, and those that aren&#x27;t you just drive a little more careful. I guess there is a different level of preparedness (here you are required by law to have winter tires on your car), but still it seems like some places treat it as an end-of-the-world scenario as if it&#x27;s impossible for humans to live like that.')
