Pluto really seems to nail the major pain points from notebooks: for a quick summary of Julia&#x27;s Pluto from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;835930&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lwn.net&#x2F;Articles&#x2F;835930&#x2F;</a> :<p>1. Pluto&#x27;s on-disk format is genuine executable Julia, with metadata in comments.  Code review happens on the actually executed code, so highly regulated&#x2F;otherwise conservative environments don&#x27;t have to worry about the single source of truth deviating from what code reviewers see.<p>2. Pluto disallows multiple declarations of global variables.  This prevents problems with getting different results, depending in which snippets within the notebook get executed in which order.<p>3. Pluto makes sure the notebook&#x27;s displayed output is always in-sync with its source code; it eliminates the problem of someone getting some result, changing some code, and sharing a notebook with results that don&#x27;t match the code.  It does this by performing dependency analysis across the code fragments and topologically sorting them.  It then re-evaluates all dependent code snippets when a given snippet is modified.<p>Wow.  This is the way.')
