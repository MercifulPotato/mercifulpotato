AND THEY WILL ALWAYS DO IT CHEAPER BECAUSE THEY DONT HAVE TO FUND FURTHER DEVELOPMENT.</i><p>Take an example what Amazon did with Mongo - First they launch a closed-source competitor (totally fine) but then they also take Mongo&#x27;s source and rebadge it as their own fully-managed DocumentDB (Mongo 1.6 but with closed source additions). It&#x27;s having your cake and eating it too. There&#x27;s nothing legally wrong with this, but I do think this is market abuse (because they can only do this because of AWS market penetration) just to make the worlds richest man richer.')
