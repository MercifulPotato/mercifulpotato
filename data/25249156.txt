Item(by='yorwba', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606692836, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25247180, text='&gt; the most viral and captivating content is often content that purposefully instills anger, fear, outgroup-hatred, schadenfreude, etc<p>Another aspect is that on social media, virality isn&#x27;t just based on people actively sharing stuff, but also content being so captivating that the platform amplifies it into virality based on user interaction statistics. (E.g. high click-through rates being used as a feedback signal to show content to more people, thus amplifying clickbait.)<p>I experienced that first-hand with a YouTube channel I started recently: one day I noticed the impression count (i.e. the number of times YouTube showed a video thumbnail to someone) growing exponentially. But view counts didn&#x27;t grow nearly as much. So my content didn&#x27;t suddenly get more popular, it had just randomly gotten a boost in the recommendation algorithm, showing it to many more people, most of whom weren&#x27;t interested. (The boost subsequently disappeared.)<p>I think if social media were just people talking to each other, we&#x27;d be mostly fine. But imagine how little time you&#x27;d spend e.g. on YouTube if the only way to watch a video were to have someone send you the link. Obviously not enough for the platform.<p>So the search for virality turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy: if the recommendation algorithm thinks something will go viral, it can make it happen simply by pushing it in front of enough eyeballs.')
