Item(by='valand', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612040827, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25972673, text='Oh, I meant to emphasis on that &quot;customerService depends on accountService and vice versa&quot; thingy. While in my writings &quot;accountService is a member of customer&quot; is a form of customer depending on accountService.<p>But my main point is that it should not be written that way at all.<p>Semantically, if we must include the subject, it should be<p>`theService.createAccount(Customer, NewAccountData)`<p>Or replace theService with CustomerAccountService or whatever.<p>Writing that way, with functions depending on types, avoid getting tangled from the so-called account-customer cyclical dependencies. Because account and customer don&#x27;t need to know each other until a function needs to know both of them. There&#x27;s no such thing as `customer.getAccounts()` because in the end the query would roughly look like `getAccountsWhereCustomerIs(CustomerId)`.<p>You&#x27;re not dumb. It&#x27;s just me mis-writing due to the fact that I&#x27;m writing this at 4 in the morning lol. Or maybe I&#x27;m misinterpreted parent comment and that confuses you. In that case, I&#x27;m the dumb.')
