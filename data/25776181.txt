In my own participation in (left) political organizing, I don&#x27;t believe that we can rely on corporations to make it convenient for us, and say so. To be sure, the corporations convenience&#x2F;inconvenience <i>matters</i>.  But the inconvenience of having to access the thing in a browser instead of an app??? This seems like <i>nothing</i> to me.<p>The site actually getting shut down entirely is of course a lot more significant, I see much more of a point there. It&#x27;s complaining about &quot;oh no it&#x27;s just so hard to access it via a web browser instead of an app&quot; that seems ridiculous to me -- if you are organizing against the system -- and it&#x27;s pretty clear to me that&#x27;s what parler was doing; I am opposed to the politics they were doing it from, but not to organizing against the system -- you should expect and prepare for attempts to suppress. If &quot;oh no we have to access in a web browser instead of an app&quot; is <i>all</i> you get, you are doing great.')
