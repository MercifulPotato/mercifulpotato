This should be obvious if you consider things like dividends. There needs to be a fixed number of shares, each with a clear owner for that to work.</i><p>This isn&#x27;t really true. Let&#x27;s say a company has 100 shares and they decide to issue a $1 dividend. If there is no shorting, the company just pays out $100 and everything is done.<p>But let&#x27;s say there <i>is</i> shorting. Someone loans out 10 shares to a short who then sells them to someone else. All of a sudden there are 110 shares out there. So when the company pays out the $100 it&#x27;s $10 short of what is required for each stockholder to get the dividend.<p>So where does the required $10 come from? From the party shorting the stock of course! Anyone short a stock is required to pay out, in cash, any dividends issues while they hold a short position. So it all works out.')
