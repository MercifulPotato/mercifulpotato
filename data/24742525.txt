You won&#x27;t solve California droughts by reducing water usage in Iowa, for example.<p>&gt;Also note that California produces 80% of the world&#x27;s almonds, but something like 1% of the world&#x27;s meat.<p>If these numbers are accurate, it seems like it&#x27;s <i>more</i> sensible to discuss almonds in the face of water usage and eschew talking about meat, since California in the midst of its many droughts is specifically using a lot of its local water supply on almonds, not meat.<p>edit: the numbers I found from a quick Wikipedia search are that 11% of Cali&#x27;s Ag water is used on pasture forage (though this doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it&#x27;s for meat; from other information on the Wiki page it looks like a lot of this pasture forage is for horses), and 18% on Alfalfa which is exported as cattle feed. So that&#x27;s anywhere from 18% - 29% on &quot;meat and meat products&quot;, whereas 34% is &quot;fruit and nuts&quot; (it&#x27;s unstated how much of that is almonds).')
