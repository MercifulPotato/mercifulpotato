I do currently follow a similar model to what you describe when recording complexes in Strong, using the name to hold the rep data, it just feels like &quot;Clean + Clean and Jerk&quot; for &quot;2+1&quot; is nicer than &quot;Clean + Clean + Clean and Jerk&quot; or &quot;Clean double + Clean and Jerk&quot; etc.<p>It feels like using supersets for these would make tracking data over time difficult. eg given your clean clean jerk example, if one wants to track volume of a particular exercise it&#x27;s not clear what the volume for each of those should be applied to, and it could get rather messy (is it 2x cleans + a jerk, or 1x clean + a clean and jerk?). Everyone probably has different preferences there, but my point is that native support for complexes would probably make stuff like this easier by providing a way to properly define&#x2F;separate each component of the performance at data entry time.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to only talk about things it doesn&#x27;t support, though. I honestly think this looks great even without support for complexes (it&#x27;s just long been the top of my wishlist for exercise tracking tools!) and am going to try it out next week!')
