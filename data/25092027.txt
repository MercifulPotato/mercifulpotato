I have 3 email accounts at FastMail and 6 at ProtonMail.  Also, some of it is inertia: I&#x27;ve hosted the MX for sneak.berlin at FastMail for several years (and have prepaid some time into the future), and have only been using ProtonMail for about one year (and the HOWTO article is recent).<p>The fact that FastMail might be subject to the new Australian crypto key escrow law[1] is a little bit worrisome, and I may not continue to use them in the future depending on how that plays out.<p>For things where surveillance is less of an issue, I prefer being able to use a plain IMAP client, which ProtonMail does not support.  Their current iOS client is pretty lame, for example (although their web client is better, and I understand that their next major release will improve things a lot across the board).  I mention the IMAP issue in the article.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;parlinfo.aph.gov.au&#x2F;parlInfo&#x2F;download&#x2F;legislation&#x2F;bills&#x2F;r6195_aspassed&#x2F;toc_pdf&#x2F;18204b01.pdf;fileType=application&#x2F;pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;parlinfo.aph.gov.au&#x2F;parlInfo&#x2F;download&#x2F;legislation&#x2F;bi...</a>')
