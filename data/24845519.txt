How many percentage of the consumed energy turns into the desired product (computation)? Les than 1%, a CPU using 100 watt is pretty much a 100 watt room heater with a side-effect of also performing some computation..<p>That&#x27;s a _WAY worse fuel efficient than a Model T, and yet we treat computational power and memory capacity as infinitely cheap.')
