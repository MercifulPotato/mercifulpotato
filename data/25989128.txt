Say we wish to do away with banks. So a person wants to open business A, needs to buy things to get their business up and running. Rather than begging the bank for access to capital [0], I buy things from my fellow businesses in this community on credit. They agree to give me their goods in exchange for my promise to pay back (and in exchange I do the same for their goods).<p>This still doesn&#x27;t work because of one simple reason: dollars (or your local currency) are legal tender, and you need legal tender to pay taxes. You cannot legally function on &quot;community credits&quot; alone.<p>[0]: Which in itself it&#x27;s a pretty wretched thing that this is in the hands of private individuals, who can decide who gets to start businesses and who remains a wage-slave.')
