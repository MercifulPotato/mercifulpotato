I use the LiveFrame [1] app, which still supports very old versions of iOS (9.5).<p>The iPad had just been sitting in my closet for a few years, since I couldn&#x27;t update it to the latest version of iOS, and most apps stopped supporting it. I was about to throw it away before I had one last attempt at doing something useful with it. I&#x27;m really glad I found the LiveFrame app and was able to get it working.<p>It also has a web browser that can display almost any webpage (although it would probably struggle with the latest CSS features.) So you could show a dashboard web page to display some information.<p>I would recommend looking on eBay to see if there are any cheap iPads or Android tablets.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;liveframe&#x2F;id860372559" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;liveframe&#x2F;id860372559</a>')
