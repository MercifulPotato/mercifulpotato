As many folks have said before, often times it makes sense to do things that donâ€™t scale early. This might mean in-person visits. YC has many stories of this working, like Airbnb and Stripe.<p>I will also add that if you are looking to go down the VC path, being near VCs is important. You can raise VC being far away, but it is more difficult, and the associated costs will eat away at what the original commenter seems to be looking for, which is a cheap place to live.')
