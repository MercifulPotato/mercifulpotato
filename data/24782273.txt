I don&#x27;t believe this to be true.<p>No. Viewership was low, so it got cancelled. If it got cancelled before airing then a low viewership would be a result from that. But that&#x27;s usually not the sequence.<p>If that is the catch-22 you could apply this to a 4th season aswell. Or 5th.<p>Shows don&#x27;t get renewed during or before a season. At least most of them don&#x27;t, so it&#x27;s always a gamble.')
