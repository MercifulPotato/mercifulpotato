Windows ARM64 can execute natively on the M1 (through QEMU for hardware emulation, but the instructions execute natively).  Intel&#x2F;AMD could produce an ARM processor that could find a market.  They also have a close partnership with Microsoft and I have to believe there would be a path forward there.  They could also target Linux.<p>I haven&#x27;t seen enough evidence yet though that ARM is the reason M1 performs so efficiently.  It may just be the fact that it is on a cutting edge 5nm process with a SoC design.  I&#x27;m not even sure if the PC&#x2F;Windows market would adopt such a chip since it lacks upgradability.  It&#x27;s really nice to be able to swap out RAM and&#x2F;or GPU.  Heck even AMD has been retaining backwards compatability with older motherboards since it&#x27;s been one one socket for a while.<p>I think for laptops&#x2F;mobile this makes a lot of sense.  For a desktop though I honestly prefer AMD&#x27;s latest Ryzen Zen 3 chips.')
