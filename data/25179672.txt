It is light, very thin, and USB-C. Both screen are tactile and wacom pen enabled. The laptop folds at 360 so you can use either screen.<p>But the best is when you hold it in portrait mode like a book to display the paper on the color screen on one side, and take notes on the eink on the other side with a pen.<p>Even better: with the 2020 update, set the eink display to &quot;clone&quot; and select the option to turn the screen off, and you have a eink laptop to read technical paper in the browser, <i>BUT</i> in eink so it goes easy on your eyes.<p>It only serves one purpose, but it serves it perfectly.<p>It&#x27;s replacing my Sony 13&#x27; DPT RP1 eink reader, thanks to its better integration with OneNote, and also the &quot;side uses&quot; (you can use it as a eink laptop or screen by hooking a USB keyboard. vi on eink display is a pleasure to code with)<p>I would suggest the 256G version to have lots of room for content as it&#x27;s the ideal device to consume media on (mostly book) ; a few resellers still have it new-in-box. If you can afford it, get the Korean model on ebay, with LTE enabled - it&#x27;s a Fibocom L850-GL CAT9 WWAN Module II which is has an Intel xmm 7360 insde, so it&#x27;s multiband and will work everywhere.<p>Don&#x27;t get it used or open-box returned due to a bug on the charging side: if you try to use the yogabook at 0% battery but with the AC plugged, <i>REGARDLESS</i> of which AC adapter you use, it won&#x27;t draw enough power.<p>This means it will turn itself off in a few seconds, but right after damaging the battery - 10% loss of capacity is easy to do in just one day when trying to do the &quot;first boot&quot; if you are not patient ...')
