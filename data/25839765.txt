I get to listen to horns honking at all hours.<p>A few cars (Acura comes to mind), do a bit better, in that they have a very soft, more pleasant beep instead of honking the horn. My vehicle allows me to disable the horn honking completely, but it is buried deep in the settings, and I doubt few people would ever look for it.')
