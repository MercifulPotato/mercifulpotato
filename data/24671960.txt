This is where I just visually scan the document for keywords. For example, if I was hiring a Django developer, I&#x27;d look for Django...Once I&#x27;ve completed the first pass, I take a deeper dive into the shortlisted resumes, decide who I want to interview, etc.<p>The way I see it is that this kind of resume is explicitly <i>reverse</i> filtering against hiring processes like yours. Creative people don&#x27;t want to be compared in the hiring process as part of a &quot;shared folder&quot; against 300 other people, because it becomes basically an SEO game. (Note that this is not saying your process is wrong, it&#x27;s just not a good fit for more creative and freewheeling programmers).')
