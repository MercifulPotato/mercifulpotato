Excerpt from article of not letting money distort your goals:<p><i>&gt;Staying in a job for loyalty or money&#x27;s sake is like staying in a bad marriage for the sake of kids. [...] Optimizing learning over money early in your career.</i><p>[EDIT to the many downvoters:  Did I totally misunderstand the author&#x27;s blog article?  Where is the &quot;overly driven by money&quot; message?  His framework chart doesn&#x27;t have <i>money</i> anywhere on it.
