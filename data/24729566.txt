How are people supposed to believe in capital &#x27;S&#x27; science when our scientific institutions make claims based on their guts instead of just admitting they don&#x27;t know (which is the only acceptable scientific answer when you can&#x27;t back up a claim with reproducible experiments).<p>[EDIT]My point is, is the self-inflicted loss of trustworthiness not well earned by the CDC? When the CDC said repeatedly that masks would only make you catch the virus or that Americans shouldn&#x27;t prepare or panic about the new virus, when that turned out to be either lies or decisions based on nothing approaching the rigor or science, why should people believe things have changed? How does the layperson understand that <i>now</i> the CDC is basing recommendations on &#x27;S&#x27;cience?')
