All of your assertions fall flat. To give an example from the Muslim side, Jewish refugees escaping from Spanish repression in the 1550s-1600s escaped to the Ottoman Empire, where they were welcomed and shepherded into the bureaucracy.<p>Hinduism and it&#x27;s openness may have been responsible for letting people live in harmony for close to 3 millennia, but what we see is not the Hinduism of those times, but a rabid bastardization of it, akin to Islamic radicalization we see in Pakistan and Afghanistan.')
