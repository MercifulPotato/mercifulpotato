There is no bytes type in py2. How would a per-file directive (of all things) help?<p>What if one function running in “py2 mode” returned a string-that-is-actually-bytes, how would a function in “py3 mode” consume it? What would the type be? If different, how would it be detected or converted? What if it retuned a utf8 string OR bytes? What if that py3 function then passed it to a py2 function - would it become a string again? Would you have two string types - py2string that accepts anything and py3string that only works with utf8? How would this all work with C modules?')
