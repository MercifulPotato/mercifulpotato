Item(by='tylerhou', descendants=None, kids=[25175685], score=None, time=1606026685, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25175346, text='&gt; Tax property more when it&#x27;s vacant. Problem fixed.<p>Besides leaving properties vacant, rent control distorts the market in other ways. Because rent control also lowers the supply of rental unit, builders are more incentivized to sell to owner-occupants (since rent control depresses the value of rental units and thus a landlord&#x27;s willingness to pay for a given unit). This increases the pool of housing available to richer people who can afford to buy a house, and decreases the pool of housing to people who can only afford the rent.<p>Rent control also incentivizes renters to stay in their current housing, even when moving would be more efficient. (Consider someone living in an rent-controlled below-market rate apartment in San Francisco who gets a new job in the South Bay. They would like to move, but that would cost them extra in rent.)<p>Even if you create policies that address these issues, there are likely more problems rent control creates. At what point do you give up and conclude that rent control is the issue?&#x27;<p>If you want to control gentrification and enable people to stay in the neighborhoods that they grew up in, there ways to achieve that which don&#x27;t have the negative side effects of market-wide rent control, like below-market-rate housing for people who make less than a certain amount or have lived in an area for a certain amount of time.')
