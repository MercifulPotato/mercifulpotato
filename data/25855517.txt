While it can be told about any two classes of people it really applies to a lot of code I encounter:<p><pre><code>  A physicist is showing a thermos to her friend, a programmer.\n\n  &quot;It&#x27;s amazing&quot;, she said.  &quot;You put a cold drink inside and regardless of how hot it is outside the drink stays cold&quot;.\n\n  The programmer is suitably impressed.\n\n  &quot;But that&#x27;s not all&quot;, she continued.  &quot;You can put a *hot* drink inside and no matter how cold it is outside the drink stays hot&quot;.\n\n  Now the programmer is perplexed.\n\n  Plaintively he asks, &quot;But how does it know?&quot;\n\n</code></pre>\nI think of this whenever I read code that contains a gratuitous state variable that explains the type or content of some data structure rather than make the data structure self-explaining.  Even more annoying when it&#x27;s a class.<p>Having to coordinate <i>two</i> variables is a recipe for bugs down the road.  Seems like it should be a beginner&#x27;s mistake but I see it all the time in &quot;non beginner&quot; code.')
