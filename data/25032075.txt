In any random sample there should be a 9:1 ratio meaning that out of 100 randomly selected votes ~90 will be for Biden and ~10 will be for Trump.<p>The larger the sample the more likely the actual count is closer to the 9:1 ratio. Any deviation from that ratio will be made up as the count goes on. So in the most extreme case, if 90k in a row were all Biden and there was a 90k spike, the next 10k should spike for Trump. That never happened because after the 4am Biden spike, the count went back to &quot;normal&quot; ratios.<p>To use the casino analogy imagine if you&#x27;re at the roulette table and it comes up red 100,000 times in a row without black or green ever being called. That is statistically improbable.')
