But as a hobbyist, you risk leaving corrosive salts on the board or worse, sloshing them into electromechanical parts like switches, pots, unsealed relays, sounders, etc.  Getting to &quot;pristine&quot; is harder than a lot of people think.  There&#x27;s a vicious cycle in production where assemblers will use too much flux, get flagged in an IPC-610 evaluation, try to clean the boards, and then get flagged for high ionic contamination in the next evaluation.  You can&#x27;t see the salts you leave behind from incomplete cleaning.<p>Beginners should not ever clean flux.  Most hobbyists should never need to clean flux.  Professionals should have data driving any decision to clean flux.')
