I humbly recommend that you spend 80% of your efforts in finding ways to market this. What&#x27;s nice is, it is &quot;viral&quot; in that as people start sharing their music in this way, probably with others in the music scene, they will also get exposed to the product.\\<p>Your tiers could use some work. Your basic aim is to discriminate between dirt poor student musician, professional or hobbyist individual freelancer,  small businesses, and enterprise:<p>- The first free tier is good, but for the second one, I wouldn&#x27;t give unlimited songboxes (I understand you&#x27;re limiting by track de facto); as that feature should be saved for enterprise.<p>- You can charge a lot more as you go up, as you increase number of songbox, and bands supported (i.e. a set of songboxes).<p>- I wouldn&#x27;t limit the # tracks much after the first paid tier, because it helps drive engagement and exposes your product further.<p>Also as a growth aim buy more domain names with an ultimate aim of songbox.com :)')
