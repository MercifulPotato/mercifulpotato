It&#x27;s all about the people for me. I had no idea how much energy I got from the team and being together in the same space, even as a fairly introverted technologist. Remote communication technology is nowhere close to being able to replicate that. It&#x27;s one of those things you don&#x27;t realize is missing until it&#x27;s gone.<p>I&#x27;m hoping to be able to continue with some hybrid of WFH and in-office post pandemic. However, if I had to pick one, I&#x27;d choose in-office no doubt -- even with my fancy home office.')
