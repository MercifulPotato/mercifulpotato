It would be interesting to hear your experiences.<p>In terms of implementing the react frontend, this is a common complaint:<p>We do have a react SDK that provides React components for login &#x2F; sign up UI and its one of our powerful differentiators. It also does not need redux since the login components can handle state easily within themselves. That being said, one possibility to use redux would be to check if the user is logged in or not. For that, we provide a function from the SDK that can be called (doesSessionExist) anywhere in your react app. Hopefully this gets your attention :) Either way, we&#x27;d love to hear from you on our Discord or on my email ID (search Advait on this thread).<p>Your summary is incredibly on point and is part of our core thesis! Thank you for your candid feedback (we are also already in production environments but I understand your hesitancy).<p>Thank you so much for the encouragement - it is highly appreciated!')
