As such, it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;ll end up with two copies of the same thing (which is what would happen in the classical version) so there&#x27;s no discussion necessary around the distinction between teleportation and cloning.<p>Is it possible to have three entangled systems? It seems that would allow sending the state information from one to the other two, thus destroying the original but leaving two &quot;copies&quot;.<p>Apologies if the answer to this is obvious, I&#x27;m a total layman when it comes to this stuff.')
