JSX was one of the main reasons React became so popular. What would you have instead of JSX?<p>JSX was also one of the main reasons why people opposed it at first. We were taught to never mix HTML and JS and put markup in a separate file. Of course separate template files as a concept were bad in the first place, but it served as a red herring for those learning. It &quot;felt wrong&quot; to many people who wanted to &quot;just write Javascript&quot;. React works perfectly fine without JSX. I mean the syntactic sugar is nice, but the VDOM implementation was the breakthrough innovation that made React popular. You can have JSX if you want, but at the time of release, most people <i>hated</i> a new compilation step just for a bit of syntax comfort.<p>&gt; its original API of `React.createClass` was really no different from hundreds of similar APIs.<p>Yes, this is the API that I am talking about. There was never a need to combine state handling into the first virtual DOM engine. If there are hundreds of similar APIs, why create another one? Why not let the developer choose their own favourite Class implementation? Some people (such as myself) try to distance themselves from OOP as much as possible, so the class API was quite worthless.')
