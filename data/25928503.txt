He was interested in shilling his dataset far and wide, and will do what ever it takes to show the &quot;value add&quot; of his stuff to other tasks. The smart ones just gave him the number the wanted. I did the work and told him the value add is dubious at best. He found someone else to gave him the number he wanted to tell the story he pre-determined, and made claims in the papers that didnâ€™t even line up with the published results in that very paper. The music goes on and the whole experience is a complete waste of life.')
