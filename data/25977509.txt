The rest is straightforward natural selection: the most efficient covid-19 variants will win. We might get lucky; the most efficient variant might accidentally mutate away all the things that makes it deadly to humans. There might even be some selection pressure for that.<p>But it could also stay about as deadly while changing enough about its spike protein to defeat antibodies in previously infected individuals and get more infectious in the process, and that would be a really bad scenario.<p>I&#x27;ve been stunned for the last 12 months at the volume of the people that are totally okay with this, since we have no way of knowing right now how this might turn out over the next few years.')
