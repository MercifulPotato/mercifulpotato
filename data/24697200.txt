ECDSA by itself isn&#x27;t an implementable protocol: you also need to specify a curve and an encoding for the values at a minimum and ideally a hash function too.<p>The common DER encoding used for ECDSA signatures introduces several behaviours similar to the ones being discussed here which differ between implementations.  (Or, rather, DER itself doesn&#x27;t but BER does and what things that implement DER usually implement is some subset of BER and some superset of DER).<p>For curves with a cofactor similar issues also probably arise there-- I haven&#x27;t thought much about that since I just try to avoid cofactor generally, because it&#x27;s a pretty big footgun. :)<p>ECDSA implemented as Bitcoin does today (post BIP66) with a perfectly strict and completely specified DER encoding-- a near-power-of-2-size cofactorless curve-- and an additional requirement on S being in the lower half of the range doesn&#x27;t have these issues.  ... except to the extent that someone could try to make an implementation copying some off-the-shelf-ecdsa and miss those specific requirements and only be partially compatible.')
