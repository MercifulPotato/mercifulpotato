Item(by='osacial', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611677496, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25910902, text='Any of those shoals are identified outside of current EEZ, which is ~250 miles, however any neighbouring country can make claims to all those shoals as soon as they became islands, simply because of extended seabed or any other reasons - one of those is that they simply might not recognize such neighbours. If new owners of shoal can defend their rights from existing nations, then they could succeed, however, this opens can of worms, because most of the ocean is unclaimed and with automation in near future it is possible to make artificial islands regardless of any depth of the ocean - as a side product from deep sea mining.<p>This post however misses other exciting and less expensive chapters how to make your own country and succeed in doing so:<p>1. How to invade other country and make it your own?<p>2. How to organize a coup and overthrow government of already existing country and make it your own?<p>3. How to steal a country and pretend to rule it?<p>Ah, the possibilities... most of them are already executed and in action.')
