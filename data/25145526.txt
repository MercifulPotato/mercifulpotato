Disney should be forced to renegotiate any copyrights and contracts he’s involved with across the franchise.<p>If that happened, I guarantee you that this would be the last time a big corporation would try to pull this sort of thing off.<p>[edit:  I wonder if the current law would support this.  Disney’s in violation of the contract that assigned them copyright in the first place; surely invalidating the entire contract is a reasonable remedy.]')
