A bunch of candidates run, if no one gets 50% then the top two vote-getters face off in a second round with no other options allowed. On the surface it sounds a bit like IRV, but it causes really bizarre outcomes.<p>Basically, let&#x27;s say party A is unpopular, and has 2 candidates. Party B is extremely popular and has 7. Party A&#x27;s candidates each get 15% of the vote, Party B&#x27;s candidates each get 10%. Even though most voters voted for Party B, they&#x27;re now stuck in a runoff with two candidates from the opposite party.<p>Some people argue that this forces parties to be disciplined and force out candidates they deem &quot;unsensible&quot; or &quot;extreme&quot;. But in practice this often doesn&#x27;t work, and even if it did I feel like the mark of a good voting system is that voters feel safe expressing their preferences without having to be strategic.')
