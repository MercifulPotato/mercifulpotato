Sure, income has gone up, but so have house prices and so that proportion has surely collapsed. That has a much bigger effect on young peoples&#x27; lives than the number of luxury items they can buy and stuff into the property that they don&#x27;t have.<p>Edit: I found this interesting graph for the UK (where I live) [1]. It shows the ratio of average house price to average annual income. Not perfect measure as distribution of income over age brackets is probably more imbalanced now due to starting work later (18 - 25 rather than 16 - 21) but still interesting.
