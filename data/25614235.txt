Excess physical energy and restlessness is a common side effect of psychedelics, and that can easily translate into mental anxiety. Expending some of that energy through jumping jacks, push ups, running, hiking or whatever can help calm the jitters and make it easier to relax into the experience. Just don&#x27;t do anything that involves too much coordination or dealing with traffic :)')
