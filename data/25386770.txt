Most screen resolution upgrades come bundled with a touchscreen but I hate smudges on my screen. That people willingly to that to themselves on a regular basis is baffling to me. Especially because you&#x27;ve got to move your arm further to touch the screen than to touch the trackpad. It&#x27;s just less efficient for most computer interactions.')
