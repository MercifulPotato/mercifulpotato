After a few minutes of the album by KMRU, I got comments like, &quot;What is that noise&quot;, &quot;didn&#x27;t they get in the piano lesson past hitting C&quot; - as she sung C for about 15 seconds, and &quot;it&#x27;s the sort of music you play at end of a marriage&quot;, &quot;imagine being the lift driver in that elevator&quot;. While I argued that you can vary things like timbre and rhythm and not just pitch, I will have to revert back to my headphones or car for such aural excursions.')
