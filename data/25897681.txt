If you take the authors world view as true, and you identify yourself as a laborer in the conservative notion, for instance maybe you like Donald trump or Jordan Peterson and hate critical theory, then you see the world clearly and you have friends in high places, unlike the clueless left academics and media who opposes you. The left, simply because they are in the middle, are universally wrong and mocked by everyone who isn’t as delusional as they are. I suspect this article and it’s author of having underlying (and deniable) partisan motivations.')
