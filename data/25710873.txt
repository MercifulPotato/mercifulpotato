With a very concrete and contextual analogy.<p>No one is trying to get rid of cell phones anywhere in the USA. It is neither concrete nor contextual.<p>This Parlor de-platforming is extremely similar to the Daily Stormer de-platforming from Cloudflare. That&#x27;s an actual, reality-based example I feel acceptable about discussing. There are probably many other examples.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cloudflare.com&#x2F;why-we-terminated-daily-stormer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cloudflare.com&#x2F;why-we-terminated-daily-stormer&#x2F;</a><p>This happened 4 years ago. There&#x27;s a huge amount of historical discussion and arguments you can look up about this event 4 years ago if you like.<p>&gt; EDIT: So according to you, for my argument to be relevant it has to have an actual precedent in reality? Did Nazi germany have one?<p>Yes. Nazi Germany counts as a historical example if you wish to use them. But since they had no internet back then, I think you&#x27;ll find it difficult to find similarities to today. But give it a shot, what about the Nazis do you want to discuss?<p>If I&#x27;m thinking about the 1930s or 1940s, I&#x27;m thinking...<p>* The US Office of Censorship (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Office_of_Censorship" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Office_of_Censorship</a>), which literally opened mail and censored them, as a historical example if you&#x27;d like. There&#x27;s plenty of real-life examples of censorship from which you can base your argument and discussion off of.<p>* There&#x27;s also Hay&#x27;s Code (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Motion_Picture_Production_Code" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Motion_Picture_Production_Code</a>), which is probably a good 1930s example of Free-Market American Censorship being applied to Hollywood (and now that I think of it, bears some level of resemblance to the Parlor vs AWS situation).')
