The mere fact that a problem exists doesn&#x27;t mean you must drop everything else to go and fix it, especially such a large and intractable problem as &quot;a third of the population unfathomably has a worldview totally incompatible with my own&quot;. You may instead choose to solve a different problem where you think you have an actual chance of making progress.<p>For example, I am of the LessWrong school, and I consider one of the greatest sources of suffering to be the fact that people die; but I am not reskilling into the field of human longevity, and I don&#x27;t think (?) society would excoriate me for that. And since I have chosen not to work on that particular infinite well of suffering, I <i>have</i> to not care about it so much, for the sake of my own sanity and my ability to work on other things. If mere knowledge of the existence of an infinite well of suffering obliges you to expend huge amounts of effort on fixing it, woe betide you when you discover <i>another</i> one! If you want to put everything you have into solving one of the problems, then you simply have to weep, put aside the others, and try not to let the constant agony affect your efforts in the place where you think you can <i>actually help</i>.<p>It certainly sucks hard that many people have their country&#x27;s political decisions thrust in their faces every hour of every day. Come to that, 58mm people die every year, which is an overwhelming tragedy that most people manage to ignore most of the time so that they can actually get anything done. But I have the choice of investing effort into fixing only a very limited number of problems, and I do not judge someone who runs the numbers and thinks they can do more good by not pouring all their effort into the impossible ones. I stress again that politics really is extremely hard (just look at the US election results to see how much popular support there is for both of the two highly incompatible sides of the USA election).')
