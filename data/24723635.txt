They can make whatever changes to the protocol they wish, but they can&#x27;t force anyone to adopt those changes.<p>And yes, a lot of Bitcoin has been carelessly lost, but these are mostly old cases before Bitcoin had any exchange value. You&#x27;ve probably read about people throwing away hard drives with 1000s of mined bitcoins that ended up being worth millions a few years later. Hindsight is 20-20.<p>It should also be pointed out that a sizable chunk of Bitcoin is essentially frozen in Satoshi&#x27;s wallets. Whether to count them into the supply is debatable. Same for Hal Finney.')
