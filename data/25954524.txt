It cannot be solved with technology. You need men and women with principles to ensure our rights. Unfortunately we seem to have a lack of those today. Without them, we will continue making protocols and platforms and laws and regulations, and keep circling the drain.<p>Each one of us must realize the absolute importance of free speech, and must speak out even in favor of protecting the free speech of people we despise.<p>Realize that the entire point of free speech is to protect unpopular&#x2F;despised speech.
