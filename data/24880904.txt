You only infringe once you distribute the content further.<p>In fact, as far as I&#x27;m aware of, this is also how the situation plays out <i>de facto</i> in most (all?) European countries.<p>&gt; The rights holders have effectively said &quot;you can watch this for free as long as we get the ad revenue&quot;.<p>The key lies in the word &quot;effectively&quot; here. They may have <i>said</i> and even meant that, but I am unaware of a legal mechanism that would actually allow them to do this (in Europe). The only way I can think of accomplishing this would be to make the content available under a dedicated, bespoke licence, akin to how GPL works, and even then I&#x27;m unsure whether it would be enforceable. TOSes, generally, are not.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not hard to predict that&#x27;s coming, especially in Europe given Article 13 last year.<p>This is wrong. Article 13 regulates <i>content hosts</i> (in this case, Youtube), <i>not</i> end users. Hence, Article 13 has no bearing on ad-blocking software.')
