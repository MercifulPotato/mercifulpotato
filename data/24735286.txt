The idea that the things you describe are representative of “lefties” is almost as silly as the notion that “left” is any kind of unifying umbrella at all.<p>That said, yes a political persuasion so large it uses a hemispheric metaphor is likely to have some common threads.<p>Absolutely, there were some people “on the left” who took obviously dishonest photos of beach gatherings and mindlessly regurgitated them. And certainly there are people “on the left” who on principal oppose residential development that would alleviate some housing pressures because the development is overwhelmingly upmarket and contributes to the affordability crisis even as vacancy eases affordability pressure in other ways.<p>But what I see in my “bubble” is that these are both examples of the deep culture of debate on the left; that challenging groupthink is built in; that “reality” isn’t some amorphous thing but actually an area of exploratory interest, where the left internally dissents and people in it gradually reconsider their ideas and assumptions without outside&#x2F;“other” pressure. Because yes, we get shit wrong, but we actually care about correcting ourselves more than correcting the “other”.<p>Both of the examples you chose are subjects that “the left” has aggressively self policed, because when the actual reality hasn’t matched the instinct, we don’t mind admitting we’re wrong and absorbing that new knowledge.<p>[1]: Edit to explicitly state the Monty Python reference, which I’m sure some will pick up on... “People&#x27;s Front of Judea”, etc and so on.')
