Item(by='dragontamer', descendants=None, kids=[25475179, 25475834], score=None, time=1608349408, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25474688, text='I always saw Daenerys Targaryen&#x27;s plot to be a &quot;cartoon&quot;, so to speak. Everything about her: from the dragons, to the royal bloodline, to the &quot;slaves are bad Imma save everyone&quot; plots was cartoonishly shallow. She&#x27;s practically the &quot;Dungeons and Dragons Murder Hobo Adventuring Party&quot;.<p>In effect, Daenerys was the &quot;typical&quot; fantasy plotline, happening elsewhere. Eventually, when Daenerys arrived on Westeros, where actual politics &#x2F; actual history is going on (aka: more real), her fantasy methodologies just don&#x27;t work out very well.<p>---------<p>But that&#x27;s my reading (of the HBO series. I never actually read the books). I recognize that there are people out there who might think that the Dothraki were somehow realistic.')
