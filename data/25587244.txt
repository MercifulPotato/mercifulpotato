NixOS and Fedora Silverblue). That said, the packages don&#x27;t cover everything around a distro; off the top of my head, it only partially covers people (yes maintainers, but people could be involved in other ways), and it appears to not cover events, funding, or documentation (ex. wiki stuff). I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s a <i>fault</i>, mind; even the existing database feels like a weird commingling of concerns to me, but &lt;bikeshed&gt; I wish they&#x27;d called it the Ultimate Debian Package Database or something &lt;&#x2F;bikeshed&gt;')
