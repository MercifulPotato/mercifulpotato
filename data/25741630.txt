Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610419713, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25741479, text='&gt; Unlike online UGC service providers, bookstores can be forced to remove defamatory books in the US. There&#x27;s a reason there&#x27;s a law specifically for UGC service providers, and you cannot defend this while at the same time demanding that they get treated like book stores when it comes to compelled speech.<p>Sure I can, since the plain text of the law in question only removes publisher (which are not notice-based), not the notice-based obligations and liability of a distributor. <i>As the article you cite here argues</i>, the <i>extension</i> of 230 beyond what it says on its face to also remove those distributor-style liabilities is a strained interpretation that <i>some</i> courts have adopted that lacks support in the text of the law and is explicitly at odds with it&#x27;s legislative history and rationale.<p>So it&#x27;s quite easy to support the law that exists for UGC service providers and demand they get treated like bookstores and other distributors as regards notice-based removal of defamatory content because <i>that&#x27;s exactly what application of the law as written does</i>.<p>The debate over 230 is not, mainly, about this one area where some courts have applied it out of line with it&#x27;s plain text.')
