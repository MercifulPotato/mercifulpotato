A bit nit-picky but the Beta distribution has support [0, 1]. So the distribution in the graph is not a Beta. It&#x27;s probably a shifted and scaled Beta.  2. The probability density can be arbitrarily high, which means that the log of the density can&#x27;t have an upper bound at 0. Probability is bounded at 1 but probability density isn&#x27;t.  The fact that none of the example distributions passes zero is a mere coincident.  I&#x27;m surprised to see this beginner&#x27;s mistake in an otherwise insightful article.')
