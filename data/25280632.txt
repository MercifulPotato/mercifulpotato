Even little stuff like my son who is on my family plan.  He used Google Play Music <i>all the time</i> with no problems.  When they <i>forced</i> us to move to YT Music, now it won&#x27;t let him get the app because he&#x27;s too young and YT isn&#x27;t allowed.  So I either have to give up all the parental controls that I need and use, or he can&#x27;t access the family plan music subscription that I pay for and used to have with no problems at all, because I was forcefully migrated to a new service I didn&#x27;t want when the old one was perfectly fine.  I despise the new world we are in.<p>I&#x27;m about to go full self-hosted on a ton of stuff.  Plex, Book Sonic, Next Cloud, etc.  Then I can move when <i>I</i> want to move.<p>Edit:  I actually bought a used (came from Google I believe) Dell R620 on ebay, loaded to the hilt (dual 8 core (16 total physical cores) E5-2650, 256 GB RAM, 10 600GB drives (SAS)).  They&#x27;re amazingly affordable.  I paid around $750 with shipping.  I can run a hell of a lot of stuff on that and since I&#x27;m mostly at home these days it will be blazing fast (way better than existing cloud stuff that is limited by my 20Mbps downlink, which is the fastest I can get).  Nothing like a Gigabit connection to my &quot;cloud&quot; :-D')
