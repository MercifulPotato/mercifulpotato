I don&#x27;t have a problem with what you said there.<p>You have to go back a couple of posts to see the point. There, you wrote &quot;&#x27;Intelligence&#x27; is a word that, etymologically and semantically, is related to human or human-like capabilities. You wouldn&#x27;t say that a leaf floating on a lake is swimming.&quot; As we are now agreed that definitions follow from knowledge and are modified in response to new knowledge, it would not be somehow wrong to extend the concept of intelligence to a certain class of machines, if it turns out to be useful and informative to do so.<p>&gt; They are <i>literally</i> just programs.<p>I take it, then, that you don&#x27;t agree with the sort-of Platonist view that algorithms have an existence independently of any implementation? I&#x27;m on the fence, myself, but lean towards the Platonist side.<p>Regardless, it follows from your position here that your original statement &quot;What&#x27;s happening in my brain is something we don&#x27;t have full scientific knowledge of, but we know it&#x27;s not x86 machine code&quot; can be rewritten as &quot;What&#x27;s happening in my brain is something we don&#x27;t have full scientific knowledge of, but we know it&#x27;s not computable.&quot; - but while the former is true, the status of the latter is not yet decided, so they are not identical propositions.<p>&gt; One needs not believe Newtonian mechanics is ontologically true, it&#x27;s a tenable position to claim it&#x27;s just a model, and we accept that model because it&#x27;s useful.<p>One could say the same about specific ontologies - they are as subject to revision in the face of increasing knowledge as are both mathematical models and individual words - and if it turns out that a mathematical model of biological intelligence or consciousness is effective and useful, it would be tendentious to imagine an ontological line between that model and intelligence.')
