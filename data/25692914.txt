They are opening themselves up to class-action, since their current approach is antagonistic to 45% to 50% of their audience.  Going after new platforms is a recipe for anti-trust lawsuits.<p>There is no doubt in my mind that they will do the same thing to a popular libertarian, or, progressive that is set for a massive upset of the status quo.  And no, I am not talking about an establishment figure.')
