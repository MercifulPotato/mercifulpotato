Every unionized workplace I have been in from educational institutions to government departments to defense contractors is like this to a pretty large extent.<p>&gt;But the German example<p>Yes, I know that European unions are different and not nearly as asinine as American ones but I have yet to hear anyone say that tech will get European style unions let alone a good argument for why this will happen.  The best I&#x27;ve heard so far is we should unionize because Europe&#x27;s unions don&#x27;t suck.  I&#x27;ve never worked (in tech) in an environment where I feel I am getting screwed hard enough that the unions are the lesser of the evils.  I understand game devs may feel differently (and they will likely unionize before the rest of the industry IMO).<p>Basically American unions suck which is why American workers in well compensated industries don&#x27;t want them.')
