For instance, when you are just scoping out a feature (before implementation), you could estimate the net lines that need to be added (for example). If it seems to high, people can push back before all the work has been done. And if the estimate starts to look wrong you can go back and re-scope the project and either simplify the feature or tell everyone it&#x27;s going to be much more complex than planned.<p>The key would be to recognize exploding complexity before all the work is done.<p>Has anyone tried something like this? Would it work?')
