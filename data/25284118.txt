A full-union work stoppage is the most extreme, rarely deployed. Other measures include rolling work stoppages, delaying response to manager emails, not attending meetings with management, not answering non-customer-impacting on-call pages during certain hours (I&#x27;m sure support would be widespread for this one in particular lol) - you can come up with more ideas on your own. My brother, an EMT, is part of a union that does &quot;plainclothes&quot; strikes where they just wear street clothes instead of their uniform, for a softer example from another field.')
