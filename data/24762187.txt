Moving air around your home is absolutely wonderful.<p>Even if you have no heating or cooling going on, keeping a constant flow of air helps keep dust down by filtering it, helps even the temperature (maybe part of your home heats up in the afternoon) and most importantly keeps the CO2 levels consistent.<p>If I turn my HVAC fan off, any room I&#x27;m in will climb to almost 1000 ppm CO2 in hours. If I leave the fan on, every room stays well below 600 ppm.<p>Flipping the fan switch from &quot;auto&quot; to &quot;on&quot; on my thermostat has been one of the best quality of life improvements ever.')
