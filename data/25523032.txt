Item(by='dilippkumar', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608762643, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25521000, text='I will add an additional stipulation that I won’t age - the period of time I want to go back and witness is slightly longer than 2 human lifespans.<p>PS: I don’t know how accurate these dates are, don’t cite these dates. I didn’t perform even a cursory sanity check on these dates.<p>I’d travel back to 1453 and witness the fall of constantinople.<p>Then, I’d make my way to Europe to watch the start of the protestant reformation, the rise of the Tudors and maybe go to Uzbekistan and join the 11 year  old Babur in 1494.<p>I’d love to stay and follow him till he becomes the first Mughal emperor in India later, but there’s a lot more to see.<p>I’d make my way over to Lisbon and hitch a ride with Vasco da Gama in 1497 as he starts on his historic voyage that will take him to the Indian Malabar coast in 1498. (I’m a One Piece fan btw, I am imagining sailing with Vasco da Gama would be as fun as the manga, but reality will probably be more brutally medieval).<p>I’d then make my way over to the court of the Vijayanagar empire and watch Krishnadevaraya ascend to the throne in 1509.<p>I wouldn’t mind staying in Hampi for the entire duration of Krishnadevaraya’s reign - but in 1526, I’d want to go watch Babur (whom I’d have last seen around 1494) defeat Ibrahim Lodi and become the first Mughal emperor. From there I’d go to the court of Suleiman the Magnificent and watch the Ottoman-Saffavid wars.<p>I’d try my best to go back to Europe to watch Michelangelo in Florence and later Rome. I’d probably take a short trip back to England to watch Henry VIII finally marry Anne Boleyn in 1532.<p>Around 1539, I’d travel to Copernicus and probably stay and watch him finalize his book where he proposed the heliocentric model of the universe.<p>I’d then hike around a bit, watch the Renaissance unfold, go back and watch Suleiman make his way till Vienna and make my way back to India to watch the Mughal empire firmly settle in.<p>I want to witness the 1565 battle of Talikota. Somehow, that’s important to me.<p>Not sure what I’d do most of next decade. In 1572 I’d watch the supernova with Tyco Brahe. Then follow him around for a while watching the science and religion in Europe forever change civilization. Along the way, I’d stop by in England to watch Shakespeare plays as they come about. In 1600, I’d want to witness the incorporation of the British East India Company.<p>Then I’d go to watch Kepler work on Tyco Brahe’s data and compile it into his laws of planetary motion (published 1609). I’d also be there to watch Galileo build his telescope in 1608 and between these two, define our understanding of earth and sky.<p>I could go on, but I’ll stop typing now. You get the picture. Eventually, I’d return after watching the Taj Mahal be completed in 1648 I guess, though I’d love to stay behind and watch Newton do his thing.')
