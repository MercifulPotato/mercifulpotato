Item(by='eesmith', descendants=None, kids=[25833940], score=None, time=1611039413, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25827093, text='I read <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25825188" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25825188</a> but didn&#x27;t understand how the threat models apply.<p>&gt; Firstly it prevents MITM attacks that inject Javascript (or other) payloads into web pages which can be used e.g. for DDoS attacks<p>If someone nefarious wanted to MITM my web site, the easiest would be to spoof DNS so it went to some other host, and do the MITM that way. Your ISP could do that to you, no?<p>While more people could spoof the http connection than spoof the DNS, <i>what&#x27;s the threat model</i>? If it&#x27;s the Great Firewall then all users behind it are also using their DNS.<p>Which is why (as I understand it) you also need things like &#x27;integrity&#x27; in your links in order to avoid the attack you describe. Not simply switching to https.<p>&gt; Are you comfortable with ISPs injecting ads into your blog? [1][2]<p>They aren&#x27;t injecting ads into my blog. They are injecting ads into your transfer of files from my site. Why are you using an ISP which does that?<p>&gt; You can still track which sites a user connects to, but you can&#x27;t see which pages they access or the contents of those pages<p>Again, what&#x27;s the threat model? I&#x27;m pretty sure simple traffic analysis would be enough to figure out, based on download size and number of additional requests made, which pages are downloaded.<p>While there are ways to mitigate that, it&#x27;s not as simple as moving to https to prevent anyone from figuring out what my users are accessing on my site.<p>So, do I give my users a <i>false</i> sense of security by switching to https? It depends on the threat model, doesn&#x27;t it?<p>&gt; I&#x27;m curious, which phone is this and what do you use it for?<p>Does it make a difference? It&#x27;s meant to underline the point I made that not everyone has new hardware.<p>The question for you is, how many people and devices will I block by switching to https-only?<p>Will poor people using second-hand computers be able to access things? Will old Docker images with scientific projects on them stop working when the embedded certs age out?<p>I have an implicit promise that if you could access URL X using method Y then you will always be able to access URL X using method Y. Why should I break that promise.<p>To be sure, I also have a site behind https. Among other things, it serves pip-installable packages. Which is why different threat model than my static blog site. (It also doesn&#x27;t have the a 20 year old implicit promise.)')
