The issue is not being able to handle the 5x volume spike, but handling the spikes the system handled just fine before (but not necessarily at the same day of the week&#x2F;month&#x2F;year).<p>For example, if my employer promises not to reduce cafeteria service and a month later says &quot;no cafeteria for employees today due to a conference; we cannot feed that many people; go away&quot; a hungry employee should check if we had such spikes before and if so how well we did. If indeed it was a unique surge, OK. But if every year we have similar spikes and they never turned employees away, &quot;we did reduce service&quot; is a better explanation than &quot;we cannot serve such volumes&quot; :).')
