Well, high\nend sociology tries to be <i>a science of\ngroups of people.</i><p>Well, the <i>theory</i> of that field can start\nwith a statement, observation, claim such\nas<p>&quot;Itâ€™s a hundred years later and we still\nimitate Europeans and ape European culture\nwhen we want to pretend to be rich and\nupper-class.&quot;<p>I can believe that some or much of that is\ntrue!  E.g., way back there when I wanted\nto learn to cook so I could serve\nsomething good to guests, I went for\nEuropean cooking, sure, especially French\ncooking.  Much of that cooking is still\nlike the first class dinner scene from the\nmovie <i>Titanic</i>!  Even now, I&#x27;d like to\nserve guests something from Vienna coffee\nhouse cakes -- some of which look\nspectacular, even if actually they don&#x27;t\ntaste better than good American apple pie,\nwarm, with good vanilla ice cream!<p>So, the statement seems clear enough,\nmight seem like good insight, maybe it&#x27;s\nobviously true, etc.  Still, it turns out,\nit is usually not easy actually to\nvalidate such a statement just from data,\ne.g., survey data, and associated\nstatistics.  More generally, <i>literature</i>,\ni.e., <i>belle lettre</i>, is awash in\nstatements that maybe one would like to\nvalidate with data and statistics as\nsociology science but which in practice is\ntough to do.<p>But for <i>belle lettre</i>, there is a way\nout!<p>First, f&#x27;get about asking if the statement\nis true in some scientific or statistical\nsense.<p>Second, instead, call the statement <i>art</i>\nas in the definition &quot;the communication,\ninterpretation of human experience,\nemotion&quot;.  Then look at the statement as\nan example of such &quot;communication,\ninterpretation&quot;, that is, just see if the\nstatement does communicate some emotions,\nimpressions, feelings, beliefs, behaviors,\nsuspicions, etc. of some people, maybe\neven some strange people with no attempt\nto consider <i>average</i>, most, or all\npeople.<p>First, then with a lot of such examples of\n<i>belle lettre</i>, can accumulate a catalog\nof possibilities for people, call it a\ncollection of Bayesian statistics\n<i>priors</i>, as first cut guesses when meet a\nnew person.<p>Second, if some of those claims, etc.,\nfrom literature seem to describe ones\nself, then can start to believe that are\nnot alone, not the Lone Ranger, not a\ntotal anomaly different from everyone\nelse.<p>Uh, I wish my various literature teachers,\nat least one of them, would have made\nthose points to me!')
