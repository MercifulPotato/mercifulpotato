Item(by='aliyfarah', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606395140, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25216887, text='&gt;This is the kind of thing that really leads me to distrust everything Coinbase is saying. Reading between the lines, I imagine that the complaints workers claim to have filed were ignored by management at some level of the process, or not filed on the right paperwork or something.<p>You&#x27;re too kind. I suspect what usually happens: the employee was fired by management soon after hearing some loud rumblings, then the employee filed an official complaint. Filing an official complaint while employed is extremely difficult, you not only have to weigh whether you have a justified complaint, but also expect some tension and possible conflict with your employer. I don&#x27;t like how Coinbase tried to play off official complaints from fired employees.')
