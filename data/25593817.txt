It was my first real industry job and in particular was responsible for leading two people who, technically, were way beyond me and had been actively mentoring me.<p>Lessons I learned in this specific context:<p>1. Sometimes you become the leader because you you can kiss ass better than others. Sometimes it&#x27;s just that upper management is an ass and you&#x27;re more tolerant of that.<p>2. I learned a lot more about leadership from my mistakes than any successes. I don&#x27;t think I was cocky, but more humility would have served everyone better.<p>3. Have your team members&#x27; backs. Having authority sometimes means keeping problems and mistakes internal. Exposing these upward can seem like its showing your ability to find and fix things and feel like the right (even the <i>necessary</i>) thing to do. It might be the worst possible thing to do by destroying team moral and any respect you may have had.')
