Item(by='dimeatree', descendants=0, kids=None, score=4, time=1603937149, title='Ask HN: Articles / Papers on Software Management/Cycles/History?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hey all, sorry for the bad title.<p>I am in the process of writing an essay to send to my CEO on why we need a good Software Project Manager that practices Extreme Programming (XP), and what value it will bring. This is just to ensure we find the right person for the role, and the transformation process involved. The current situation is that I have been forced into a management position role (Actually I am spread-thin among many roles), when I know I am not equipped for the position in the slightest and my efforts will just cause long-term damage.<p>I have been doing some hunting around for references; however my issue is that I am having trouble finding references around the history of software development, and the efficacy of the methods.<p>Listed below are the following papers and sites to read through currently; I am just collecting at this stage, so I have a fair bit of prep-work to do. They don&#x27;t need to be journal articles, just a good written article - or if there are some great postmortems out there in regard to Project Management, I will gladly take them on board :)<p>- https:&#x2F;&#x2F;oberoncore.ru&#x2F;_media&#x2F;library&#x2F;wirth_a_brief_history_of_software_engineering.pdf\n - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;337928210_Waterfall_Model_The_Scientific_Method_of_Software_Engineering\n - Dr Winston W. Royce, MANAGING THE DEVELOPMENT OF LARGE SOFTWARE SYSTEMS\n - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;publication&#x2F;220373708_Agile_Modeling_Agile_Software_Development_and_Extreme_Programming_The_State_of_Research \n - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rimas.kudelis.lt&#x2F;~rq&#x2F;pub&#x2F;Books&#x2F;software%20testing&#x2F;Addison%20Wesley%20-%20Planning%20Extreme%20Programming.pdf\n - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;academy.nobl.io&#x2F;definitive-guide-to-agile-retrospectives-and-post-mortem-meetings&#x2F;<p>So in case my question was missed, I am essentially after additional articles, papers, and postmortems focused on Software&#x2F;Project Management styles and the necessity of it all.<p>Many thanks!')
