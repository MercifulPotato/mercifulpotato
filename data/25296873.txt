I am working on a similar but different concept for a prototype I am working on. The project requires many document&#x2F;NoSQL style micro services, and I had the idea to do this directly with the file system and JSON serialisation, with thread locking on appropriate read&#x2F;write calls (some calls that are read only don’t require locks). It is <i>extremely</i> fast and performant, and given the way I’ve delineated the block storage that the file system runs on, my hope is it will also scale reasonably well.<p>I have also implemented a message queue using the same design&#x2F;infrastructure.')
