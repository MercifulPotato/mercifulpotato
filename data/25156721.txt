This chapter will discuss the 1995 battle for Grozny and examine why the Russian armor did not achieve the desired results.<p>So... the argument is that &quot;Russians don&#x27;t know how to use tanks&quot;. I don&#x27;t find this argument particularly persuasive.<p>It&#x27;s true that up-armourmed Abrams in Fallujah proved effective against RPG-7s (as mentioned in your link). But the RPG-29 was used in Syria successfully against them, and (more often) by Hezbollah against the Merkava tanks.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com.au&#x2F;russia-rpg-threat-to-modern-nato-tanks-2017-6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com.au&#x2F;russia-rpg-threat-to-mode...</a>')
