Had they instead found greater severity on birthdays and attempted to statistically correct for it, the two would be compatible.  Instead, they looked, and found that there was no underlying difference to correct for.  The question then becomes whether the GP is wrong, whether the hospital in question didn&#x27;t have such a policy, or whether the measurements used in the study were insufficient to pick up the difference in severity.<p>I don&#x27;t know which of these is true, but despite the apparent statistical significance of the finding, I wouldn&#x27;t be confident assuming that the result is generally applicable.   While not impossible, it strikes me as suspicious that they found no differences whatsoever in the surgeons&#x27; birthday vs non-birthday schedules.  I somewhat wonder if by &quot;no difference&quot; they really meant &quot;no statistically significant difference&quot;, which in this case wouldn&#x27;t justify their lack of adjustment.')
