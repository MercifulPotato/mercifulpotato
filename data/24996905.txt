Ultimately, a very simple function running on Cloud Function is just way, way more reliable and &quot;safe&quot; for us than spinning up a VM, monitoring that, installing a full web server or CGI or Django&#x2F;Flask setup to it, keeping it patched, managing deploys to it, etc. There&#x27;s just fewer moving parts to break.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t advise someone to spin up a key part of their infrastructure on Cloud Functions if they&#x27;re not already using GCP for other things.
