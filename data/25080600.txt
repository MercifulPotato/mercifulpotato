I&#x27;ve seen a claim of 6000 (not sourced properly), the RDA is 600, I couldn&#x27;t find even a dubious source for 10000 and all decent sources didn&#x27;t give a dose at all.<p>Given that 10000 is considered more than the maximum safe amount by many health authorities, I doubt Fauci would say he&#x27;s taking that much even if he did.')
