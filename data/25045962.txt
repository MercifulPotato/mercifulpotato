Item(by='falcolas', descendants=None, kids=[25046263, 25046032, 25046059, 25046374], score=None, time=1605016854, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25045889, text='$80k for how many years of work? Unless it’s one, I’m with the parent. I’m sure it’s all legal and ‘equitable’ according to the terms, but that’s peanuts of a return for somewhere between 4 and 7 years of work (based off a typical vesting schedule).')
