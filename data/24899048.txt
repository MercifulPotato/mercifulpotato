So it works as an interpreter (you give it code, it runs).  But internally it does not go line by line as you go.<p>As a simple demonstration, a syntax error on line 10 of a PHP script will keep it from executing code on line 5.  By contrast a syntax error on line 10 of a Bash script will not keep it from having executed line 5 first.')
