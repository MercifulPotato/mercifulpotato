Their backend is AWS, and so the cost reflects that. I might be wrong on this, but I think they use Glacier.<p>Here, we are pretty much providing a datacenter hookup for your hard-drive. If that hard-drive fails, we can ship it to you for recovery, but that&#x27;s on you.<p>The idea for this site is that most people with ZFS pools already have a mirror&#x2F;RAIDZ setup at home, and would enjoy the peace of mind if they had one-extra data-sink to send their snapshots.<p>Therefore, true data-loss will occur if:<p><pre><code>  * Their house burns down\n\n  * AND the remote zfs.rent hard drive fails\n</code></pre>\n...all at the same time.<p>---<p>Personally, I live about 20 minutes aways from my parents&#x27; house. I have two separate ZPools (one for my place, one for theirs). I sync the two every time I visit.<p>I wanted an extra cloud machine to sync to once a week or so -- you know, in case Northern California fires <i>really</i> get out-of-hand :&#x2F;<p>---<p>EDIT:\nI went to rsync.net just to double-check.
