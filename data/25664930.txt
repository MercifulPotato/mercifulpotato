COVID19 has overwhelmed the French, Belgian, and Italian systems too.<p>&gt;If you ask a lot of British people they seem to think that the only alternative is the wild west found in the US, rather than the other healthcare systems in Europe.<p>The NHS <i>is</i> unique in being so unified. I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s another European country in which one government entity runs insurance, billing, and delivery. Because the UK is the foreign country Americans are most exposed to (Canada doesn&#x27;t count), this results in both Americans and Britons thinking that all healthcare plans outside the US are like the NHS, when actually the norm is something closer to that of France, Germany, or the Netherlands.<p>Government running every aspect of healthcare means that every aspect of healthcare is a political issue. The consequent level of weaponization of the NHS in British political rhetoric is flabbergasting. It&#x27;s said that Social Security (the US version of UK National Insurance) is the &quot;third rail&quot; of American politics—any politician that touches it gets electrocuted—but there is no comparison. I, for one, have no desire whatsoever to ever experience the US equivalent of how in the UK the NHS is always, Always, ALWAYS the #1 or #2 topic of every single election, with every candidate competing to outdo the others in promising that the NHS will &quot;always be free&quot; and that he is the only candidate who can make sure that the local GP&#x27;s surgery hours will widen and that the A&amp;E will no longer be &quot;the worst in England&quot; or &quot;the second-worst in Yorkshire&quot;. The <i>Private Eye</i> piece is the result of the above.<p>(Canada, also with a single-payer system, sensibly divorces billing from providers. As in the US private entities deliver most healthcare, and in both countries if one&#x27;s doctor has inconvenient hours or if the local hospital has substandard care, one simply goes to another as opposed to having this being something politicians are expected to fix.)')
