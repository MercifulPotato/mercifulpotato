I know on my job, a lot of decisions are made due to inertia and processes that were built when we all could collaborate in person.  Feels like there&#x27;s a degredation in performance but it is not perceptible fully and without in person collaboration we are unable to course correct when absolutely necessary.<p>Note I have no idea what it was like to work on this game post COVID and i&#x27;m merely speculating!')
