They simply feature such swearwords as well as genitals.<p>&gt; &gt; <i>Kankerlijer means &quot;cancer sufferer&quot;. It is a strong insult: an example of its legal status can be found in a 2008 court case, in which using the word kankerlijer to insult a police officer was cited as a serious offense.</i><p>&gt; <i>Though, little surprise if &quot;offensive to an authority figure&quot; is a lower bar than &quot;offensive to parents&quot;</i><p>It isn&#x27;t about offending, but insulting.<p>It isn&#x27;t legal in the Netherlands to insult police officers in function regardless of how polite the language is. One can&#x27;t walk up to one and say “<i>I find your face most æsthetically displeasing.</i>” for instance.<p>Certainly not a law I agree with, in any case, and thankfully it&#x27;s becoming more and more of a dead letter, but occasionally people are prosecuted for it.')
