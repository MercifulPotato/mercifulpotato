About three years ago I decided to use a pseudonym on Facebook. Last year my account was disabled for violating community standards, and when I contacted Facebook, the form letter I got back was that Facebook was unable to verify who the account belongs to, and to reply with a picture of a valid ID. No amount of sending an ID, nor explaining I was using a pseudonym without realizing in it was against ToS, nor asking anyone to look at the 15 years of data associated with the account led to anything other than receiving the same form letter, over and over. On the bright side, it turns out I donâ€™t miss Facebook in the end.')
