Item(by='ajarmst', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603332609, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24847350, text='I&#x27;m old enough to remember the &#x27;Look and Feel&#x27; and Microsoft vs. Netscape suits. By the time the antitrust actions against Microsoft and the whole SCO&#x2F;Linux fiasco worked their ways through the system, the judgements were largely irrelevant or moot (in the colloquial sense).  I think an additional value of actions like this are to enter some of the issues that the modern information economy---which operate on scales at least an order of magnitude faster---into the legal record and provide basic arguments and interpretations that can afford the development of new law and precedent. Even bad or silly decisions (hello, &#x27;right to be forgotten&#x27; and cookie warnings) provide a foundation for legal challenge and new laws (viz. Section 230, although that last has also been serving as an illustration of how ignorant (hi, Donald) or cynical (hi, Joe) legislators can be about the law.)<p>Minor dig at the generally very good article: complaining that something has become politicized in 2020 is almost quaint. Ya think?')
