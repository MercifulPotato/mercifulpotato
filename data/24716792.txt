That compounds itself into institutional or systemic racism of which this is an example.  This is a government system that puts more obstacles in the way of darker skinned individuals because during the development of the system, the developers probably never even considered the importance of this system working for anyone but lighter skinned people.  Lighter skinned people were important and darker skinned people weren&#x27;t.  That is institutional racism.<p>Also I&#x27;m not aware of any credible authority on the subject that would say &quot;intent or a conscious prejudice&quot; is any type of requirement for something to be considered racist.')
