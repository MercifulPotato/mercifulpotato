VAC bans just get you banned from those games and is public record on your profile.<p>I only know of accounts being suspended for dicking with the steam store itself, e.g. by repeatedly abusing the refund system. So at least on that basis, they&#x27;re not really being suspended for their game conduct.<p>Whether what they did warrants a suspension from steam is sort of beside the point too, since it&#x27;s just as relevant for singleplayer games.')
