When the runtime is installed by default it’ll make a huge difference. (FWIW, I would not recommend using my library as is since it lacks JS bindings support for now, but I will probably look into it again some day soon.)<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jchv&#x2F;go-webview2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jchv&#x2F;go-webview2</a>')
