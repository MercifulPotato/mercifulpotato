I compromised relationships, stopped hobbies that made me relaxed and happy--again without realizing it.<p>It&#x27;s scary how life can just pass by while you&#x27;re in a state like that.<p>But as long as you&#x27;re aware of what you&#x27;re doing, why you&#x27;re doing it, and the &quot;life debt&quot; you&#x27;re taking on--rock and roll. Pouring yourself into creating something really is an incredible thing.')
