Beyond that, I don&#x27;t like the feeling (even of the putty ones) after a few hours. My ears start to feel clammy and like I&#x27;m building some kind of bacteria dish inside my ear.<p>Ear plugs have never been enough for me. Also - if it gets too quiet then my tinnitus starts going. Thus, like OP, I use a fan. Bothers my partner but she&#x27;s gotten used to it. She can&#x27;t stand the part where I like having it pointed at me too (I&#x27;m not very good at regulating body temperature at night without one).')
