Item(by='elihu', descendants=None, kids=[25019622], score=None, time=1604783826, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25019004, text='Yeah, that (or approval voting, or STAR) would be a good system in a primary.<p>In the general election, using plain score voting is a bit dangerous; if you consider a Trump vs Clinton race where all the Trump voters give him a ten out of ten, and most of the Clinton voters give her a six or seven, then Trump wins by a bigger margin than he did in 2016.  (STAR fixes this with an immediate runoff of the top two after maximalizing everyone&#x27;s vote.)  But in a primary election, it might be good to get the candidate with the most enthusiasm behind them.<p>One difficulty in implementing something like this for the Democratic primary is that it isn&#x27;t very compatible with the delegate system.  Maybe that&#x27;s not entirely a bad thing and delegates should be done away with, but sometimes it&#x27;s good to have a group of people at the convention who can make decisions if something unexpected happens to one of the candidates.<p>You could have individual states adopt different voting systems for their primaries and just use them to allocate delegates.  For instance, instead of allocating delegates proportionally to anyone with more than 15% of the vote using first-past-the-post ballots like we do now, allocate delegates proportional to their candidate&#x27;s total score, perhaps with some cut-off (like, no delegates awarded if your score average is less than 4 out of 10) or a rule that only the top N candidates are awarded delegates.')
