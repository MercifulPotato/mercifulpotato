Not great for that to get leaked; but not that scary from a national security perspective (we&#x27;re pretty aggressive about classifying stuff).<p>If anything damaging comes out of this, I would expect it to be of a political nature; where something that Pelosi and friends would prefer to keep secret gets leaked, but doesn&#x27;t have much influence on national security.')
