On startup installation, macOS and iOS do have opt-in screens for certain things like analytics, improving Siri, stuff like that. With the introduction of this feature, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they add that as well.<p>It&#x27;s easy to find fault in retrospect but it doesn&#x27;t make sense to have opt-in screen for every conceivable feature. Apple&#x27;s philosophy, which is wildly successful for most users, is to choose sensible defaults about how the OS works. When those are challenged, they expose them more explicitly, as they have done in the past. No company can easily predict if their defaults are going to cause a divide, so sometimes they have to be reactive on some features. Apple generally has a great track record of responding to criticisms like this and making things clearer for users.')
