E.g. Aa is inserted. The user will see &quot;B&quot; both as the last item on the first page, and the first item on the second page.<p>Or with your example:<p>Aa Ab B C<p>Now &quot;A&quot; is inserted between page loads. The user will never see &quot;A&quot;. What&#x27;s right for your application? Maybe a notification saying &quot;previous pages have gotten new items&quot;. Maybe not. It all depends.<p>Reddit can be annoying if you go page after page. As stories are bumped down you see them again. That, in my opinion, is a bug. But solving it requires something completely different from merely defining page boundaries.')
