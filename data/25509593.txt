Also sometimes the Fremont bridge route is going to be shorter. I hate riding my bike over the Ballard bridge, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d call riding on it &quot;risking death&quot;.<p>Bike access within Ballard is pretty great since the hills are a bit more manageable than in other parts of the city.<p>All that aside, it&#x27;s pretty easy to live in Seattle and not have a car, being able to walk to groceries, bars, restaurants, parks, etc.')
