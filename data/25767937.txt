Item(by='xpe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610571824, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25765557, text='&gt; I use SSM more because it&#x27;s a pure example of this; what exactly did marriage advocates &quot;give up&quot; in the bargain? It was the opponents who more or less had to capitulate near totally.<p>I am fascinated by your language use of &quot;capitulate&quot; here. You are framing this discussion very much with the language of &quot;subjugation&quot;.<p>Here is how I frame one category of public policy involving allocation of scarce resources. In the case of legislation that adjusts spending from general revenue, each taxpayer shares the responsibility. Individuals who attempt to withhold that portion of the tax will face penalties. This is one way a government can wield power. The power is often implied, but if necessary, it can be backed up with various enforcement mechanisms. These mechanisms may be coercive, but they are subject to the rule of law.<p>Now, with regards to granting privileges to same-sex couples, I do not see this as an issue involving scarce resources. A person who opposes same-sex marriage is not directly harmed by someone else&#x27;s partnership receiving the right for hospital visitation, for example.<p>In fact, I think the opponent of SSM, in practice, benefits in ways they don&#x27;t even recognize. Happier, more fulfilled people tend to lead to a more vibrant culture, stronger economy, and overall better quality of life -- for everyone. One of the classic ironic Hollywood storylines is about a homophobic man who grows up to be a father of a gay son. Over time, he realizes he was wrong.<p>At the same time, I can understand how this opponent of SSM may <i>feel</i> worse off. Unfortunately, this person wants their <i>private morality</i> to be imposed on <i>everyone</i>.<p>For background on how I am using <i>public morality</i> and <i>private morality</i>, see the writings of Robert Kaine. He argues <i>against</i> moral relativism while supporting the importance of value systems that are compatible with democratic ideals. In short, not all private moralities are equal in this sense: not all are compatible with a pluralistic public morality.<p>To be clear, Kaine&#x27;s reasoning does <i>not</i> demand a total ordering of private moralities. Indeed, it steers clear of that issue.<p>So, in conclusion, while I can <i>sympathize</i> with people who don&#x27;t get their way (which I frame as &quot;having their private beliefs codified into law&quot;), I don&#x27;t think they have been treated unjustly. Not all private beliefs are compatible with pluralistic democratic values. Sometimes society has to choose.')
