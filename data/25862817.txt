Then you perpetuated it. This is criminal negligence if not arson, and we ban accounts for this kind of thingâ€”especially now, after the hellfires this site went through in the last couple of weeks. We&#x27;ve raised the bar and are banning more accounts for abusing the site this way. I&#x27;m not going to ban you because your comment history shows that you&#x27;ve mostly been commenting about other things.
