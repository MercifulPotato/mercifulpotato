However the problem to focus on is that nuclear war is a lot more likely than most people think. Accidental launch in reaction to bad intelligence is a constant possibility; also the number of nuclear powers continues to increase. Civil war in any nuclear-arm nation is also something to consider. All of these could result in multiple strikes, which would unleash horrors not seen since WW II or before.')
