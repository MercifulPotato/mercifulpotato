The original goal of IQ testing was to predict which students needed special care. It is still very useful (albeit expensive) metric for that.<p>You are entirely correct, turns out I misremembered.<p>Wealth is definitely not inherited the same way as IQ, in that it doesn&#x27;t show any regression to the mean. We also know that adopted children from a lower-IQ family will show an IQ between their birth and adoptive parents, which is again very different from wealth.<p>I do agree that IQ is not a perfect metric, but can you describe why you think IQ is more reflective of society than anything else?')
