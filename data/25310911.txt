To me the weird bit is that you&#x27;re necessarily using it to inject very non-sterile heroin with unknown adulterants that you&#x27;ve bought from a (by definition) criminal enterprise. I hope that at some point doctors are able to provide opiates for addicts as further harm reduction.<p>I know there&#x27;s been some emergency COVID policies put in place in parts of Canada that allow morphine to be prescribed for that purpose (and possibly hydromorphone, but not heroin since Canada unlike Britain doesn&#x27;t allow medical use of heroin).')
