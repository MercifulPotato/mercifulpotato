I monetized 2 of my projects.<p>First one was Newsy (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsy.co" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newsy.co</a>) - which allows people to turn their un-used domains into something useful - a tool I built for myself first and slowly let others in. It&#x27;s been a little slow since I&#x27;m not doing much marketing, but getting the first ~10 customers was an awesome experience.<p>Second was my long-term project - SideProjectors (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sideprojectors.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sideprojectors.com</a>) - a market place for selling &amp; buying side projects - monetized with some standard elements - ads, pro membership, sponsors - all of them turned out to be great way of getting some side income.')
