I&#x27;m having a hard time believing that you read it carefully, because that&#x27;s the Childs preprint, which is only mentioned in passing, and the true focus of this new article is the Palmer (MIT) preprint, which is about mapping nonlinear differential equations to nonlinear Bose-Einstein condensates. BECs are modeled by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which contains a potential term that is proportional to particle density (basically a potential that depends on the wavefunction), causing nonlinearity.<p>From the news article:<p>&gt; The MIT-led paper took a different approach. It modeled any nonlinear problem as a Bose-Einstein condensate. This is a state of matter where interactions within an ultracold group of particles cause each individual particle to behave identically. Since the particles are all interconnected, each particleâ€™s behavior influences the rest, feeding back to that particle in a loop characteristic of nonlinearity.')
