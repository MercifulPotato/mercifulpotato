There were other terrible circumstances (he had barely slept in a few days, because of mixups hadn&#x27;t eaten properly, etc). In the end he was convinced to go on, and played differently than he was used to to try and get the most out of the piano.<p>What followed is widely hailed as a masterpiece, and remains his most popular work.')
