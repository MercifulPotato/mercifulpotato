Went into some depth comparing China with the United States for financial markets, startups, technologies, and fintec &#x2F; payments.  It also discussed how Asia will be able to leapfrog the USA since they aren&#x27;t saddled with old credit technologies.<p>I recall Safra Catz is on the list of contributors &#x2F; attendees.<p>Any help tracking this link down would be a huge help!  I&#x27;ve wracked my brain and googled the heck out of it, but so far came up empty.<p>I could&#x27;ve sworn I favorited it, but yeah :(<p>Thank you!')
