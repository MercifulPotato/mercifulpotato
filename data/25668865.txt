Take most of the comments you see on Twitter in subject matter and&#x2F;or delivery, and they would be either downvoted or moderated off this platform.  No-one in good faith (who has had reasonable exposure to Twitter) could argue this is <i>not</i> the case.  Just to be clear, I believe this to be a good thing.')
