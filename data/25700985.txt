It is backed by a strictly append-only log, but works as a fully read&#x2F;write POSIX-compatible filesystem. Think of it as a cross between a filesystem and tar, with infinite versioning and tuned to maximise ease of backups.<p>It is intended to be used by individuals to archive personal files.&quot;<p>Very half-baked. It works, but it turns out there are quite a few applications with highly pessimal write() patterns that bloat the metadata database, making it less general-purpose than I had hoped.')
