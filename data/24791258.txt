The Trump version was announced 2 days ago while the Biden one was planned a bit before that.<p>Whatever you think of Trump, he&#x27;s playing a game of chess.<p>Who&#x27;s going to get the better ratings?

I can see Trump touting his outsized ratings post town-hall.<p>I may be wrong. Maybe even a bit cynical at this stage....')
