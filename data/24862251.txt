Hence why the author wanted to use tags to limit the run to specific packages.<p>Rather than doing that you can run package_facts once to get a list of all the installed packages and skip all the module invocations you know won&#x27;t be changed entirely. You can&#x27;t do this in general because on a totally unknown system something exteranl might mess with packages between your fact gathering and the install but on your known systems this is almost always fine.')
