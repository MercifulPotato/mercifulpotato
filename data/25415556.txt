It is about the reduction of the need for farmland, transport, packaging, water and the use of chemicals. All parts of the problematic stress we put on nature and the environment. The use of greens in human food consumtion is enormous, regardless of the nutrition value they have compared to meat. If we can reduce the &quot;environmental footprint&quot; this consumtion have, it is a win, and not a waste of resources. On the contrary, I would argue.<p>And as I start off with; this is just the beginning of an interesting development. The road to a more sustainable future is paved with innovation and technology. It&#x27;s amazing how far vertical farming has come already, in my view.')
