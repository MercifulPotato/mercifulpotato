Like, I mean, this isn&#x27;t a plot summary, but this is in some sense what happens so look away now if you wish you didn&#x27;t know:<p>The Primer has been calling her Princess Nell for a <i>long</i> time. Once you realise what&#x27;s going on with the vast number of &quot;specially adapted&quot; Primers for the orphan girls, that Princess has got a ready made tribe with shared values in the form of the Mouse Army, waiting for her say so.<p>The whole book has been telling you that in this era what matters isn&#x27;t control over a land mass, which is what the Fists are fighting for in the Leased Territories on behalf of Han, but a Tribe with shared values.<p>The Mouse Army shows up, rescues Nell and takes her to her mother. The Victorian Queen recognises Nell as the leader of a novel but important tribe.<p>The novel is flawed in many usual Stephenson ways (e.g. use of rape in place of actual character development) but I don&#x27;t know what people expected from these endings, they seemed perfectly satisfactory to me on multiple re-readings.')
