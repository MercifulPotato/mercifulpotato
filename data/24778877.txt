I wish we had a system that&#x27;s not as dependent on resumes as the current one is. I actually dedicated the last chapter (that I&#x27;ll probably make public) on advice on how to make the process better, if and when you&#x27;ll be a hiring manager.<p>Anyone who feels the pain on how broken the system is: please, try to not forget this. And when you&#x27;ll have the opportunity, try to improve it.<p>I see solutions along not immediately rejecting when the resume is not a &quot;fit&quot;, but carrying on looking for signals.<p>As of today - in 2020 - the best way to not have to rely on a resume is to have a referral. The first part of the book stresses this a lot. A trusted referral &quot;I know this person&quot; will probably make a resume redundant, at least for smaller places.')
