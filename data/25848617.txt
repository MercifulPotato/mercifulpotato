How I got to some page is almost as important as the page itself.<p>I&#x27;ve been using large tab sessions ever since Opera 5 in the early 2000s. Back then I&#x27;d have 20-50 tabs or so. These days I have sessions of 500 active tabs and 500 suspended. It&#x27;s great. I have full text tab search, and since my sessions last years, I know the general location of all important tabs. ALso, since I use a single process brower and NoScript, all those 500+ tabs take under &lt;3 GB of ram.<p>It&#x27;s matter of taste, but it&#x27;s no new trend. Tabs, and tab users, have been around for 20 years now.')
