They&#x27;d call the order as &quot;caramel macchiato&quot; and, he seemingly hoped, get trouble from the other customers who had been refused that drink ... cute.<p>Aside: I always assumed the whole &#x27;spell your name wrong&#x27; thing that Starbucks did was a marketing thing - they certainly got a lot of social media posts out of it!')
