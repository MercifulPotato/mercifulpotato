They do some work, but their scope and manpower is limited, and they try to multiply their impact through contracting. Part of that is helping federal agencies write better contracts to be able to <i>source</i> the kind of contractors they want --- ones who think in terms of product development, user research (&quot;build with, not for&quot;), and are using modern software development practices. Bringing in contractors helps them multiply their impact, especially with how difficult hiring people into government is. (and a lot of people in tech simply didn&#x27;t want to work directly under the Trump administration, which --- as liberal as the tech field tends to lean, seems to be a factor on hiring at 18F and USDS).<p>I work at one of the contractors in the space (Ad Hoc [1]) and get to work with people from USDS every day. Like others have commented here, the government salary ranges are a problem for them to hire enough. Our last COO had been an administrator at OPM, and would say things like &quot;on the government side, I couldn&#x27;t ever hire the kinds of software developers that we&#x27;re able to here on the contractor side.&quot;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adhoc.team&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;adhoc.team&#x2F;</a> -- we&#x27;re hiring, full-time remote!')
