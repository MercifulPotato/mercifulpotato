This is particularly important for multichannel sound in movies and video games but it is important for music.<p>Good sound recordings (say a David Bowie album from the 1970s) carefully record the instruments with a &quot;dry&quot; recording with limited echo and reverb.  Then they put in the echo and reverb they want with a convolutional filter or physical realization thereof.<p>If you see that as the artistic vision and want to reproduce it accurately you don&#x27;t want to undo that convolution.<p>Undoing convolution is an iffy thing to do anyway because it involves a lot of subtracting two big numbers to get two little numbers and is apt to amplify high frequency noise.<p>It is different for voice applications:  a speech recognition system needs some kind of deconvolution to not be confused by the audio environment.')
