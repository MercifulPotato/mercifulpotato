Item(by='nicetryguy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608140886, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25437336, text='&gt; What I wanted to try and do was something akin to the Super FX chip used in titles such as Star Fox, where the SNES runs the game logic and hands off a scene description to a chip in the cartridge to generate the visuals.<p>Bruh. It&#x27;s in the third paragraph.<p>&gt; Of course many games shipped with mappers<p>No. You&#x27;re thinking of the NES. The SNES handled memory mapping natively. The SNES chips had specific calculation functions, or ended up being co-processors, or both.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s still a very cool hack but I was hoping for some ultra-optimized software-only SNES raytracer when I read the title.<p>Not even the SNES games in the 90s did 3d without an expansion chip. You can&#x27;t do any raytracing, or any 3d for that matter (without SEVERE compromises) with 3.5 Mhz.<p>If you read the article, the guy designed his own 3 core chip at 50Mhz... Yes it&#x27;s more powerful than any chip that was in an SNES, but, it&#x27;s not entirely period-incorrect.')
