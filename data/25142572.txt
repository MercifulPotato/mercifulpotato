Google Chrome is one of the products I love the most as a developer. The number of standards&#x2F;experimental features that are launched in Chrome boggles my mind. Microsoft Edge plays catch up, but Safari doesn&#x27;t even try. From date field to async&#x2F;wait to web payments, several HTML5 specifications can&#x27;t be rolled out easily because of Safari.<p>I am old enough to remember the last time that happened, IE killed Netscape and left web development in stalemate. Chrome changed that and continues to push it forward till this day. It also gave birth to V8 engine and Node.js. IMO, we owe open web to Google Chrome.')
