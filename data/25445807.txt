[...]<p>&gt;Q: Was Brendan Eich fired?<p>&gt;A: No, Brendan Eich resigned. Brendan himself said:<p>&gt;“I have decided to resign as CEO effective April 3rd, and leave Mozilla. Our mission is bigger than any one of us, and under the present circumstances, I cannot be an effective leader. I will be taking time before I decide what to do next.”<p>&gt;Brendan Eich also blogged on this topic.<p>&gt;Q: Was Brendan Eich asked to resign by the Board?<p>&gt;A: No. It was Brendan’s idea to resign, and in fact, once he submitted his resignation, Board members tried to get Brendan to stay at Mozilla in another C-level role.<p>Despite that irrefutable proof of Mozilla&#x27;s and Brendan&#x27;s own words that he resigned of his own free will, and the Board actually wanted him to stay, GamerGate followers love to spread conspiracy theories based on those false narratives, framing Brendan as a victim and martyr, instead of respecting the human rights of the people whose marriages Brendan donated his money to destroy.')
