This is such a hotly-anticipated release and people are craving escapism in 2020, and this game is going to provide that for so many people. That said, the level of aggression is intense and crosses the line.<p>Still, I feel sorry for the developers who were seriously in a Catch-22. They are (correctly, IMO) prioritising the right thing by focusing on quality over the short-term negativity from a very vocal group. I wish more companies would take this approach (or, in the case of Apple, rediscover this approach).')
