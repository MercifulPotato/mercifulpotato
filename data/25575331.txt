If at rest you&#x27;d burn ~2000 cal&#x2F;day, and you&#x27;re consuming ~2300 cal&#x2F;day, then exercising for one hour, three days a week can certainly make a difference.<p>Most people that are actually overweight though, have a much higher surplus in their caloric intake. Strenuous exercise like running over 10km isn&#x27;t possible for many of these folks... and even if it were, it certainly wouldn&#x27;t be possible <i>every day</i>.  Cutting out the 600cal breakfast sandwich in the morning or the 200cal soda every day at lunch will have a bigger impact for most folks and is a lot more feasible.')
