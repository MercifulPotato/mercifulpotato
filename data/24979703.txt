Item(by='ryanbrunner', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604412142, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24976341, text='&gt; If you&#x27;re one of the people believing monoliths are The Way, you&#x27;re making a bizarre bet, because there&#x27;s N potential pieces you can have to create a complex system, and you&#x27;re saying the most optimal is N == 1. What are the odds of that? Sometimes, maybe. But mostly N will be like 7 or something. Occasionally 1000. Occasionally 2. But usually 7. Or something.<p>&quot;Pieces&quot; is doing some heavy lifting here. You&#x27;re assuming that isolated parts of a system need to be seperately developed and deployed systems, which absolutely doesn&#x27;t need to be true. Seperate parts of a system can be modules, namespaces, libraries, or any number of different solutions to decouple code and create domain contexts and boundaries.<p>I&#x27;ve never met anyone who prefers to use monoliths that would also say &quot;just let everything call everything else, you don&#x27;t need any structure&quot;. That doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that that the only acceptable boundary is an HTTP interface.')
