I had a Spectrum at home with the microdrives and the Sinclair printer (silver paper, remmber that?). I used Apple 2s at school and taught with them at summer camp. I loved both machines and learned both 6502 and Z80 machine code thans to them. We also had the gorgeous BBC Micros with the Tube coprocessor and disk drives.<p>The Spectrum was never going to be a business PC - just the keyboard tells you that. Not even the rather nice QL had a poper business keyboard.')
