As a pro musician I experienced that. Wealthy people want to hang out with the band, and get access and &quot;rough it a bit&quot; sometimes. It does result in artists getting paid, but often it results in people buying expensive coffee while looking at art, buying a slighter nicer house near the artists...<p>It&#x27;s hard to describe but my anecdotal first hand experience includes plenty of rich tourists hanging around the emerging cultural hubs. I sincerely think the money goes into feeling cool rather than fueling the art economy, it&#x27;s the surrounding bars, restaurants and cafes (and property developers) that end up making the big money. As mentioned elsewhere - the artists end up gone, the soul of the place eventually goes, and they end up with those weird soulless expensive places that used to be poor and full of artists.')
