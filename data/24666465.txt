I tell my folks to get their work done and I expect them to schedule their own time because I trust them as professionals.  If they need to work between 6pm to 2am or 4am to 10am because that&#x27;s when they&#x27;re the most productive, or they&#x27;re dealing with something in life and they&#x27;re still getting the work done I trust them.  I feel folks get fully jaded because everyone sets up all this rigidity and there&#x27;s a huge lost of mutual trust and respect because of it.<p>Coming in twice an hour late and being ridiculed about it is ridiculous.  This is professional life, not some strict grade school.')
