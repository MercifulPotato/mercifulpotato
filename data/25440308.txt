That report failed to find evidence proving the theory, but instead simply found unknown things it couldn&#x27;t explain, which it pretended was evidence.<p>This is a common flaw in such forensics reports. When there&#x27;s evidence, it&#x27;s usually found and reported. When there&#x27;s no evidence, investigators keep looking. Todays devices are complex, so if you keep looking, you always find anomalies you can&#x27;t explain. There&#x27;s only two results from such investigations: proof of bad things or anomalies that suggest bad things. There&#x27;s never any proof that no bad things exist (at least, not in my experience).&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.erratasec.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;theres-no-evidence-saudis-hacked-jeff.html#.X9nFxy1Y5TY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.erratasec.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;01&#x2F;theres-no-evidence-saudis...</a>')
