They support the market even when there is nobody else on one side of the order book. When companies list on the NYSE, they are explicitly asking for a group of market makers to be able to naked short their shares as a stabiliser. Many longer-term investors, similarly, explicitly express preference for these protections.<p>Other markets, like dark pools, are completely counterparty to counterparty. Still others operate around dealers (who are similar to but distinct from specialists).<p>There is a lot of variation in and competition around market structure.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;ask&#x2F;answers&#x2F;128.asp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;ask&#x2F;answers&#x2F;128.asp</a>')
