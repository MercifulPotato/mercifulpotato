Further these theories imply that &quot;elites&quot; should maybe be purged which historically has been attempted to horrific outcomes (see the chinese cultural revolution or cambodia).  Perhaps I am being reactionary in that concern however.  Either way this article seems to over simplify the subject while also somewhat claiming that it explains more than it probably does.')
