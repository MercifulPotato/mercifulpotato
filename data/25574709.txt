Some may even forge proof should the CDC or WTO decide to issue papers. Would police need to check them in a dispute? I haven&#x27;t heard of a protocol, just a vague recommendation claiming we can start taking off our masks after herd immunity is achieved. (Which at 90% vaccination in the USA could take 2-3 years).<p>What aspects of &#x27;proof-of-X&#x27; from our programming world could we deploy (soon!) to combat this coming battle?')
