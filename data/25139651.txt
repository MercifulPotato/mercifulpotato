Item(by='walrus01', descendants=None, kids=[25140475, 25139753], score=None, time=1605720892, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25138906, text='&gt; I expect Apple to role out its own gaming console by 2nd or 3rd gen. There’s so much potential here. One of the most underrated Apple announcements in a very long time. I haven’t been this excited for Mac since they announced OS X!<p>I would be shocked if this happened, since Apple has no ecosystem of game developers whatsoever.<p>Both the newest xbox and the PS5 are for the most part backwards compatible with the massive base of xbox one and PS4 games, since they&#x27;re a shared x86_64 architecture.<p>Microsoft has the huge advantage that games can be developed for both windows and the xbox at the same time, with the same libraries. This goes all the way back to the origins of the first xbox which was nearly named the DirectX box.')
