Item(by='disown', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604102967, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24947741, text='&gt;  I&#x27;m sorry your chose to pursue this as a personal attack and with such intensity but, nevertheless, and for the sake of those reading this with less animosity, allow me to reply.<p>Don&#x27;t be sorry. Just stop hijacking threads for your vegan agenda.<p>&gt; It strikes me as fascinating how societies would evolve and behave when different species could have and exchange different narratives. This a something not new, that has been exploited more than once in science fiction, precisely because the diversity between humans is not enough (many would argue that there are not human races) or simply not enough to be a scenario for picturing vastly different realities, or a playground for a different role playing.<p>I really can&#x27;t make sense of what you are trying to say here. Did google translate mangle what you wrote?<p>&gt; I won&#x27;t reply to unfortunate comments about plants<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s hard to confront the horrors of mass plant torture isn&#x27;t it? All these innocent plants hopelessly stuck in the ground unable to run away or defend themselves.<p>&gt; By discuss, however, I mean tolerant and well-intentioned exchange of thought, not cheap attempts of mocking perspectives you don&#x27;t share.<p>What is cheap is turning a topic that has absolutely nothing to do with veganism into a vegan virtue signaling session. And I highly doubt you are interested in a &quot;tolerant&quot; and well-intentioned exchange of thought given the way you snuck toxic &quot;veganism&quot; into this thread. Your response made it absolutely clear that you aren&#x27;t here for a &quot;discussion&quot; like most virtue signaling militant vegans.')
