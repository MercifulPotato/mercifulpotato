Imagine if GNU binutils was more permissively licensed and as modular as clang? Then developing novel, non-GPL’d compiler infrastructure could depend on BFD - the boring part that working on won’t bring bonafide improvements to your new compiler. Another factor is that LLVM’s quality and ubiquity has reduced the monetary and technical upside to pursuing new opportunities in compiler development.')
