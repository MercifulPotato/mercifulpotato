Item(by='grardb', descendants=None, kids=[24920142], score=None, time=1603899520, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24919820, text='I&#x27;m not an expert baker, but when you type &quot;sourdough&quot; into Google images, 99.9% of the results you are getting are photos of bread made with refined (white) flour.<p>As far as I know, you are never going to get a big, airy crumb with 100% whole wheat bread. Based on the article, I believe the Emmer flour used is not refined. The bread will always be denser than when using refined flour, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it didn&#x27;t rise properly. I bake whole wheat bread (100%) exclusively at home, and the crumb looks exactly like Blackley&#x27;s.<p>Even if you type &quot;whole wheat sourdough&quot; into Google images, you&#x27;ll notice that virtually all of them are only half whole wheat.')
