Is it just a stylistic choice?<p>The second one doesn&#x27;t contain a static object that travels with the camera in the frame at all times, and the zooming in effect is still visually compelling, so it doesn&#x27;t seem necessary. But I really liked the constant ribbon in the first.<p>Also, who did the art for them? Was it a team effort or just a single person?<p>[EDIT] It looks like Arcadia also has a sort of ribbon effect, though it is more subtle than the single, same color ribbon in the original.')
