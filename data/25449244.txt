However, &quot;on the merits&quot; is a term of art that explicitly excludes procedural matters like &quot;can you even bring this case&quot; or &quot;did you file on time.&quot; Standing is a procedural issue.<p>So while the suit was thrown out for being obviously faulty, it did not fail &quot;on its merits.&quot; Mind you, that does not make the objection sensible. If I write &quot;they are bad because they are a poopy face&quot; in crayon, and then I don&#x27;t pay my filing fees and the case is thrown out for that reason, I am technically correct that my case was not heard on its merits, but that doesn&#x27;t make it a good point.')
