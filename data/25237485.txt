Well, i am a asylum seeker currently seeking asylum here in the United States. I came to the US through the border. Upon, arriving to the US, I enrolled in college currently doing my undergrad in computer information systems at Baruch College in NYC. I want to know whether or not my college degree can play a critical role in helping me with my green card process? Thank you')
