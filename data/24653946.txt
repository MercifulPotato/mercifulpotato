There are lots of different jobs in the chip industry.<p>1. Device engineer - want to build transistors?  Grab a physics&#x2F;chemistry masters and &#x2F;or PHD.  Go to work at a foundry house like TSMC, Samsung, Intel, SMIC or Global Foundries.<p>2. Analog circuit design - grab a masters in EE (w&#x2F; circuit design specialty).<p>3. Layout - the person who translates the analog circuit design into the physical drawing that ultimately gets turned into a photolithography maskset.  You can get an associates degree (maybe not even that much) at a local community college - learn the cadence&#x2F;mentor EDA tools.<p>4. Verification - learn verilog HDL and computer architecture.  A bachelors degree at a good Electrical Engineering program will get your foot in the door.<p>5. CPU design&#x2F;architects - masters&#x2F;phd in computer architectures.<p>6. Software - lots of different jobs here.  Firmware guys write low level boot-rom code.  Some guys focus on linux drivers and kernel porting to company xyz&#x27;s latest chip.  Some software guys focus on specific IP blocks of a chip like maybe working around bugs in the latest GPU IP integrated into an SOC like that used on the Raspberry Pi.<p>7. Test engineers - the guys that write test patterns to test a chip after it has been fabricated and packaged.  You could go software or hardware for these jobs.  Bachelor degree needed.<p>8. Packaging engineer - the people that design the packages that the bare silicon gets mounted to.  All kinds of folks in this field - physics, mechanical engineers, materials guys.  This is a fairly broad field.<p>9. Hardware engineer - designs the pcb&#x27;s that the chips get mounted too.  Your &quot;classic electrical engineering&quot; job IMO.  Bachelors in EE with a focus on electronics and circuit design.<p>In general you&#x27;ll need a degree from a decent engineering college to get your foot in the door.  Software generally doesn&#x27;t have this barrier.  Look for internships at chip companies.')
