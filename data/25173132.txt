Coming from React, the transition is relatively easy. I did learn some UIKit and AppKit and find it extremely verbose.<p>The thing is SwiftUI is not really ready for prime time. There&#x27;s a lot of bug and inconsistencies here and there. Things that work on iOS doesn&#x27;t work on MacOS. Vice versa.<p>Keyboard navigation and input focus sucks.<p>Minor update (like from iOS 13.1 to 13.2) could break some part of the app.<p>Also performance is not optimized. I have a slideshow that took at least 10% CPU on Mac all the time. That limitation makes me decides to use animation sparingly across the app.<p>But again, the productivity is no brainer.<p>Basically my iOS and macOS app lives in monorepo because there&#x27;s ~95% code sharing.')
