Child pornography. Explicitly soliciting accomplices for murder. Explicitly organizing plans for murder.<p>2) If lines in the sand have already been defined, why not redefine them if there is new information available in our society? Please answer me without a &quot;slippery slope&quot; argument. That is abstract and hypothetical. Let&#x27;s deal with concrete scenarios.')
