I recently got to try out a candy depositor with a temperature controlled hopper. The machine costs about $12000.<p>The machine consists of a base depositor that can be purchased on its own for about $2000-$3000. The heating elements consist of a few metal plates worth maybe a couple hundred dollars, a couple of off the shelf temperature controllers worth less than $100 each and some housing and circuitry for the controllers that&#x27;s can&#x27;t be worth more than $1000. Overall, I&#x27;d say the temperature controlled depositor has maybe about $7000 worth of parts in total, being generous.<p>That&#x27;s a decent markup for something comprised nearly entirely of off the shelf parts.')
