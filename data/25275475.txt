Coronaviruses have a specific mechanism of &quot;error correction&quot; in them which lowers the mutation rate, compared to most RNA viruses.<p>The &quot;selection pressures&quot; are also less likely in this case then most would estimate. We as humans are much more &quot;pressured&quot; by this virus in its current form than the virus by anything we&#x27;d do. The viruses themselves don&#x27;t even &quot;need&quot; to come &quot;around&quot; anything, and there are enough unknown viruses in the world which aren&#x27;t less potential threat than this one which understandably  got the spotlight.<p>It&#x27;s surely good to be aware of all the processes involved but the probabilities of different events and outcomes should also direct our responses.')
