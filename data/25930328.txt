In terms of the predatory publishers, my Indian institution had its own filters, and most labs have their own as well. For example, for a while we had an institutional restriction on submitting manuscripts to conference proceedings, with the justification that the hard time limit equals substandard peer review. In addition, for the longest time we were not allowed to submit anything to open source journals, with similar justifications. Publishing in a journal with an IF &lt; 8 was also frowned upon, and the institution would not cover publication expenses. AFAIK other institutions had similar filters for publications. I would regard my institution as a decent, but nowhere near the best in my field in India.<p>Who does publish in these predatory journals? Smaller, less well funded universities with desperate students, ever since the government mandated first author publications as a requirement for receiving PhD degrees.')
