At the time, I simply couldn&#x27;t get my mind around this, but: as far as Apple&#x27;s hackers were concerned, the Mac&#x27;s vaunted Graphical User Interface was an impediment, something to be circumvented before the little toaster even came out onto the market. &quot;<p>This is Unix revisionism. Most of the early development of the Macintosh is documented on folklore.org and they certainly didn&#x27;t rebuild Unix to fit on a Mac. They bootstrapped the Macintosh using the Lisa development environment, which itself was bootstrapped with Apple ][s. Unix was far too large and unwieldy for microcomputer hardware of the time, and Apple didn&#x27;t have a license for it anyway. There&#x27;s plenty of stories of early&#x2F;hobbyist Mac buyers realizing their $2k computer had no development tools, calling up Apple, and being told that they&#x27;d need to buy $10k Lisa machines if they wanted to do real app development. MPW didn&#x27;t come out until 2 years later.<p>(If you just wanted an easy-to-use development environment, Apple HAD worked on a GUI-capable BASIC for the Macintosh. But Bill Gates got wind of this and refused to renew their Apple ][ BASIC license unless they canned the project. Since no BASIC license meant no more Apple ][s, Apple caved, and the version of BASIC that Microsoft did ship on the Mac had no GUI support whatsoever. They would eventually ship Hypercard three years later, of course.)')
