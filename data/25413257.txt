The reason is the top most dangerous spots for a cyclist are 1) sitting at an intersection and 2) passing though an intersection. If I cross an intersection starting from non-zero momentum I can cross it in 2 seconds. If I start from zero it take more than 5. Now I&#x27;m not just going to go through an intersection without checking, but I&#x27;m going to slow down, check, and go, because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s safest for me. This is what I see the vast majority of people do. Now I&#x27;ve seen people not do that and just blast through, but I can&#x27;t count more than 5 in my entire life that have done that. You know what happens when you do fully come to a stop and the intersection is clear? Cars honk at you. Cars get <i>real</i> close. People yell about how you aren&#x27;t supposed to be on the road and threaten you. I&#x27;ll take my chances with the intersection, considering I&#x27;ve been chased by some of these people on more than one occasion.<p>This again comes back to the fact that cyclists are neither pedestrians nor motorized vehicles. It isn&#x27;t a surprise that they want to be treated like cyclists and not be in that binary classification. It is only hypocrisy if you use the wrong classifications. If you&#x27;re really trying to understand bike safety try riding in their shoes for a month or two. You&#x27;ll start to get it real fast.')
