They&#x27;re dismayed.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m that smart. Wouldn&#x27;t call myself a developer either. But I&#x27;m still kind of dismayed. I used to love macOS (or OS X to be precise), but the clock has been ticking for years now. Near every decision made about macOS future goes in the wrong direction (for me). Right now I&#x27;m looking at Manjaro. But still, I need the Adobe CC suite to get my work done, so I will have to use two machines. I hate running two computers. But that&#x27;s probably where I&#x27;ll end up.')
