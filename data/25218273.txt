When a team slacks off in migrating (usually we have months between receiving the first notification and service shutdown) things escalate and a director might get involved.<p>Anyway, this means that migrating to the new interface is clients&#x27; responsibility.<p>However there&#x27;s an exception: if the changes are trivial (like changing the the name of one of the API endpoints), we have an automated tool that basically performs this change across the whole codebase. These kinds of changes still need to be approved by the codebase owners and shouldn&#x27;t break any test, so they must be really trivial.\nIn this case is usually the team owning the API&#x2F;Service that performs that.')
