Being generous, I&#x27;d say he carefully walks a tightrope between &quot;ancient aliens&quot; and real history. My impression is he does the former for $$$ (e.g. he&#x27;s a co-author of &quot;Lost Secrets of the Gods: [..] Ancient Astronauts&quot; that makes extremely absurd claims to put it mildly), and as soon as he is critiqued by actual experts, he starts wildly walking back his claims or insist that he was misinterpreted or whatever to save face.')
