Good way to make sure you’re in the history books for all time<p>I think the advantage of that is if he did and fusion energy was a large portion of energy that powers the Super Charger Network it would amuse him enough to consider putting his considerable wealth to that end.<p>He really is like a real life Lex Luthor, and when the only way he can one-up his rivals would be to make them dependent on them at rate Royalties +15% (because he has dominant market share and be because he quite honestly &#x27;just could&#x27;) would be very befitting after having being out-done in the Space Industry. And the reality is that since Solar city is probably the only real <i>Musk Corp</i> he can actually displace, that&#x27;s where he&#x27;d probably get the most bang-for-his-buck and kick-start the &#x27;battle of futuristic futures&#x27; by the 2 richest people on Earth that we were supposed to have already.<p>Bezos also made lots of platitudes about how he wants to help make the entire Earth a Nature preserve: so in case you&#x27;re reading this (or iithe Saudi&#x27;s who have rootaccess to his new hacked his phone...) why the hell not, Jeff?')
