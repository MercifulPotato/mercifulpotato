You just don&#x27;t write idiomatic JS (or even TS) in Angular.<p>In templates is the biggest example - where you can use some JS constructs but not others, and have to learn a new set of directives instead of using if&#x2F;for&#x2F;while etc.<p>But also things like modules being an empty class that&#x27;s only there so you have somewhere to put your annotations.<p>Not to mention needing to bundle a compiler, unless you use AOC, and the debugging is a nightmare (or at least used to be, I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ve fixed it recently.) When your stacktrace is full of zone.js calls that are doing weird things because they monkey-patched Promise, you get the feeling that it&#x27;s <i>just not Javascript.</i><p>Some might say that JSX in React is similarly not JS. I respectfully disagree. The syntactic sugar is so light you could easily translate it yourself, by hand. Try doing that with Angular code!<p>And the trouble is that, as a new language that you have to learn, it is significantly inferior to JS&#x2F;TS. So yes, give me React any day, where I can use real Javascript and not have to feel like the framework is fighting the language it&#x27;s written in.')
