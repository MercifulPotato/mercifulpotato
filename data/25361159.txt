What we have instead are various manuscript copies and copies of those manuscripts, many of which are corrupted, partially destroyed, wrong, fake or has other textual issues. Excluding the fake ones (how do you know which are fake?) these manuscripts are corrupt, destroyed or wrong in different places. Some fragments are quotes from other manuscripts which in turn have the potential issues mentioned.<p>When preparing a critical edition, you basically collect all of these ancient manuscripts and try to figure out how they relate to each other, and based on what you know of the manuscript and the text you can relate them in a tree (imagine a git commit log with branches)... for example if manuscript B is copied from an earlier manuscript A. Then based on your skill and knowledge you use this limited information to try to figure out what the original manuscript said.<p>Apart from some old papyri, like the ones found at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Oxyrhynchus" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Oxyrhynchus</a>, for many authors the oldest surviving manuscripts are often from around the 10-12:th centuary. So if you read Homer or stuff like that, it&#x27;s been like 1700 years before the original and the oldest surviving manuscript used to base the critical editions used today. So who knows what was originally in the manuscript :-)<p>These critical editions are then what other scholars use when they translate these poems into English.<p>The fun part about reading the critical editions instead of translations is they show you what the textual issues are: often it&#x27;s not obvious and controversial what a particular word should be in the text, if there are many possibilities that are equally likely. The translations will have to pick one interpretation of the text and stick with it, to not make it overbearingly complicated for people to read the works.<p>Edit: Two more things<p>(1) The most common textual corruption are related to word anticipation when you copy a text by hand. So say you&#x27;re a 12:th centuary monk and you copy (by pen) a text, you will probably read a sentence, memorize it, and write it down in the copy you are working on. A common problem is if in a previous sentence you had to write down a word that is different but sounds like a word in the sentence you will now write: it&#x27;s easy to accidentally write down the old word again.<p>(2) More nefarious: There are many instances when copyists remove or alter text for political or religious reasons.')
