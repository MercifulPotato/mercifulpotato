You know it&#x27;s not really traditional in Physics to go back and read the original papers of the great people before us. I&#x27;ll confess I&#x27;ve never read Einstein&#x27;s original papers on Relativity even though I&#x27;ve written a textbook on Relativity.  In Physics the idea is it&#x27;s the ideas matter, not their original presentation.&quot;<p>&quot;Newton&#x27;s original presentation of this stuff in the Principia - number one, it was in Latin (laughs). It took a while for it to be translated into English and number two, he was apparently afraid of using all of the new mathematical techniques he invented. So he tried very hard to only use existing mathematical techniques so people would believe him, so people would accept it right away.<p>&quot;Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, who is a great 20th century astrophysicist, actually wrote a version of the Principia Mathematica for the common reader. If you ever want to know what Newton was actually up to in the in his great masterwork the Principia I would advise not buying either the original Latin or English but buying Chandrasekhar&#x27;s explanation of what was going on.&quot;<p>- Sean Carroll \nThe Biggest Ideas in The Universe pt 2 @15:55 (youtube)')
