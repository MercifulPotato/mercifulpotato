Renters have skin in the game, because they paid tax (and because they live in the general society that those tax dollars are being used on). That they paid no property tax is not relevant, because it ceases to become &quot;property tax&quot; as soon as it&#x27;s paid, and just enters a larger general pool.<p>People may have differing levels of skin in the game, but it&#x27;s no more sensible to say that property tax should only be spent on things property owners want than it is to say that property tax paid by people named Dave should only be spent on things that The Council of The Daves want it to be spent on.')
