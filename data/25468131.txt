So I assumed it always compiles to GPUs via XLA.<p>But, had a look in the code and jax has cublas and RoCm blas, and it looks like there is a flow where it uses the gpu directly, unless I&#x27;m missing something.<p>Definitely worth having a closer look. Autograd via function reflection should be faster than backprop. And if it&#x27;s running on AMD GPUs then it&#x27;s quite intriguing.')
