Do you think that a corporation with their market cap is not fully aware of these kinds of decisions that impact their sales?<p>This is the same company that removed the headphone jack for very cynical reasons, in order to increase the sale price of their phone by $150 (or however much the Airpods cost). The same company that repeatedly removed ports from the laptops in order to sell more dongles (so much so that there were running gags at the time about Apple, the dongle company). A company where the revenue from the sale of accessories for their devices could literally make a Fortune 1000 company (!!!).<p>They definitely knew what they were doing and chose to do the thing that most benefited their bottom line.<p>Let&#x27;s stop giving the benefit of the doubt to the top tech companies. They don&#x27;t deserve it like mom and pop stores.<p>Oblio&#x27;s Law: Never attribute to malice that which can be attributed to stupidity, unless the ones acting have an army of data scientists, researchers, market analysts and PR people at their disposal.')
