I think that incident was atrocious.<p>Your link says (about the Dec 31 email): &quot;Public health professionals could discern from this wording that there was a real possibility of human-to-human transmission of the disease. However, because at the time there were as yet no cases of the disease in Taiwan, we could not state directly and conclusively that there had been human-to-human transmission.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s no different to what China or the WHO were saying in this timeframe. The constant &quot;no confirmed human transmission&quot; were <i>because</i> everyone was watching for it.<p>Again, there is no evidence China hid anything here, and Taiwan doesn&#x27;t say anything different.')
