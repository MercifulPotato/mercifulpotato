Work&#x2F;home separation is important when you have children. My kids know when my door is shut, it means I&#x27;m &quot;not home.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve primarily worked at home for six years now, and it&#x27;s been an incredibly effective method for providing that needed separation.<p>When the door is open, or if I come out of my office, they know it&#x27;s a free-for-all for my attention, and I&#x27;ll often walk out to play with them from time to time to clear my head and&#x2F;or relieve some work-related stress.')
