Item(by='karjaluoto', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608311318, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25467864, text='<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blot.im" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blot.im</a> is a nice alternative. I played with it last spring and loved the immediacy of making an edit locally (in iAwriter) and seeing those changes made on the live blog within seconds.')
