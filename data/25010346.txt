It might seem obvious to you because your inner life is in alignment with what it is arguing. That being said, lots of people struggle to &quot;get&quot; Stoicism, because they grew up believing that happiness and worth reside in something they can&#x27;t fully control. For many people, it is not remotely obvious that your life is valuable if you&#x27;re not rich, or handsome, or successful.<p>It&#x27;s also important to understand that Stoicism is a serious, well-argued philosophy comprised of arguments that dialogue or disagree with rival philosophical schools, like Epicureanism or Aristotelian philosophy. It contains many arguments that I feel are decidedly not obvious:<p>* Virtue is the only good\n* Happiness resides in only what we fully control (our response to external circumstances), and not in things that are outside our control, or partially under the influences of things outside our control\n* Wisdom (the ability to exercise reason to make the wisest choices) is the most valuable faculty\n* We are fundamentally cosmopolitan, and see ourselves as part of a broadly human polis, instead of seeing ourselves as <i>only</i> Athenian, American, Indian, etc\n* We must act for the social good, even though we are not guaranteed success (i.e. Stoicism is NOT quietism; this particular claim puts Stoicism against the Epicureans)<p>In fact, many people would find the fundamental framing of Stoic ethics dubious. If you&#x27;re a deontologist, you&#x27;ll be irritated that Stoicism often doesn&#x27;t give an exact answer to a particular ethical question -- it instead emphasizes crafting a good character, and deducing the right response from what a good person would do, given the circumstances. Surely you&#x27;d want an exact answer that obtains in all situations -- none of this wishy washy virtue ethics stuff.')
