The smell actually made many of my female classmates cringe&#x2F;move away when I sat in front of them. I had no idea about how they felt.<p>After that spray was over (a few months later), I decided to switch to Playboy (which was cheaper at the time), mostly because I liked its smell. It had the added bonus of being tolerable too. A few days later, my teacher bought the same Axe deo that I had, and that&#x27;s when I realized that that deo would literally mix with sweat to give off this wafting smell, as though you were a raving alcoholic. The smell was unbearable to say the least, and would literally make me choke. Thankfully someone had the nuts to convey that to the teacher and he switched deos.')
