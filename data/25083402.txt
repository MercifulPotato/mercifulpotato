Item(by='throwaway409', descendants=2, kids=[25083578, 25083581], score=2, time=1605282242, title='Ask HN: Our new engineering leader apologized for being a white man', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='A new executive joined the engineering team at my company. He&#x27;s a white man. In an engineering meeting to our team, they made it clear that they were committed to diversity, and then apologized for being a white man and not &quot;helping out in that respect.&quot;<p>Part of me wants to shrug it off as a flippant personal opinion. But, as an engineering leader, this person plays a significant role in setting the tone for the engineering culture, and normalizes certain expectations. So the other part of me finds it alarming that a leader is normalizing the expectation of being apologetic for existing at the company with an &quot;undesirable&quot; identity. Nobody should have to apologize for their gender nor their skin color.<p>Am I way off base with this? We have yet to have a 1-on-1, and my opinion about this person&#x27;s behavior is starting to fester to the point where I feel like I have to bring it up. But if I do, how do I do it tactfully? I have a feeling that my position can and will be strawmanned as &quot;oh look, a white man who is upset about losing power.&quot; I just don&#x27;t want the expectation of having to apologize for my immutable characteristics.<p>Help!')
