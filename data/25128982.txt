Majority sometimes disrespect freedom of speech using bullying innocent comments advocating respect for a  freedom which we observe recently even here in form of downvoting and it also have no justification what so ever.<p>&gt;otherwise they donâ€™t know how to improve the product.\nthey should ask and pay for participation if they wish to know, or they simply don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s ok.<p>If I wasn&#x27;t asked about it I consider it a spyware activity and we have no idea what they do with this information now or in the future.<p>R.
