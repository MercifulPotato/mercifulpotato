We have an excellent idea of what the Anglo Saxon language would have sounded like, in part because it has close living relatives.  Anglo Saxon and Old Norse were mutually intelligible. Conveniently, Iceland was settled by the Norsemen in the 9th century.  Its geographic isolation contributed heavily to the Icelandic language&#x27;s slow rate of change -- to the extent that if you can read modern Icelandic, you can read the Norse Sagas from the 12th century in their original!  This property of languages whose speakers are physically isolated being extremely conservative is well known to linguists via study of many, many languages. We also have other works written in the Anglo Saxon language, most notably translations of the Bible.  This reasonably large textual corpus, combined with a very close, and very conservative, living linguistic relative  allows us to have a very good idea of the phonetics of Anglo Saxon.<p>Saxon poetry does not rhyme in the sense that modern English poetry does.  It relies primarily on alliteration and meter, along with initial and approximate rhyme.  Were you to listen to it, a recitation of Beowulf would sound more like a chant than a poem.<p>Saxon poetry also relies heavily on a form of metaphor called a &quot;kenning,&quot; in which usually two words, but, sometimes 3 or more, are combined in a non-literal way to replace another word.  An example would be to describe a ship as &quot;s√¶wudu,&quot; or &quot;sea wood.&quot;  Note the phonetic resemblance to modern English, after you take into account the vowel shifts that happened during the middle English period.<p>If you want to hear it, you can listen to the first few lines here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CH-_GwoO4xI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CH-_GwoO4xI</a><p>While I don&#x27;t doubt that Saxon poetry could be incredibly boring if you didn&#x27;t have the proper introduction, I might suggest that, if you didn&#x27;t, you go back and study its structure before beginning to read the works themselves.')
