Generally the customer that gives you the most hassle on front end and is the cheapest will demand the most and hassle you the most for the entire period.<p>This argument reminds me of someone who I once tried to work with, I said, I&#x27;ll just charge you my costs instead of full rate (this is like a 3x difference in price). So many arguments around cost, so many demands on quick delivery.
