We do not have a good theoretical explanation for why this behavior prevails.<p>which seems to me like standard confirmation bias.<p>When writing a test or updating code, you clearly assume you got it right. So a passing test “confirms” that.<p>Personally, I find myself quite susceptible to this bias when <i>updating</i> code (i.e., when I haven’t broken any tests,  I assume I updated my code correctly) but I’m much more cautious when writing new tests. I usually prefer to write a failing test, and get it to pass, to mitigate some of that bias (but fully admit that once it turns green, I’m overly confident at the “clearly correct” nature of the output).')
