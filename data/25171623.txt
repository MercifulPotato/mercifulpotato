Worst case scenario I leave. Best case scenario I become totally disinvested in the project&#x2F;company because I can&#x27;t work anyway so why care about anything? Take the salary and do as little as possible, bet every project is de facto late anyway.<p>By the way, what happens when the manager is away for a day or on holiday? Nobody can deploy anything?')
