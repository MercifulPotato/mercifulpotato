They knew what the thresholds were, could barely meet them, it had no business objective there.<p>Foxconn didn&#x27;t win from this and so the narrative should be about states making more careful deals for payouts with companies.<p>Even good companies make stupid ventures here and there - the bigger the company, the more inane it looks. The huge problem here of course is the public dime. The Governor should be destroyed over this.')
