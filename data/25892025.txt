Even when I was poor and my home office was my bedroom shared with my wife, that sure beat the interruption farms of big tech office buildings. Nowadays I have a private room where I can keep it quieter than a library or blast music on speakers that beat any headphones and I&#x27;ve got a nicer monitor setup and chair than any company would&#x27;ve given me too. Of course I like commuting to a shared office space for certain kinds of meetings, but most interactions are fine over chat or video call. Needing to be in person is by far the exceptional day, not the rule. I&#x27;ve been cheering the slow normalization of remote work over the past decade and the way the pandemic tipped it over the edge has been a big silver lining to me.')
