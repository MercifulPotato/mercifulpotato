There wasn&#x27;t really any evidence for either idea but the Russia conspiracy ate the Democrats - if anything, far worse than QAnon has eaten the Republicans. Indeed given the demographics of HN I&#x27;m guessing someone will reply to this post and claim that &quot;The 2016 election was rigged by the Russians&quot; or &quot;Russians controlled Trump&quot; etc was all totally true and not a bizarre conspiracy theory at all. The descent of US political parties into fantastical theorising is a general trend.')
