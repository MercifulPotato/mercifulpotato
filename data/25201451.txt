However, tension headaches and caffeine are strongly correlated.<p>I don&#x27;t drink much in the way of caffeine.  When I drink coffee I drink decaf.  I also drink decaf tea sometimes.  I also drink irregularly.  I&#x27;ll go a week or two without any decaf or anything and then another week drinking six cups a day.')
