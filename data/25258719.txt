Every month, the IRS website has no update on our status. We filed our taxes early and even got our tax refunds <i>before</i> the normal April 15th deadline. They clearly have our information and our accountant confirmed that we 100% qualify. It’s very frustrating to hear this when we (and many others) haven’t received anything. Especially since that extra money could have helped relieve a lot of stress when I was job hunting because of COVID layoffs.')
