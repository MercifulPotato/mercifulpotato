India will require several decades of further development yet to attempt a human Moon landing (much less Mars). Russia (nor the USSR before it) can&#x27;t come close to doing it and they&#x27;re still far more advanced than India in human launch capabilities.<p>There are simple things (relatively speaking) you can slash the cost out of dramatically, where it doesn&#x27;t translate to a far more advanced and difficult mission, and that includes landing humans on the Moon or Mars safely.<p>NASA can do cheaper missions. There is nothing particularly special about that for such advanced organizations. NASA spends a lot of money because time (getting a mission right the first time) and scarce human resources are both more important to them than sheer dollar cost in most circumstances, unless we&#x27;re talking enormous sums of money. They could have attempted James Webb in a much faster timeline at a far cheaper cost, by increasing the risk of failure in the mission; that trade-off is almost always undesirable for NASA.<p>Simply put, a few hundred million dollars is a very big deal to ISRO, it&#x27;s not a big deal to NASA. If spending $1 billion on a mission gets you down to 5% risk, or you can spend $100 million at 30% risk of failure, NASA will almost always choose the $1b option because there are not enough human resources to throw at numerous copycat missions and the time cost is immense.')
