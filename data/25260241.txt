Item(by='conductr', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606777872, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25259688, text='&gt; Austin TX and surrounding communities are seeing huge growth with, anecdotally, a disproportionate number of Californians<p>Most of Texas has been dealing with CA transplants since last housing crisis, or before, so 12+ years now. Austin area in particular is where the liberals usually land. And they tend to be very liberal even by traditional Austin standards and especially by Texas standards in general. Some of the recent things in Austin, particularly around tolerance of homeless, are not popular with Texans. We are generous people but not to the level of letting homeless sleep in our suburban yards. We&#x27;re told we&#x27;re not compassionate. But we feel these people are mostly, homeless by choice. If you take the time to watch them, it&#x27;s a lifestyle for a high percentage and yes there are some who did not chose it due to drugs, PTSD, etc, and we&#x27;d support getting those people help, housing, food, etc. But not putting up tents and port-a-potties for them at the underpass. [1]<p>I just came back from Austin. I haven&#x27;t lived there since 2007&#x2F;8. Homeless there has always been a problem. As it is in almost any liberal US city. The last few years, it&#x27;s gotten so much worse and letting it bleed into the suburbs makes no sense IMO. The local leaders are enabling thus inviting more homeless, etc. as happens in almost any liberal US city.<p>[1] As an example of something no Texan understands. My aunt told me, a lady on her Nextdoor ostracized the neighborhood for giving the homeless things they didn&#x27;t need. Like food when they had food. Or food they did not like. So, she met with and created an Amazon Wish List for each person living under&#x2F;near a nearby bridge freeway intersection. When my aunt clicked on it out of curiosity, it was mostly gift cards, phone minutes, electronics, etc. In my mind, things that are easily converted to cash.')
