Mainly, meaningless exception messages and insane stack traces and poor tooling within my editor of choice (at the time).<p>Also, I take issue with a language that touts itself as purely functional, but then builds itself off of the JVM, forcing you to use objects under the hood.  You end up with some kind of weird FP&#x2F;OO Frankenstein&#x27;s monster that isn&#x27;t _really_ FP, but also isn&#x27;t _really_ OO.  Also, since it is on the JVM, there is _no way_ you can actually have truly immutable objects or data structures, as much as Clojure likes to think that is the case.  It places a lot of trust on the libraries that make up your program not to go into reflection and do some really annoying mutations.<p>If that is the case, I&#x27;d rather just use something like Erlang or Haskell which are _truly_ functional languages, not just an OO system masquerading as a functional language.<p>I _really_ like the syntax of lisp, and Clojure provides some really good extensions of that syntax with the way they do parameters, but in the end I just couldn&#x27;t get over the issues I had with the core of the language runtime.')
