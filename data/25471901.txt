Video gamers have always pushed for better-and-better.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with being excited for these new features. It probably sucks to reprogram these engines every few years to take advantage of these features... but that&#x27;s a job lol.<p>There are plenty of video-game developers who don&#x27;t care much about the latest-and-greatest graphics. Instead, they build a &quot;retro&quot; look and try to compete on gameplay alone. That&#x27;s also good and fine (and I usually tend to buy these games instead).<p>But I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with someone out there being excited for say... Minecraft Raytracing. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-_4QaWbntUQ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-_4QaWbntUQ</a><p>-----------<p>I mean, they&#x27;re games. They&#x27;re supposed to innovate and excite us in new ways. They&#x27;re entertainment. Some developers choose the graphical route, others choose gameplay. Nothing wrong with that.')
