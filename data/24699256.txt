I probably made 10 mistakes. Very nice interface.<p>My only thought was - if I suck at typing, learning it, it&#x27;s going to be very discouraging getting through just one page. I wonder if it would be better to display just a paragraph at a time. Also as the user finishes a sentence without mistakes to give them a visual reward (kinda like one of those cheap mobile games that shows stars or something). And another reward for finishing a paragraph.<p>Other than that, I am guessing this will likely help a lot of people learn to type or type faster.')
