The threat of violence or incarceration (maybe one you are equating with government intervention) is one of them.<p>But there are plenty of others: chemical addictions (e.g. cigarettes), systems that prey on the susceptibility of our dopamine-reward pathways (like slot machines, or your perhaps your facebook feed), etc.<p>Good policies in a free market economy are ones that make it more difficult to disrupt the beneficial aspects of a free market. I&#x27;d say good policy-making actually increases the free market-ness of markets in a messy, imperfect world.')
