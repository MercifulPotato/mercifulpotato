Without past experiences to tune it, intuition is useless.<p>We&#x27;re in uncharted territory now. Our ideals and principles of speech and communication weren&#x27;t created in times when you could reach millions from your home, or manufacture opinion, or create alternative narratives. So those principles don&#x27;t necessarily apply to current times.<p>Insisting in the old views will get us the same result as those battles where soldiers would march following the old ways in perfect classical formation against the first automatic weapons. And I don&#x27;t want to be shredded.')
