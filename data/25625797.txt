It&#x27;s really not possible to make an open-ended high bandwidth low latency interface to a huge chunk of FPGA silicon part of the regular CPU core&#x27;s tightly-optimized pipeline, without drastically slowing down that CPU. The sane way to use an FPGA is as a coprocessor, not grafted onto the processor core itself. Then, you&#x27;re interacting with the FPGA through interfaces like memory-mapped IO whether it&#x27;s on-die, on-package, or on an add-in card.')
