Either via local govts like the U.S. rolling this out, or through crypto-currency, if they solve adoption, ease of use, inflation, identity, and sybil attacks-BIG IF.<p>It&#x27;d be nice if you could for instance use notaries to tie your SSN to a coin wallet, then have a way to regain lost keys&#x2F;passwords, and if they had some fraud protection (ability to rollback transactions without fees), or insurance at the least.<p>The government I think has too many special interests, but syndicalists&#x2F;unionists working in tandem across country-lines could create a global currency without govt control.<p>I&#x27;ve thought a lot about this, researching different technologies on bitcoin. I&#x27;m no expert in crypto by far, but what I envision would be hard - with current chains being built as far as I can tell.<p>Maybe in 5-10 years though.')
