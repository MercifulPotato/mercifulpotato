Stern (1937):<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;technologicaltre1937unitrich&#x2F;page&#x2F;39" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.org&#x2F;details&#x2F;technologicaltre1937unitrich&#x2F;pag...</a><p>Markdown: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;raw&#x2F;Bapu75is" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;raw&#x2F;Bapu75is</a><p>One of the research assistants assisting in literature searches applied concepts from the piece to his own writing.  His name was Isaac Asimov.<p>A key element is that much of the reward of market-property based systems comes <i>not</i> from increased productive capacity but by asset inflation and cost externalisation.<p>On other factors putting brakes on adoption of technology:<p>1.  Negative externalities.  Flying cars carry noise, safety, and complexity costs, many not borne by the owner, operator, user, or beneficiary.<p>2.  Conflicting constraints.  Ground and air craft have different requirements, and the compromises between them make for designs which are far from optimal to either task.<p>3.  Transportation addresses the problem of movement through space ... which is one that can be addressed through other means:  increased density, more sensible land use, telecommunications, improved delivery and logistics.<p>4. All innovations and technologies combine intended and unintended effects, apparent and covert consequences, and immediate and latent impacts.  With time, unintended covert long-term impacts become more apparent, and are most often negative.<p>5. Complexity costs, a&#x2F;k&#x2F;a technical debt, are unintended, covert, latent, and negative.<p>6. With increased complexities, risks tend toward systemic, global, and catastrophic.  Technological societies are complex.<p>7. Mature political systems tend away from executive power --- the capacity to get things done or make them happen --- and toward <i>veto power</i> --- the capacity to <i>prevent</i> progress.  It&#x27;s interesting to note that widespread ground-transport expansion, most especially railroads, has most often occurred either in newly-industrialised nations, or those recently disrupted by major warfare.  High-speed rail in particular emerged in postwar Japan France, and Germany, as well as industrialising China.  It has lagged or failed utterly in the UK and US, where wealthy landowners can exert veto power.  High land values are the natural enemy of transportation megaprojects.<p>8. Risk in technically-complex projects can be divided into technical and human-factors risks.  As technical risks are more completely addressed, the residual risk is dominated by human factors, which are by definition not technically addressable.')
