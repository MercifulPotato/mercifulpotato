Item(by='roenxi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605419286, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25098270, text='&gt;  The stock market has grown significantly while demand for energy has widely declined in the last five months. Every energy long bet has been a disaster.<p>The stock market isn&#x27;t backward looking, or even short term future looking. Note that someone only watching the S&amp;P 500 would know that the coronavirus broke out in early March but probably think the situation had been completely resolved by August. We can&#x27;t be sure what the stock market thinks it is seeing (or if it is right for that matter).<p>And if energy bets didn&#x27;t turn out well, notice that that correlates to the US losing its position as the world&#x27;s largest economy. China invested a bunch in energy and now have a noticeably bigger economy [0].<p>&gt; Economic growth may not be able to continue indefinitely, it’s inconclusive, your computers can create more economic value with declining watts even if you can’t.<p>This growth isn&#x27;t going to involve more people because they need food and isn&#x27;t going to involve more stuff because that needs energy. It&#x27;ll be a very abstract form of growth.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)</a>')
