I&#x27;ve been a real Amazon critic for a lot of the typical reasons, so I&#x27;ve tended to buy elsewhere if possible, although I would still occasionally buy from Amazon for a great price or whatever.<p>This morning I checked in on 3 outstanding orders I made over a week ago with 3 separate merchants, none of which appear to have shipped.  I&#x27;m guessing they&#x27;re in this quagmire.  But I keep seeing Amazon deliveries (Christmas presents from the in-laws) arrive on time.<p>At this point, if there was something I needed soon, I&#x27;d probably hold my nose and use Amazon for it.  The monster knows how to deliver.')
