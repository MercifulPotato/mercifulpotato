The v3 version doesn&#x27;t work as my terminal doesn&#x27;t support images.<p>On my Windows box it actually does work surprisingly well with the official curl binary and the graph looks great but the weather emoji mess up alignment towards the end.<p>I think these kinds of inconsistencies are the reason something like the way brow.sh does it makes more sense, if it&#x27;s not plain text the only reliable way to represent it is via colored fixed width block characters as terminal UIs have been relying on those for ages so they are more widely supported.')
