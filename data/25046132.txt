Studies (Gompers, et. al. (2009)) indicate that a second time entrepreneur has a 30% chance of success versus a 20% for a first time one. So there&#x27;s some skill in it but it mostly comes down to luck.<p>edit: And if you&#x27;re arguing skill then clearly the skill of the early employees matter tremendously and not just the skill of the founder. So why do you think it&#x27;s wrong for those employees to get more stake?')
