You open an issue, and a pull request. The intern fails to see what the problem even is and closes the pull request <i>and</i> the issue telling you they don&#x27;t see a problem. In other instances, pull requests would sit there for months for use cases that are no-brainers.<p>We made the decision not to contribute to that project and not to maintain a fork. Instead, we developed plugins that are independent so we do not depend on pull requests being accepted, nor have to keep the fork in sync.')
