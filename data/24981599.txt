By aggregating data from tools like Datadog and Okta, we help teams understand their architecture at a glance – everything from ownership to runbooks. Using this data, we enable engineers to build report cards that score services against initiatives and service quality standards, helping teams build high quality software and instill a culture of quality. The tools teams use today (excel sheets and confluence) are cumbersome and rudimentary - we’re on a mission to create a new category of engineering tooling, to solve the organizational complexity of microservices')
