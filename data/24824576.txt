What you are referring to is reinforcing a problem a cultural and organizational issue, which left unkept will make progress stagnate in the long run.<p>But in a high quality codebase armed with proper peer-reviews this divergence of name and implementation won’t be tolerated and if such divergence exists it should be considered a bug not the expected state of things, such a defect should be resolved when found instead of making it the norm that you can’t trust the code base.<p>What if we couldn’t trust that parts in our cars and heavy machinery does what they say, I wouldn’t want to tear down the engine every time I’m about to use a car just to make sure there’s actually an engine inside and it’s not a fridge compressor due to implementation diverging over generations. This is of course an extreme example but what I’m saying is that we should allow our code to decline into such a state to begin with.')
