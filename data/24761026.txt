Smaller lighter functionality akin more to scripts rather than full applications, with more billing and scaling flexibility, and typically leveraging other cloud services to get things done.<p>Another big reason it&#x27;s stalled is because PaaS has rapidly improved and now deploying a Docker container running whatever you want is just as fast and easy. No need for all the vendor lock-in, frameworks, complex environments and everything else when you can just package up a typical webapp and run it anywhere, even with the same billing (like GCP Cloud Run). In return you get a much better dev environment with all the existing tooling and best practices.')
