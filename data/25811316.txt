It depends what you do with the money you save. Are they being frugal to make targeted investments in the things that have a good pay off or are they frugal in ways that prevents them from even taking advantage of opportunities.<p>By way of analogy, consider a household that is really frugal and doesn&#x27;t spend most of the money the could spend. If that is part of a goal to put their kids through college with no debt, save up to buy a business, pay off debt, etc. then there is a plan. If they are just stuffing money away into a mattress it isn&#x27;t quite the same.')
