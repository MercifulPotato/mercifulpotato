After ~5 years max, these will be unusable.<p>I purchased the regular AirPods and this point was reached even sooner, after ~2 years of heavy usage they don&#x27;t work longer than 15 minutes.<p>With almost all other wireless over-ear headphones you can at least keep using them passively with a headphone jack when the battery inevitably degrades. Some even have user-replaceable batteries. I have been using old AKG headphones for &gt; 15 years.<p>Yet another throw-away product from a self-proclaimed environmentally friendly company.')
