Item(by='grishka', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609269624, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25569996, text='8 years later, Apple Maps still doesn&#x27;t show buildings in Russia, even in largest cities. So it&#x27;s essentially useless for actual navigation. It&#x27;s okay-ish when all you want is to see a point on a map in a city you know, and that&#x27;s about it. Out of other companies, Yandex and Google have by far more detailed maps.<p>This leaves me with one question â€” why does Apple reinvent it anyway? Why can&#x27;t they just use ridiculously detailed OpenStreetMap data (with appropriate attribution) and call it a day?')
