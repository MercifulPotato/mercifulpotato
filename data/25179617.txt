In particular older grad students who support other people and can&#x27;t afford to live on a grad student stipend (which is a starvation wage for one, let alone more) and therefore must work a job while in grad school do not get any stipend, they pay their way. Which is of course a much easier arrangement for the student to manage if they have a trust fund or wealthy family to dip into (speaking to the article at hand)')
