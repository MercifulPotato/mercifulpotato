There are certain finiticky things when setting up, and it doesn&#x27;t have the immense MacOS polish, but I would say it&#x27;s 80-90% of the way there to a good, intuitive dev machine that gives you a very similar experience to a Mac programming setup.<p>Note, I&#x27;m referring to a desktop setup, no idea about how it works with laptop hardware and I have a MBP for my portable needs.')
