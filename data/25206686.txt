Things with flexible keyboards, maybe still 768p screens, a large HDD plus possibly a small SSD, 8 GB RAM, i3 or i5, a couple of USB ports, one HDMI. That&#x27;s all they need.<p>If I have to explain them why my laptop costs plus than 1000 more than that I only tell them that it&#x27;s for work, every day all the time.')
