The 15% for small businesses is a start but it&#x27;s still not always fair. At the same time, I think the arguments Epic gives for example are bullshit. I rather give 30% of the money Epic takes for basically selling digital nothing to millions of teens to Apple. At least Apple is doing something with that money, maintaining the App Store, providing and developing tools like XCode and Swift. Also for me it makes a difference that Apple is a publicly traded company, Epic is not. But off topic here, the very closed nature of the App Store is a benefit in terms of security, especially for users that don&#x27;t know much about technology or don&#x27;t care to care about their security. Having several app stores would water down the whole iOS ecosystem and has actually the potential to hurt the business of many app based companies. Yes, the App Store can be strict at times and quite of few of its restrictive policies need changing. But it does force you to make good stable apps. And it puts your apps right next to every other app in that category, instead of having to care about n different ways of how to distribute your apps. It&#x27;s only the one, and there you got to get it right. Having more app stores won&#x27;t really increase your audience either, at the end it&#x27;s still gonna be the same customers, but a lot more maintenance. So I think if Apple would change its pricing model, the App Store review process, and lift some of the more stricter limitations, which I think it has to in the next year and a half, then the App Store will be a great way to get you apps out there. But that&#x27;s my opinion from a personal point of view.')
