Item(by='jessaustin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611908271, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25955075, text='TFA is linked at the top of this page; please assume we can all read it. There is <i>one</i> reference to airlines, which reference includes several links to financial sources documenting (uncontroversially, one would like to assume) that they are harmed by massive drops in demand for air travel while they benefit from the receipt of hundreds of millions of dollars from the government. Taibbi takes Sorkin&#x27;s comparison of GameStop and Delta seriously, and invites attentive readers to ask themselves how different one firm facing reduced demand is from some other firm facing reduced demand.<p>Regurgitating a press release is not &quot;actual reporting&quot;. We won&#x27;t know what actually happened between RH and Citadel for some time, if ever. It&#x27;s misleading to keep mentioning this in this context, because TFA doesn&#x27;t address Citadel at all.<p>ISTR you have described RH as &quot;a force for evil&quot;. I didn&#x27;t disagree with you, but it&#x27;s disappointing that your famous animus for one of the rare decent journalists in USA has preempted that judgment. Every time Taibbi is linked on HN you&#x27;re around to slag him. You seem more opposed to Taibbi than you are to DNSSEC. When you read Taibbi you imagine things that are not in the text. What did he ever do to you? Did he cut you off in traffic? Did he steal your dog? What gives?')
