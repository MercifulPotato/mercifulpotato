Sometimes because they understand the domain well enough to understand the impact on function and benefit from the “artifact” and don&#x27;t need someone else spinning a narrative about benefit for them, sometimes because the “artifact” itself is a status&#x2F;aspirational item for them.<p>The actual lesson of “sell the benefits, not the features” is not “people care about results not artifacts”, but that motivating action in others who aren&#x27;t inherently motivated to that action without effort on your part requires understanding their individual interests and providing a narrative connecting the action you desire with their interests. It is not a lesson about what people care about, but about what you need to do to get what you want once you understand what they care about.')
