I live in Georgia, and our winters are fairly mild compared to northern states.</i><p>I grew up in the South and live in the Pacific Northwest now. I think you see a lot less outdoor dining in the South not because of the winters but because of the summers. It&#x27;s so hot that eating outside is miserable half the year, so restaurants aren&#x27;t physically designed for outdoor dining during the couple of spring and fall months when it would be nice.')
