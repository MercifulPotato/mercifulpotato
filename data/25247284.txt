It quickly became a huge thing, and a kind of mini social network of stuff happening on campus. As they used Snapchat APIs directly for this they were quickly banned, though. It took years before Snapchat added similar features, but for me those felt DoA and no one uses them. Sad when innovation is quenched. Instead they went on to make their own app, Gobi or something.')
