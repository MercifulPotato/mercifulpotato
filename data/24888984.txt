For a technical audience, they are amazingly unaware of &quot;Systems Thinking&quot;. Saying &quot;MEH, there are other pollinators&quot; is lazy thinking. Our ecosystem is a vast web of interconnections. You cannot predict how one HUGELY important species being destroyed will affect the rest of our ecosystem.<p>Furthermore: People use honey bees for honey ( duh ). But they are more useful than just that: people drive honey bee colonies around to crops in order to pollinate them. If we don&#x27;t have honey bees, we do not have crops.<p>There is no mystical &quot;other pollinator&quot; that is going to fill the niche of the honey bee. Honey bees are uniquely industrialized and failure to eliminate the Murder Hornet threat to honey bees will have HUGE implications.<p>What are you proposing exactly? We stand back and lose all of our biodiversity because we have to pay a few conservationists 1&#x2F;5 of a mediocre SAAS CEO&#x27;s salary? Give me a break.<p>Humanity does not stand on its own, we still need nature to sustain ourselves. &quot;When the last tree has been cut down, the last fish caught, the last river poisoned, only then will we realize that one cannot eat money.&quot;<p>And outside of economic and survival concerns: Nature is IRREPLACEABLE. Once it is dead it is dead forever. How could you honestly take this position? What do you find valuable? What do you find beautiful? What do you live for?')
