As I said before, educators need assessments <i>anyways</i>.  We have a fair amount of effort that graded assessments from educators predict future performance better than these third-party assessments, too (of course, the best predictor is both together-- e.g. SAT plus grades).<p>&gt; Under this structure, it would be possible for cheaters to mess up the teacher&#x27;s assessment of their proficiency, and by extension the overall proficiency of a group of students. But it is strange to assume that they would do this, because -- I asked this above -- what benefit would they derive from doing this? If this action had any effect, that effect would be to move the curriculum onward from material they don&#x27;t understand to material they understand even less. That is a harm to the cheater. The problem just doesn&#x27;t arise.<p>No one looks at middle school students&#x27; grades except the students and their parents-- well, and for eligibility for participation in athletics.  Still, there&#x27;s rampant efforts to cheat, with the negative outcomes I described above.<p>You&#x27;re attributing a whole lot of foresight to a short term selfish decision.  Yes, cheating may eventually bite you, putting you into a class you&#x27;re unprepared for.  But it provides a lot of short term apparent benefit, so...')
