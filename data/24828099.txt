My spouse has a chronic condition and her family is almost useless, and my family is worse than useless. Luckily we have each other and I have very flexible work conditions. She&#x27;s also found Facebook groups for people with the condition. (She&#x27;d really love to get off of Facebook, but it&#x27;s the only place people with her condition meet online.)<p>I&#x27;ll share a bit of advice she got from the groups she reads online: &quot;Prioritize your well-being over explaining yourself to people who don&#x27;t care about your well-being.&quot; It&#x27;s understandable that not everyone has heard of or knows the details of some of these rare conditions. It&#x27;s crazy how some people (even close friends) will react when you explain the reality of your situation to them. Don&#x27;t put up with it. Just move on.')
