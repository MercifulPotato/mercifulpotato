I&#x27;m becoming jaded as well.<p>My most hated thing about the industry:  the amount of people who do not give a shit.<p>These people try to do the least amount of work possible. They actively try to stretch a day&#x27;s worth of work into a month. They do not want to learn anything, even on the company&#x27;s dime. They have zero passion and pride. Often they are vicious; they will act so kind and diplomatic but they are sneaky snakes that will take credit and control communication. They would shoot their own mother to look good (apologies for the morbid exaggeration). I know that this might be common elsewhere but I feel like our industry has seen such demand, and 90% of that demand was filled with awful people. The poor visibility of actual work done allows these people to continue feeding of the flesh of true, honest, hardworking devs. I&#x27;ve been eaten alive once too many and I&#x27;m sick of it.')
