I just took over a project that has a serverless architecture.<p>We can&#x27;t run it locally because the emulator won&#x27;t run 7&#x2F;10 of the code, there are memory limit errors that are totally opaque to us since we can&#x27;t step through and watch it break.  We are getting unexplained timing issues that were being worked on via logs in dev.  The costs are insane.<p>If we want to say serverless is the future, the future isn&#x27;t here yet.  There are many tools that would need to be built to make serverless viable, and the tools that are built are immature and bad.  Not to mention, you&#x27;re tied to the companies support, so Google was outdated from the LTS for Node for a while.  The reality is going serverless means you don&#x27;t have control over what happens to your code.')
