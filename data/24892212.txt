Consumers aren&#x27;t begging for their hardware to be closed, and companies aren&#x27;t passively trying to please them. The vast majority of consumers don&#x27;t care if their hardware is closed until they discover something that their hardware is capable of doing that they&#x27;re not allowed to do with it or something that their hardware is doing that they&#x27;re not allowed to keep it from doing. Companies close as much as they can while trying not to upset consumers enough that they leave or complain to the government - which means either that they have to find ways to 1) add or limit functionality in a closed way, or that 2) they have to get all competitors to agree to prevent or allow the same things (to eliminate alternatives), or 3) they have to advocate a POV (and lobby for it in government) that whatever functionality is missing or required is <i>dangerous</i> to add or remove.<p>This is following consumers in a way; like building a wall behind them every time they move in a particular direction could be considered following them.')
