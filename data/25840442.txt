If they get together in a room and conspire to fix prices, that&#x27;s illegal.<p>So here&#x27;s what they do instead. First, one of them raises prices. They know that isn&#x27;t going to end well for them unless the other one does it, because otherwise they&#x27;ll lose business to the other one which now has a lower price. If the other one doesn&#x27;t promptly respond by raising prices too, they&#x27;ll have to lower them again. So that action is really an invitation to coordinate in raising prices.<p>Because they both know that. It&#x27;s obvious that the one can&#x27;t profitably raise prices unless the other one does. So now the other company has a choice. Option one, leave prices where they are, causing their competitor to have to lower them again before their own company actually gains any significant market share as a result of the lower prices. Option two, raise prices to match, and now they both make more money.<p>Option two is better for both companies. They both make more money and the only risk is that the higher margins attract a third competitor who comes in to undercut them. If that isn&#x27;t likely or can be made unlikely through some exclusionary mechanism then they both get to raise prices to the monopoly price.<p>It&#x27;s exactly the same thing as the price fixing conspiracy except that they never said it out loud. It&#x27;s a loophole.<p>And it&#x27;s also the difference here:<p>&gt; isn’t collusion anymore than when someone joins Parler&#x2F;Gab because it’s the “hip new thing”.<p>The users are too diffuse for the coordination mechanism to operate, and without it they don&#x27;t have market power. At the point when each site has a proportionate share of the users, no individual user has any reason to use a given site other than because they like it better, and their individual choice doesn&#x27;t affect the collective outcome enough to justify making it strategically.<p>Basically, it only applies to concentrated markets.')
