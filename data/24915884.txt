You use disk encryption to be protected against the case that the computer gets stolen. But that means the attacker has your TPM and can use it.<p>The only way to prevent that is requiring a BIOS password at boot (not very common) and secure boot (and like in the article many Linux users skip that because it can require extra knowledge and extra work.)<p>So you replaced entering a disk password by entering a BIOS password. What&#x27;s the benefit from usability perspective?<p>(Yes, secure boot would add security I don&#x27;t try to deny that.)')
