They&#x27;ve thrown away the benefits of a incredible wiki-based platform (where changes were pretty much instantaneous and any of us could easily make a difference to the docs!), the (actually pretty decent) WYSIWYG editor and an overall frictionless editing experience and replaced it with what, some (not even Markdown) document files in a GitHub repository. I honestly believe this will dissuade people from making small, quick fixes and ultimately drive away contributors.<p>Yeah, I really agree with this. Having built a website which relied on people submitting PRs to add their content on GitHub - I wouldn&#x27;t do it again. It&#x27;s a lot of friction for both the maintainers and people contributing.')
