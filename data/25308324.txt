In my first job, right after college, I have also sent an inflammatory email (nothing compared to the email she has sent) to my manager (not a whole group of coworkers). And I got seriously reprimanded for it by my then manager. Even after a decade I cringe when I remember the email I wrote. I have no idea why people think it&#x27;s okay to send emails like this and expect not to get fired.')
