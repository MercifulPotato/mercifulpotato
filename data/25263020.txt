You&#x27;d use this if you want to scale up or down and boot different images on the host. Yes, you have a 24 hour minimum, but that&#x27;s better than a 1 month minimum.<p>I&#x27;d have loved to have seen mac pros, and virtual instances (subdivided, even if you had to maintain a dedicated host to run them on), but this is still a major quality of life improvement for heterogeneous environments.')
