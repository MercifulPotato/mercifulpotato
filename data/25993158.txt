Don&#x27;t bias toward taking amphetamines as the parent comment instructs you to do.<p>There are serious negative long-term effects from taking amphetamines regularly.  Such advice as above is very one-size-fits-all, and in my view is thus really bad advice.<p>&gt; <i>Ignore the people screaming about Adderall being &quot;literal meth&quot; and how it will certainly kill you.</i><p>You can ignore those people because they&#x27;re wrong, amphetamine is not methamphetamine. But do not ignore the people who tell you that even normal amphetamines (adderall) are not harmless.  They cause harm, even at low doses.<p>The harm they cause may be mitigated by the benefit they bring; it may also be extremely difficult to estimate their harm in advance.  Ceasing regular use of amphetamines for some people can result in subsequent YEARS of oversleeping, lethargy, and depression from dopamine receptor downregulation.<p>&gt; <i>I don&#x27;t feel strung out nor is it some addiction.</i><p>Amphetamines are a highly addictive substance, if you are taking them every day it is likely that your body has developed at least <i>some</i> physical dependence upon them. Addiction doesn&#x27;t make itself known until you stop.')
