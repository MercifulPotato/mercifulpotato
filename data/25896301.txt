The word used to mean X, not Y, whereas now it&#x27;s just a pretentious version of Y.<p>&quot;Decimate&quot; may not be a terribly significant word to use&#x2F;lose, but that&#x27;s not a refutation of the pattern of loss that&#x27;s degrading the language. Claiming it&#x27;s just an arbitrary point of view is not correct.<p>On the other hand, a lot of people don&#x27;t grasp that when you Google a word, you likely do not find <i>all</i> the definitions that are in a decent dictionary, so it seems like the misinformation is fairly balanced between ignoring distinctions and making up distinctions&#x2F;restrictions that didn&#x27;t exist in the first place.')
