Because while I think conspiracy theories of people yelling stupid stuff that is unsubstantiated about voting machines, then I think that’s as dangerous as videos of kids cyber bullying, or blowing people’s heads off in video games, etc.<p>I don’t think any of that stuff is truly dangerous and adults should be trusted to watch the right things. But if Youtube is saying they are trying to help democracy or whatnot, then they need to ban coke ads. Because sugar does way more harm to America than dipshits masturbatorily posting about election conspiracies.')
