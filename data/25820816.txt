I was basing this on rent + bills at £800&#x2F;month. Leaving £400&#x2F;month for other expenses ~= £15k&#x2F;year ~= $20k&#x2F;year = 5 years.<p>£600&#x2F;month is also definitely doable in London (even in Zone 2). I have quite a few friends who earn less than me that wouldn&#x27;t even consider a room costing more than that.')
