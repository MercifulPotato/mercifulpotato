I love doing meetings over video conferencing specifically because everyone hates them and it makes them get right to the point so they can get off of them as quickly as possible. There&#x27;s far less chit chat about irrelevant stuff, or political talk, or whatever other nonsense is keeping me from getting work done. Yes, I hate the disconnects and freezes, and the half-second delay, and all that stuff. But if it makes my meetings short (and it does!) then I&#x27;ll take it!')
