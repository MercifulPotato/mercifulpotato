To speak of &quot;anthropomorphizing&quot; animals is a bit outdated... as the primatologist Franz de Waal puts it, people who use that term are in &quot;anthropodenial&quot;.  Today&#x27;s biologists and ethologists largely acknowledge that at least higher animals are sentient beings, with consciousness and a full complement of complex emotions and reasoning ability.  You can argue that humans are on top in overall cognitive abilities, but it&#x27;s really only by degree, not by fundamental kind... our cognitive machinery is only bigger than most other animals&#x27;, not really different.<p>As for your statement that animals&#x27; feelings &quot;don&#x27;t matter&quot;, well, why not?  Not too long ago humans of one skin color said that the feelings of other humans of another skin color don&#x27;t matter.  Then we made some progress, and now to say that is considered barbaric.  And many humans today are beginning to think it&#x27;s time to make some more progress and realize that non-human animals&#x27; feelings also do matter.')
