I went and installed it and while it was booting (~10 minutes on a 2 core 4096MB VM), I poked around looking for more information  and found some of the &quot;knee-jerk hate in HN comments&quot;[0] you mentioned, as well as a hit piece[1] on the founder&#x2F;creator (whether the arguments therein are valid is something you need to decide for yourself) and a more positive take[2] on it as well.<p>While it&#x27;s certainly an interesting bit of design and coding, with a laudable goal (decentralization of human interactions online), the functional model has all the hallmarks of a pyramid scheme, with everyone lower down paying rent to those higher up.<p>Despite the decentralized&#x2F;p2p nature of Urbit, it&#x27;s inherently hierarchical and seemingly designed to extract rents from those lower down the pyramid.<p>And since all the higher-up slots are already occupied, this seems more like Amway than a decentralized, egalitarian network.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m wrong.  I hope I am.  Am I?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21672481" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=21672481</a><p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;distributedweb.care&#x2F;posts&#x2F;who-owns-the-stars&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;distributedweb.care&#x2F;posts&#x2F;who-owns-the-stars&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;digital-stimulation&#x2F;about-urbit-part-1-ownership-1a352973a409" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;digital-stimulation&#x2F;about-urbit-part-1-ow...</a>')
