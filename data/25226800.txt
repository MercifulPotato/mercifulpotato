It&#x27;s just how they are interpreting it. If some hobbyist makes a video &quot;how to make Grana Padano style cheese&quot;, they send a cease and desist. Had they made a video &quot;how Grana Padano cheese is made&quot; and mentioned in the video that they are showing their version of the process but had specifically and clearly mentioned the resulting cheese is not and can not be actually called Grana Padano, they&#x27;d been okay I think.<p>They are probably okay now as well if the matter progressed to court and they had a good IP lawyer, but then again I am not one.')
