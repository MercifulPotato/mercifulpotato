But features are widely used by customers ahead of that time, as part of the rollout process.<p>Our team usually rolls out non-feature changes to services via dynamic configuration switches, so that we can get new bits in place, and then enable new behavior without a redeploy. This also enables us to roll back the dynamic config quickly if something unexpected happens.<p>(We generally don&#x27;t do this for net new functionality; there&#x27;s lower risk in adding a new REST endpoint etc. than in changing an existing query&#x27;s behavior or implementation.)')
