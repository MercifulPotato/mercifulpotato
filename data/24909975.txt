Item(by='sbarre', descendants=None, kids=[24910073], score=None, time=1603821225, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24909875, text='&quot;Unlimited&quot; in terms of Internet access&#x2F;bandwidth has always been a contentious term.<p>And I mean _always_ because back in 1995 I worked for an ISP and when we introduced our &quot;Unlimited&quot; dial-up plan, I can&#x27;t tell you the number of people who got mad at us because they couldn&#x27;t dial in and stay connected 24&#x2F;7 all month long.<p>We explained it in our terms of use (and actually had a really clear tl;dr in non-fine print in our ads) that customers could use as much as they could without worry of being charged for overages or getting cut off after a certain number of hours, but it was not a _dedicated_ account that promised 24&#x2F;7 service.<p>But certain customers insisted that _their_ interpretation of the word was the one that _we_ should be held to.<p>One customer even took us to small claims court, and lost.<p>For the rest, our typical response was to say we were sorry this wasn&#x27;t the plan they were expecting, and we&#x27;d happily refund their most recent month and close their account.  That&#x27;s almost always when they would change their mind and suddenly be ok with the terms.  ;-)')
