This is just a case of a company using its resources for a purpose designated by the owner.<p>An employee co-opting company resources without owner approval to broadcast their (employee&#x27;s) political message is not allowed, unless explicitly given permission by the owners.<p>Why people cannot tell the difference between the two situations above is beyond me - it&#x27;s not like they are similar or confusing.')
