Using the axiom of choice, all vectors of any space can be represented as finite linear combinations. In the case of infinite-dimensional vector spaces, this means you would need at most <i>n</i> vectors from the infinite basis <i>B</i>, and <i>n</i> scalars from the underlying field <i>F</i>.<p>I&#x27;m interested in what you&#x27;re trying to demonstrate with your example though, or if we misunderstand each other, because this theorem is very well established.')
