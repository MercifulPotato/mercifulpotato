I have a nice situation with Apple holding the keys to the castle, without the horrendous problems that friends of mine have had with Android malware, and you&#x27;re threatening it. I don&#x27;t want that.<p>End of story.<p>I don&#x27;t care who makes money and how they do it. I don&#x27;t care about any wider point. I care that my experience on the phone <i>that I bought for that experience</i> doesn&#x27;t get worse. I believe that experience <i>would</i> get worse, if there was open-season on the apps that could be installed. Capitalists are going to capitalize. The walled garden comes with restrictions that I signed up for, and I&#x27;m <i>happy</i> about that. That was <i>why</i> I signed up in the first place.')
