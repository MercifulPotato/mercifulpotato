My USB-C MacBook Pro with it&#x27;s pathetic two ports that my work bought for me is now old enough that the battery is starting to fail and we&#x27;re still in a world where this single cable for power, screen and ports just doesn&#x27;t seem to really exist.<p>I&#x27;m starting to be convinced the port is fundamentally flawed, dongles with multiple ports are never reliable enough to keep a drive mounted for any heavy work, HDMI glitches out. Doesn&#x27;t matter what dongle I try they all have some sort of thing wrong with them.<p>The only dongle that works reliably enough to do light video editing with a drive is the $20 Apple single USB-C to A adapter, which converts one of your single USB-C ports to a single USB-A port.<p>The fact that Apple hasn&#x27;t released a usb-c hub speaks volumes, lets be honest they could charge $500 for it and people would still defend and buy it. But I feel the reason they haven&#x27;t it because the technology fundamentally doesn&#x27;t deliver on this promise and it would be just as unreliable as the 3rd party ones.')
