That&#x27;s amazing and as someone mentioned, much more successful than over 99% of startups in the history of mankind.<p>Notes: I really like the theme, the barbershop candycane aesthetic does cry out &quot;mail&#x27;s here!&quot; ... I think that the text on steps 1-3 is a bit dense and could be thinned out, or reduced somehow.  The comparison chart on the price page is nice and clear except I would suggest adding some sort of icons to each of the row descriptors to make it clearer to understand at-a-glance.  Great idea for a product and proud of your success!')
