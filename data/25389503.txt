You treat it in black and white, and ignore all the shades of gray and all of the extra dimensions to the issue. It&#x27;s either &quot;you&#x27;re with me and everything I believe about every aspect of the issue&quot; or &quot;you&#x27;re an evil stupid virus denier&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s so much more to the issue than that, and 99% of the people you think believe the virus isn&#x27;t real DO believe it&#x27;s real, they just don&#x27;t agree with you on how severe it is and how it should be responded to.')
