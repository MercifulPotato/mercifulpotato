There&#x27;s no right answer there, I&#x27;m just looking for something relevant that shows they&#x27;ve got some knowledge of the field outside of being able to bash out code to order. For juniors I don&#x27;t really expect much while seniors should at least be able to talk a bit about a couple of things, but having interviewed prospective head of development candidates I was amazed that two out of four just tanked on the question, one just couldn&#x27;t answer at all.<p>Candidates who know there are things they don&#x27;t know about I don&#x27;t mind, but candidates who are unaware of these things at all are typically uninterested in broadening their knowledge, and not someone I&#x27;d like on my team.')
