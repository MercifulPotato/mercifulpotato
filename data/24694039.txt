California has plenty of ranches, but their not acting as a buffer around those areas.  Also, being within a few miles of forest is really close in wildfire terms.  When people think of wildfire buffers they point to things like roads and firebreaks, but thatâ€™s only useful when people are actively fighting fires.  You want tens of miles not feet between structures and wildfires.')
