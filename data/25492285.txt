Templates make some tasks easy (type specialization and generic containers) but become tangled messes with other tasks (function bindings, serialization).<p>I used something similar to your technique for compile-time variable destruction. The compiler doesn&#x27;t know the type, so a macro generates a callback which deletes a casted version. These callbacks are named with the type so they can be lazily added and reused.')
