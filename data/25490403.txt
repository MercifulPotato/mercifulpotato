The fine article even mentions that.<p><pre><code>  &gt; The few studies that have shown this to cause symptoms use extremely large doses of MSG that aren&#x27;t used in food (for one thing, the dosages involved would be unpalatable even for those without the symptoms;\n</code></pre>\nSo you do accept that some studies have demonstrated MSG sensitivity? So why the lie in the previous sentence? I&#x27;m trying to give you the benefit of the doubt, but I just don&#x27;t see how you claim the former statement given this statement.<p>In any case, yes, you are correct here. As per the fine article, the dose at which symptoms become common is six times the normal dose. Do you find it utterly impossible that some people could be sensitive at one-sixth the dose that &quot;most people&quot; become sensitive at?')
