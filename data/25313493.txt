It&#x27;s just that all the risk is borne by the borrower, not the lender. Take out a bunch of loans and can&#x27;t get a job? Too bad! You still have to pay your loans anyway. Your risk didn&#x27;t work out.<p>&gt; 18-year-olds don&#x27;t have credit history, and most of them don&#x27;t have income either.<p>Yes, this is exactly why in every other normal circumstance, lending them money is a bad idea.<p>College used to be something where you could reasonably pay tuition with a decent summer job. If there is not an infinite supply of money to pay tuition, tuition will have to be lower. This will make it more accessible, not less.')
