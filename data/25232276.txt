In my reading, US citizens are responsible for US income tax regardless of where they are in the world. Some of that is balanced by double taxation treaties, but this doesn&#x27;t apply if you&#x27;re floating from one place to the next.<p>While it&#x27;s possible for some digital nomads to become a (tax) resident of nowhere, falling into a loop hole, it was my impression that this was not the case with US citizens. It&#x27;s anyone&#x27;s guess as to how long this will last, especially with this years uptick in remote work (if that is coupled with a return to the ability to travel after COVID).<p>In the case of self employed digital nomads it&#x27;s possible to structure your businesses to legally minimize taxes. I run my business out of Estonia, which may not be the cheapest tax wise but has the benefit of being an EU country, and somewhat transparent about tax.<p>Estonia has flat 20% tax on share distributions. This is also great for startups. Money that comes into the business and stays in the business isn&#x27;t taxed, simplifying growing your business.<p>nomadcapitalist.com has some good reading on the subject, both blog or book. Regardless of whether or not you agree with his observations on certain things.<p>I&#x27;m far from an expert, but if anyone wants to talk about my experiences, my email is on my profile.<p>Edit: Is it allowed to add answers in AMAs, I&#x27;m not across the etiquette.')
