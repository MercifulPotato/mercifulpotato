They&#x27;d rather make many less good hires who do as they&#x27;re told than a more complicated one, even if that person were better at all the attributes. You can tell people a lot about culture and how some things are just formalities, but the contract is what remains, everything else changes with the next reorg.<p>From the point of view of the person at legal it makes sense (too much complexity and extra work), from higher management it makes sense (potential risk with someone who can think for themselves and won&#x27;t accept everything that is handed to them), and the hiring manager will probably not pick a fight for someone who&#x27;s not even on the team yet.')
