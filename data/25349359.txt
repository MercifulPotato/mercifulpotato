They were certainly aware of the Lion Air crash.  However, they could not get manual trim control to work.<p>The manual trim operation requires a large amount of strength to operate when the stabilizer is loaded.  It might be true that pilots would now be aware that they need to allow the stabilizer to be in an unloaded position before disabling the automatic trim.  But that&#x27;s a big if when the aircraft is only a few thousand feet off the ground.<p>In other words, without any modifications, if MCAS were to erroneously operate during a takeoff, and the pilots had perfect information on what was happening, it still might be difficult to recover from it.  They could probably wait for an MCAS cycle to complete, then disable the automatic trim.  But there&#x27;s only about 60 seconds to complete these actions.')
