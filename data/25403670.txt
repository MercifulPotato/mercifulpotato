Maybe briefly in the late 1990s the export limit was 56 bits, but all of the EXPORT cipher suites in TLS 1.0 (from 1999)[0] have limits of 40-bit symmetric keys, or a NULL cipher.  Also the RSA and DH moduli for export cipher suites were limited to 512 bits.<p>[0] Page 60 of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ietf.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc2246.txt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ietf.org&#x2F;rfc&#x2F;rfc2246.txt</a>')
