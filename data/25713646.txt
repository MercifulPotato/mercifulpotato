If FAANGT doesn&#x27;t ban&#x2F;remove the fascists then they face huge commercial pressure - if they do then the commercial pressure (from the other side) is much less. The market is speaking - the CEO&#x27;s of these companies have decided that the tide has turned and it&#x27;s in their shareholder&#x27;s interest to ban.<p>I think this is a terrible way to run society - no company should have the scale or power of these companies, but it turns out that this is what can happen if you run things by a market. To argue that they shouldn&#x27;t do this is basically arguing against a market economy!')
