CURL without https seems insufficient nowadays.\n2. CURL could be improved by running multiple downloads at once. I&#x27;m not sure that curl command line utility could do it, but certainly libcurl.so has this ability, it allows client code to work with multiple connections.\n3. Any application having UI could benefit from async: input&#x2F;output and main task are async by nature. For example, curl might want to show progress&#x2F;status to a terminal despite of a stalled connection.<p>So maybe Hyper is too much of a code for a curl, but it is arguable that it is not.')
