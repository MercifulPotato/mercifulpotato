In my opinion, once you start talking about restricting speech, you get into the grey area - who decides what speech to restrict? Off the top of my head, the most &quot;capable&quot; organizations would be either:<p>- The companies who run these glorified advertising platforms (which would regulate speech based on &quot;how much money will we lose?&quot;), or<p>- a Governmental body (which by its nature has a monopoly on violence - &quot;if you say something we don&#x27;t like, your social credit score goes down and you can&#x27;t leave the country or we throw you in jail&quot;). I think freedom of speech is a very large part of what makes America distinctive from other countries.<p>- Alternatively, we could have whoever the loudest complainers are control speech, which would be very reactionary - driven by misinformation or coordinated culture change campaigns(?)<p>If the people with abhorrent opinions decide to start causing direct physical harm to people in reality - that&#x27;s when police, government, etc. should step in and penalize them - not social media companies or governments, or the vocal minority determining what people should and shouldn&#x27;t say.')
