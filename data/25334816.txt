CO does have a lot of FAANG options though and Slack was also there.<p>They&#x27;re not looking for the most interesting work at that point, they&#x27;re looking to keep their job and raise a family - it&#x27;s a tradeoff.<p>Isn&#x27;t that a risk to move to a place without as many employment options? Yes. The reason for that risk is you can raise kids in a nice house for $500k rather than in a tiny, old, 2 bedroom apartment for 1.5M.')
