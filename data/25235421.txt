As the author demonstrates, classic Macintosh computers are&#x2F;were much simpler than modern Macs and also easier to use.<p>They typically also sported a tiny black and white display (vs. 27&quot; or larger 5K or 4K full&#x2F;wide color and HDR displays), extremely primitive multimedia capabilities (Macromedia director vs. the web, iMovie, Unity...), much slower storage (slow floppy disks and hard drives vs. modern flash storage),  and was more likely to crash or freeze due to lack of memory protection and preemptive multitasking (though it didn&#x27;t have the problem of breaking when you lose internet connectivity like modern macOS.)<p>Modern IP networking is powerful and connects you to the world, but AppleTalk was largely plug-and-play and had nice dynamic resource discovery (which influenced the design of Bonjour&#x2F;mDNS.) Note classic Macs could be connected to the IP internet, but they lacked web browsers until ~1992. ;-)<p>As far as Apple is concerned, I think iOS may be the inheritor of much of the simplicity of the classic Macintosh: one app at a time, simplified multitasking, hood welded shut with minimal user-serviceable components inside. But an iPhone also does much more than a typical Macintosh of the 1980s or early 1990s, notably full wireless, mobile internet access with modern web support, streaming video, television, and music, wireless&#x2F;mobile voice and video calls, multimedia messaging and email, full speech recognition and automatic dictation, Siri&#x2F;digital assistant, full voice control of the device, automatic language translation, accelerated 3D graphics with augmented reality support, automatic computational photography, high-resolution, color digital painting and photo editing with dozens of layers, video editing, CD-quality sampling, music synthesis, and multitrack recording, millions of downloadable apps, etc.. And it runs all day on batteries and fits in your pocket.')
