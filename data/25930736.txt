I mean, I don&#x27;t disagree that serious analysis needs more info than a single number.  But... what&#x27;s the policy distinction here that you&#x27;re trying to argue?<p>There&#x27;s no mystery to the current situation: people are out of work due to the pandemic and making a lot less money, and that&#x27;s bad.<p><i>Edit: two replies have responded by repeating the theoretical distinction and proposing scenarios where the two metrics would diverge.  I understand that part.  I&#x27;m asking if there is any evidence RIGHT NOW that this is the wrong metric to look at.  Because naively, you&#x27;d really expect that people losing a lot of jobs to covid would simultaneously increase the population of people below the poverty line AND the average&#x2F;median incomes of those people already below it.  And if that&#x27;s true, and it seems to be, why are we arguing about minutiae about metrics?  The cause, and the solution, is the same in either case.</i>')
