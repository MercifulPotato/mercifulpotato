There are some technical &amp; memory-related prereqs (i.e. I have a CS degree, and I&#x27;m not a dummy), but mainly I know our systems so well because I&#x27;ve worked actively on them for more than a decade.<p>It would probably take me a decade to build such a detailed mental model at another company or agency. And that&#x27;s even assuming I could get hired. One consequence of working on an idiosyncratic, one-off architecture is that my mainstream tech skills have atrophied significantly. I definitely could not pass a leet-code interview at a FAANG anymore.')
