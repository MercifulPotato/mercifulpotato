Having grown up around there I object to this being described as a special case; it&#x27;s everyday driving conditions for a lot of people. :) Better built cattle grids appear on main roads with good visibility and it&#x27;s not unreasonable to cross them at 40mph (thinking about it there may even be the occasional example people cross at 60).<p>An anecdote from around 15 years back: the government considered closing the driving test centre in Minehead because there was no dual carriageway nearby on which learner drivers could demonstrate correct merging skills. Residents collectively replied that all the centres in London should be closed as they did not qualify drivers to deal with reversing down narrow lanes with sheep and mud on the road (...this is painfully evident if you&#x27;re stuck behind an urbanite driver anywhere near Minehead in summer). Anyhoo, the test centre still operates today.')
