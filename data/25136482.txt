If you want to remain cross platform and support Metal you&#x27;re so severely restricted that the best you can hope for is to just special case a bunch of features for non-Apple machines and not support them at all on Mac.  It really feels like Apple wanted to kill gaming on Macs entirely.  I understand that they want to maintain control over their own graphics stack, but for this to work the stack has to be <i>better</i> than the competition and that&#x27;s not the case here at all.')
