Just added that as an &quot;Employment type&quot;.\nAnd i regards to why LaunchAfrica as opposed to Angelist? Well firstly your point - the shitty interface and how they push for you to sign up and stuff like that. It is also full of other stuff and I prefer something straight to the point. Also i think its always better to focus (on Africa). I am also still trying to figure out more features that could make it stand out.')
