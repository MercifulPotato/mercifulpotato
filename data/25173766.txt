Like &quot;nice sounding problems&quot; that actually no one cares about.<p>The great thing about building something for yourself is at least you know it&#x27;s a real problem. It may potentially be too small of a market, but at least it&#x27;s a real problem.<p>Also, it&#x27;s much easier to build something that you deeply understand.
