There are some YouTube creators that would be totally fine with you downloading their content but you can&#x27;t assume every creator is the same. Just because a user filmed, edited and uploaded some video from their own house doesn&#x27;t mean they have any less rights than music or video from major labels or Hollywood studios.')
