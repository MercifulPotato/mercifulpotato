No, I&#x27;ve been looking to change jobs for the past year and absolutely nothing has popped up.<p>I think businesses have weighted the power&#x2F;capability of scala against the relative lack of easily hireable programmer for them.<p>If a business makes themself dependent on one (or a few) key scala programmers, they are more prone to be held hostage (e.g., the power dynamic is more towards the scala programmer). They will have to pay more salary or face the risk of the programmer leaving (which affects business continuity). The scala stack doesn&#x27;t automatically give a more competitive edge against the competition, however (tho i would say it does, but only if the entire org buys into it).<p>Therefore, it makes more business sense, esp. for a middle manager responsible for hiring, to hire a java programmer (which is basically a dime a dozen at this point). The business will face no risk of the programmer holding the business hostage (because they are easily replaceable). So that&#x27;s why you see businesses start to not adopt scala.')
