And I find it wholly unappealing to abandon the existing corpus of literal decades of knowledge having been poured into those language ecosystems all in the name of whatever it is that Rust delivers on. I just have too much experience in the industry to throw away my time and experiment with something I can&#x27;t take off the shelf and be productive with from day one.<p>I&#x27;ve also mentioned I just can&#x27;t stand the way the language looks. It&#x27;s ugly as sin, and I know I&#x27;m not alone in that opinion.<p>I made some crude comments in a previous thread here on HN about Servo, but still came away with the feeling there was literally no one using Servo, the site didn&#x27;t tell you how to actually use it, and no one cared, but the hype was unreal because it was web tech written in Rust.<p>Edit: The points on this post are fluctuating wildly. If you&#x27;re interested in Rust, could you share your knowledge with some of us who are on the fence like me instead of downvoting? It doesn&#x27;t actually help me understand anything about the language or community other than I shouldn&#x27;t criticize Rust because its users will downvote you.')
