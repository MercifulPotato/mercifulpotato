Nadella has done a lot more good by changing microsoft&#x27;s business model from the inside from EEE to one that embraces open source and collaboration than he could have if he quit. Even while he was at Microsoft he was working in the cloud division laying the groundwork for what the company managed to transform into. They&#x27;re also clearly not focusing their efforts on EEE now - why would they embrace Apple and get office to work on their platform if that was the case? They&#x27;re not going to extinguish apple - its too powerful, and their collaborations with groups as powerful as Apple, Google, Linux users, etc would be a waste of time if they were still operating with their old strategy. These are immensely powerful rivals, not weaker&#x2F;fragmented standards that can be extended and extinguished just like that.')
