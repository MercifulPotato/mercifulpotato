Forget the name of their lovecraftian ticketing&#x2F;control interface (which was always breaking) but it was hands down the worst interface I&#x27;ve ever worked with. Their remote SA team was not very good either. The supply&#x2F;parts folks serving DC techs earned bonuses on having bad parts recycled into production and the parts delivery was not managed properly. One xmas I saw the same motherboard 5 times after returning it as defective each time. I resigned and was then fired. Only place that ever happened. Was so happy to leave I didn&#x27;t care but it has come back to haunt me once or twice.')
