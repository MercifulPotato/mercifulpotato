Item(by='nbzso', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609847310, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25639781, text='&gt;What really puzzles me about Apple fans and it&#x27;s userbase is that they do not care. They simply do not care at all what&#x27;s being done to them.<p>I am Apple user and I care a lot for my self and my privacy. Thats why I will not support this company with my money. Some people are aware, but unfortunately we run a business in which Mac OS as software platform is superior. Little Snitch is installed in all my Apple computers. In last 5 years after every os update, telemetry from mothership is exponentially more. I don&#x27;t like this direction and have taken active measures to change my business operation and remove everything Apple related excluding some graphic software and audio. Windows is not an option.<p>Apple is a company that openly dislikes professional users and focusing marketing efforts to semi pro audience by using powerful tribe psychology, trends and sentiments to create public perception of a Good Shepard and Guardian.<p>In reality they know that future is data based and Google has advantage in this market. So they correct direction to recondition public over the idea of personal computing and transform Mac OS to iOS UX with already established consumer habit of no control and minimum transparency.<p>From business perspective the idea that someone will have a log file with my office activity is non acceptable. Period. Apple knows this and recently stopped standalone updates. This pushes businesses to avoid sandboxing of Apple computers in corporate network.<p>The message is clear. You rent Mac Os as a service, the price is your data. It is Beautified Google:)')
