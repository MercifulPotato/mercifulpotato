Humor is tricky - certainly humor contributes <i>something</i>, but if you&#x27;re going to make a humorous comment <i>here</i> as opposed to a more entertainment-focused forum, it should also attempt to expand someone&#x27;s perspective on the topic. It should be funny or entertain because it lights up some new parts of the brain. Grandparent comment is educating everyone on the origins of PWA to dispute the article, with a proclamation of bewilderment that we got to this place of term misuse, and parent is just giving a very general reason for this happening.<p>Your joke, at best, is an unrelated and in this case unnecessary example of &quot;misuse&quot; but unfortunately doesn&#x27;t add anything substantial to the conversation. Even if we &quot;get&quot; the joke, we do not want to <i>trend</i> in the direction of low effort jokes dominating our discussions.')
