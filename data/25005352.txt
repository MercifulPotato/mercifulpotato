I heard in Sweden  from a friend who lived there briefly that everything was dark and closed early like 6-7pm. The opposite of a place like NYC or even here in downtown Toronto where it&#x27;s normal to find plenty to do until midnight.<p>They said it was some sort of strict cultural thing. Everyone wakes up early and you got to get used to that early schedule. And I&#x27;ve been a life long night-hawk.<p>Not talking just about bars either. I have multiple 24&#x2F;7 convince stores and gas stations near by. And Uber Eats shows quite a few options at 1am on week nights.')
