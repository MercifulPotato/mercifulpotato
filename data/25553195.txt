State and local government defined benefit pension obligations are invested in them, individuals&#x27; 401k and IRA accounts are invested in them, and the most influential members of society are invested in them.  There is no political will to let the price of stocks fall (or even stagnate), and so either the US government keeps stock prices chugging along, or the USD has lost its buying power, in which case you have a bigger problem than your stock market holdings (if you&#x27;re American).')
