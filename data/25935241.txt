The fact that said expert is confidently claiming that 75% number makes me doubt his opinion. We can&#x27;t confidently estimate the proportion of people infected in the US or Europe. I don&#x27;t know how you&#x27;d begin to claim such a thing in Brazil, where the access to testing and data reporting is quite poor.<p>&gt; for millenia the most-effective method of weather forecasting was constancy: &quot;Tomorrow will be just like today&quot;<p>I disagree that this like predicting the weather. The weather has consistent seasonal patterns that give you ~90% (brown number) of the story (ironically, this virus is also probably strongly seasonal, but I digress).<p>Here, we&#x27;re engaged in speculation that some &quot;new strain&quot; might be <i>worse</i> than the existing strain. It&#x27;s the opposite of using long-term trends to predict the future. It&#x27;s a bit like claiming that every new typhoon is going to be the worst one ever, because it&#x27;s different than the last typhoon in some way.')
