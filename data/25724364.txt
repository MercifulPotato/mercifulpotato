They&#x27;re not out there running ELISAs, Western Blots, minipreps and passaging cell cultures.<p>So they may not understand how the vaccine technology works at a particularly higher level than the general public.<p>Not a slight against nurses, of course, they do <i>incredibly</i> valuable work. But, upon hearing about a novel mRNA-based vaccine technology, they may be less likely than, say, an MD or a biomedical PhD to go &#x27;that&#x27;s a pretty cool application of a technology I understand pretty well.&quot;<p>Same thing with cops, fire, paramedics etc. They didn&#x27;t exactly spend a decade in school to learn all about the magic of B cells and epitopes. So, they might be a little suspicious of something they&#x27;re not exactly trained to understand, and seemingly not particularly curious about. Not really their fault I guess, it&#x27;s just way outside of their wheelhouse.<p>In this particular situation, however, that becomes a bit of a problem since the public isn&#x27;t necessarily able to contextualize their opinion on something, and may miss the fact that they may have zero clue what they&#x27;re talking about.<p>Agreed. Weird time to be alive indeed.')
