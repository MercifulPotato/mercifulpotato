Dividends are measured relative to stock price, not earnings.  And a 3% dividend - that is, a per-share dividend equal to 3% of the share price - absolutely does cause the price to decrease by 3%.<p>It&#x27;s pretty clear why this must be the case - it&#x27;s one of the weakest possible forms of the efficient-markets hypothesis.  If it wasn&#x27;t the case, people would buy (sell) the stock just before the dividend and sell (buy) just after for a nearly guaranteed profit.')
