This in currently not the case at all of SMR...<p>When it comes to technology at pilot scale, price and capacity improvement may turn out to never be realized... But there are dozens of promising tech, so it seems unlikely that all tech will &quot;fail&quot;... and SMR exhibit higer level of risk cause it is even not at the pilot scale project, and it is mostly one technology (with 2 or 3 varieties)<p>And there are many more tech at the lab stage<p>And there is also thermal storage, with many proven and cheap technology, and many different innovation at different stage in the pipe<p>And there are all the innovation to reduce the intermittence and help manage it<p>And there are all the innovation and intervention to allow to make energy demand more flexible')
