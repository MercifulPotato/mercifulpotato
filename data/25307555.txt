I just haven’t seen any proof of that.<p>From a macro perspective, masks did not stop the 2nd wave in Italy and France and their mask compliance was the highest in Europe. I don’t think you can claim Italy just didn’t mask hard enough.<p>Flu cases, by comparison, are down something like 99% year over year. So it’s not like I’m saying masks and hand washing don’t work. They appear to work extremely well for flu, they just obviously have failed to stop COVID.<p>If you look at how fearful some people are to even approach someone who isn’t wearing a mask, but then immediately feel safer when the mask goes on, it’s not clear to me a better approach wouldn’t have been “masks do not work, if you don’t want COVID then do not gather inside”.')
