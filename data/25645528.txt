This is the ultimate elephant in room with hiring and it&#x27;s always been there and always will be unless we somehow do hiring while never talking to someone or seeing them or knowing their real-name.<p>Even if it wasn&#x27;t expressly forbidden under law, no one was ever rejecting someone from a job &quot;because they are black&#x2F;white&#x2F;female&#x2F;etc&#x2F;etc&#x2F;&quot;, that&#x27;s always been obviously wrong, but it&#x27;s easy enough to simply say &quot;They&#x27;re not a culture fit.&quot; or &quot;Not experienced enough&quot; or &quot;Didn&#x27;t answer the technical questions well enough.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think banning people&#x27;s faces on resumes or CVs would fix anything, the only thing that would &quot;fix&quot; this is changing our implicit and unconscious biases from childhood onwards, i.e. a major change to our teaching culture, and across all the media, TV, movies, books etc.')
