Promo is definitely not my jam! You&#x27;re right, that page is totally worthless.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s super simple. I just wanted a type-c version of what was already out there, and maybe for it to sound &#x27;reasonable&#x27; at a sub $30 price point. It is only 16-bit 48kHz, but does a great job at dialing in tone, recording a quick riff, etc. Bottom line, it&#x27;s about -90db noise floor and 80db SNR.<p>Thanks')
