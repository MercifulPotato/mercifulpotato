Appropriately normalizing the primes with some kind of function based on log(log(n)) would probably allow the article&#x27;s technique to perform well (still struggling on larger primes -- you can&#x27;t avoid needing a lot of bits to express those gaps), but it&#x27;s precisely the shifting density which makes the problem hard to learn with any standard algorithm, and I don&#x27;t think theirs would be an exception since they explicitly rely on gaps drawn from some fixed distribution.')
