The result of the timestamp is instantly verifiable against the timestamped data, meaning the results of the timestamp can be viewed on a public blockchain explorer or using an API that interfaces with the blockchain, without trusting our code. If another party doesn&#x27;t trust our frontend code, they can build their own frontend logic that interfaces with the blockchain in the backend to independently verify results. If someone is using our app, they implicitly trust our code, yes, but they don&#x27;t have to trust our database. That&#x27;s the difference.<p>&gt; <i>In both scenarios, you have no proof of when the photo was taken. It could&#x27;ve been two hours or ten minutes ago. There is no way to digitally verify it.</i><p>This is a solvable-ish problem. What our app does is require the photos to be taken in-browser, and adds a small stamp to the photo before hashing it with the most recent Bitcoin block hash. This way, we have a window of ~10 minutes within which we know the photo was taken.<p>Can this be abused? Yes. But the transporter is exceedingly unlikely to know how, and they also don&#x27;t have access to the cars before handoff, so the concern is really negligible. Faking the photos is now at least a few order of magnitudes harder than before. We can improve on this in the future.<p>&gt; <i>posting a photo of a different vehicle</i><p>We ask the transporters to take a photo of the VIN in the frame, along with other photos (body, odometer, etc.). This is a pretty foolproof solution.')
