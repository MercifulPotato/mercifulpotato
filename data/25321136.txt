The US collectively produces way more than enough to keep them afloat until the end of the pandemic; the only reason for the dichotomy is Congress&#x27;s failure to pass enough aid funding to provide that support. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, congressional Republicans - and in turn, everyone who voted for them - are ultimately responsible for the failure of every small business that shutters due to the pandemic, due to their absurd insistence on legal indemnity for employers whose employees get COVID due to unsafe working environments.<p>To be clear, as a lot of other commenters have pointed out, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be well established how risky activities like outdoor dining are. If it were a question of whether it were worth an additional $X billion in aid to prevent that risk, great, that&#x27;s a conversation that&#x27;s worth having. But you can&#x27;t have that kind of meaningful conversation starting from an ultimatum, as we are today.')
