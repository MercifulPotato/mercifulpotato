Some people are fine with hardly any support. \nSome people can&#x27;t stand to do it without support.  Also, not everyone can be an entrepreneur, nor should they, just like not everyone can be an employee either.  There&#x27;s no shame in it, you are who you are.  If anything you&#x27;ve gained extremely valuable insight into yourself and you were brave enough to confront who you are.<p>I don&#x27;t want to read too much into your article, but I just wanted to add that it sounded like you were doing things on your own which can be extremely hard (or easy) depending on your personality type.  Also it sounded like having a marketing&#x2F;sales co-founder could have made a difference.  I&#x27;m not sure where I came across the advice that a start-up needs a hipster, a hacker and a hustler, but it&#x27;s a rare individual who embodies all three qualities.<p>My first 2 business failures were because I was inexperienced as an entrepreneur and didn&#x27;t understand where my strengths and weaknesses were.  My next venture was a success because I had co-founders and I could focus on my strengths.<p>I&#x27;m sorry things didn&#x27;t turn out well and I wish you luck in your next move.  Whatever you do just be the best version of yourself... whatever that is.')
