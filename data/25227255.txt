Item(by='yorwba', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606472052, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25227079, text='&gt; I would have no problems identifying a minibus either. They typically have writing &#x2F; phone number on the side and something on the roof.<p>What if the writing accompanying the phone number says &quot;Schl√ºsselservice Maier&quot;? Some kind of ... shuttle service? Is that a taxi? (It&#x27;s actually a locksmith.)<p>Of course these kinds of situations don&#x27;t really happen for English speakers. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen non-English text in a CAPTCHA... Instead you get a picture of some Californian street with palm trees or something. (I assume those streets are in California. Maybe they&#x27;re actually in Jakarta or elsewhere, in which case I&#x27;m sorry for being presumptive.)')
