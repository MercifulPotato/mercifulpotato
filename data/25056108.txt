When I heard last year that .NET 5 would support single-file binary, I expected it to be the same as something like Rust or Go would offer. But no, Microsoft changed the meaning of AOT and moved the goal post, introducing the real AOT as &quot;native AOT&quot;. Thankfully they are aware of the issue, so I hope to finally see in when .NET 6, which will also be an LTS release, is released.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;visualstudiomagazine.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;31&#x2F;aot-survey.aspx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;visualstudiomagazine.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;31&#x2F;aot-sur...</a>')
