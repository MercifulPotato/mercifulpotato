George Floyd became a symbol, for example, due to the obvious unreasonableness of him being killed violently on the street when an officer responded to the use of a counterfeit bill. People don&#x27;t consider that a reasonable reaction.<p>If you had asked any American a week ago about what they think is a reasonable reaction for an officer faced with people trying to surpass a barricade, that has been set up for security reasons inside a government building to protect the people inside,  after said building has been trespassed by a crowd breaking through the windows, I don&#x27;t think &quot;shooting&quot; would have been unexpected.As some people pointed out half jokingly, &quot;you can&#x27;t even try that in GTA&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t see the relevance of mentioning that woman&#x27;s connection to the military either, other than emphasising that she should have known better.<p>In opposition, I think the flag that symbolises the right of people to own slaves, being flown without consequence in the meeting place of congress while the officers stand around and take selfies with the mob, sends a clear message to the descendants of slaves about how much can they expect to be protected and represented by that democracy. Even more so in a climate where they have been violently repressed for protesting inequality.')
