The attacker would have to do an active man-in-the-middle attack that rewrites the connection and swaps out the ephemeral keys with keys known to the attacker, which risks detection.<p>If an attacker has the CA&#x27;s private key, then the attacker can mint new HTTPS certificates. They wouldn&#x27;t be able to do passive listening attacks on connections, but they could use an active man-in-the-middle attack to swap out the server&#x27;s certificate in the connection. However, this attack could be detected through Certificate Transparency, and the CA&#x27;s leaked keys would become untrusted by browsers.')
