Item(by='tumetab1', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603213484, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24839394, text='<p><pre><code>  Do you not see how that is effectively identical to any other backdoor?\n</code></pre>\nYes but it&#x27;s not the same as &quot;a backdoor to which the authorities have a secret key, letting them view communication on demand.&quot;. I oppose the notion that &quot;lawful access&quot; is the same that a backdoor&#x2F;secret key that decrypts all E2EE.<p><pre><code>  the end result is the same: unilaterally being able to obtain any message\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s not the same since restricts scope (monitoring all communications vs specific users, indefinite decryption vs history chat). Keep in mind that some will monitor if they are getting those &quot;send decrypted chat please&quot; so if weird stuff is being request, word will get out. The E2EE backdoor is worse because allows silent decryption of all communications for ever.<p><pre><code>  Privacy activists are objecting to the end result, not the technical mechanism by which it is implemented.\n</code></pre>\nMany &quot;Privacy activists&quot; actually oppose with the argument that it&#x27;s impossible to have E2EE and also &quot;lawful access&quot; which is not true.<p>And I agree with all your concerns, I just thing a middle ground (favouring more the privacy) is possible.<p><pre><code>  Also such an active mechanism would be quickly thwarted by even moderately sophisticated criminals, either by not using backdoored communication software or by simply blocking requests for the keys. And if the goal is to only capture unsophisticated criminals, surely old fashioned police work is more than sufficient. \n</code></pre>\nThat all might be true but the considerations is also, will E2EE by default create unnecessary difficulties for police? Are we willing to increase expenditures in police forces to keep the same level of protection? How much crimes are we willing to let go to keep E2EE (crimes where the timing matters)?\nI would be fine if the discussion was that.<p>---------------<p>Side note regarding this, be aware that OS Updates and App updates are already the mechanism I examplified. An App update can be installed which decrypts everything and sends it to somewhere. We&#x27;re already trusting that the app&#x2F;service provider is not doing that or being mandate by the courts to do that.')
