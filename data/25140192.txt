Notebooks are fantastic for experimenting, but once a final solution is found, it should be turned into standalone, modular components before making it into production.<p>I think the tough part is that most modern data workflow tools don&#x27;t work well for data scientists. They can&#x27;t quickly deploy and experiment with code variations on the cloud, so they end up in continuous experimentation mode with notebooks where they can make line-by-line tweaks. If the tooling could facilitate quicker deployment, it might be easier to break the notebook habit.')
