He also realized that including the cosmological constant term in his equation would be mathematically valid, and that if he picked just the right value for the constant, he <i>could</i> obtain a static solution for the universe. At that time, it was generally believed that the universe was static on large scales.<p>Then, later, when it was discovered that the universe is expanding, Einstein dropped the cosmological constant term. He later called including that term in 1917 &quot;the greatest blunder of my life&quot;, because if he had just gone with his original field equation, without the constant, he could have predicted the expansion of the universe more than a decade before it was discovered.<p><i>&gt; In bot cases you are picking arbitrar values</i><p>When the expansion of the universe was discovered, yes, it was already recognized that it is valid to include the constant in the Einstein Field Equation, so it couldn&#x27;t just be un-included. Its value was just assumed to be zero since that was consistent with all observations that were known then.<p>In Einstein&#x27;s original 1915 field equation, however, the constant wasn&#x27;t &quot;set to zero&quot;. It wasn&#x27;t included at all; nobody even realized at that time that it was valid to include it.')
