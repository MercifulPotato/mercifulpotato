Unlike Anki where you choose how well you were able to recall the answer (essentially a score from 1 to 5), I use a combination of your CORRECT&#x2F;INCORRECT signal as well as how quickly you reveal the answer to determine a recall score.<p>From my own testing, it works reasonably well, although there&#x27;s room for improvement over time.')
