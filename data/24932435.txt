The food arrived and was completely inedible. The restaurant sent out a vindaloo that was the most unnatural red color, like they had dumped a bin full of chili flake in it.<p>Grubhub pointed the finger at the local restaurant, and the local restaurant pointed the finger at GH for not specifying the level of spiciness. In the end the only way to resolve the problem was to do a chargeback because neither merchant would take responsibility. We didn&#x27;t have the business relationship with the restaurant. So I&#x27;ll never use GH for anything because when something goes wrong they absolve themselves of responsibility.<p>And I&#x27;m skeptical of any other company that acts as a base middleman like they do.')
