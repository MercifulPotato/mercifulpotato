Support for prop 22 is a business decision that doesn&#x27;t require the hearts and souls of every worker in Uber. I&#x27;d be surprised if Uber engineers, PMs, designers, etc - basically everyone other than public-facing leadership and the few involved in crafting Uber&#x27;s public policy - were required to actively express support for prop 22 in the workplace or anywhere else. The average Uber worker should be perfectly able to go about their workday without diving into a political debate about prop 22.')
