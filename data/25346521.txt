Hopefully it&#x27;s understandable that I didn&#x27;t come to that conclusion because the article does not attribute those words to anyone.<p>&gt; The vaccines would be a current and global talking point. It&#x27;s natural that the first post-testing vaccines would be a significant moment, that someone involved would feel it was of historic note, and that a publication would use that phrasing to accentuate the story&#x27;s weight.<p>Yeah, I suppose, but it&#x27;s still weird to me.  I don&#x27;t care about the details of the first publicly administered dose.  What really matters to me is that doses are now publicly available (kind of, depending on need for now).<p>Nothing about the &quot;first&quot; dose strikes me as being of historical note other than the timestamp and the milestone it represents.  But I guess that&#x27;s a matter of opinion and a lot of people seem to disagree with me.')
