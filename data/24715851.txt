It&#x27;s not as simple as dropping it off and letting gravity make it &quot;fall&quot; like blue ice from an airplane. There&#x27;s not only the matter of making it escape the Earth&#x27;s gravity (which is considerable), but also that the Earth and all the garbage on it is already moving in an orbit around the Sun that you&#x27;d have to decelerate from. More likely we&#x27;d end up with a chain of trash comets.')
