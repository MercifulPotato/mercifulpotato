Maybe not the third level. But, ever heard of the phrase &quot;aim for the stars and land in the clouds&quot;? Aim for the third level, and maybe land in the second.<p>I think it is possible to improve ourselves by emulating the people we look up to. Is it something to do with their mentality? Then emulate that mentality. Fake it till you make it. Which is why I think it is a useful exercise to try to improve ourselves in a direction that we may not be headed on currently.<p>Although, to be fair, I do partially see where you&#x27;re coming from. People shouldn&#x27;t try to change themselves for external benefits. But if we really have an internal drive to change ourselves, then I think we do need to look up to people at the third level and try to understand them.<p>Sorry for all the cliched phrasing here.')
