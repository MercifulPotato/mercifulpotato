Occasionally I do a spot of welding at home, but the 38 to 60 hours a week I&#x27;ve spent twenty years doing has made me a <i>vastly</i> better metal fabricator than the few side projects I&#x27;ve done.<p>But I can rant endlessly to you about my other interests, some of which tie in nicely to a wider-perspective-of-life than just metal fabrication, and it&#x27;s those other interests that have proven to set me apart from the pack and advanced my career way more.<p>Could you just ask a person what fun or interesting or challenging things they&#x27;ve worked on, whether in their paid line of work or as a side-project, and leave aside your value judgements about what they do outside of work.<p>Core point: stop thinking <i>your experience</i> generalises to the whole population.')
