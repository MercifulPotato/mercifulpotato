Even wireless scanning, which I did not know was a thing until I got this device.<p>My favorite thing about Brother is they sell the same models for a few years, and then iterate on that model. It massively cuts down on manufacturing issues, number of spare parts, and being unable to web search for a problem.<p>Brother are the Toyota of printers. The MFC-27XX series are the Camrys.<p>I hope to never buy another printer brand again.')
