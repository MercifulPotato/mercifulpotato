My main work experience is at a smaller startup that has a heavy focus on collaboration so my opinion is biased towards that. In my experience trivial things can be solved with a slack message&#x2F;call but I greatly prefer in-person interaction for more in-depth debugging, etc. But I understand how that’s not necessarily applicable to all situations.<p>My main concern, and the reason I posted the above comment, is I think companies may over -correct with hybrid work models. For those that prefer office work a hybrid work model is barely better than a remote-only culture; the office loses its benefits when everyone isn’t there. I’m not arguing these remote-only&#x2F;remote-first cultures shouldn’t exist - in many cases they provide large advantages - but think there will be a significant desire for office-only environments for those that prefer office work.')
