As a manager, you don&#x27;t want to silence people giving you feedback, frankly, this is about as stupid thing as you can do.<p>Better way to deal with complaints is to educate on what kind of complaints are productive and what kinds are destructive.<p>For example, I try (not always succeed) to restrict to myself to only complain about things that I am ready to solve if somebody tells me &quot;go ahead, fix it&quot;.')
