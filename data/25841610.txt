I love every second of lockdown and WFH. It&#x27;s great - didn&#x27;t get a cold once last year, felt great every day without a commute. So many wasted hours reclaimed.  Sure, I do productive things while commuting, but there&#x27;s a big difference between having those hours back fully. and making unproductive hours productive.<p>Best thing that ever happened in regards to work conditions. My only gripe is that so many people fail to understand that &quot;working at home&quot; is different to &quot;working remotely&quot;. I wish people were more willing to jump into a meeting for a 15 minute brainstorming session rather than spend 5 hours working out a problem on Slack.')
