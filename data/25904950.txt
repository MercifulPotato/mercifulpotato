It was referencing Barack Obama specifically. If there had been a black woman president, the phrase would have definitely been written to specifically say &#x27;a black woman in the whitehouse&#x27;. On the other hand, if it had been written before either a black man or a black woman had (tried to) become president, it <i>may</i> have still used &#x27;man&#x27; in a gender less way.')
