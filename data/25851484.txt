The main advantage of a DSLR is getting low light exposures that are in focus, often without the need for a tripod. Looking directly through the lens helps eliminate distractions.<p>Anything more than 6 megapixels is fluff, unless you <i>really</i> like cropping away most of your image. Back in the day, I bought a Nikon D40, instead of the D40x because it had <i>fewer</i> megapixels (but the same size sensor, which meant each pixel on the D40 was bigger, gathered more light, thus was better able to deal with low light).  I wore the shutter out after about 46,000 pictures.<p>I take pictures of things like cities, buildings, trees, etc... I&#x27;m not very good at portraits.<p>I still have some things up on flickr at  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flickr.com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;145132971@N05&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flickr.com&#x2F;photos&#x2F;145132971@N05&#x2F;</a>')
