And various attributes of anyone that might determine whether or not someone is about to retaliate are extremely unknowable without long observation times.  There&#x27;s no possible way to quickly ascertain someone&#x27;s proclivity to violence, agitation level, emotional state, number of guns they really have on hand, willingness to use them, etc.  People will act differently outside of a public setting like work, on a TV show, etc.<p>So as long as guns are as easily available as they are currently, it&#x27;s not unreasonable to expect a law officer to start the interaction in this way which is a manner that protects the officer the most.')
