The construction boom hasn&#x27;t mitigated. Seattle isn&#x27;t doing a good job at chasing money away.<p>I don&#x27;t have skin in the game here, but I noticed this statement, which I think isn&#x27;t right.  You need to consider that commercial construction, skyscrapers no less, take  years.  From conception to funding to planning to approvals to building, the lag is long.<p>So long, in fact that some have come up with the (controversial, not saying it&#x27;s correct) &quot;Skyscraper Index&quot; which argues that historically, peak skyscraper height correlated with the worst economic dips in the economic cycles.<p>Latency is huge.  No one thought up COVID, WFH or even CHAZ when they were standing around plastic models of plastic buildings.')
