For whatever reason, neither phone ever &quot;saw&quot; the other one (despite them being on the same network and physically next to one another). I tried this about 10 times before I finally gave up. (iPhone SE &#x2F; iPhone 12 Pro)<p>What made it more irritating was that you only get one &quot;phone detection&quot; attempt per account transfer process, and you&#x27;re rate-limited on the server side, so I got soft-banned for 24 hours after several attempts.')
