Medical companies tend to have policies in place that will distribute to Africa ahead of richer countries if the richer countries are not seeing outbreaks.  Obviously there is more money in the richer countries, so the early delivery will skew that way. However once enough are vaccinated (from all potentially passed vaccines) that a country can safely open they will start redirecting vaccines to poor countries.<p>Once the world is open the US and UK will be happy to say that they were able to cancel some unused vaccine supply if it turns out not needed.  (which will be easy - between focusing on poor countries and moving production to something else (or winding down) as they recognize the need is gone they will be willing to end those contracts not completely filled. Politically it is a money saving move.<p>Of course the above assumes best (or at least) case. There are many ways things can go wrong. If all approved vaccines need a booster every 6 months things will be very different.  (this is an unlikely but still possible very worst case)')
