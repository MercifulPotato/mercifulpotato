Depending on the job I&#x27;ve had and how late my friends like to go out, I&#x27;ve had sleep schedules in the past ranging from 10pm-6am, all the way to 2am-10am. And they were all fine and healthy.<p>Most adult&#x27;s wake up doesn&#x27;t have anything whatsoever to do with the sun. I don&#x27;t have a &quot;natural&quot; wakeup time. I wake up 8 hours after whenever I went to sleep.<p>So I absolutely get an hour more of daylight with DST because my schedule shifts an hour earlier. Work starts an hour earlier so I wake up an hour earlier. That&#x27;s just how it works.')
