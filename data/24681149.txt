You&#x27;d better get it straight that it&#x27;s not a bunch of boy scouts you&#x27;re up against... We&#x27;re after power and we mean it...<p>There&#x27;s no way to rule innocent men. The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals. Well, when there aren&#x27;t enough criminals one makes them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws.<p>Who wants a nation of law-abiding citizens? What&#x27;s there in that for anyone? But just pass the kind of laws that can neither be observed nor enforced or objectively interpreted – and you create a nation of law-breakers – and then you cash in on guilt. Now that&#x27;s the system, Mr. Reardon, that&#x27;s the game, and once you understand it, you&#x27;ll be much easier to deal with.”')
