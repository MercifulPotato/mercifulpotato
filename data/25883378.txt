Search engines fundamentally cannot pay for the links that they provide. It breaks the whole model. Google is right in saying it would have to pull out of Australia. It&#x27;s not a threat, it&#x27;s a statement of fact.<p>I have worked in SEO for 11 years and am no fan of Google. I think Google over this period has become corrupted.<p>The right avenue to fix what is broken with Google is to go after AdWords &#x2F; Ads. Google should be required to show what each advertiser paid in each auction. Right now, advertisers are often not even bidding against each other but against Google itself. Google Ads is extremely scammy unfortunately and harms small business.')
