Since Windows is non-POSIX, inevitably some things are different, but it doesn&#x27;t take much to deal with this.<p>My .emacs.d folder (now 15 years old, and a bit of a monster, a whole git repo with thousands of lines of nonsense plus a pile of submodules) has no more than a few spot hacks for Windows vs POSIX vs macOS.<p>(The most annoying bit has probably been keeping on top of the font names! - but interestingly these are actually super easy to deal with on Windows. It&#x27;s Unix that&#x27;s the pain in the arse here.)')
