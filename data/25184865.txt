If government policy dictated that population should be increased, then we could have good times. They wont come until then, and the path forward is space colonization for good times again.<p>When the population doesn&#x27;t increase as fast or starts shrinking, there is going to be emotional unhappiness. I know why, but the subject is sensitive to be discussed openly.<p>The other option for increasing happiness is manipulation of the birth rates&#x2F;ratios with mandatory genetic modification&#x2F;engineering. Then people will be more satisfied, while having a shrinking population across the world.<p>Growth in populations masks many problems therefore results in happiness. A decline in population increases unhappiness and exaggerates a problem.<p>But the problem is that a larger and larger percentage of population isn&#x27;t going to get their needs met when the population starts shrinking across the world. There needs to be a mandatory global order for genetic modification.')
