Item(by='reggieband', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602949674, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24806665, text='&gt; We&#x27;re discussing law in the comments here like we&#x27;re all lawyers<p>Even worse, we are discussing the future social effects of changes to law as if we were psychics. Not even lawyers or the best judges could claim to do that correctly. The default position seems to be &quot;revoking Section 230 will ruin the Internet&quot;. I&#x27;m honestly trying to see how and I just don&#x27;t see it. It would change the Internet and it would make certain classes of business more difficult.<p>&gt; Facebook will only become more centralized as other online communication platforms are unable to bear the costs of publishing user generated content<p>I don&#x27;t see a substantial change in Facebook&#x27;s position either way. Is everyone still waiting for Mastodon to usurp it? Or maybe we dream of some young, ethical startup to win the hearts and minds of the globe and show us all how to be benevolent in this space? The idea that Section 230 somehow helps create the conditions that gets us out of the mess we are in is a pipe dream. I would love someone to sketch me out a plan, based around the legal protection around aggregating user generated content provided by the current laws, that slays the beast of Facebook.<p>&gt; Do you trust Facebook to not start censoring links to external websites?<p>Not anymore or less than I trust Facebook to show my posts on anyone else&#x27;s feed. In a world where there is Gigabytes of content generated each day, more content than any human could possibly digest, Facebook necessarily shows you some slice of it. The fact that we don&#x27;t hold them accountable for the slice they choose is frankly crazy to me.<p>&gt; How are content aggregators going to exist? Forums? Chat rooms?<p>Should &#x2F;unmoderated&#x2F; content aggregators, forums and chat rooms exit? This is a fundamental question which I am scratching at.<p>It seems people are making a motte and bailey argument here. They seem to suggest content aggregation couldn&#x27;t exist without Section 230. This is hyperbole. It would mean the platforms that aggregate user generated content would be forced to strictly moderate it or face legal trouble.<p>&gt; How is Google going to exist if it&#x27;s liable for what it links to?<p>That brings us firmly in the territory of law that I am not familiar with. I know there are cases where the question of publishing links and how that relates to content and&#x2F;or copyright is grey. However, what liability I would face if I were to post a link on my own blog to someone else&#x27;s content is something I have no knowledge of.<p>&gt; Meanwhile, all of my other options for discussion will slowly start disappearing as it becomes too costly to continue operating.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this is necessarily true. Outside of reddit and hacker news I can&#x27;t think of any other space I even bother posting anything. The majority of my meaningful communication is done 1-on-1.<p>We&#x27;re treating a specific class of communication as sacrosanct. Not even: I&#x27;m free to say what I want. But rather, I&#x27;m free to create open public spaces where anyone else can post anything they want. We&#x27;re talking about a very specific kind of thing and I&#x27;m unsure if that specific thing is worth having at all.')
