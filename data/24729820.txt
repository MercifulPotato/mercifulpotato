Item(by='LatteLazy', descendants=None, kids=[24735840], score=None, time=1602251058, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24726221, text='I think you are wrong in general, though I am not an American and won&#x27;t pretend I know about the US protests in portland or elsewhere...<p>Why do I think you&#x27;re wrong?<p>The purvue of the FBI needs to be a lot more specific than any crime in the US. We&#x27;ve seen more than enough times that such a wide purvue leaves them ripe for abuse (look up their treatment of MLK).<p>The only practical way for this to happen is for the FBI to actively justify their decisions on what and who to investigate. &quot;Why are these people being investigated?&quot; is a very fair question to ask and one the FBI should happily answer.<p>The only alternative to this is that whoever is in charge (POTUS) gets to decide with no oversight, no checks or balances, and no accountability.<p>We&#x27;ve had that in the past. It didn&#x27;t end well.<p>Respectfully &quot;it&#x27;s their job to do this&quot; is a really bad defense, it&#x27;s the opening line to basically every abuse of power and likely will be part of the defense for all future ones.<p>If the FBI have a good reason to spend time on this, they can tell us and I&#x27;ll happily support it. If they don&#x27;t, they need to stop. But either way, they should not get a blank cheque to use a huge budget and enhanced police powers without having to answer to &quot;we the people&quot;.<p>This should be an apolitical position, whether you&#x27;re right or left, extreme or centrist.')
