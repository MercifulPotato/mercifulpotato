Actual informed people have a good idea of the scale that these funds are operating at, and can understand without context whether $3.7bn is a lot.<p>Even &quot;actual informed people&quot; won&#x27;t necessarily know how much much any given fund has in AUM.<p>&gt;Losing $3.7bn trading stocks in a tech bull-market the likes of which we&#x27;ve never seen is...not good, regardless of the fund size.<p>Actually, fund size is very relevant. Losing $3.7b as a $10b fund will put you in at least 37% drawdown which can put you past a board-controlled threshold at which trading might pause or a re-evaluation of the trading strategies might be triggered. Losing $3.7b on a $100b account is 3.7% which is business as usual really.<p>If you have a machine learning background this analogy might be useful:\nif you&#x27;re building an algo trading strategy then training your model on absolute dollar returns data will be nonsense. What makes more sense is calculating the relative returns or even log-returns because then we&#x27;re encoding an actual relative change.')
