It’s an appreciated effort but I really am that particular about how I like my space and kitchen maintained, much prefer if they nearly place a dish in the sink if they would like to (otherwise I have no issue “bussing”) and resume enjoying themselves with the rest of the guests.<p>Made for an annoying moment once when one guest would not relent on being allowed to clean and made the situation of cleaning my kitchen about them and their life hangups in a weird and inordinate amount. They haven’t been invited back. Bourdain is right: do NOT mess with the cook’s meez.<p>(Also Kitchen Confidential is such a stupidly marvelous book in general)')
