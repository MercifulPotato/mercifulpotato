The effort of digesting vs. producing material is about 2 orders of magnitudes for me. I took 60 hours of lectures (time spent in class) during one of my semesters of undergrad. 12 hours of lecture everyday. That is completely sustainable because all you have to do is listen. Reading papers is the same, it&#x27;s a low effort activity. Something you can do for 12 hours a day. Yes, &quot;advanced academic lecture&quot; is more draining than Harry Potter but less draining than driving a vehicle.<p>2) Working hard (or long hours in the case of academia) vs. working intelligently are orthogonal. I can&#x27;t really address the entirety of graduate school because history is going to be much different than engineering. Applied much different than theory. I&#x27;ll repeat my claim, if you actually take the useful bits of a grad student&#x27;s day, it often compresses to 1-2 hours. Yes, reading is important. Yes, there are often other teaching commitments that are usually treated like second class citizens. I&#x27;m not debating the time spent in an office. Merely, that the &quot;60-80&quot; hour myth really needs to stop.')
