Earth&#x27;s climate alternates between ice ages and greenhouse periods, during which there are no glaciers on the planet. Earth is currently in the Quaternary glaciation, known in popular terminology as the Ice Age.[1] Individual pulses of cold climate within an ice age are termed &quot;glacial periods&quot; (or, alternatively, &quot;glacials&quot;, &quot;glaciations&quot;, &quot;glacial stages&quot;, &quot;stadials&quot;, &quot;stades&quot;, or colloquially, &quot;ice ages&quot;), and intermittent warm periods within an ice age are called &quot;interglacials&quot; or &quot;interstadials&quot;, with both climatic pulses part of the Quaternary or other periods in Earth&#x27;s history.[2]&quot;\n</code></pre>\nLink: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ice_age" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Ice_age</a><p>No matter the cause, no ice in the polar regions is actually the norm. Sure, bad consequences for humanity are real, but in the (very) long run, we would have to face them anyway (if humanity still exists).')
