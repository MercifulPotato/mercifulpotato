I searched a lot of eye-friendly device and reviews, finally I found DASUNG Monitor. Though, compared with ordinary monitors and screens, it’s black and white and lack of color, it’s very eye-friendly for people with dry eyes and eye disease. The clarity of the screen is actually remarkable, and the refresh rate is good enough. Because I bought the one without frontlight, so I need to turn on the light at night, I bought an eye-protection lamp for my mom. All in all, the feedback I received from my mom is relatively good. It turned out that her eyes were always dry and unclear when she staring at her office computer screen and mobile phone for a day at work, she rely a lot on eye drop. After I bought DASUNG Monitor for her, her eyes feel much more comfortable and dry eye eased obviously. She would use the screen as main screen, and make text reports and spreadsheets. Seldom using her normal screen only when she needs something with color. Your eyes feel much more comfortable than using a normal screen after a whole’s work. It’s worth the price!')
