Item(by='arminiusreturns', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611864154, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25945194, text='&gt; The regulators are on the side of the financial institutions since the unusual activity is coming from retail traders.<p>I call BS. I mean you might be right that they are on the side of the institutions, but it&#x27;s not because retail is unusual, it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a big old boys club and they don&#x27;t want the plebs getting uppity. MM&#x27;s exposed themselves by massively naked short selling into very risky territory, which is illegal and what the regulators should be more interested in, as it is what enabled all this to happen in the first place!(1)<p>It&#x27;s well known that the SEC is a toothless wonder that doesn&#x27;t go after the malfeasance right under it&#x27;s nose but loves to go after middle and low end people, with maybe a smattering of high profiles just for the optics (come to think of it, very much like the IRS). The legal system is part of that corruption. So you may be right that the legal positions are shoring up on their side (though I think its very possible you are wrong), but that doesn&#x27;t make it the right, or just, state of things!<p>I think we are living in a moment of history that will lay bare just how abusive and illegally manipulative the whole system is against retail and there is going to be a backlash that isn&#x27;t inconsequential.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sec.gov&#x2F;answers&#x2F;nakedshortsale.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sec.gov&#x2F;answers&#x2F;nakedshortsale.htm</a>')
