And then you have a bag with the old and new protocol and maybe after 20 years you realize it‘s going to take another X years until you have at least some relevant adoption, as demonstrated with IPv6.<p>If one is ever going to „replace“ email it happens on top of the existing protocols and not as a replacement.')
