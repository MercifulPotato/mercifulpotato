It&#x27;s a 7 node mini-cluster, not very expensive (I think about Â£300 fully populated), that fits into an MiniITX-style case with a single small power supply and single ethernet exposed to the world.  You can easily pick the thing up with one hand.  It&#x27;s certainly not powerful, each node is a very modest ARM processor with &quot;only&quot; a gigabyte of RAM and 8 GB of local storage.<p>The alternatives are more powerful, but far more expensive and not very attractive.  Blade server?  Huge, noisy, power-hungry and I wouldn&#x27;t get much change from many thousands of pounds.  Rack of NUCs?  Powerful of course but far more expensive, large, and lots of wiring required.  Lots of VMs running a single machine?  Still more expensive, larger, and not really the same experience as having a real cluster.<p>So these Raspberry Pi clusters fit a niche which is <i>not</i> well served by other solutions.')
