But on Zoom calls, I&#x27;m accidentally interrupting all the time. I think it&#x27;s the slight delay that&#x27;s the problem. I end up mis-judging when my time to speak is.<p>Interruptions on video calls are also significantly worse than those that happen in-person, because the presence of a louder person&#x27;s audio will often completely erase the audio of anyone who was trying to speak at the same time. At least in real-life, you can still catch what the quiet person said amongst the noise if you were paying attention.')
