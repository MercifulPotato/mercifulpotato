The iPhone has a &quot;Walled Garden&quot;, unless you jailbreak, it&#x27;s very difficult to run anything outside the App Store.<p>My Mac? Almost nothing I run is from the App Store. Nothing needs to be from the App Store. Most of what I run doesn&#x27;t even go through Gatekeeper and it certainly never touches software I build or compile myself.<p>If a &quot;Walled Garden&quot; can be disabled by bypassed by a single entry in your hosts file, by running from the command line, or any other number of ways, it&#x27;s a damned short wall around that garden.<p>Lots of valid criticisms of MacOS, but it&#x27;s nowhere in the ballpark of a walled garden.')
