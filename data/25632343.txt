I wouldn&#x27;t assume that at all; it&#x27;s very much not their job, and it&#x27;s not unusual for the courts to cause the government significant trouble and embarrassment. A judge&#x27;s job is to uphold the law, not to be a political actor. And the UK&#x27;s judges, by and large, have a reasonably good reputation for sticking to it.')
