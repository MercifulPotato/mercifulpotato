Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=[25307882], score=None, time=1607109641, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25305626, text='&gt; The essayist even seems to take umbrage that the Dothraki armor looks nothing like Sioux buckskin! Would he take umbrage if they looked alike? You betcha he would.<p>Most historians, and enthusiasts of history like myself, would not take umbrage; instead, they would effuse praise for bucking stereotype and actually doing their research into how these cultures would have dressed. I&#x27;ll point out that the author actually has a lot of praise for CK3 for getting its history details right.<p>&gt; The truth is, GRRM&#x27;s throwaway comment notwithstanding, the Dothraki serve an analogous role to ASOIF narrative as the Huns, Vikings, Kazakhs, Barbary pirates and Mongol raiders did to European history. Are you and the essayist seriously arguing that these ancient peoples are somehow demeaned by the freaking Dothraki?<p>I think your first sentence is unwitting justification of the second sentence. Your understanding of the aforementioned cultures [1] appears to be limited to their raiding effects on &quot;civilized&quot; societies, ignoring other aspects of their society as at best uninteresting and at worst nonexistent. That steppe cultures are reduced in popular history to such a degree is perhaps understandable, but if you&#x27;re taking a position of trying to assert historical accuracy, perpetuating popular history myths is pretty tasteless.<p>[1] Although interesting that you chose to qualify only Barbary and Mongol with pirates and raiders, leaving no qualification for the Huns, Vikings, and Kazakhs. Am I to take away that you believe that the Huns, Vikings, and Kazakhs consist solely of entities predating on settled societies, and that you believe that the Berbers and Mongols had richer cultures with only a subset of these people consisting of such entities? Or should I infer that you are listing known predatory groups, and know the &quot;Barbary pirates&quot; only by that name and not their culture grouping (admittedly, this makes &quot;Mongol raiders&quot; harder to explain)?')
