It&#x27;s become the defacto cryptocurrency and by definition it will only have a set number of coins so the more people want it the more it will go up.<p>It&#x27;s become very easy to buy it so know-how is no longer a barrier. It&#x27;s also an international asset so anyone in the world can buy it. There are still a boat load of technical issues that need to be fixed but those will be fixed.<p>This does not mean that it can&#x27;t collapse every so often but long term it&#x27;s only going up.<p>Don&#x27;t make it your main investment  but buy a little on a regular basis. 10 yrs from now you will be happy you did.')
