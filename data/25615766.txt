I need nfc payment with a bank supporting the whatever (Google Pay or something), GPS with a maps app, LTE with support for whatsapp and calls + sms and bluetooth for wireless buds for calls. Don&#x27;t even need music. Maybe I could even skip NFC payment by having a slot to insert a cut contactless credit card although I like the extra security of having to unlock the device to use Google Pay. I only wish Android smartwatches supported whatsapp voice message sending and weren&#x27;t so slow to the point of being unusable')
