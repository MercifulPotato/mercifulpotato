I come from a place where saying &quot;All &lt;slur&gt; deserve to be killed!&quot; already is illegal and would already possibly land you in prison.<p>Not vaccines though, but that might come to pass as well, since vaccine safety misinformation is basically manipulation that runs vulnerable people into biological weapons and that&#x27;s pretty bad.<p>And life is ... fine. We go on without having the (pretty much uniquely USian) 100 % unlimited free speech.<p>Comparing different places is always difficult - Germany is understandably much harsher at limiting Nazis than US is - but saying there&#x27;s less school shooters and domestic terrorists because of it probably doesn&#x27;t see the whole truth like mental healthcare, quality of education and access to weapons etc.<p>So I&#x27;m not sure what to make of it.')
