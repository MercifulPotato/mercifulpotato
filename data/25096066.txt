The &#x27;recent&#x27; upstarts like Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc are either powered by massive profit engines or endless VC&#x2F;investment money.  Those places can set standards that aren&#x27;t achievable by older companies that have lower margins and need to actually show profits.<p>There is also a cultural difference between hardware engineers, who are usually more &#x27;serious engineers&#x27; who actually engineer things vs software engineers who are often less rigorous in their architecture and design.  HW folks deal with long lead times and can&#x27;t usually fix errors after production, so that creates a vastly different culture.')
