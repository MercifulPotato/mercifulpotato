I wish we would focus on both.<p>How I understand it, how to resolve this would require medical interventions (shutdowns, testing, tracing, therapies, vaccines, etc) and economic interventions (stimulus, deferrals, forgiveness, etc) and yet we seem to mostly be doing the medical ones and getting pushback on it.<p>I could be wrong on this, but I think one of few institutions in this country that can provide economic interventions is the US Congress. They provided one stimulus bill that helped to provide the economic safety net while we worked on the medical safety net. It shocks and angers me that they haven&#x27;t provided another one.<p>I struggle to see why they don&#x27;t provide more economic stimulus. HN, can you help me understand why Congress isn&#x27;t providing more financial help to the country?')
