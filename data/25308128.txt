I&#x27;m not saying that GWB isn&#x27;t competent or anything like that...but is your assertion that if he didn&#x27;t have the name (and inherited wealth and connections), he would have been a viable candidate?<p>Same could be said about the Clinton&#x27;s, so I don&#x27;t think this is partisan.')
