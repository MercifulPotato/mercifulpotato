It&#x27;s really hard to to that calculation as an outsider though. Maybe this project should work with a BEV company to do a preliminary feasibility study of this. They&#x27;ve probably already thought about this though.<p>Edit: It will also become more feasible with energy density increases in batteries. I hope it&#x27;s not entirely unrealistic to expect a doubling in the next 20 years.')
