Especially within the context of a poster who has been making the same attack across hundreds of threads, willing to lie and exaggerate repeatedly along the way.<p>Now, I can hear the free speech brigade on this one, so that should be addressed too. It happens to be the case that members of the armed forces are in a separate category with respect to their 1st Amendment rights. Given that the President is commander in chief of the military, he sits in a place where his speech is of at least the same consequence as a general. Using that speech to interfere with the processes of the US Government, even if credible claims are made, poses a threat to  the nation as a whole.<p>What does he expect to happen? Is it for everyone else to say &quot;Oh, gee, I guess you&#x27;re right after all, let&#x27;s do the election over?&quot; If the process is corrupt, but you believe in the system as a whole, you aim to fix it on the next cycle, not instigate a crisis after losing.')
