(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Autocorrelation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Autocorrelation</a>)<p>Autocorrelation is the algorithm used for Radar (at least, that&#x27;s what my professors told me). When radar bounces off of another object, there are different &quot;echos&quot; of that radar (ex: an object was 10 miles away and 20 miles away: the 20-mile object will take 2x longer to come back). Its messy and everything.<p>The radar input is very messy, full of reflections, echos, and more. But autocorrelation takes all of that information, and tells you where the objects were.')
