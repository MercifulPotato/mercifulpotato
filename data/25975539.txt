I&#x27;m actively locked in a functional alcoholic state and have been on-and-off for almost three decades. I find I can do a month sober but then I just get back on it afterwards.\nI&#x27;ve tried weed of various types and in nearly every form factor but have been unable to shake the potency of it (makes me super paranoid and that&#x27;s not a manageable side effect for me).<p>However, when I do have it, it&#x27;s impossible for me to drink so it&#x27;s hard to look past it&#x27;s effectiveness in trying to treat the root issue, alcoholism.<p>My question to you is, what&#x27;s a small dose for you and how are you vaping it?<p>Thanks again, I am going back on the wagon today so this thread has been particular interesting.')
