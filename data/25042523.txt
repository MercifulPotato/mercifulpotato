Item(by='Retr0spectrum', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604978214, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25040939, text='VT-x itself is not the main attack surface. It&#x27;s all the interfaces between the inside and the outside of the VMs, for example graphics hardware emulation, network hardware emulation, etc. etc. There have been <i>many</i> of these bugs, on qubes&#x2F;xen, and basically every other popular hypervisor. I have personally found a kernel memory disclosure vulnerability affecting xen, which I tested under qubes (it wasn&#x27;t a very useful bug, but the point is, they exist and they are plentiful).<p>Furthermore, the &quot;blue pill&quot; attack is not a vulnerability in VT-x itself. In fact, it does not exploit any vulnerabilities at all - it simply works off the idea that code running in ring n can hide itself from code running ring+1 (the bluepill hypervisor being ring -1).')
