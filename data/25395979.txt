Item(by='octoberfranklin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607752851, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25395973, text='Most of the non-SpaceX blocks are areas that have had terabits&#x2F;sec of fiber running through them for the last decade as part of long-haul intercity links.  Since the <i>last mile(s)</i> of rural fiber is so much cheaper than the <i>last mile</i> of urban fiber [1] this is a massive windfall for the telephone companies.<p>The FCC created some very perverse incentives with this auction. They actually made it more profitable for telcos to leave intercity fiber unused than to splice a strand to serve the neighborhood it passes through, no matter how little the splice would cost.  This led many providers (cough cough CenturyLink cough) to refuse to use or even license their fiber until they could scoop up this cash first.  If even one residence in the block has service above 25mbit&#x2F;sec the whole block is taken out of the auction.<p>I previously submitted a much-less-useful version that was colored by speed tier (there are only four) here:<p><pre><code>  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25368927\n</code></pre>\nThis updated map has all sorts of goodies if you click on the region... stuff like the dollar amount of the winning bid and so forth.<p>[1] 100% aerial, no trenching, no manholes, no ducts, uncongested utility poles, simple (two-dimensional!) property boundaries, terminate at the property line not deep inside a multitenant&#x2F;condoized building.  The conventional wisdom &quot;rural internet is expensive&quot; got turned on its head by the counterintuitive economics of ADSS optical cabling.')
