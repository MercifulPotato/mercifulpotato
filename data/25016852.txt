End of story really.<p>They realized like everyone else this wasn’t a hill to die on and didn’t fight too hard, but did fight a little. Bump stocks were “legal” not by a law or any official regulation, only by the ATF’s previous judgment. The ATF, NFA Tech branch specifically was able at any time to change their mind on this, and that was the reality everyone knew. This is how the ATF operates, “judgments” they often contradict themselves on, not law. Bump stocks were a hot topic for a month and the only supporters that were worth listening to were arguing on grounds of the ATF ability to “determine”, not that they were fans of the product.<p>In the gun world, no one liked bump stocks. So no one was really going to fight for them.')
