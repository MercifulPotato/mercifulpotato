Basically the feedback of the community was positive towards this change - and he seems really happy about it!<p>So now he brings guests with different types of backgrounds, from AI to Quantum Physics, where he dares to ask question about what he thinks are more profound&#x2F;out of the box questions.<p>He knew this shift wasn&#x27;t going to appeal everyone, and that&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s impossible to please everyone, and he saw this path a way for him to grow and explore even though he would lose some following (clearly a small portion).<p>I&#x27;m really happy for him, and it&#x27;s a joy to see someone put themselves out there, to risk it, and grow!<p>And guess what, maybe he left a void to be filled - the same void he filled that allowed him to do his own thing.')
