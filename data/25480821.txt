But they&#x27;ve also been tracking growth of the new strain at the same time. New strain has been responsible for a growing proportion of positive tests. May be coincidence, but they are being cautious.<p>E.g. see graph here<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;The_Soup_Dragon&#x2F;status&#x2F;1340349639946629120?s=19" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;The_Soup_Dragon&#x2F;status&#x2F;13403496399466291...</a><p>Edit: complete conjecture but if new strain is more infectious but less dangerous it might actually be helpful in the long run as it might displace other strains. Fingers crossed')
