E.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1029&#x2F;2018EF000922" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1029&#x2F;201...</a><p>The mainstream “facts and science” does not support the conclusion that climate change will eventually “dwarf everything else” in the economy, not even for hard-hit countries like Bangladesh. The 1&#x2F;3 number for Bangladesh by 2060 is one of the higher estimates I’ve seen, from Asian Development Bank. Others show less than 10%.<p>See also: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;weather&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;19&#x2F;climate-change-could-cost-us-up-percent-its-gdp-by-study-finds&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;weather&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;19&#x2F;climate-ch...</a> (“Climate change could cost the U.S. up to 10.5 percent of its GDP by 2100, study finds.”).<p>10% is a lot! It’s trillions of dollars, and it would be worthwhile to spend a significant amount of money to avoid it. But we need to pay attention to the science.')
