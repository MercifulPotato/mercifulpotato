I suspect that it would happen faster than you think.<p>Furthermore, companies like Facebook have actually made a point to deeply integrate otherwise disparate products (Instagram), solely to later claim it&#x27;d be &quot;too hard&quot; to spin them off if the court orders them to.<p>The simple answer is to continue to fine them until they accomplish the task: If a company goes bankrupt trying to comply with the court, perhaps they shouldn&#x27;t have violated the law so flagrantly in the first place.<p>I think people are too hesitant to admit that companies that violate the law should be eligible for the &quot;death penalty&quot;. It&#x27;s absolutely fine for a very bad company to explode and die once brought to court.')
