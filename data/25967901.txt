There&#x27;s an important distinction between consulting online documentation and googling for &quot;how do I do this very specific thing?&quot;<p>Of course you can&#x27;t build an app without consulting documentation. Why do you think references even exist? Nobody can store all the knowledge in their head.<p>But doing it without the very specific questions (ie. Stackoverflow), that&#x27;s a different question.
