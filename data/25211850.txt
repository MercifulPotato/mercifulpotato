In the olden days we&#x27;d call this an &quot;apprentice&quot;. Today it might be an &quot;intern&quot;, but the general expectation is that only applies to very young workers- not those respelling or making a lateral move.<p>I agree that this is a good idea, but the market won&#x27;t accommodate this kind of labor change without government help. Employers have been able to shift responsibility for training off onto other organizations (i.e. coding bootcamps) to get individuals trained and prepared for jobs. Nowadays, workers themselves largely have to bear the financial burden of training in hopes that they land a good-paying job.<p>What you&#x27;re suggesting essentially places the financial burden of training and skill development back on companies through apprenticeship programs. That&#x27;s not going to happen voluntarily.')
