Item(by='chordalkeyboard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607690545, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25384756, text='Thanks for your reply.<p>&gt; That any person in the long chain of people required for the type of conspiracy suggested would slip up and leave any tangible trace, have a change of heart, leak something, or any person that noticed their name had been used to vote already when they tried to, or any number of other possible evidence.<p>You haven&#x27;t seen the videos [0] [1]? Interesting, did you look for them? Didn&#x27;t the news report on them? Did you see the affidavits? [2] [3] [4]<p>Or do you just interpret all of that in a way that is consistent with your belief that these are all spurious allegations by bad faith actors?<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t expect any Youtube video to provide evidence to begin with, I expect it in court, where over 50 cases have failed to produce a single piece of evidence.<p>Surely you understand that sworn affidavits are evidence?<p>&gt; I make statements about the reality that santa and big foot don&#x27;t exist because there&#x27;s never been any evidence showing they do.<p>You&#x27;ve never seen a video purportedly of Bigfoot? Or did you interpret it as a hoax because of your priors? You&#x27;ve never heard of Saint Nicholas? Or do you think that he never existed because someone told you outlandish stories about him and that colored your perception of the entire thing?<p>&gt; I&#x27;m opposing your suggestion that videos stating something very provable without any kind of evidence is the same thing as what I&#x27;m doing, and I&#x27;ve explained that stark difference.<p>You&#x27;re asserting that there isn&#x27;t any evidence when you&#x27;re actually ignorant of evidence and defending the decision of a major corporation to prevent their platform from being used to share evidence.<p>I&#x27;m not really keen to present evidence myself here because I think its clear that there is no such thing as evidence without interpretation, and most people (on both sides of the issue) have already decided to interpret everything in the way that justifies their biases. I&#x27;m also not convinced that there was <i>enough</i> fraud to change the outcome of the election (although the attorney general of Texas and 17 other states do seem to think so [5]). But there&#x27;s so much purported evidence of fraud it was pretty easy to go get some links so I could disprove the notion that there hasn&#x27;t been any presentation of evidence. There has been enough to raise questions about election integrity. Which is actually where these allegations of bad faith start to become really interesting because the same people saying there&#x27;s no evidence are accusing people of bad faith for their arguments alleging fraud that refer to evidence. So humans being human, basically, which is why I&#x27;m actually much more interested in the epistemological and cognitive issues that arise in this case.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apelbaum.files.wordpress.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;cctv-suite-604-11-03-2020.mp4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apelbaum.files.wordpress.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;cctv-suite-604-...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitchy.com&#x2F;samj-3930&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;04&#x2F;that-is-some-handoff-herschel-walker-shares-video-of-woman-trying-to-hide-handing-usb-drive-to-fellow-election-worker&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitchy.com&#x2F;samj-3930&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;04&#x2F;that-is-some-handof...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;recap&#x2F;gov.uscourts.miwd.99598&#x2F;gov.uscourts.miwd.99598.1.2.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;recap&#x2F;gov.uscourts.miwd.99598&#x2F;...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;recap&#x2F;gov.uscourts.miwd.99598&#x2F;gov.uscourts.miwd.99598.1.3.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;recap&#x2F;gov.uscourts.miwd.99598&#x2F;...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;recap&#x2F;gov.uscourts.miwd.99598&#x2F;gov.uscourts.miwd.99598.1.5.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.courtlistener.com&#x2F;recap&#x2F;gov.uscourts.miwd.99598&#x2F;...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.texasattorneygeneral.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;images&#x2F;admin&#x2F;2020&#x2F;Press&#x2F;SCOTUSFiling.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.texasattorneygeneral.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;default&#x2F;files&#x2F;ima...</a>')
