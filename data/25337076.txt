My guess is, especially in the face of covid, the more access to high speed the better.<p>Would you rather have had those funds going to Frontier and Comcast?  The funds are GOING to be spent, the only question is how.  Not having rural broadband has been deemed an unacceptable outcome by the majority of Americans.  The way the funds have been spent to date have definitely been a mixed bag.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;07&#x2F;fcc-digital-divide-spacex-broadband&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;07&#x2F;fcc-dig...</a>')
