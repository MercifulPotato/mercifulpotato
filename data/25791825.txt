If Dell (I&#x27;m not saying this was Dell), came to you and said: either this chip is 5000 or I don&#x27;t carry ANY of your chips, you give them what they want.<p>To me this shows AMD has learned its lesson: without the OEMs onboard you aren&#x27;t going anywhere.  Selling individual chips to gamers is profitable, but that only goes so far.')
