This is why developing nations do it: it is the easiest way to roll out medical care to people who don&#x27;t normally have it.<p>In the US (and most of Europe...) people have plenty of access to more equipped medical facilities. My local pharmacy that I go to for the flu shot has more drugs than would even fit in a van - even assuming one does of each drug. This is typical for any developed country.  So it makes sense for us to use that existing supply chains as much as possible.<p>Note that West Virginia - the state that has the best record as to getting vaccines into arms stated the key to their success was using the existing pharmacies in the state (not just the big national chains, all the independents). The states that are doing the worst are trying to develop some new infrastructure just for this.')
