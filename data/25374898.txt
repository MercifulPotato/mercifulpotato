This president has not  started&#x2F;entered into a war for the first time since Carter, reformed the criminal justice system to reverse laws that unfairly targeted minorities and non-violent drug crimes (laws supported by Biden when they were passed, btw), presided over a record low unemployment rate and record high wage increases for American workers prior to the pandemic and the media treats him like he&#x27;s the reincarnation of Hitler.<p>Imagine if Obama reformed the criminal justice system, wasn&#x27;t a war monger in Syria&#x2F;Libya and presided over a record economic boom? He&#x27;d be made a saint or something.<p>Go figure.')
