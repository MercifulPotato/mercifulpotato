The problem with the lynch mob is you don&#x27;t get a fair trial. You get punished for whatever the mob says you did, regardless of what the truth actually is. Often what actually happened is blown out of proportion and sometimes its fabricated. Even when true, the &quot;crime&quot; often does not fit the punishment of harassment and &quot;cancel culture&quot;.<p>If I make a dumb racist or sexist joke, I should be told &quot;hey dude, fuck off, that&#x27;s not cool&quot;, not have people calling my employer to tell them how terrible I am, harassing my friends and family or sending me death threats.<p>&gt; My wife wouldn&#x27;t divorce me if a random stranger on the internet accused me of something terrible. ... \nMy employer wouldn&#x27;t dismiss me if a random stranger accused me of something terrible.<p>What if a thousand random strangers harassed you, her, your employer, your family and your friends with all kinds of accusations and death threats? Its not even that your wife or employer believes the mob, but that the stress and pressure becomes too much for them.<p>What if you made a single distasteful joke on twitter and instead of a few people telling you hey, that wasn&#x27;t cool at all, instead you find tens of thousands of people harassing you and everyone you know? This happened to Justine Sacco. She made a very stupid and distasteful joke on twitter, to her 170 twitter followers. It got picked up by a journalist and thousands of people piled on to her. She lost her job because her employer didn&#x27;t want to be associated with the press caused by the mob. According to interviews she suffered from anxiety and mental health issues for a long time after. Yes her comment on twitter was distasteful and racist, but it wasn&#x27;t so bad as to warrant everything that happened to her. I&#x27;ve heard of such bully campaigns that lead to the targets suicide and it wasn&#x27;t even clear if they were guilty of what they were accused of or not (but even if they were, their death is entirely too far!)<p>That doesn&#x27;t seem reasonable to me at all. Quite frankly, I find it shocking how many people are not just ok with but also in support of these modern day witch hunts.')
