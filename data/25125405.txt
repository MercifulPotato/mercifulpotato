However I argue that the value added is so high that the initial curve is worthwhile. I usually start by explaining that Git was made by kernel coders who like low level access, so git hides nothing from you and provides a very generic solution that works for almost everyones use case. GUI tools will cover you in simplest of scenarios, but it&#x27;s a matter of time until you need to do something marginally complex and are left hanging out to dry. I advise not using them at all because the details they hide are the only thing that will help you understand the advanced features.<p>Once you&#x27;re over the hump the system is very intuitive. I liken it to awk or sed which beginners often find incomprehensible, until they understand what the tools do at which point they become simple. There&#x27;s a lot of good resources out there and StackOverflow has almost every question imaginable already asked and answered.')
