The main issue is negative externalities, which are already addressed by the Non-Aggression Principle; i.e. your liberty applies to yourself and your own property, not other people or their property, unless they consent. Libertarian society is not a free-for-all. What little scope for petty conflict remains can be addressed adequately through social means rather than force.<p>&gt; In a well-functioning democracy, the people <i>are</i> the government so the idea of a governmental monopoly is diluted somewhat.<p>Even in the ideal model, &quot;the people <i>are</i> the government&quot; in approximately the same way that individuals cells <i>are</i> a human being. Part of a vast collective, in other words, with no individual influence or control, retained only to serve the collective, and ultimately disposable. That&#x27;s fine for cells in the body but a horrible way to think about sentient beings.')
