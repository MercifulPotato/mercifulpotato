Every PS5 game can use primitive shaders, because the developers know that every PS5 will have them. For a generic desktop PC game release, though, only 1% of all buyers will have a new enough AMD RX Vega GPU, so it doesn&#x27;t make sense to invest much resources into supporting primitive shaders there.<p>That said, pretty much all of the specialized hardware that Workstations used to have in the past is now commonly available everywhere as vertex, compute, or pixel shaders.<p>So in my opinion, the workstation marked died because suddenly everyone gained access to what was previously reserved only for workstation users.')
