Item(by='shakna', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605462532, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25102506, text='&gt;  The only thing that worries me about the domain is lack of reviews about the entity that manages the .ht ccTLD.<p>The country of Haiti? Réseau de Développement Durable d&#x27;Haïti is an autonomous non-profit that acts much like a government department. They&#x27;re actually also in charge of Haiti&#x27;s internet backbone, so are less likely to be inclined to come up with arbitrary rules or suddenly change what is acceptable for the ccTLD. They have bigger concerns.')
