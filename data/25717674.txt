This fear of being accused of racism is intense; as if acknowledging that black people are actually treated worse by our society is actually more harmful than the loss of life that black people experience.<p>This is a preliminary study, and yes, it deserves a followup.  If you&#x27;re saying that preliminary studies should always be kept under wraps and not discussed, that&#x27;s weird and anti-science.  There are a couple of well-understood phenomena that can explain this.  The first is unconscious bias -- it&#x27;s been shown time and time again, across the board with various population differences, and could easily explain this.  Second, bad training data -- if a doctor hasn&#x27;t been trained with black patients, and pictures of black people with various ailments, then they might not recognize symptoms as readily (insert analogy to facial recognition).  Also, a large proportion of black people in the US speak a different dialect than their white counterparts -- the way folks describe their symptoms differs between dialects -- so if a white doctor can&#x27;t understand what their black patient is saying, they&#x27;re operating on less information than a white doctor treating a white patient would be.  Finally, a matter of trust -- psychosomatics are real -- black women know their history, and might not trust a white doctor as well as a black doctor, and that can impact outcomes.  Rebuilding that trust will take generations of trustworthy, good faith efforts to correct the wrongs of the past.')
