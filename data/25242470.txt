Rules let people be held in jail for years while the police &quot;investigate&quot;, and a pliant court system refuses to censure deliberately slow and sloppy investigations by the authorities.<p>It&#x27;s a system which lets governments, and particularly the current government, target political opposition with impunity, instilling fear among other opponents and critics. If you don&#x27;t have strong poliical backing or public prominence, you risk your freedom if you oppose the government.')
