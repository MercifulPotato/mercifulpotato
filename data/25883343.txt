Patreon is a sponsor focused audience.  Everything else is just informational and of declining value to the code authors.  Github is the opposite.<p>That distinction is so important to the people writing the code.  People make all kinds of requests like the sky is falling in.  Sometimes there is chest thumping or big tears about how their concern is more important than everything else even if it is a major distraction and irrelevant to the road map.  Unfortunately, that sort of stupidity amplifies as projects become more popular.  I guess I am fortunate in that case since I am a nobody.<p>If people want to cut to the front of the line and dictate the importance of their concerns they can do so in a sponsor-only channel prioritized by money pledged.  I am a huge fan of that.')
