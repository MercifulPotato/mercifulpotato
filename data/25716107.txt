My employer posted the position in a city 120 miles away from me. I still applied because I figured I could suck it up and do that for a summer. Turns out they needed someone in the exact city I was in because they also operated near my school as well. Also they wanted to extend it year round as well even though the posting just said &quot;Summer.&quot;<p>When you say it comes down to luck, it pretty much does. I&#x27;m fairly certain, if not 100% sure I was chosen simply because I was the only one in my area that applied. All the other positions in the location 120 miles away were filled and nobody wanted to move to my city. So to make things simple, they just chose me, a fresh OOP learned programmer with little to no skills except for writing a basic linked list in java.')
