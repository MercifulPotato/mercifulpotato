Case in point: Amherst MA, college town, tons of great restaurants that probably equal Cambridge or Somerville (not in quantity, but maybe quality).  Also some pretty interesting places in both Holyoke and Northhampton MA.<p>In fact some of the best food &amp; drink I&#x27;ve had was in parts of Nebraska &amp; Missouri and Wisconsin.  You absolutely don&#x27;t need to be in the city to get good food &amp; entertainment.')
