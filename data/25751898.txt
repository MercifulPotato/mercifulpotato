They are different languages with somewhat different long-term goals and very definitely different short-term goals, and these threads are never interesting in anything but a sort of sporting event spectator way.<p>I will just say that while there are a lot of things I like more about Rust than about Go, generics in Rust come at a cognitive cost. They&#x27;re infectious; they don&#x27;t get used the way people say they need them for Go (&quot;I need to be able to sort arbitrary things and have sets of arbitrary types&quot;); they&#x27;re as fundamental to Rust as interfaces are to Go. It adds a lot of additional indirection.')
