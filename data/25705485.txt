It&#x27;s been a while already where they stopped claiming to have USD to back the USDT and are claiming to have &quot;diverse investments&quot;.<p>Why on earth would you believe them now? You probably believed them the first time too :) Do you have the audit? Either way the Tether T&amp;C&#x27;s don&#x27;t actually give anyone holding Tether right to withdraw anything from Tether. Ever. Not assets, not dollars, nothing. There&#x27;s nothing stopping them from running with all of those assets, they may or may not have, legally.<p>Ask their CEO or CFO! If you can find them that is, they&#x27;ve been missing for about a year now, nobody&#x27;s heard from them.<p>&gt; Just in last two weeks the price of BTC basically doubled. ETH as well. Printing _now_ kind of correlates with the price hike. Yes, if we assume that they are completely naked, then all of this printing is fraudulent (whether at 14 or 24B). However, if they do have reserves, this printing does make sense in the overall market.<p>It actually always did. [1]<p>&gt; Anyway, still curious how the 9 trillion printed by the Fed and the 10 million going to &quot;Pakistani NGOs&quot; does not bring you the same outrage as a bunch of people putting their own time, money and effort in crypto projects. Has any bitcoiner hurt you?<p>Money printing is irrelevant. Totally and utterly irrelevant so long as inflation remains on track for 2%. The whole reason for printing was to offset a reduction in velocity of money. You&#x27;re pointing at a system working, that you don&#x27;t understand, and screaming fraud. You&#x27;re basically a financial anti-vaxxer. Everything you need to learn about finance, about economics, is available to you at your local college. The course is called &quot;ECON-101.&quot;<p>Put all the time and effort and money into crypto you want, I know plenty of beanie baby collectors who do the same!<p>&gt; Has any bitcoiner hurt you?<p>Of course not, I made a ton of money on crypto on the run up and sold in January 2018 lol.<p>If you saw someone&#x27;s house on fire, would you say to yourself, huh, that&#x27;s weird, and walk away? Or would you maybe tell people that they&#x27;re about to get seriously hurt.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;JacobOracle&#x2F;status&#x2F;1346133083645476869&#x2F;photo&#x2F;1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;JacobOracle&#x2F;status&#x2F;1346133083645476869&#x2F;p...</a>')
