It&#x27;s totally free!&quot;.<p>- &quot;Looks great. But there are no mirrors. Isn&#x27;t that dangerous?&quot;<p>- &quot;Yeah, but that&#x27;s not a bug, it&#x27;s a missing feature. Besides, we don&#x27;t like mirrors because in all cars they need to be cleaned all the time.&quot;<p>- &quot;Really? Apparently the KDE cars also have mirrors but different technology, and they don&#x27;t need to be cleaned at all. Also, what&#x27;s the difference between a bug or missing feature if a lot of people complain about it?&quot;<p>- &quot;Oh yeah. But honestly we really don&#x27;t like that people have to clean their mirrors, so we prefer not to have them.&quot;')
