It&#x27;s a rather different market, and different sales techniques -- made harder because my FOSS-only distribution model meant I couldn&#x27;t distribute an evaluation version with more restrictive licensing.<p>The non-FOSS pricing is cheaper, but still in the $10K range. My last sale took about 15 months from start to finish.<p>FWIW, I got strong feedback that people wouldn&#x27;t buy it with GPL licensing. It&#x27;s library software designed to be embedded wherever you need it, so I can understand that.')
