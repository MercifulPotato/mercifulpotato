It is like, after centuries of writers writing about it, apply for a patent on &quot;flying machines&quot;.  I understand that patent law may in fact protect such things, broad concepts that innumerable people have dreamt about for decades, but it shouldn&#x27;t.  At most it should grant monopoly to a specific implementation rather than sequester the entire field.<p>On the other hand, let MS have it.  All that science fiction points to such schemes going either going horribly wrong or being sad and pathetic.  Let MS keep shooting that same foot.')
