People are fleeing from Whatsapp because it&#x27;s owned by Facebook (which has one of the worst privacy reputations), because it&#x27;s closed source and because facebook can replace your E2EE private key if they want so the E2EE is pretty useless. Facebook could also use the metadata if they want, which is pretty valuable.<p>Signal on the other hand is a nonprofit run by trusted people like Moxie Marlinspike, it&#x27;s accessible to casual (non-IT) users as well (unlike XMPP) and it&#x27;s fully open-source. It also minimizes metadata, like with the Sealed Sender functionality.')
