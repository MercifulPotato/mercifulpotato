The point is that there&#x27;s always another layer of service providers that can cancel you, some of which are monopolists.  If you think that&#x27;s fine, or &quot;just business&quot;, good for you.  I do not.<p>&gt;<i>What is your point?</i><p>People shouldn&#x27;t be able to put you out of business because they have more power and don&#x27;t like you.<p>&gt;<i>Does that make sense? Again, the analogy is completely missing the point.</i><p>You&#x27;re overthinking things.  For the third time:  &quot;If you don&#x27;t like it, build your own competitor&quot; -- oft-repeated-- is a ridiculous statement in most cases.  No one is going to build their own App Store, Play Store, Facebook..or yes, bus line.<p>I&#x27;m glad you can poke holes in an off-hand analogy though.  It was never intended to be a literal 1-1 translation, with Parler filling the role of Rosa Parks.<p>&gt;<i>They don&#x27;t need to break a law for another business to cut ties.</i><p>This is news.  Thanks.<p>(edited to remove much sarcasm)')
