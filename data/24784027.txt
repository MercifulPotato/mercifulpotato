Often, athletics takes <i>priority</i> over academics, with our high school basketball and football teams being <i>required</i> to take a class during school with their coach that basically amounts to extra practice. And this instead of being free to pursue whatever elective they want; it&#x27;s frustrating as hell. Not to mention that according to the HSAA of my state, they can literally be failing <i>three</i> classes and still play. Which is just utter bullshit! And that&#x27;s on top of the fact that sometimes the players don&#x27;t get home until after 10 on a weeknight, and then still have homework, or have to wake up early the next morning and such on top of all that.<p>Not to mention that schools rushed kids back into classrooms this year partially to help justify them keeping their sports programs running, which just turns me off all the more from (school) sports.')
