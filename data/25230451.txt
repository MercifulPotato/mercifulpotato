I&#x27;m already working professionally and it&#x27;s very helpful to get proficient in some areas, but it&#x27;s hard to force&#x2F;motivate myself to study other non work related topics on my own. The main benefit is that by having a MSc from a reputable organization, I&#x27;d increase my future work prospects. Also there are subjects that aren&#x27;t available as MOOCs, but also the fact that most MOOCs lack the rigour that I&#x27;d wish for, save for a select few, which sadly are about basic introductory topics.')
