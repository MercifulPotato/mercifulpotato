China is not some lawless backwater, despite the fake news bogeyman in recent years. You can get played out just the same by a supplier in Belgium - like any business relationship, you take steps to mitigate the risk, but nothing is ever 100% iron-clad. You should still get a written agreement.<p>*Edit: &quot;Who else do you supply to&quot; is a very common part of interacting with a supplier, and most of the time they are chomping at the bit to share their &quot;famous customer list&quot; with you. In fact, some suppliers even have pages on their website listing who their &quot;authorised resllers&#x2F;distributors&quot; are. Having a chat with any of the others helps, and like any business relationship, it&#x27;s a human relationship with some trust involved. You back things up with legal protections, but in the end, business is about the human aspect of things.')
