Which is still an advantage and provides clear benefits in terms of iteration time over CPU renderers, but it&#x27;s not a complete win, and so far, only the smaller studios have started dipping their toes in the water.<p>Also, the advent of AMD Epyc has finally thrown some competitiveness back to CPU rendering, so it&#x27;s now possible to get a machine with x2 as many cores for close to half the price, which has given CPU rendering a further shot in the arm.')
