I&#x27;m also not sure given what occurred in this instance that you can make some of the assumptions you included within these questions.<p>Also - Tim Pool isn&#x27;t considered &quot;reasonably neutral&quot; by any stretch of the imagination. He is a very unnuanced commentator, his bias is hard to ignore, he tends to cherry pick data and often misrepresents opposite views, aside from that he is very inconsistent. If you do recommend people should check sources, I&#x27;m with you but Pool really isn&#x27;t a particularly reliable one for factual accuracy, summaries or analysis.')
