I think for someone who &quot;doesn&#x27;t care about openness&quot; would at least benefit from that in the architecture. It means the same compiler can be used to bootstrap things and simple steps can be added to greatly optimize specific types of code, like AI stuff. This board really stands out in AI performance.<p>Also, having things open means that the supply-chain can be more stable, with less chances of a single glitch in the system halting deliveries for any time. This is driving a lot of interest in RISC-V right now.')
