But note that it&#x27;s a <i>different</i> point from the one that I was responding to. If the purpose of having volunteers build the houses before becoming lifetime donors is due diligence--them gaining trust in the process--then it doesn&#x27;t matter how efficient they are at building the houses, because the tradeoff is not them building houses vs. whatever more productive work they could have been doing with that time and energy. Nor is it about having to overcome any irrational quirks of human psychology, giving the donors &quot;personal connection&quot;, etc. The tradeoff is the donors having trust in the process vs. not--i.e., them gaining the information they need to <i>rationally</i> believe that their donations will accomplish the end goal, vs. not. In short, it&#x27;s a perfectly <i>rational</i> investment of time and energy for the donors, even if they are terrible house builders.')
