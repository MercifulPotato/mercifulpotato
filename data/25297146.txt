I have use for something exactly like minisketch but need to interface it with JavaScript. I&#x27;ll take a stab at it with Emscripten.<p>Can you point towards other performant algorithms? IBLT, from the minisketch GitHub readme at least, seems wasteful in terms of space.<p>If you&#x27;re aware: What&#x27;d be a comparable data structure to Pin Sketches for membership checks (whether &quot;X&quot; exists in a set of, say, 100M records). Minimal Acyclic Finite State Automata (MA-FSA) and Succinct Tries come to mind but those aren&#x27;t optimal though deterministic.')
