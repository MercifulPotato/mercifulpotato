At least, if you&#x27;re reducing sleep so that you can spend more waking hours on billable work, you should probably take a step back!<p>And I assume the starting point, 5h on $3, was an exaggeration. There&#x27;s time for saving money, and there&#x27;s money that&#x27;s worth the time to save. My point really is that 5h doing non-work hobbies, spending time with family, or whatever, isn&#x27;t a &#x27;cost&#x27;. Not even necessarily an opportunity cost, since for that there had to be abundant supply, that doing it now doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re not doing it next week, that there&#x27;s always more already lined up &#x27;for free&#x27;.')
