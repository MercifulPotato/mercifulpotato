It&#x27;s pretty much standard post-2000s republicanism; there&#x27;s nothing hateful in here, nor are there any binding conclusions on what to do. Just a reiteration of a common GOP take on American history.<p>About the only bit that you could even call somewhat contentious is the content about identity politics at the end, but it&#x27;s not like there anything racist or anti-diversity or whatever in there as far as I can tell. The document has been really carefully written in that regard.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what big thing coming you&#x27;re worried about. Panic less.')
