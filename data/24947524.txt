The curriculum is just as valuable for bootstrappers! It&#x27;s all about validating a problem, getting users, planning your time, etc.<p>The core curriculum doesn&#x27;t have anything about trying to get investors. There&#x27;s one video about what YC looks for in a startup application, but even that&#x27;s still useful for a bootstrapper (clarity of thought).')
