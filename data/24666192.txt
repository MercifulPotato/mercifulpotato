My first thought exactly.<p>Iff this laser trickery worked permanently, then you&#x27;d basically have a prototype Star Trek replicator right there. Feed garbage in, out comes something useful.<p>If the laser trickery worked temporarily (say, on the timescales of minutes), then perhaps this could be a small step towards creating Star Trek style holograms.
