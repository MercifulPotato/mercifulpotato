This doesn’t make the original shares any less valuable, because they still have the same cash flows.<p>Imagine someone conjured a new company, called Tesla-2, out of thin air. It’s future profits and dividends exactly match Tesla. Why should this make TSLA any less valuable?<p>If people are investing in TSLA for the company’s long term viability, the existence of TSLA-2 should be a good thing for holders of TSLA. Now they can buy even more. It’s only bad if people are buying TSLA as a speculative asset to flip to a greater fool. Which is why short selling is such an important mechanism to prevent speculative bubbles.[1]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;j.1540-6261.2006.00868.x" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onlinelibrary.wiley.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;abs&#x2F;10.1111&#x2F;j.1540-6261....</a>')
