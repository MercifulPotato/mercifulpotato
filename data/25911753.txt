But that doesn&#x27;t mean that journalists (or anyone else, as that&#x27;s important in many non-journalistic contexts) don&#x27;t or shouldn&#x27;t have opinions.<p>Rather the goal should be to <i>report</i> the facts without bias.<p>That may sound like hair-splitting, but it isn&#x27;t.  We&#x27;re humans and we all have opinions, biases and ideas of our own.<p>But when it comes to reporting news or just facts&#x2F;results (e.g., revenue figures, safety&#x2F;efficacy testing results, etc.) the idea is to consciously set aside those biases.<p>Some do that better than others, which prsents an arbitrage opportunity that allows those with no desire or intention to report honestly&#x2F;factually to insert blatantly false and&#x2F;or misleading information.<p>Quality reporting of news and fact doesn&#x27;t require a lack of opinion or bias about the subject at hand.  Rather it requires the desire, willingness and ability to set aside  those things in support of trustworthy reporting.<p>There are many reasons why that arbitrage opportunity exists, but the existence of opinions on the part of those reporting isn&#x27;t a major contributor, IMHO.<p>As the old saw goes, &quot;opinions are like assholes.  Everyone has one.&quot;')
