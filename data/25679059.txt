I want to move the money around so I don&#x27;t spend it and I know I have enough to pay my bills.  I don&#x27;t want to see $1,000 and think &quot;I&#x27;m going to spend that&quot;.  Similarly, I don&#x27;t want to see a charge come through for a bunch of bills that I don&#x27;t have enough money for.<p>2.  In Simple&#x27;s app, if you overspend in an expense or goal, it takes it out of your &quot;safe-to-spend&quot; amount (think: your total spending money).  It notifies you that you &quot;overspent&quot; so you can move money around in your little envelopes to fix it.<p>3.  In Simple&#x27;s case, you have one literal checking and up to  two literal savings accounts.  The expense&#x2F;goal &quot;envelopes&quot; are virtual buckets in the checking account, not actual accounts with account&#x2F;routing numbers.  In the past, I&#x27;ve used many literal checking&#x2F;savings accounts for this purpose.')
