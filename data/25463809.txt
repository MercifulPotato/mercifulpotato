Folks on DEX&#x27;s are mainly power users.<p>Also there are two reasons why DEX&#x27;s have high volume:\n- Long tail of assets are only on DEX&#x27;s. Average retail isn&#x27;t buying these\n- DEFI protocols utilize DEXs. I would argue most of the volume isn&#x27;t people trading, rather automatic trading to support protocols like Yearn.finance')
