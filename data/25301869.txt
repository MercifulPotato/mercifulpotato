It’s just a very poor examination. It makes all types of assumptions about climate in a land where the seasons lasted years and were unpredictable in their length.<p>We don’t know which parts Martin was inspired by. To\nmake broad assumptions while ignoring facts like the mysterious ways seasonality worked in this fantasy land makes for an incoherent and nonsensical critique of Dothraki garb.<p>At no point does Martin even use any earthly culture as exposition.')
