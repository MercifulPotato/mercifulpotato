Item(by='jack_arleth', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602059688, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24694565, text='Some comments have touched on some possible issues such as the swapping of key-frames of someone else&#x27;s face and possible funky effects by introducing other faces and or objects into the camera image.<p>But I haven&#x27;t seen anybody touch on the compute cost required to implement this. As I&#x27;m not in the machine learning field I don&#x27;t have a good idea what the compute cost is for something like this. Can anybody chime in on that?<p>If this &quot;codec&quot; were to require a somewhat beefy gpu I don&#x27;t see the benefits at all. Current H264 is usually done by hardware decode and sometimes even encode. In areas where bandwidth is constrained I would imagine a lack of computing resources, thus nullifying the entire premise. That said, in current times it would save a substantial amount of data transmitted. But I&#x27;m not sure if we should lock-in our entire videoconferencing system to nvidia just to save some bandwith.')
