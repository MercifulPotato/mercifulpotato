Remember when your parents said &quot;everything is moving so quickly, and it&#x27;s not getting better&quot;? You&#x27;re now reaching a point in live where you wish for simpler times.<p>Apple is not perfect. I also agree their quality is getting worse. I understand why people say that everything used to be better. But their customers can now do things with their hard- and software that we couldn&#x27;t imagine 10 years ago.
