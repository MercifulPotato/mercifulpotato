Besides fs permissions being a complete mess, the unstable behavior described here liked to show up at the most inopportune moments. Wound up confining my work to the virtual Linux fs, but that kind of defeated the whole purpose of WSL for me. I&#x27;m also back to using a VMware machine on my company owned laptop, but my personal systems are still Linux on bare metal. As an aside, I struggled with Hyper V to replace VMware, but it makes the system unstable on the particular Win 10 builds my company provides employees. I&#x27;d gone at least 8 years not seeing a blue screen before that.')
