Item(by='codethief', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607037078, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25296224, text='&gt;  The graphs on this article do not appear to show that the U.S. has decarbonized as much as Germany. I guess I’m missing something?<p>No, I don&#x27;t think you are. Unless I&#x27;m missing something, too.<p>Here&#x27;s another curious thing: The article says<p>&gt; Meanwhile, during the same 20-year period, the United States reduced the share of fossil fuels in its primary energy consumption from 85.7 percent to 80 percent, cutting almost exactly as much as Germany did.<p>…but looking at the graphs, they didn&#x27;t <i>actually</i> cut anything. It&#x27;s only the <i>relative</i> share in the States&#x27; primary energy consumption that decreased but it only did that because the total consumption <i>increased</i>. The absolute amount of fossil energy consumption in the US hasn&#x27;t really changed since 2000.')
