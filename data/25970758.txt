And as Cancel&#x2F;Interrupt to the late 1960s at DEC and of course Bell&#x2F;UNIX.<p>Apple (really Xerox&#x2F;PARC in this case) needed a key combination for &quot;Copy&quot; in their first GUI, and decided not to break the usability of that preexisting standard (and all of the other Control chars, some of which are still useful today).<p>Microsoft Windows came along shortly afterward. They <i>copied</i> Apple&#x2F;Xerox&#x27;s choice of C&#x2F;X&#x2F;V for Copy&#x2F;Cut&#x2F;Paste in the GUI, but they broke the well-established standard meaning of Ctrl+C in the process. (IIRC, this is especially ironic because they were also breaking the meaning of Ctrl+C from MS-DOS.)<p>And sure, Microsoft then went on to become dominant, and by virtue of their dominance created a huge number of people who believe that the misuse of Ctrl+C for Copy is &quot;standard&quot;.<p>But it still breaks functionality. Then and today, 35+ years later.<p>&quot;Copy&quot; should be the same action in all applications. If it is not, the OS&#x2F;GUI is failing the user.')
