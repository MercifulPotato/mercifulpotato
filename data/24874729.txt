I’m personally for it to provide a baseline load for other renewables.<p>But let’s not pretend like there are no risks anymore. Although in a theoretical setting we have reactor designs that are safe, in practice plants can be mismanaged and unexpected disasters can strike. People also thought Chernobyl and Fukushima were safe before they weren’t, and the price for getting it wrong is so high.<p>One thing I’d like to know is why there isn’t more research into thorium reactors, when I looked into some years ago it seemed like a much safer technology, so I was missing the reason why it wasn’t getting nearly as much funding or attention.')
