You don&#x27;t get to dismiss violence simply because you have sympathies with a particular cause.<p>I condemn all extremist violence and rehtoric. I have no sympathies with supporters of Trump, let alone the subset of his base living inside a Q fantasy. However, I feel I&#x27;m going insane seeing the differing standards applied to groups based on political party association.<p>But have at it, you deserve everything you get. Continue to call your opponents Hitler and Nazis while condeming dark and inciting language. Continue to support domestic terrorism from some groups while wretching at the sight of it from others. It&#x27;s your society, destroy it in whichever fashion you feel gratifying in the moment. Dehumanise at will.')
