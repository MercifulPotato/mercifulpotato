They&#x27;re too slow this gen to be able to do this all without problems. So games would put various re-used assets in multiple places in the game&#x27;s file bundles so that when you&#x27;re in section A of the game it can access that file with all the other files of section A. And likewise it puts a duplicate in section B so that when you&#x27;re in section B it doesn&#x27;t have to seek to section A&#x27;s files to find it, which would be slower.<p>It sucks and caused some bloat in current gen games due to the duplication. Hopefully with these fast next gen SSDs that disappears.')
