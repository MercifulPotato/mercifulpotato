Gerrymanders often are designed to violate this (for example, chopping up liberal Austin, Texas so that parts of it are in five separate congressional districts, each of which has a suburban majority).<p>It would also be an improvement to increase the size of legislatures to reduce the potential for gerrymandering. The UK parliament has 650 members, each representing 102.5k people.  The US House has 435 members, each representing 754.5k people.  The number is set by law and can be easily changed.  Make it 1000.  It would then be much harder to game things so one party can wind up with 80% of the seats with 50% of the vote.')
