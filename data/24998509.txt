Which specific results significantly diverged from the range of possibilities that the polls indicated?<p>I don&#x27;t recall any major surprises in electoral college results. The only state results that differed from 538 predictions were Florida and maybe Georgia, but both of those were rated as toss-ups. Most states seem to be within a few points of the polling average.<p>The national popular vote currently has Biden a few points below the prediction, but I expect he will make up those points when California makes it through the 4 million votes that they still have left to count.<p>I feel like people saw the high probability of a Biden win and expected that would mean it would be called early on Election Day, but people analyzing the polls said that would only happen if Biden overperformed polls. For the most part, things went exactly as predicted. Yes, a lot of polls were off by a few points, but that is to be expected. Yes, the errors were correlated with other and were not independent, but that is also to be expected.')
