Like 6.2% unionised in private industry and that tends to be more in other industries.<p>I find it hard to blame them for this later migration.\nHell if you&#x27;d take their lobbying on foreign policy they&#x27;d probably be fairly protectionist.<p>At the end of the day I think the major dealbreaker is that everything in china whether it&#x27;s low skill labour or high skill labour like engineers automating things is cheaper and that the capabilities exist. (Some part of bumfuck Africa or SEA might also be cheaper but not have these capabilities)     \nThere&#x27;s also plenty of competition there driving those prices down vs...well what&#x27;s left in the US and EU.')
