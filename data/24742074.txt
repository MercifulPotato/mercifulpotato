This would cause pressure buildup in the tank that would trigger the shut-off when putting gas in. It was really frustrating just adding $5.<p>This also illuminated the SES light and, more importantly, would have resulted in a failed emissions test. Instead of spending $250 on a new one I hit the old canister with a hammer to break up the charcoal and it was all good.<p>Edit: Service Engine Soon')
