It actually requires effort to run up a visible sweat while biking (other than where you’re seated).<p>2) If you have a reasonable bike network, everywhere in a city should be easily accessible via bike no matter where you need to go. It’s far easier and cheaper to build new bike access than new car access. And converting a lane is a matter of signs and a few cones.<p>3) If a place has a reasonable bike network you can actually use the several hundred dollars a month on gas and car insurance and the depreciated value of your car to probably move in closer to where you work.<p>4) An average biking speed for a fairly average beginner is something like 13-14 mph. That’s about 20kmh. So your 10km distance is about 30 mins. And you’re military. It’s likely you could go 50-75% faster without breaking a sweat.<p>5) The discrepancy between men and women (and likely ethnic minorities) is entirely due to a lack of infrastructure. Everywhere there is good bike commuting infrastructure the disparity diminishes. Making biking safe eliminates gender disparities at least.<p>There are many countries that are doing this successfully. It’s not a unique or novel concept. There may be American cities that are so sprawled out that it doesn’t make sense, but even there there’s value within city downtowns.<p>And all of the above is for regular normal bicycles. Add ebike and pedal assist to the mix and the argument becomes way stronger.')
