That said, I do actually read the briefs and opinions myself in interesting cases--such as Google v Oracle, or the election related Kelly v PA and now TX v PA.<p>I don&#x27;t know who Ron Coleman is, but doing a brief internet search, I would say that you should trust my judgement more only in the regards that I actually give explanations behind my beliefs that can be compared with other explanations to judge if I&#x27;m accurately representing the state of affairs, and to decide for yourself which explanation is more persuasive.')
