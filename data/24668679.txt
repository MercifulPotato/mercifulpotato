Population is not a relevant factor. Violent crime is the relevant factor. The amount of violent crime committed by members of a group is what correlates to higher shootings of that group.

One group of black people has only 1 out of 1 million people drowning. You might say wow white people have a drowning problem, they can&#x27;t swim. But, in this case race is irrelevant.
