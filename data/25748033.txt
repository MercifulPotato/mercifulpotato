That is, that&#x27;s the nominal version that&#x27;s distributed by the system and has all sorts of backported patches, especially but not exclusively for bugs with CVEs. For example, 3.10.0-1160.11.1.el7 is relatively recent, being updated 30 November 2020.<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s possible to download any version of the kernel sources and build it, but the chances of having a system that boots into a 5.x.x kernel under RHEL or CentOS is pretty small.')
