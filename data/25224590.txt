I started a new project with a colleague and we wrote a nearly 1000 line Markdown readme with code examples of best practices, patterns etc before we brought on 4 other engineers to the team (who were new to the company). But it quickly became old and out of date as we worked through the project.<p>So more specifically, I know that one strategy is to just make time to keep it up to date, but I do think there is more to it than that. One aspect was out of date code examples - referring to old line numbers or old patterns that we reconsidered. I think some of that could be automated, and it made me wish for or wonder something better.')
