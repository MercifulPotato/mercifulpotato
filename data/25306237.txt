Item(by='dventimi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607108367, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25290339, text='Many commentators seem to be getting hung up on &quot;stored procedures.&quot;  That&#x27;s understandable given the title of the original post, but it&#x27;s also unfortunate because it mixes independent concerns:  business-logic in the database, and using stored procedures.  You can do the former without the latter, and in my experience it works better:<p>* custom data types and domains\n* use schema and namespaces\n* foreign key constraints\n* check constraints\n* default values\n* views\n* functions (not stored procedures)\n* triggers<p>In my experience, you can get a clean, efficient, easily-understood data model and application with those ingredients, without ever having to touch a stored procedure, a looping construct, or a conditional statement.')
