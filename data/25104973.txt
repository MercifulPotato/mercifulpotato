But so does a new ICE ban.<p>Caifornia has passed a 2035 ban, but it has flirted with a carbon tax too in parts.<p>Canada has a carbon tax, and a 2040 ban. Australia had a carbon tax, with no ICE ban, but to our eternal shame repealed it when a conservative government regained power. India has an ICE ban scheduled and a carbon tax. Norway has their aggressive 2025 ban, but has had a carbon tax that covers about half their emissions since the 90s.<p>The EU doesn&#x27;t have one yet, but I would bet a lot of money they will by 2030.<p>It&#x27;s not clear to me that they&#x27;re all that different in terms of political will required. The same countries are interested in both.<p>Although the specific level of tax that can be passed on carbon may not be sufficient for the desired result. An ICE ban is in theory blanket, although exceptions are going to creep in.')
