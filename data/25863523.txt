Some of my coworkers like it, but there are a few out there who basically don&#x27;t want to learn something new.. I have been using Ramda professionally for about two years now and I love the heck out of it. My org is using more and more TypeScript which makes using Ramda a little harder but it still works pretty well in this context too. I have been working on a test data inventory project with Ramda recently and it has made the implementation so much nicer than it would have been otherwise. I started using pipeP (by defining it with pipeWith) and omg it&#x27;s so great for dealing with a mix of async and non async calls.')
