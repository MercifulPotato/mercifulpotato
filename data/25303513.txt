He resigned of his own free will, against the Mozilla board&#x27;s request that he stay. His own words and the Mozilla FAQ quoted below, I&#x27;m not just making this up.<p>Down the following thread, Brendan suggested googling &quot;constructive separation&quot; -- but I&#x27;m not sure if he meant for that euphemism to apply to how he left his job at Mozilla, or to how he wanted to cancel and destroy existing happy same sex marriages in California against their consent. All of the google results have to do with marriage, not employment. Brendan, care to clarify?<p>As JavaScript proves, Brendan Eich never really understood the concept of equality: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dorey.github.io&#x2F;JavaScript-Equality-Table&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dorey.github.io&#x2F;JavaScript-Equality-Table&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24127716" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24127716</a><p>DonHopkins 3 months ago | on: Mozilla lays off 250 employees while it refocuses ...<p>Eich was not forced out or fired. In fact, just the opposite: the board actually tried to get Eich to stay, but he decided to leave all on his own. Don&#x27;t try to rewrite history to make an ideological point. It&#x27;s all very well and unambiguously documented what really happened, and there&#x27;s no excuse for you spreading that misinformation.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.mozilla.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;04&#x2F;05&#x2F;faq-on-ceo-resignation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.mozilla.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;04&#x2F;05&#x2F;faq-on-ceo-resignat...</a><p>Q: Was Brendan Eich fired?<p>A: No, Brendan Eich resigned. Brendan himself said:<p>“I have decided to resign as CEO effective April 3rd, and leave Mozilla. Our mission is bigger than any one of us, and under the present circumstances, I cannot be an effective leader. I will be taking time before I decide what to do next.”<p>Brendan Eich also blogged on this topic.<p>Q: Was Brendan Eich asked to resign by the Board?<p>A: No. It was Brendan’s idea to resign, and in fact, once he submitted his resignation, Board members tried to get Brendan to stay at Mozilla in another C-level role.')
