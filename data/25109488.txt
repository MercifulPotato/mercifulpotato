There&#x27;s no objective authority that decides X is right or Y is wrong, simply social&#x2F;cultural influences throughout the world.</i><p>Worth remembering that it&#x27;s also not the case that every person has different morality, and everyone&#x27;s moral values are uniformly distributed across the space of possible values.<p>No, the moral values of humans are all <i>very strongly correlated</i>, both within and across societies. We spend a lot of time bikeshedding the details, but we essentially have a shared sense of what&#x27;s right and wrong.<p>(I hypothesize it&#x27;s because we all have the same brain architecture - the basic moral sense is encoded in firmware, and through culture we adapt it to fit the environments and societies we live in.)')
