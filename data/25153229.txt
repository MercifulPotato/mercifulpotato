The USA picks sides but we don&#x27;t have to. And I don&#x27;t care if they say insensitive things or whatever. War is way bigger than words and both of them commit atrocities, that much is obvious. Both of them can also see history from a certain perspective and justify themselves, and I can see that in both cases also.')
