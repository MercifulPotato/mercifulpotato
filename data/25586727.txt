There isn’t a good reason to exclude them from comparison. Even so, working for a startup without equity is often more lucrative than working for the federal government. The situation is even worse at the state and local level where you also have to fear your pension being raided via government bankruptcy.<p>I’m talking about actual government employees, not contractors. The actual government employees who manage those contracts are not paid well. You can see the results of this too in things like the F35 program where the government had no idea what it wanted and repeatedly redirected and added crazy requirements (to be fair, Lockheed is also incompetent).<p>You’re right though, painting even a majority of public employees as incompetent isn’t fair.')
