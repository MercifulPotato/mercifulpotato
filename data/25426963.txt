Test would make it easier to become ripped but youd be aiming for well above average body at that point.<p>Edit: I do agree though there is a huge gap where it&#x27;s accepted that woman can cheat in basically every way physically possible to look better and it&#x27;s encouraged but men can&#x27;t do more than work out or it&#x27;s ridiculed. It doesn&#x27;t help that rampant steroid use in Hollywood gives people unrealistic expectations of what&#x27;s achievable by a guy with a full time job on top of that. I don&#x27;t think test is needed to beat out the average overweight guy though.')
