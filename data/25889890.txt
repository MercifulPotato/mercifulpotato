I&#x27;d love to read the SD card repair post, because I have a Model 3B+ which died four weeks after I bought it in a quadcopter accident. My suspicion is that the problem is solely with the micro SD card reader as the card was bent in half when I retrieved it. The power LEDs still turn on, but USB boot doesn&#x27;t appear to be working either.')
