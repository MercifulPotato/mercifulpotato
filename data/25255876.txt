Now maybe we also get decent (static) structure information for these. But the interaction of a virus with the host cell is much more complex. There is much more than just an amino acid sequence involved. And these parts are all moving, so a static picture as we now can create faster than before does not contain all the information necessary to fully understand the functions.')
