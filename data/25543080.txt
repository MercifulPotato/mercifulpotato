Japanese products were known for being cheap and unreliable until international brands like Sony started to come up. China is also going through this process and brands like Huawei and Xiaomi are already trusted by many international consumers.<p>Also an irony of you mentioning Germany is that many German companies have actually been bought up by Chinese capital in the recent years.')
