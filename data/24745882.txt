See the ticker GME, someone with a pristine record predicted a GME pop following a console deal before the second COVID wave. Somehow he timed it perfectly (GME &#x2F; Microsoft partnership annouced less than an hour after that post). That was a good DD and  people apparantly made good money. Then it was followed by a tremendous amount of other poor posts (yolos, shitpost and &#x27;gut feeling&#x27; DD) AFTER the surge. Without any information it is rather difficult to distinguish between the &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;bad&#x27; ones. There are some people tracking performances of different authors but I did not get to see an exhaustive study that would conclude one way or another.<p>Edit: ok nevermind the GME DD exemple. I tried to find it to link it here, but it is now deleted. People are claiming the author was a Microsoft Insider. Disclosing that info was highly illegal. I don&#x27;t know what would be the legal ramifications of trading on illegal info when you don&#x27;t know that said info is illegal. But I knwo that being investigated by a 3 letters agency is something you want to avoid.')
