Item(by='Silhouette', descendants=None, kids=[24693761], score=None, time=1601942274, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24693270, text='I&#x27;ve been driving for decades, and I&#x27;ve had many of the problems other comments have mentioned that make life tough, and yet to my knowledge I have never fallen asleep at the wheel or caused any sort of accident. There certainly have been a few times when I was expecting to drive but clearly wasn&#x27;t fit to and had to make other arrangements.<p>And, in the gentlest possible way, if you were unable to recognise that you were so tired that you were likely to fall asleep while driving and make another choice, you <i>were</i> demonstrably unfit to drive at that time. It might have been understandable, particularly if you were young and inexperienced, but you still shouldn&#x27;t have driven at that time and your actions were still irresponsible and dangerous.<p>Anyway, I think I&#x27;m done with this discussion. There are several posters here who are literally arguing that it&#x27;s OK to drive knowing that they are severely impaired and have a much greater risk than any normal person would of injuring or killing someone. I can&#x27;t argue rationally against such an irresponsible and selfish position, and my blood pressure has probably gone through the roof reading all of these comments and thinking of all the people who would disagree with them but can&#x27;t because they&#x27;re dead.')
