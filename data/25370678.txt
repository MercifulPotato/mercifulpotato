All this stuff gets reported by telemetry because they know exactly how likely it is that a first attempt flight will fail catastrophically (very). So these test rockets are heavily instrumented and networked. Watching it the first time I also thought one of the engines had failed but then that engine had a successful relight and another did not, and the fuel mix ratio appeared to be wrong on one of the engines. This is all consistent with loss of propellant (there was a quite significant leak after the first fire in engine bay) and not consistent with &quot;engines ate themselves alive&quot;.<p>Your greater point about it being better to land than not land stands, but these are experimental rockets. They&#x27;re expected to fail catastrophically and you plan accordingly.')
