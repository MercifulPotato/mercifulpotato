And I won&#x27;t dispute the need for a minimum standard of efficacy.<p>However, if anything, the problem that we&#x27;ve had over the last 60 years is setting the standard of efficacy too high. This caused the Better than the Beatles problem, and placed Pharma companies in an impossible situation where they have to run faster and faster just to stay in the same place.<p>Moving forward, if we&#x27;re not going to lower the efficacy standard, then the questions that Scannell raises about model validity and the search problem writ large become even more pressing and important.<p>On the other hand, if we&#x27;re not going to solve the search problem, then the pragmatic solution would be to lower the efficacy bar somewhat so Pharma companies can at least create slightly less effective but way cheaper drugs.<p>In theory, we should be able to do both. In practice, we&#x27;re likely to get one way before the other. The current path we&#x27;re on of fewer drugs and higher prices is simply unsustainable.')
