Europe, and a team to do generic design work in Asia and the prices are ridiculously low and the quality is good. It&#x27;s not a place to do advanced work (it can be, but you have to dig for that) - and although it means &#x27;more work can be done&#x27; and an expansion in some ways, I can only feel for the pressure on wages locally for tech-related work.<p>Folks, if they can remote you in Utah, they can also remote someone else in Kiev, and this is a very material thing to consider.<p>This is going to be hugely impactful for trade negotiations in the future because what we have now will be a &#x27;race to the bottom&#x27; for labour laws, working conditions, etc. and large corporations will be very happy to &#x27;not think about&#x27; how much of that cost is simply be externalized, off the balance sheet. &#x27;McCorp&#x27; does not care that there is no financial oversight, shifty accounting principles, meagre commercial law, limited human rights in &#x27;Country XYZ&#x27; - all they will see is the direct issues: labour input costs, and then maybe the &#x27;quality of outcomes&#x27; but even that is sometimes secondary.')
