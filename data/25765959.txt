Hyper partisan, hyper biased, contains no facts, flippantly suggests mass censorship of opposing viewpoints, flippantly puts out massive blanket statements dehumanzing and generalizing half of the population, it reads like pure propaganda.<p>It&#x27;s so &quot;interesting&quot; that you didn&#x27;t consider what the left did this summer a &quot;danger to society&quot; worthy of repercussions, where they spent month after month rioting, burning down American cities, LITERALLY forcefully taken over a large chunk of a major American city and claiming it as their own autonomous zone where they make the rules, personally setting fire to multiple buildings on my block, looting businesses on my block because they were owned by &quot;evil capitalist whitey&quot;, making me flee the city I had lived in for 6 years to escape their violence. No, there was nothing &quot;problematic&quot; with that. No, apparently all the politicians tweeting out their direct support for it weren&#x27;t &quot;inciting violence&quot;. The double standards are so sickening.')
