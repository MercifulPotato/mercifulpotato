They did the best they could, but they still had a lot of angry people out there. The whole world uses CVEs but it is US funded by the way.<p>In come new CNAs, scale the efforts through trusted teams, which makes sense. The mitre team can only do so much on their own.<p>Unfortunately I donâ€™t think anyone will be as strict and passionate about getting CVEs done right, like the original mitre team has.<p>Here is to hoping they can revoke cna status from teams who consistently do not meet a quality bar.')
