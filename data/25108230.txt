Item(by='walrus01', descendants=None, kids=[25108783, 25108768, 25108516, 25111321], score=None, time=1605502998, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25107615, text='What I&#x27;m talking about is the nature of a dedicated access (1:1) single carrier per channel geostationary link, via a pair of modems such as comtech cdm760 and appropriately sized rf chains and antennas on both ends. It&#x27;ll be a rock solid 492ms and the bandwidth (in Mbps) will be proportional to the size of the transponder space leased, and influenced by antenna sizing&#x2F;gain, overall link budget, tx power on both ends and so forth.<p>Example: at one location, a 3.8 meter ku band dual linear polarity compact cassegrain dish in somalia, a 200W BUC+SSPA, good quality norsat PLL LNB, a cdm760 modem. Ten MHz of transponder space occupied total. Other end, a 5.5m dish with similar gear on it in a teleport in Cyprus.<p>If the person I&#x27;m replying to isn&#x27;t willing or able to clarify whether they were in a contended, or dedicated network, or specify the gear, it&#x27;s hard to say exactly why they&#x27;re seeing jitter. But I can quite confidently say that excursions above 495ms are <i>not</i> something seen in a dedicated network.<p>It&#x27;s how that dedicated capacity can get sliced up and shared that is the most common cause of packet loss, jitter and high latency in geostationary based two way satellite IP links.<p>The most common thing for a cheap VSAT isp to do is to acquire one chunk of Ku transponder capacity (let&#x27;s say about $8000 a month worth), install something like an idirect hub with line cards in it, and sell access to individual end users in $developingnation at an 8:1 oversubscription ratio or more. Meaning that an end user vsat terminal might see 495ms at a lucky time when its peers in the same network were not also moving traffic, but could also often see latency anywhere from 500 to 850 during busy periods.<p>Now that same 8000 bucks a month of transponder space could equally well be assigned to a single high priority end user with money to pay, in which case they would never see above 495ms. Or it could be oversubscribed to all hell, such as if the ISP wanted to sell $280&#x2F;month service to a bunch of very cost conscious end users in a developing nation environment who can only afford very cheap VSAT terminal hardware (one 1.2m fiberglass compression molded reflector, a 4W BUC, and an idirect modem) and minimal monthly ongoing payments. In which case each user will be in a 16:1 or worse oversubscribed network.<p>The economics of making a 5500 kilogram $200 million satellite in geostationary orbit pay for itself, before its lifespan is done in 15 years, are not favorable. If you ever want to truly be shocked go price the $ per Mbps per month that results from the 1:1 dedicated setup I described above.<p>On the topic of what the average hn reader considers &quot;satellite internet&quot;. Based on consumer experience with the absolute cheapest consumer grade ku and Ka band vsat terminals in the usa, they almost 99% of the time mean Hughesnet or viasat&#x2F;wildblue. Very few people actually have money or reason to lay their hands on real two way satellite stuff. Generally if you work for a company that needs something like a $3500&#x2F;month link for a mine in Nunavut you&#x27;re paying some third party experts to implement it.')
