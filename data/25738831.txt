The man refused to provide that service exclusively to LGBT couples. There&#x27;s no charade or dishonesty to that at all and it&#x27;s just as abhorrent as the people that made the same weak argument about potential black customers during segregation. You can try to pretend it&#x27;s about &quot;artistic expression&quot; but in the end it&#x27;s about wanting the ability to discriminate against a protected class that you don&#x27;t like.')
