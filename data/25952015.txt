It doesn&#x27;t take long for the average person to understand the language of finance if it is explained clearly... and professional investors are going to be pissed about it [...] So expect professional investors to hold the amateurs in contempt. Not because they are losing money. But because they have constructed an identity out of finance being exclusive &amp; high status. They won&#x27;t want to be associated with unwashed masses &amp; will resist it')
