Then a couple of days reading documentation and slowly coding my way into a bunch of corners resulting in code that doesn&#x27;t work. So after 3-4 days of &quot;working&quot; on a project, I&#x27;ll actually get into a groove where I can knock out a decent app or tool in about two days. Then add another day for testing and documentation. With fixes needing to be made here and there, that means two good days of coding (and a couple days of bad coding that might be thrown away) for two weeks.<p>If I start spending a lot of my time coding, that means I&#x27;m running off without getting requirements, or I&#x27;m stuck with a problem I don&#x27;t know how to make progress on. So for me this is a good cadence.')
