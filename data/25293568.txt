Nobody else currently produces a sub-15W part with that much computational power.<p>This is a big part of the reason that the AMD mobile chip comparisons seem to be kinda besides the point for me. For a bunch of reasons, its almost impossible to get a high quality laptop today w&#x2F; the latest and greatest AMD chips that people love to compare to the M1 chips. I know AMD makes great chips, but what does that matter if you can&#x27;t get buy them in a laptop today?<p>FWIW - I love AMD, I have a Ryzen desktop for gaming. Its fantastic the competition they are bringing in the desktop market. But I don&#x27;t want to play the game of searching far and wide for high quality laptops that have the new Ryzen chips _and_ are actually in stock somewhere in a configuration I want _and_ are from a reputable manufacturer.<p>I was able to pickup a M1 Air on release date w&#x2F; the upgraded specs from my local Apple store. It&#x27;s a glorious machine, and I knew the build quality and hardware is going to be top notch.<p>OEMs still largely prefer Intel for laptops for whatever reason, which sucks, and it seriously hampers the ability for AMD to compete in this market.')
