It&#x27;s not something to be proud of<p>What? Absolutely! Maintenance is hard. Maintenance of old&#x2F;big&#x2F;complex systems is even harder. Maintaining something for so long with substantial user base is definitely something to be proud for. Everything doesn&#x27;t need to constantly add features in order for people to be proud of their work. Just adding bug&#x2F;security fixes once you feel something is feature-complete is also OK.<p>Not sure where this constant need for changes is coming from, but each to their own. But to look down on people who are doing maintenance is a real shitty thing to do.<p>I hope you don&#x27;t work together with others in open source, as they&#x27;ll also feel saddened by your comment that they should not be proud unless they work on new features.')
