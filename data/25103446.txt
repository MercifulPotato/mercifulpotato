Relatively few people &quot;dislike&quot; heartland America in and of itself. The objection has always been to people voting for bigotry, and on top of that, it&#x27;s always to their own detriment, plus it is all too common that it is &quot;heartland America&quot; that are the ones who need to exercise more empathy and are the most likely to disparage &quot;others&quot; and outsiders because they are not exposed to them.
