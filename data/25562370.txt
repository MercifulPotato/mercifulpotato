I&#x27;ve been helping to solve exactly this. But code can be messy without having a clear defined &quot;clean code&quot; standard. And a project can perform horrible, without having minimum response times docutented.<p>Often my job was to define all those. And often those definitions already hit a nerve. When suddenly your code is marked as &quot;far too tightly coupled&quot; or &quot;too complex: AB above 34&quot; when you thought it was neat and smart code, that is confronting and, I&#x27;ve seen, is often felt as personal critique.')
