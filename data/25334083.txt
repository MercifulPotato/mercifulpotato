This is the antithesis of modular.<p>If you are looking for similar performance, the best you can hope for is a more accessible competitor. Someone like Nvidia or Qualcomm releasing a SoC with comparable features.<p>The big problem there is Qualcomm and Nvidia both have closed drivers so they are only marginally better than Apple. Since Qualcomm does such a lousy job supporting older CPUs, arguably worse (what&#x27;s the value of a CPU with only 3 years of support?).')
