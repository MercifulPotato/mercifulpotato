I guess it matters whether your battery is drained, or <i>dead</i>. Sometimes the battery just doesn&#x27;t have the juice to turn the starter (you hear the clicking of the solenoid when trying to start, but no cranking). Other times it&#x27;s so depleted that an external current supply will be sucked up by the thirsty battery.')
