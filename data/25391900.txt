In my own experience moving to a 0% state income tax state, it effectively canceled out the savings from CA tax but the cheaper housing more than made up for it.<p>Longer term:<p>Tech salaries will come down as employers hire from a larger talent pool that is cheaper on average.  This will make it hard for people in SV to work remote as they won&#x27;t be as competitive.
