If you look in the generation queues of the various RTO&#x2F;ISOs (organizations that manage which units run and at what level for large parts of the grid) the only thing expected to be built is even more wind and solar along with storage. Multiple GW of wind capacity is being added each year, so it isn&#x27;t slowing.<p>Why is this happening? It&#x27;s complicated, but it&#x27;s basically economics at this point.<p>What problems do we face? Well, sometimes wind and solar aren&#x27;t available. You can solve this in three ways. The first is to have thermal generation respond when the wind&#x2F;solar dips. This can be tricky as thermal generators (outside of natural gas) weren&#x27;t designed to move that fast. They were designed to run near max for most of their life. Natural gas peakers are more effective here. Another option is storage, which can hold you over until you get more wind&#x2F;solar again. However, we would need a massive amount of storage built for this to be effective. A third option would be to increase demand response at the industrial and customer level. Meaning, power isn&#x27;t generally expected to be 100% available in that scenario. If there isn&#x27;t enough generation capacity, those that aren&#x27;t willing to pay the high prices are shut off (or something along those lines). That is generally how supply&#x2F;demand is supposed to work anyway, but practically speaking, the demand doesn&#x27;t participate today. In actuality, I expect a combination of all of that to become common place and it is what the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has been pushing for.')
