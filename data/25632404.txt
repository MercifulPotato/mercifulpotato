If you could name the language, some tooling and purpose of use.<p>Obviously, one can always refer to stackoverflow, TIOBE, etc. polls, charts, statistics, based on which one can have a relative overview. Yet it does not convince that much, taking into account that &quot;loved&quot;&#x2F;hobby&#x2F;side-projects&#x2F;etc. programming languages != programming languages used in production. Moreover, there are too many announcements, articles, news about promising technologies&#x2F;languages that are going to change forever &#x2F; disrupt &#x2F; revolutionize the whole technological domain. Nowadays, it looks ridiculous, as if there is a plant of devs who churn out new language or framework every single day.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, progress is a good thing. There is nothing wrong with enhancing existing tech stack to make live at work easier. We do not have to sweat every single day to resolve simple problems.<p>I belive you got my point.<p>Very interested in looking at the real piture.<p>Appreciate your comments and time in advance. :)')
