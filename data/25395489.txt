This will actually hinder herd immunity, wasting limited vaccines.<p>Oh, ideally you wouldn&#x27;t vaccinate people who are already immune, but saying it hinders herd immunity is a bit silly.<p>I find it&#x27;s always helpful to do thought experiments at the limit.<p>Do you think reaching herd immunity requires more doses A) in a population that is 99% of the way to herd immunity, but that 25% of doses will be wasted because they&#x27;ll be given to people who are already immune, or B) in a population that is 1% of the way to herd immunity, but only 4% of doses will be wasted in this way?')
