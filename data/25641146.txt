But maybe it was as a joke. Because it&#x27;s funny to imagine someone with a ruler measuring their screen ^^<p>&gt; I would say a good place to start would be asking yourself, &quot;Why does Linkedin look the way it does?&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t like this trope personally. It works for linkedIn because it was what Monster and other sites were not.<p>If its to be different, embrace it, listen to customers as you say. Don&#x27;t just take what&#x27;s already been done with a slight knock off feel.<p>As for the site itself and concept its nice and super clean, definitely fits into a lot of designers&#x2F;developers ideals. Recruiters will want the analytic data but doesnt seem thats the market.<p>An exportable html&#x2F;pdf page of your profile would be nice to give users too. Just because it gives ossum designers and whoever to extend on the clean template for themselves.')
