The (past) theory of Intel that x86 was valuable in itself made no sense anyway. And there is not a single &quot;AVX512&quot; extension set but a base and quite a number of fine grained extensions, and which are supported per uarch is easy to find.\nOne of Intel strategy is runtime dispatch in library code, and for any general purpose AVX512 you are probably going to do that for now. So you could as well address variants if needed. If AVX512 generalizes, I suspect it will become a more stable instruction set. But Knights Mill is legacy already, and has not been replaced.')
