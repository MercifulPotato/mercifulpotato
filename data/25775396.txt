The whole definition of a fact being a justified, true belief etc.<p>* That which is believed to be true on faith.<p>Regulating on the former with the proviso that encountering new evidence should inform our understanding of the truth seems prudent. For example the &quot;scientific method&quot;. So for example not only can we show that anti-vax beliefs are wrong we can also show that disseminating them is actively harmful. So there is certainly a case to be made that regulating the propagation of these harmful beliefs under an evidence based regime is the prudent thing to do.<p>Regulating on the latter is a terrible idea and that&#x27;s what you&#x27;d get if anti-vax believers were trying to prevent evidence of the efficacy of vaccination from spreading.')
