Each analysis demonstrated that, following directives from organizational and political leadership for universal masking, new infections fell significantly. Two of these studies and an additional analysis of data from 200 countries that included the U.S. also demonstrated reductions in mortality. An economic analysis using U.S. data found that, given these effects, increasing universal masking by 15% could prevent the need for lockdowns and reduce associated losses of up to $1 trillion or about 5% of gross domestic product.<p>All of these studies were conducted on data from the spring, when cases were declining across the northern hemisphere.

But who knows...maybe they slightly alter the slope of the curve. It&#x27;s impossible to tell without a controlled trial.<p>The german paper is particularly ironic, given that it was published approximately <i>concurrently</i> with a huge increase in diagnosed cases in the same city, which is now at all-time highs for the year:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;early&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;02&#x2F;2015954117" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;early&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;02&#x2F;2015954117</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gesundheit.jena.de&#x2F;en&#x2F;coronavirus" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gesundheit.jena.de&#x2F;en&#x2F;coronavirus</a>')
