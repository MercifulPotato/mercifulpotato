So the conservatives promised a referendum and won that election - that seems like “the consent of the governed”, doesn’t it? And the british public could have voted for labour in 2017 or 2019 if they wanted a softer stance on Brexit, but they <i>didn’t</i>, and the Conservatives won both those elections too, albeit with a minority government from the 2017 election. Maybe that means something, in terms of what the british electorate thinks?')
