I feel like I still haven’t gotten a clear answer on whether there should be a limit on Google’s ability to control information on its platform and what that limit should be. Can Google route emails from its competitor’s recruiters to my spam folder? Can they choose not to do business with me if I contact their employees? What if I email the wrong politicians?<p>Have we really reached the point where asking where the line is after the president is banned is seen as rhetorical? How can we make good decisions if we can’t have these discussions? It feels like we are working off a “common sense” that is shared only by those who consume political theater. I’m not sympathetic—-I don’t even know the story—-but I see what I perceive to be a lack of deliberation.')
