Apparently he or she has never seen the US annual budget.  $22 billion is a rounding error.<p>The US spends $3.6 trillion per year on health care expenditures.  If we shut NASA down, and diverted all of their budget to health care, we could pay for ~2.5 days of health care for everyone in the US.<p>I mention health care only because the article also laments that a GOP &quot;priority&quot; is not &quot;cover all pre-existing conditions.&quot;<p>Perfect is not the enemy of good.')
