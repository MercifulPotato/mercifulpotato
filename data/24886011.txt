The focus assist light is (as the name implies) just a light that gives more visisibility and thus  assistance to the existing (constrast&#x2F;phase) autofocus. Not different than opening a window or switching on a light at the location.<p>Whereas LiDAR can be used to focus all on its own (without even engaging phase&#x2F;contrast focus). Of course it can be combined too.<p>In other words, the difference is focus assist is just a light (which doesn&#x27;t do anything else), where lidar actually measures focus distance.')
