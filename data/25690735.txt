That is not what happened.<p>Also there was bloodshed.<p>I don&#x27;t care about what this president does because he&#x27;s a repulsive child.<p>Is there reason for alarm? Sure. The Capitol Police were negligent in planning and performing their duties. There was not a sufficient lockdown and security protocol for the physical items. Probably all sorts of other things. These people committed felonies and should be punished.<p>But this was not a revolution. Our government was not overthrown.')
