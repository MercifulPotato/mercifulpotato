I reverse-engineered pretty much all Turbo Pascal versions starting with v4.0 all the way up to v8.0 (Delphi v1.0). I even disassembled the beta versions of Delphi, v7.9h and v7.9k, to see and study the transition from Turbo Pascal to Delphi.<p>That being said, what you are looking at at turbopascal.org is an absolute mind-blowing reverse-engineering job. One hint is when you look for example at<p>Procedure AddReferenceRecordForTypedConstant (UnitSegment, BlockRecord: Word; ReferenceFlags: TReferenceFlagSet;\nDX, TypedConstantOffset: Word);<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;turbopascal.org&#x2F;processing-typed-constants" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;turbopascal.org&#x2F;processing-typed-constants</a><p>at the bottom of the page - where the author couldn&#x27;t come up with a proper name for the DX register, so he left that identifier unchanged. If you disassemble Turbo Pascal &quot;tpc.exe&quot; and look for that subroutine you&#x27;ll see that Anders Hejlsberg really used the DX register.... (I know, not really convincing...)')
