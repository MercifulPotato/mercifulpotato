Students are cramped in small dorm rooms shared by multiple people, many with shared public bathrooms.  Students &quot;work&quot; (attending class&#x2F;studying) at small place, chairs with a small board as desk in classroom or small desks in library.  There&#x27;s one or a few shared cafeterias on campus.  Close to no variety shops on campus.  In almost all aspects of campus life, things and spaces are cramped and choices are few.  Students only endure it because they know it&#x27;s only for a few years.  People don&#x27;t want to live or work like a student for the rest of their life.  Plus the cost of college has spiraled out of control year after year.')
