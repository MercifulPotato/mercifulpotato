If it&#x27;s disproportionately higher than average, then unionization should be lawful. If it&#x27;s not, then it should be illegal.<p>The point I&#x27;m getting at is most of the wages that could go to employees go to executives. Not even to the board or funneled back into the company for investment. Some businesses are fair and obviously pay the CEO fair compensation package. But not egregious ones like 100x the lowest paid employee or even higher. That&#x27;s just flat out absurd then at that point and clearly someone can&#x27;t stand not being able to compete in a worthless yacht race or some bourgeoisie garbage.')
