It has cost me a lot of contacts, but so be it. There is always a choice.<p>If you had a friend you respected that was vegan for ethical or environmental convictions would you insist on continuing to exclusively have social gatherings at BBQ restaurants with no menu options for them? Would you take them seriously if they caved to avoid being excluded from the group?<p>When I deleted all walled garden messengers by Google, Facebook etc they knew I wasn&#x27;t kidding. Anyone that refuses to make small allowances for you living your convictions is not your friend.<p>The people that need to talk to me use now matrix or found other ways to reach out like e-mail or in person. Those that don&#x27;t respect my ethics don&#x27;t get free advice from me anymore.')
