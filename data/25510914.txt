His unvested equity, for all practical purposes, reverts back to the company. In standard 4&#x2F;1 vesting, you get 1&#x2F;4 of your equity on your first anniversary, and then equal-sized chunks every month thereafter for 4 years. Prior to that first anniversary, the idea of 4&#x2F;1 is that you get nothing; the whole idea is to avoid allocating equity to people who don&#x27;t last a whole year.')
