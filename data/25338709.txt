I can jog to Discovery Park and be in forest surrounded by beach, or up to Carkeek and see tide pools and wetlands. I can be on a real hiking trailhead in less than an hour.<p>Camelback Mountain is half an hour from the center of Phoenix. Virginia Key Beach Park&#x27;s walking trails are 20 minutes from downtown Miami. Lionel Hampton-Beecher Hills Park is about the same distance from Atlanta. You get the idea.<p>SF certainly has really nice nature close by, but it&#x27;s not like other US cities are industrial wastelands.')
