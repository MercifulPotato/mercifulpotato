Saying 1 door or 2 doors doesn&#x27;t mean you actually grasp the entirety of the problem.<p>What do you mean &quot;opens a door randomly&quot;? Is he picking from all three doors? Yours, and the two others?<p>In that cases you get interesting but trivially-obvious-what-move-to-make scenarios like &quot;he chose your door and showed you you were right&quot; &quot;he chose your door and showed you you were wrong&quot; &quot;he chose a different door which had the car&quot;...<p>Do you just mean the subset of &quot;he chose randomly and happened to draw a goat out of one of the two you did not choose&quot;?  In which case switching isn&#x27;t beneficial because you no longer are also capturing the cases that would otherwise be the &quot;he chose randomly and opened the one with the car that you did not choose&quot; that <i>are</i> included in the original &quot;switch or not&quot; decision because he always goes to a goat?')
