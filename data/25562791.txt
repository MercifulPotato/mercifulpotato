If I can tell ahead of time that the recruiter is a ghost, then I can tell them I don&#x27;t want to work with them because they&#x27;ve got a bad reputation on the ghost-list. Like a bad yelp review, that will hopefully motivate them to change. As long as new reports keep coming in, their full history remains. But old reviews should start to fall off the ghost-list after a certain amount of time without a new report of ghosting (to reward the positive change in behavior).')
