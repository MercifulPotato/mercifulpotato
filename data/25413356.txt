Its been long since politicans represented or cared about little people calling with their problems. Heck, a friend of mine worked for very popular politican as his assistant and was told to just tell people you write their problems down but dont even bother anymore. I believe its the truth about the whole US politics system at this point. Its all about who donate more bc that the only way you can get elected and then stay in power.')
