I&#x27;ve had to stop reading them because I just can&#x27;t keep up.  But from the ones I have read, I am even more dismayed than I was before.  The most disturbing thing to me is the number of people who are just shrugging off the capitol riot as just another cost of doing business in a free society.  If the riot were an isolated incident that <i>might</i> be a valid position, but it wasn&#x27;t.
