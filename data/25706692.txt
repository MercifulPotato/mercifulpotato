But was twitter not created with this constraint due to the original intention that tweets could be posted by sms and were thus constrained by the format of sms itself and not actually an inherent and necessary part of the platform?<p>It seems like there&#x27;s room for twitter to provide at least a method for long form content.<p>Maybe have it seperate from the actual twitter feed and let people use a normal size tweet to link to it?<p>People already seem to use it for longform content, providing a way for people to do it efficiently may provide a positive change. It would give people a reason to use twitter who otherwise might not because of the content limitations.<p>Even adding such a system, I imagine the bulk of tweets will still be the 280 character kind, but it would provide a built in method for that occasional time you want to write something longer.')
