She was a heroin addict. Every other year she&#x27;d have a baby, malnourished, underweight, in withdrawal, neglected taken away.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s truly tragic.  You&#x27;ve been a blessing to those children, and that&#x27;s beautiful.<p>Given the harshness of this reality, I understand why past generations looked to forced sterilization.  There&#x27;s really no winning with that, but after <i>4</i> kids (to date) with that fate, it&#x27;s a legitimate moral debate (not an easy one, nor should it be) as to the relative good.  I guess it&#x27;s a sibling to the abortion debate.')
