Navigate back near (not to) the beginning?</i><p>Yes. In most shells it&#x27;s trivial to go back by a word (e.g. skip in front of the path with one shortcut).<p>That said, this happens so rare that it&#x27;s not even something that ever registered with me as a problem. I know what arguments I want for ls. And if I don&#x27;t it&#x27;s usually some bizarro infrequent flag that I have to look up how it&#x27;s used anyway.<p>And other programs where it would be actually useful don&#x27;t allow it anyway (having flags after the &quot;main&quot; argument). Git, for one.')
