Yeah, the ecosystem is wonderful if you aren&#x27;t a developer.<p>However, Arduino is now weird compared to mainstream embedded development.  Most things have converged to 32-bit instead of 8-bit.  Arm Cortex-M is now mainstream so your architectural understanding is useless.  5V causes a lot of grief given that everybody else in the world is at 3V&#x2F;3.3V.<p>A developer basically has to <i>unlearn</i> a bunch of things to move up from an Arduino.  I still recommend Arduino to non-developers or somebody just trying to throw together a project, but I no longer recommend them to someone actually trying to learn embedded development.')
