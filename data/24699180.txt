I’m not saying they will actively try to get a candidate elected who is more friendly to their agendas. However, I don’t see them going out of their way to prevent others from doing it knowing what the future holds should there be an administration change.<p>I’d also be surprised if moderate voters actually give a crap about anti-trust issues, at least not enough to sway their vote one way or the other. If anything, it could have the opposite effect of turning off voters that see this as government overreach, since many moderates are fiscally conservative.<p>This post is out of curiosity and to hear the thoughts of others, so hopefully it isn’t taken the wrong way.')
