Usually those don&#x27;t relate to the vaccination agent itself but accompanying chemicals that trigger your immune system (after all, the immune system won&#x27;t launch an attack if you got stabbed with a needle) to go into attack mode. When you have an allergy to vaccines, this attack mode goes into overdrive and causes a widespread release of cytokines and other immune system agents. In some cases the reaction can be driven by the vaccination agent itself but from what I recall that is exceedingly rare.')
