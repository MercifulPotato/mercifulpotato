You&#x27;d be surprised at the amount of stuff you can get for free if you make it easy to express.<p>My D scripts are usually shorter than my Python one&#x27;s (and I write code I want to save not just &quot;it&#x27;ll do&quot;-type scripts, to my detriment), but because we don&#x27;t teach people anything other than C++&#x2F;Java&#x2F;Python (Haskell is very nice but it&#x27;s too far away to be helpful to this area of software) we falsely imprint a view that performance <i>always</i> cost&#x27;s expressiveness or development time.<p>The good news is that this trend does seem to be getting better, and it&#x27;s only going to get easier thanks to widespread use of infrastructure like LLVM and the social acceptance in industry of wacky languages.')
