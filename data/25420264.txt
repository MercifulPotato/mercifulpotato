If you are in a cafe, your conversations are transient and can only be overheard by your nearest neighbor. Your cafe would have to have a bulletin board or file cabinets where descriptions of content is posted along with where you can get it.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure that wouldn&#x27;t last too long either.')
