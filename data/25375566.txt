They constantly advertise that for a short time, courses that cost &gt; $100 are selling for $12.99.<p>But anyone who has visited their site more than once knows it&#x27;s trivially easy to always pay $12.99, regardless of popularity&#x2F;rating&#x2F;length. The result is that instead of seeing them as a great deal, I view all Udemy courses as lower quality (whether deserved or not).<p>Which is a shame, because some of their creators do a fantastic job and have a high quality products that could sell for Wes Bos-level prices.')
