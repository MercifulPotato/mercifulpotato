Shopify is a seller platform, do you think they should be forced to sell items on their platform that they don&#x27;t want to sell? Because if yes, I&#x27;d like to point you towards almost any payment processing institution in the US, since they will stop working with you the moment you start selling something they don&#x27;t like(pornography, sex toys, gambling products) even if they are not illegal at all. They don&#x27;t want to participate in this transaction and you can&#x27;t force them. So I don&#x27;t see how you could force Shopify to carry something on their platform that they don&#x27;t want to.')
