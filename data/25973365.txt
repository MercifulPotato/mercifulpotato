Ordinary property is the right to say how others are allowed to use a physical thing that belongs to you. It&#x27;s effectively the same concept, just extended.<p>Of course, it doesn&#x27;t immediately follow from <i>either</i> physical property or intellectual property that it will be abused in the way Doctorow describes (by &quot;keeping customers by making it impossible for them to leave&quot;), but it certainly could be. For example, suppose a relatively small number of individuals or companies owned most of the land, and most of the industrial machinery, and all the investment capital - then everyone else would have to go work for them, and produce whatever the property owners wanted to produce, instead of what they wanted to make for themselves. Someone might describe such a dynamic as fundamentally abusive in exactly the same way that intellectual property is.')
