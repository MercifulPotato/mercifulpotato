Item(by='dudus', descendants=None, kids=[25348554, 25348315, 25348563, 25348612, 25348013], score=None, time=1607446591, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25346873, text='Gol rebranded the 737-MAX to 737-8 not to be confused with 737-800 which is part of the 737-NG percursor to the MAX. Not confusing at all.<p>Arguably this confusion is meant to undermine the consumer choice of aircraft during the purchase. GOL has heavy competition from LATAM, AZUL and AVIANCA on most of their routes, and none of these companies are using the 737-MAX AFAIK.')
