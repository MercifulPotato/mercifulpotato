For example:<p>&quot;<i>If you got to a gas station near me, you can get a CR2032 battery for say 2 USD. If you got to a certain home decor&#x2F;equipment store a mile away, you&#x27;ll get 4 of these batteries for 1 USD. That&#x27;s what, 8x more expensive for a relatively common product?</i>&quot;<p>This isn&#x27;t a difference between .25Â¢ for 1 and $2 for one. It is the difference between $4 and a bit of a search for 1 plus three more to stuff in a drawer and $2 for one here now where you are. And $2 is the cost of, what, a couple ounces of coffee?<p>This is what ECON 101 calls irrationality.')
