Does Animate create content that isn&#x27;t rendered consistently across browsers?<p>&quot;Didn&#x27;t interact well with other web content&quot; is interesting, because Flash never did this well IIRC. What was lost?<p>&gt; <i>We ended up writing our own JS animation framework that works with Animate-exported SVGs.</i><p>Neat!')
