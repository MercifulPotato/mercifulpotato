Item(by='mncharity', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606105261, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25177594, text='OT, so briefly: I&#x27;m interested in the possibility of applying much greater than usual domain expertise to create science education content which is more correct and insightful, focused on integrated transferable understanding.  An unresolved challenge is how to make such available in a form and setting that actually gets it used.  A quick check of the NCERT science textbooks turns up error and opportunity for improvement.  So, is there some setting in which one might say &quot;for NCERT class foo, book Science, chapter bar, here is a free correcting-and-extending supplement&quot;, and potentially see significant use?  Tnx...')
