Doubly so after my transplant.<p>VitaMix<p>There are two hard to reach cavities.<p>The outer ring of the top plug fills with debris. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.webstaurantstore.com&#x2F;vitamix-062984-lid-plug&#x2F;HP755.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.webstaurantstore.com&#x2F;vitamix-062984-lid-plug&#x2F;HP7...</a> This one really pisses me off. It&#x27;d be so easy to redesign the plug to eliminate the cavity.<p>The second is the underside of the pitcher, between the side wall and the center spindle. This one is only annoying. Can&#x27;t find a pic, but this is the pitcher. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thingsaroundthehouse.com&#x2F;vitamix-7500-vs-5200&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thingsaroundthehouse.com&#x2F;vitamix-7500-vs-5200&#x2F;</a><p>I use looped pipe cleaners to scrub these cavities clean.<p>I could fully disassemble my former KitchenAide&#x27;s pitcher to clean every component.

Great, now I have to clean the cord too. Or rinse the pot before using it again. Sometimes I kinda fold the cord and stuff it thru the top handle.')
