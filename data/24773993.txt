However the reason time &#x27;slows down&#x27; (Relativity Theory) could could be &#x27;on purpose&#x27; because there is finite computing power in &#x27;God&#x27;s Computer&#x27;, and the trick of Relativity length contraction and time dilation is a compensation to ensure calculations can be done in time, or even an &#x27;emergent&#x27; phenomena due to the fact that calculations <i>do</i> take time, even in God&#x27;s computer, and if the later interpretation is the case it implies &quot;Gods Computer&quot; does experience the same &quot;spacetime&quot; that we do in this universe. And if that&#x27;s true it indicates Gravity is external to the Simulation while the Standard Model is <i>part of</i> the simulation.')
