But once I&#x27;ve gone that first day it&#x27;s easier to maintain the rest of the week and to keep that going in subsequent weeks.<p>* Exercising for exercises sake is a bad motivator (for me at least). I like powerlifting because I can see programmable gains; I can easily gamify it for myself.<p>* Rest is important you need energy to exercise and if you don&#x27;t rest properly it can become too much of a drain.<p>I&#x27;m a big fan of powerlifting, it&#x27;s something you can easily do alone but also share ideas on forms and programs with people if you wish.<p>The health benefits are good as well both mentally and physically.')
