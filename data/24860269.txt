Or Microsoft updates its OS in a way that forces them to expend considerable time making it functional again and they just don&#x27;t have the bandwidth for it so you&#x27;re stuck for some amount of time or indefinitely.<p>If you have no other choice, its definitely better than nothing and you want to use what enables you to do your job the best. But in terms of where I&#x27;d be willing to throw my financial support? It&#x27;d need to be something for the better of the coding community as whole.
