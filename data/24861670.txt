If you &quot;pocket&quot; profits, i.e. pay them to investors, the investors just go out and invest them again in something else. Which is actually better, because it reduces concentration of wealth inside of corporations. Instead of one corporation growing ever larger because they have to invest internally or be subject to punitive taxes, you get many new independent companies being formed as investors seek out new opportunities for the money they receive as dividends.<p>The other problem is that there are many forms of investment that are taxed differently. Government bond interest typically isn&#x27;t taxed. Real estate appreciation typically isn&#x27;t taxed until sale, which means they can be deferred indefinitely. Investing in foreign corporations will be subject to the tax rates in those other countries. So if you increase the domestic corporate tax rate, investment moves from domestic companies to things like real estate speculation and foreign companies, which may not be desirable.<p>Moreover, multinational corporations arrange for profits to be declared in whichever jurisdiction has the lowest taxes, so increasing the tax rate on domestic corporations disadvantages them against multinationals that won&#x27;t be paying those taxes.')
