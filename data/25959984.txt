Pony is lacking in libraries for &quot;web development&quot;, so you&#x27;d need to do a lot of work that you wouldn&#x27;t in other languages.<p>That&#x27;s the case with most areas with Pony. You&#x27;ll invest time in developing libraries you wouldn&#x27;t in many other languages. In return, you get the nice list of &quot;why pony&quot; features, but, you are putting in a decent amount of work to get there.<p>That said if you release those libraries into the wild and get help maintaining them, the next time someone asks there will be less reason to say &quot;you&#x27;ll have to do some work&quot;.')
