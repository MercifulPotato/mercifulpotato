The new M1 is faster and MUCH lower power than an i9 based system that would ramp up fans at even the most minor of workloads like say upgrading iterm2 from version n to version n+1.<p>Suddenly $700 mac mini&#x27;s can do crazy things like edit 4k video and the m1 laptops can handle being plugged in to wall power much less often than the i9 systems.<p>Likely within 12 months there&#x27;s likely to be systems with twice as many cores bringing unheard of levels of performance to reasonable price points.<p>Keep in mind Intel hasn&#x27;t shipped something significantly faster than the previous generation in 5 years.')
