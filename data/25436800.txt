This quote from the article kinda sums it up:<p>&gt; “People work for Dave because they know the project is going to succeed,” Short said. “Dave is intense. He can be crude and demanding at times, but that’s actually a small piece of him. He’s actually very good at motivating people . . . . If you’re an engineer, you want to work on a project that you think is useful.  You want to think that the project will succeed and that your individual effort will make a difference. When you worked for Dave, you were in a project like that.”')
