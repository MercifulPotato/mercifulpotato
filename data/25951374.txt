But this situation exists because in the US you have to be a rich person to directly interact with the stock market.<p>[edit] Don&#x27;t pay attention to me below. I&#x27;m wrong.

It&#x27;s only a very small segment of the US population that has a net worth of over 1 million dollars or an income of more than $200k&#x2F;year. Most accredited investors are not human people at all but instead corporate people. If brokerages are going to act this way then people need to have the rights to bypass them.')
