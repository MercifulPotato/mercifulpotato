Item(by='jcranmer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609980275, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25665318, text='&gt; even though the constitution says the legislatures set the rules,<p>The US Constitution, in Article II Section 1, says:<p>&gt; Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct<p>You see the keywords &quot;may direct&quot;? That means that legislatures are empowered to <i>delegate</i> authority as they see fit in their statutes. So if the legislature says that the governor and officials can change some things, then the governor and officials have the authority to challenge them.<p>&gt; there is no one who has any standing to challenge those rules<p>Where did I say that? I said that <i>Texas</i> does not have the right to object to <i>Pennsylvania</i>. A voter in their state can sue their own state in their own state courts if they believe their officials have violated their own state laws. And if you paid attention in the spring, summer, and fall of 2020, you will have found that several people <i>did</i> challenge the actions of their state governments in these regards, and those actions were sometimes <i>successful</i>.<p>What was not successful was <i>other people</i> (including the Texas v Pennsylvania suit) suing the officials in <i>federal court</i>, and waiting until <i>well after</i> the election to do so.<p>&gt; Again, I am attempting to engage in good faith.<p>Then keep in mind that losing on standing doesn&#x27;t mean <i>no one</i> can bring the suit, it only means that <i>the plaintiff</i> is not the right person to do so. There&#x27;s a big difference between the two, and jumping straight to the former smacks of bad faith to me.<p>Since you added this after I wrote this comment:<p>&gt; If the mayor of Portland chose electors for Oregon and the governor allowed that (using my state as an example here), you don&#x27;t think anyone has the right to ask federal courts to answer the question of whether or not electors must be chosen by the legislature (as the constitution demands), and asking them to decertify the ones chosen by someone other than the legislature?<p>No. No one has the right to sue in <i>federal</i> court on that matter. You would sue the governor (assuming he&#x27;s the one who is supposed to sign off on the electors in Oregon law) in the appropriate <i>Oregon</i> court. Alternatively, assuming this an executive order that is drawn up before the election, you would sue the governor and the mayor in <i>Oregon</i> court to enjoin from enacting the executive order, assuming that Oregon law prohibits such an executive order from being made.')
