Can they quote chapter and verse of <i>Capital</i> and <i>The Communist Manifesto</i> from memory?<p>Having spent a few years on the Fediverse, I&#x27;ve found that &quot;the left&quot; in the US consists mainly of book clubs and struggle sessions.<p>The book clubs just read and debate theory ad nauseum. They&#x27;re a joke, and if you gave most of them an AR-15 they&#x27;d shoot themselves in the foot.<p>The struggle sessions look for people slightly less poorly off than themselves to bully. If they can&#x27;t find a right-winger, they&#x27;ll happily go after somebody who&#x27;s only 99.999% on board with their program. Failing that, they&#x27;ll pick one of their own at random, accuse them of insufficient ideological purity, and bully them. They&#x27;re a joke, too, only not quite as funny as the book clubbers.')
