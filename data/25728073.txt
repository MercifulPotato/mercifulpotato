Video meetings are meetings, hence synchronous.  Email and messages are asynchronous.  Each have their uses, both are abused and misused, and over time, teams and groups start to evolve their work processes based around the capabilities that exist.<p>The best managers guide that evolution, but recognise that different people work in different ways.<p>But video conferencing&#x2F;meetings is a capability to be used, and I look forward to seeing how it improves.  Rejecting it out-of-hand simply because it&#x27;s currently sub-optimal and badly used seems short-sighted.')
