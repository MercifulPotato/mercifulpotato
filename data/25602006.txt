I think they will have to show their passport when entering Gibraltar from outside the Schengen area, not when crossing the Spain-Gibraltar border (the BBC page I linked to says they already have to show it now, so that won’t change)<p>How would that even work, a border where some persons have to identify themselves while others can cross freely? That would catch only the truly stupid criminals. (But what do I know? Reading <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Schengen_Area" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Schengen_Area</a> makes my head go dizzy with all the exceptions. You can sort-of sneak into the Schengen area via Svalbard or the Faroe islands, for example, so some holes needed to be closed there)<p>Such a system only work when everybody already has to show ID, as is the case when traveling by boat or plane to and from the parts of Spain in Africa (that’s a security check, not a border check. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Schengen_Area#Air_travel" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Schengen_Area#Air_travel</a>)')
