I&#x27;m talking Pi&#x27;s, Macbooks, Pixel phones, you name it, they all jiggle around.<p>I&#x27;ve had RealSense cameras, StarTech USB hubs fail because of cable jiggling around in the port, and had to make 3D printed add-ons to grip the housing and prevent cable jiggling.<p>I&#x27;ve personally had WAY more problems with USB that SCSI cables, honestly. Also I break an average of about 1 USB cable a week; SCSI, DB25, DB9, DB15, BNC, and those cables never break.')
