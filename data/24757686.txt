Item(by='codetrotter', descendants=None, kids=[24758191], score=None, time=1602527204, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24757471, text='&gt; Kids in California fail AP tests because they don&#x27;t know what a file format is and try to submit HEIC images to a web form that only takes JPEG and PNG.<p>I agree somewhat but I think the AP test website makers should take some responsibility too. Limiting the upload to only JPEG and PNG is silly IMO. Wouldn’t really cost them anything to install ImageMagick on their server and accept a much wider range of file formats.<p>ImageMagick can read and convert pretty much any image format you throw at it, check out the list of formats here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imagemagick.org&#x2F;script&#x2F;formats.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imagemagick.org&#x2F;script&#x2F;formats.php</a><p>And yes, ImageMagick supported file formats include even HEIC.<p>I mean, if we are going to talk about having knowledge about file formats and technical details about computers, perhaps the kids aren’t the only ones lacking – so too do the people that keep insisting on only PNG or JPEG in 2020 IMO. Why force everyone to deal with these things when the server could handle much more of it automatically?')
