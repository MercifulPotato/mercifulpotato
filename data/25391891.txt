Predominantly white protesters in Portland misappropriated protests over racial inequality for their own disphoric amalgamation of social issues. There&#x27;s little agreement among them about the goal of the protests or even why they&#x27;re protesting. I know many of those people. Many have no idea why they&#x27;re there, it&#x27;s just drama to them, something they can do in the face of the most socially regressive times of our generation. On the other side people  see this, point and say, &quot;See? Told you I was right about those people.&quot;  \nNobody seems to give a shit about issues racial minorities and poor face, in the same breath ravenously supporting covid policies and their unprecedented impacts on income and social inequality along mostly racial lines. I&#x27;m surprised they aren&#x27;t chanting, &quot;black lives are essential.&quot;<p>This is not helpful for racial equality. It&#x27;s not helpful for anybody except the psychopathic industry of military oppression of civilian populations. Of course they&#x27;re walking all over our social contracts, the continued protests have opened the door for them.<p>Disruption of systematic inequality is needed, but this ain&#x27;t the way it&#x27;s going to happen. As a privileged work-from-homer, white person, whatever, our first obligation is to listen to what racial minorities are saying to understand the nature their struggles. Otherwise you can tell yourself you&#x27;re a virtuous champion of wokeness, but you&#x27;re really just a part of the same problem.')
