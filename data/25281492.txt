Of course most of these aren’t actually very interesting, after all; but it does provide a rough approximation.<p>(Code here: &lt;<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;wolfgang42&#x2F;2df001b05065488620700f0fdfa58a08" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gist.github.com&#x2F;wolfgang42&#x2F;2df001b05065488620700f0fd...</a>&gt;)')
