The British created a legal system that crystallized caste into law using their own interpretation of caste and class, and that system did not reflect whatever existed before. That&#x27;s not to say they invented caste, but the modern form definitely was implemented by them.<p>It definitely is. They made it rigid (and potentially even made up parts of it - it&#x27;s hard to tell exactly since the brits kept the records...) and enforced it in law as a part of their usual divide and conquer&#x2F;put a a selected minority on top so they&#x27;re loyal to you strategy (like [edit: Belgians] likely did in Rwanda). And now you&#x27;ve got a ton of Indians parroting stuff about caste that&#x27;s not even obviously a an original pre-colonial part of Indian culture in any obvious way.<p>Even the section in the vedas about castes&#x2F;varnas coming from different parts of the body doesn&#x27;t have 100% scholarly consensus of being original[0]. It&#x27;s a mess.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Varna_(Hinduism)#The_Vedas" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Varna_(Hinduism)#The_Vedas</a>')
