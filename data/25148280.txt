Also, it is difficult to find a central source of information in Haskell.<p>I tried to give the language a spin, and struggled with many a barrier to get to the point where I see significant progress (books, build tools)<p>I understand that you are invested in the Haskell ecosystem with your company, and I am happy that the language has more adoption in the business sector.
