They&#x27;re very cute, but in my experience they were very skittish and frankly their claws are too sharp to make comfortable pets. I wish it were otherwise, since I really admire them as highly capable animals.<p>We raised them with the intent of releasing them into &quot;the wild&quot; (of Burbank) and eventually did get them to be pretty much independent of us. So that worked pretty well.')
