Item(by='tsimionescu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603607093, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24882963, text='My understanding is that (1) the patient has the right to be explained what the surgery will be, what is their prognosis, what are the risks etc, so they can give informed consent - not sure who other than the surgeon could do this; and (2) that surgery needs to be planned, the surgeon needs to know how many nurses they will need, whether they need any assisting surgeons etc. This is all medical knowledge, a surgeon is not waiting in an operating room and operating whoever they bring in.<p>The whole story smells of very bad medical practices (and I&#x27;m speaking with the perspective of someone living in a formerly communist country, not some medical Mecca).')
