However, I&#x27;m tired of doing &quot;defensive programming&quot; in Python to essentially statically assert argument types and unit test things that a statically-typed language would disallow by construction.<p>This stuff in Rust, Go, and even Nim [0] look interesting, but the consensus seems to be the value proposition of Rails or Django is still hard to beat unfortunately.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nim-lang.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nim-lang.org&#x2F;</a>')
