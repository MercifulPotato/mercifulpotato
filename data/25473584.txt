My blog&#x27;s &quot;CMS&quot; under the hood is a single flat directory of markdown files.

I don&#x27;t really use tags or hierarchies, even though Hugo supports it.<p>My site isn&#x27;t open source (b&#x2F;c unfinished content) but in case it&#x27;s helpful, it&#x27;s based on this Hugo template project - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;thesephist&#x2F;carlisle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;thesephist&#x2F;carlisle</a><p>Newsletter wise, I can&#x27;t be super helpful because I roll my own infra through Mailgun, but I think in general the simpler the better, especially in the beginning.
