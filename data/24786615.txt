Ping me if you&#x27;d like to video chat.<p>But it&#x27;s a good question and I&#x27;ll try to reply in a brief and somewhat hand-wavy way (due to the medium, space, etc) Everything I&#x27;m going to say has caveats. And I can&#x27;t cover them all. Meh.<p>If you believe that the species as a whole has never been this unstable before, then the real question is this: what has changed? Whatever it is, it&#x27;s obviously happened in the last 20 years, maybe even in the last 7 or so. The thing to do would be to identify those changes and come up with a testable theory that can be tested using the data. In general, however, I am persuaded that the overall problem is that we&#x27;ve incentivized consumer technology based on a battle for attention span. This isn&#x27;t new; it&#x27;s been going on forever. But the network effect has shot it through the roof, and even simple AI is proving quite capable of taking that business model even further. If it weren&#x27;t, there wouldn&#x27;t be so much money in it.<p>+If you accept that premise, then that&#x27;s how the conversation should generally go. If you don&#x27;t accept that premise, then we need to back up a bit and talk about the effects of technology in general.<p>Here&#x27;s a more detailed explanation and defense of my underlying thesis I published twelve years ago. This just didn&#x27;t appear overnight; a lot of folks were trying to ring the warning bells earlier. (BTW, when I published it on HN, it got a lot of votes, but it also got a lot of &quot;Well, sure, but 1) there&#x27;ll be a new startup that will replace big tech soon, 2) we&#x27;ll just invent some new app that will solve the problems we have from the current apps, etc&quot;) It was a sad demonstration of how all of us tech folk have a tendency to do the best we can to deny and ignore any implications of what we&#x27;re doing aside from wondering whether our server is up.
