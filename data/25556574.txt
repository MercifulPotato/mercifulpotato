Screens have a form factor, screens usually have a third party organising the content that is being exchanged. Screens are flat surfaces. You operate through screens in a sort of purely functional input-output rather than spontaneous way.<p>So the screen being a technological and commercial artifact, imposes a lot of rules on how we interact through it, sort of like an API. And that&#x27;s noteworthy compared to the time before we were interacting through screens.')
