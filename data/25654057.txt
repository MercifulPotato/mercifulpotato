It&#x27;s not easy. It pretends to be easy, but is usually broken in some crazy way instead. Apt is also easy, but it actually <i>works</i> more often than not.<p>(c) was relevant in 2006, when the novelty of OS X was that it was a UNIX that you could actually use as a daily driver.

Linux may still have issues, but they&#x27;re not worse than the hoops you have to jump through to make today&#x27;s macOS behave.<p>Trendy tech companies are still buying macbook pros for their employees because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s been trendy for the last decade, not because they actually ask new hires what they prefer. <i>Practical</i> tech companies do, and at places like that you usually see a mix of macs and thinkpads.')
