There are several keycaps that that are no longer physically connected to the key, so if I tilt the laptop 4 or 5 keys fall off. I have been dealing with it by using an external Apple keyboard (with added benefit of having  10-key and full sized arrow keys). Since it&#x27;s on a desktop in this config, I have it set to never sleep so luckily I have not seen this unwakeable fuck up.')
