It was the belief that they were that prevented decrypting them for so long, until the Rosetta Stone was found.<p>Neither are Chinese characters, BTW. Chinese is a syllabary, but with a lot of redundancy -- 1200 syllables, lots more characters -- and arbitrary, historical rules about which variant for a syllable may be used for each word.<p>Amazingly (at least it amazes me), most Mandarin speakers think that other Chinese &quot;dialects&quot; are just different ways to pronounce Mandarin, where in fact they are as different from Mandarin as various European languages are from Latin.<p>Many even think of the characters as pictograms with complicated rules about sharing with homonyms. People who know more than one Sinitic language know better.')
