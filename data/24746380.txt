You do realize that branded OS updates and even point releases are not the only units of software that receive updates from Apple, right?<p>Google also asks you if you&#x27;d like to update Android, and they currently let you turn off auto-updates in the Play store, but they push updates to their nebulous, infinitely privileged &quot;Play Services&quot; packages frequently and without asking or informing the user. Even if Apple doesn&#x27;t currently do something similar, it would be foolish to believe that they&#x27;re not capable of doing so, as an ace-up-their-sleeve in an emergency scenario.<p>Also baseband firmware is pushed by the carriers silently and is essentially unauthenticated.<p>You really, really, really should not trust your phone, like, at all.')
