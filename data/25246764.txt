I also question the &quot;mathematically sound&quot; bit - the &quot;commutative changes&#x2F;diff&quot; thing sounds really far fetched.<p>Also, the fact it is written in rust means nothing to me. The whole &quot;but rust doesn&#x27;t segfault!&quot; thing is, and has always been, a ridiculous reason why rust is somehow inherently better suited for such projects. The article keeps leaning on that fact as though it makes the project superior somehow, but it just feels like grandstanding.<p>The architecture section is just buzzwords. It doesn&#x27;t explain the technical aspects, it doesn&#x27;t allow me to understand the system, and then I&#x27;m immediately dropped into &quot;how to use the CLI&quot;. But wait, you haven&#x27;t sold me yet.<p>This was painful to read.')
