I leave a couple of tabs open that I can get to very quickly for that purpose, but fortunately most of the time I can ignore sites that require JS.<p>Reasons include speed, convenience, and security.  (I also do most browsing in separate user accounts, depending on the security level of what I am doing, and what other data that account handles.)<p>Edit: Sometimes for those same reasons, or for automation purposes of some tasks (like checking a particular page for a certain fact that I want to act on when it changes, such as some security updates), it&#x27;s nice to be able to use text browsers like links (or wget &amp; curl) too, and have the info available w&#x2F;o requiring JS for it.')
