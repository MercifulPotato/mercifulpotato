You seem to have problems understanding simple sentences. Here again as a list to show exactly what I mean.<p>- 1. to get an overview, which languages exist at all, you can get a first impression at TIOBE. So you first have to know which languages exist, so you know which languages you should learn. \n - 2) You seem to have missed the second point, because in this point I advised you to learn Python, because it gives you the best job opportunities. You have compared the TIOBE list with RUST and constructed a faulty comparison (which in your opinion contains a contradiction). \n - 3. in point three I recommended Rust according to my personal opinion, because I see as a programmer and studied computer scientist in this language the best developments in the next 20 years.<p>According to your personal opinion, Rust is the worst recommendation. You then say that Javascript (not a programming language, but a scripting language) and the choice to a frontend (not a programming language at all) is the best option. By your non-technical statements, I can roughly read that you don&#x27;t have much idea about this topic and just wanted to say something, but your unprofessional statements don&#x27;t help OP with his question.')
