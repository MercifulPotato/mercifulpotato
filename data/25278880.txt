Advice?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Hey guys, \nI&#x27;m a marketer, specifically a copywriter, and I&#x27;m looking to get acquainted with technology.<p>The company I started working for offers products such as git repositories, CI&#x2F;CD, cloud compute. I&#x27;ve been reading some guides on the internet but most of them use jargon which makes it harder for me to understand the general concepts.<p>I don&#x27;t necessarily want to learn coding, but at least start thinking as a programmer.<p>To be honest, I think I&#x27;d enjoy even coding but there are so many terms and jargons that get me so overwhelmed when reading something on the web.<p>What would be your advice for someone who knows little about tech, and wants to get more acquainted with it in order to do a better job as a marketer.<p>As I said, I don&#x27;t think I need to learn any specific coding languages, but concepts like Git, continuous integration, continuous delivery, cloud compute I&#x27;d need to get very, very familiar with.<p>Please, excuse my questions if they seem silly.<p>Cheers,')
