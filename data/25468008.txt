It&#x27;s the whole discussion of being a specialist vs. a generalist, to some extent. Do you want to know stuff about a lot of things, or know a lot of things about some stuff?<p>TBH I also believe in knowing fairly deeply a few areas (you have to have _some_ depth too, not just breadth); but I suspect Carmack is not exactly a narrow-field specialist, with him founding Armadillo Aerospace and all...  his knowledge might very well be both wider &amp; deeper than mine :)')
