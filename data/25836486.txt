What, they’re going to delay the rite of electoral college certification and one month later the military, CIA, etc is answering to Trump? What do we know about involvement of actual officials beyond Trumpworld core? Was the FCC in on the insurrection?<p>Usually a coup d’etat interrupts TV broadcasts immediately. Was there a plan at all?<p>Edit: the insurrection didn’t even have snipers to try and kill retreating congressbeings. I don’t think it even qualifies as a terrorist act.  The gravity of the situation (an election that’s really within a statistical margin of error - if the goal was to ascertain the preferences of a plurality) makes it more than mere vandalism, but emotions are running way too high here.<p>The political climate may make the “terrorism” label stick. But there was nothing to it remotely resembling a coup.')
