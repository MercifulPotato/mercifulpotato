Only a teeny tiny fraction of hardware companies have any relationship with Apple whatsoever. For those that do yes their Apple work is lucrative, but for most of them like Sony or Samsung it&#x27;s a minuscule fraction of their overall revenue, and even then is only for very specific components. Large swathes of their output has nothing to do with Apple. The supply chains of most PC manufacturers never go anywhere near Apple or any of Apple&#x27;s suppliers at all, yet somehow Apple is responsible for their shoddy quality and poor compatibility? Amazing.<p>Also the cognitive dissonance is deafening. The company with industry leading device lifetimes and premium long lasting second hand market value is, er, guilty of built-in obsolescence. How does that work exactly?<p>I mean Ive got to think you must know both those points are true. The fact that Apple has nothing to do with the vast majority of the PC supply chain, and the fact that Apple devices have industry leading lifetimes and service and support is just overwhelmingly supported by the evidence. I just don&#x27;t see how you can not know those things. Yet here you are making this argument. I just find it really puzzling. Are you really not aware of these things, or deny that they are true? Are these things we actually need to dig into and discuss?<p>I&#x27;ll concede on the repairability point, yes that&#x27;s a valid argument. I would contend that it&#x27;s mostly just a tradeoff between compactness and simplicity of design, versus repairability and it&#x27;s up to customers to choose which they value most, but Apple has sometimes gone too far in unnecessarily obstructing repairability.')
