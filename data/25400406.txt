[0]<p>If you assume leaners are exactly like partisans and further assume the non-leaners are stealth leaners split equally between the two parties, you&#x27;d predict 36% of I’s would believe in large scale fraud. If you force all non-leaners to the D side or all to R side, you get a predicted range of 28%-44%.<p>So, yeah, the results actually seen (35% of Is believing in widespread fraud) are very consistent with the “independent&quot; numbers being entirely predicted by partisan bias of “independents” combined with whatever factors drive the distribution of beliefs among party identifiers, with nothing nonpartisan about “independents” on this issue.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;14&#x2F;political-independents-who-they-are-what-they-think&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2019&#x2F;03&#x2F;14&#x2F;political-in...</a>')
