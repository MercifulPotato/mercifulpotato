Though the law is rarely enforced, it does exist.<p>-Norway has a similar law, with the interesting application that if you, a Norwegian resident, is caught driving a car registered abroad in Norway, you&#x27;re on the hook for the import taxes which would apply if the car were to be put on Norwegian plates.<p>In a way this makes sense, as (fossil) cars are taxed to high heaven and then some, doubly so if they are well-powered. If the law didn&#x27;t exist, everyone wanting a muscle car would just buy it in Sweden at half the cost.')
