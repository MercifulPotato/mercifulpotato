Most things that are said assume that the listener will self-moderate. If I have Crohn&#x27;s or IBS and I post a sign on my front-lawn saying &quot;bathroom free to use for those in need&quot; I&#x27;m not expecting you to pull up a tour-bus full of tourists, move into it and use it as housing, or a sex den for turning tricks. I mean, I should clarify my sign, but honestly if you don&#x27;t meet me half-way with self-moderation, you are the reason we can&#x27;t have nice things.<p>Above all, make sure you always leave money on the table, _especially_ if you are the bigger party.')
