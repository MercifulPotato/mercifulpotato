That’s a schema specific detail like the number of columns.<p>The character set is also forgivable given the age of the format; it comes from an era when there wasn’t an agreed single character encoding to rule them all. Sure, RFC 4180 probably should have specified UTF-8 but by that point there was already three decades of CSV usage in different encodings on mainframes which are likely still in use even now to make specifying any character encoding rather pointless.<p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m not a massive fan of CSV either. The way quoted new lines are encoded, for example, is horrible and I’ve never liked the “” format for escaping quotation marks. But a lot of CSVs biggest problems are ironically a result of its success: as a format it’s so easy to use that a great many developers can hand crank their own parsers without looking at the spec. So I find it hard being critical about the lack of standardisation in CSV when the real problem is the number of developers who don’t follow the standardisation.')
