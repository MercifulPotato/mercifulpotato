Item(by='tomc1985', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608575775, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25494508, text='I recently switched from the mid-range Nikon 24-120 f&#x2F;4 to the high-end 24-70 f&#x2F;2.8. Yes the high-end lens is also a stop brighter, but you&#x27;re missing the point that almost everything about the optics is dramatically improved. The 24-70 is noticeably sharper, even in the corners, has superior bokeh, has much better and more-easily correctable color fringing, super accurate AF (due to the wider aperture), nearly no vignetting, much better blowout characteristics, and much better distortion at wide angles.<p>More importantly, those things combine to make a certain <i>je nais sai quoi</i> that makes photos taken with it seem to have <i>much</i> higher quality. I took a quick test shot of my dog when I got it and my sister remarked that she could practically feel the dog with her eyes, just looking at the photo. Nobody has ever said that about pictures of the dog that I took with the old lens, even if I spent considerable time trying to get lighting right and the dog to hold still.<p>My old lens ruined a bunch of shots I took in a forest that required running at the extreme edge of its settings. This new lens doesn&#x27;t look like it will do that.')
