Can mute (or dim) the rest of the conversation that is happening, but allow for focused discussion aside. This would be a huge advantage over actual meetings where we must use furtive whispering. Obviously not great for small meetings (distraction maybe) but excellent for large ones and really excellent for social gatherings.<p>2) when using breakout rooms, the ability to still see what is happening in the other breakout rooms. Just like when we are separated in groups in a physical room and we can still peek over at what may be happening in a different group (in case we may want to bounce to a new conversation).')
