In my book that means agreeing with him at this point is essentially saying you don’t value democracy. The man has had meetings to discuss getting the <i>military</i> to rerun elections injustice the states he needs to regain White House... He’s been trying to push violence to happen, he’s a racist. I don’t really know how he can be morally defended at this point. I would have had more respect for his positions and voters before the election but what he’s done to the US is a disaster that will take a long time to fix.')
