Ask the high schools in your country to give you an exam and then grant you a diploma.  International schools can do this, too.<p>Pick a country.  Then:<p>1. Attend a language school there.  For example, the Mandarin Training Center at National Taiwan Normal University <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtc.ntnu.edu.tw" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;mtc.ntnu.edu.tw</a> .<p>2. Take exams: TOEFL, TOEIC, local language competency, high school equivalency, college entrance, <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tw.org&#x2F;tocfl&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tw.org&#x2F;tocfl&#x2F;</a> , etc.<p>3. Apply to universities.  Apply for scholarships.  Every university has a student financial advisor who can help you get scholarships.  Ask them for advice.  Ask them to check your scholarship applications.  Reply to every scholarship rejection with an appeal explaining why you need the money for school.  I received a scholarship after sending an appeal letter.  A lot of money is available to students who can show that they need it.<p>4. Attend university.  Work part-time.  Earn a 4-year degree.  Consider earning a master&#x27;s degree, too.  A master&#x27;s degree helps a lot with getting jobs and visas.  It can also help you move to a third country later.<p>5. Get a job and apply for a work visa.<p>These steps are straightforward in many countries.<p>You can skip step 1 and save time &amp; money.  If you need an exam and nobody offers it nearby, take it in another country.  Or ask your local university to administer the exam.<p>Good luck!')
