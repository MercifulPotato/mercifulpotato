That&#x27;s obviously against the rules and obviously not ok and you&#x27;ve been flaming up a storm here.<p>In case anyone is worried about this, we ban accounts that abuse the site regardless of ideology. If this account were posting the same way but arguing for opposite positions, we&#x27;d ban it the same way.<p>Actually, the irony is how much all these sorts of account have in common with each other on both sides of the ideological divide. They all resemble one another far more than they do the bulk of the readership here, who respect the rules, come to HN out of intellectual interest, and would prefer not to swim in hellfire.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;newsguidelines.html</a>')
