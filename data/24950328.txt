I very occasionally see articles lightly criticizing Trump there and recently they had a piece talking about the pros and cons of each presidential candidate. So while Fox is 99% biased towards Trump, CNN appears 100% biased against him.<p>Actually, I&#x27;ve been reading both sites in the past few months. My rule of thumb is that while each site in isolation is unreadable, whatever they agree on (which is very little) must be the truth!')
