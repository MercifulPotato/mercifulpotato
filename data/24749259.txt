Item(by='formerly_proven', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602451758, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24748439, text='&gt; I can&#x27;t focus properly on bright blue things.<p>No one can, for a bunch of reasons. The eye is mostly corrected for red-green wavelengths; the eye is a lot less sensitive to blue light; there are far fewer receptors for blue light, which reduces spatial resolution.<p>Monochromatic blue displays are an extreme UI antipattern and should not be used for anything. If combined with high luminosity, they become essentially unreadable unless close up. E.g. ultra-blue seven segment LED displays. VFDs can suffer from this, but this is also the reason why many of them use green-blue phosphors, and not blue phosphor (which would be possible).')
