Tracking comms with any moving source, e.g. UAVs, satellites, etc.  Localization of RF sources.  Possibly MIMO-type operations to build more resilient RF point to point networks.  etc. etc.<p>Lots of this depends on the RF architecture of the board though.  The device clearly has high bandwidth but we have no idea what the tuning range is or if those subassemblies can be operated independently to build multiple beams.  Also it is very high frequency (12GHz+) and uses circularly polarized antennas which may limit utility with existing terrestrial RF infrastructure.')
