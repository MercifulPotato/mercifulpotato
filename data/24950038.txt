I came to Mumbai in 2000 in a long distance train and deboarded it at Mumbai CST. As I was figuring out if this is the Mumbai they talk about, we quickly boarded a suburban train to a suburb where I was gonna stay. It didn&#x27;t help that adults around me were constantly saying, &quot;we have reached Mumbai&quot;, while our train was passing through stations like Wadala and Kurla. This was the first time I was experiencing a suburban train system and previously I had only lived in tier-2 cities. My small mind thought that cities and railway stations are supposed to have a one-to-one mapping.<p>Upon reaching the destination I was surprised to see our flat in a small building and that further confused me. The 5 year old me thought that Mumbai only had tall buildings. It took me a while to understand how the city is organized and where I was actually living w.r.t. proper Mumbai.')
