Unless you&#x27;ve built up enough cash to simply buy an annuity so that it&#x27;s now the insurance company&#x27;s problem, or one has a pension, some form of equity returns are needed.<p>At 65, most people&#x27;s <i>average</i> life expectancy can be another twenty years in most developed countries (with a 50% chance of making it into one&#x27;s 90s), so from start (ending school) to finish (death), that could be 60 years. And that doesn&#x27;t include a partner that may live beyond you if they&#x27;re of a younger age, and so would also use whatever resources are left for their own needs.')
