Some advice:<p>- You&#x27;re biting off quite a bit of tech you&#x27;ve never used, it sounds like. If you want cross platform mobile + web support, Unity is probably your best bet in terms of ease-of-use vs. portability<p>- I&#x27;m not sure a graphic designer is going to be able to help you with the more game-specific aspects of game graphics, but I could be wrong. Animations that work well with your game engine of choice can be a big pain<p>- I would buy a book or a course on some kind on mobile game monetization and marketing. It was very different from what I was used to in the SaaS space. Paid user acquisition seemed like a strange concept. Running paid UA campaigns with different install price bids based on quality of player was also a strange concept. If you want the game to make money this stuff will come up.<p>- Try to use services as much as you can. You&#x27;re a startup, after all, you want to spend your time building the things that make your product unique. Playfab is okay but lacks decent analytics features + crash reporting IIRC. Firebase is good for mobile apps stuff but the analytics aren&#x27;t great and  they name stuff horribly. Regardless, pick one and try to lean on it heavily - only build the stuff you absolutely have to. Lots of tools have free trials and free tiers, use them.<p>- If you&#x27;ve never worked in games before, I would look up normal game development process. A simple version is to prototype things aggressively, then throw the bad parts out, then repeat until you&#x27;re ready to do what&#x27;s called a Game Vertical Slice, which usually just means to build all the &quot;essential&quot; parts in a way that lets you use them together. You want to flex your core loop in GVS, so you&#x27;ll need each relevant piece in a usable state. When you make your GVS build, play it a lot, share it with friends, maybe try to get some friends of friends or parents involved. You want honest feedback. Is it fun? Are there parts of it that aren&#x27;t? Are there things in the core loop that don&#x27;t make sense? Are there gaps in the core loop? The data you&#x27;ll get out of GVS is going to very aggressively scope your actual launch + success.<p>I say look into game development processes because I think it&#x27;s important to timebox your curiousity and perfectionism. If it were a side project, I would say kind of follow your curiosity and build things exactly as you want them. Because you&#x27;re trying to actually launch something, I would follow a hard structure such that you know you need to move on when you&#x27;re spinning your wheels.<p>I&#x27;ll try to think of more to write back. If you have questions I&#x27;m happy to answer them. Games are great, and making them is also great.')
