It&#x27;s an app for creative drawing challenges with friends. I&#x27;m seeking a co-founder to join me  on the journey of building and growing YDays into a vibrant, creativity-focused community. We launched in October and have 2,600 users so far. I’m a designer who codes, and I’m open to a few options for a co-founder: a partner with technical expertise in React and backend development, or one who has strong go-to-market and community-building expertise. Looking for someone who shares my passion for fostering creativity. Let me know if you or someone you know might be interested! You can reach me here, or by email at peter@ydays.com.')
