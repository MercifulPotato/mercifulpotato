Item(by='barnacled', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608580225, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25493646, text='I was lucky enough to cash out of a startup after 7 years and 3 or 4 rounds of funding (I had left by the time I got the payout) as a share buyback for one of the VC investors.<p>I was diluted from 3.2% to about 1.3% but the value of the company had clearly risen so _at that point_ it was unimportant.<p>However in my opinion the company&#x27;s burn rate and lack of growth clearly meant a later exit (likely an acqui-hire IMO) would have seen dilution without an equivalent growth in value, not to mention the ever-increasing VC non-dilution shares accelerating that.<p>I got majorly screwed on tax because the startup made no efforts to be efficient and were very chaotic in their arrangements for payout so that is definitely another important factor.<p>Overall by winning the startup share lottery I made roughly $500k for 5 or so years working there and that was as employee #1 so the maths given the pay cut probably don&#x27;t work out too well (perhaps break even if I&#x27;d played the career game well).<p>However of course I am hugely grateful it happened and I got to see a startup grow from 3 people to more than 10x that and learnt a lot, as well as changing my coding career direction substantially.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend joining a startup as a non-founder other than for changing career or starting out. The trade-offs don&#x27;t really make sense in most cases and you get a lot less say than you think you might (founders understandably want to control what is their baby) - never do it for the money.<p>note: I posted a more detailed overview of what happened at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25496667" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25496667</a>')
