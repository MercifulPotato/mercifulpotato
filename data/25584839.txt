I found Western Digital and Sandisk versions of the same drive). All the stats were the same, and they were most likely the same hardware with a different label (WD owns Sandisk). One had a higher review. What&#x27;s interesting is different people will purchase each, so you&#x27;re actually getting a different set of reviewers, so the ratings could be genuinely different.')
