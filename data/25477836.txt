Judging by the pace of trail construction here, it will take many years to complete, but I am still excited to see it happen.<p>I have ridden over 1000 miles on the RRVT in the past couple of years and especially in the pandemic it was a great way to relax and recharge.  I never get bored of riding the same trail segments.  This provides:\n1- Moving meditation, just pedal, relax, contemplate.\n2- Exercise\n3- Motivation - There are Strava segments all over and around this trail, I really like to compete against myself.  Friends supply encouraging kudos.\n4- Connection - Even at a social distance, it is great to see &quot;trail friends&quot;.\n5- Nature - Lots of wildlife along the trail.  Extra race in heartbeat when you see the back end of a skunk aimed at you.\n6- Safety - Other than road crossings, avoiding cars is a big deal.  No fear of some texting driver smashing you from behind.<p>There are all kinds of bikes and people on the trail, recumbents, ebikes, families, race teams, etc.   The trail is well maintained and affordable at $26&#x2F;year for a pass.  My guess is that &gt;90% of the users don&#x27;t pay the fee.')
