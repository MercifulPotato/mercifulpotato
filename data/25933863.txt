If I hire movers and a carpenter to assemble it gets expensive and out of my reach very quickly. I&#x27;d love to learn some carpentry and also how to drive and also get a truck, but I don&#x27;t love it as much as I love my other crafty or spending based hobbies, and I don&#x27;t have room for a shop or parking space for a truck.<p>Most of my IKEA stuff can&#x27;t even leave the room it&#x27;s in without disassembly. I just leave them behind when I move or actually have to pay for someone to dismantle them and take them away from the place. Not sure if they sell them as scrap or as furniture but it&#x27;s cheap because they get to keep whatever they helped me get rid of. Also sometimes I&#x27;ve just put it for free on Craigslist and they last days and get taken.')
