And the original title is from a personal blog where we talk about annoying things. We&#x27;re not a professional tech blog, or a bug tracker, or… something other than our own little thing. I choose that headline not to be clickbait, but &quot;sensationalist&quot; is probably true because I&#x27;m personally really, really angry about this issue. I wanted to do my usual &quot;scan all my documents for the month&quot; routine 30 minutes before going to bed, and instead it turned into a two hour debugging session. And I can&#x27;t even use my normal workflow now, possibly until March. I find it completely unacceptable that Apple would break Preview that way <i>again</i>. It&#x27;s not even the first time. Just thinking about it now gets me going again. That&#x27;s why the headline sounds like it sounds. I would have no problem at all if it was modified here, and as I said – your assessment is absolutely fair.')
