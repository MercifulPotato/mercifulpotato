Still exist? People are just as forced into them now as they were in 1920 especially outside the developed world. You&#x27;re complaining that life in antiquity was hard and attributing it to a failure of society.<p>What if it&#x27;s just the nature of reality that life is hard, brutish, and short, and the slice of modernity we&#x27;ve enjoyed briefly for the last half century has been a reprieve offered by liberalism?<p>Also how do you even bundle anti maskers and authoritarians in one sentence? Anti maskers aren&#x27;t telling people not to go to church or visit their families, or to die alone. The authoritarians are on the other side, like Mr Andrew Cuomo. He&#x27;s the one literally persecuting Jews in New York for practicing their beliefs in a way that is politically unfashionable due to a disease with a 99.9% survival rate.<p>You might disagree with them but anti maskers are anti authoritarian. They are literally fighting authority.')
