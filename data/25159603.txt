One could write:<p><pre><code>  copyfile(path1)to:(path2)\n</code></pre>\nInstead of:<p><pre><code>  copyfile(path1, path2)\n</code></pre>\nI always liked that idea, but found Objective-Câ€™s version of this less attractive. Smalltalk had named parameters too. Algol60, to me, had the nicest syntax for this.')
