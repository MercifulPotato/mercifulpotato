I have been thinking of moving all those into a more open format. As of now, I am thinking of going with markdown.<p>For exporting the OneNote notes, I tried https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;SjoerdV&#x2F;ConvertOneNote2MarkDown. That seems to do the job, though I will have to spend some time reformatting it.<p>For editing the files, I will most likely use VSCode (may be with Dendron) or Typora or Zettlr.<p>Next thing to figure out is where do I host this. I have been experimenting with a couple of self hosted solutions such as Gitea &amp; NextCloud with raspberry pi. I would like to access the notes from my phone (over OpenVPN or Wireguard).<p>Another very important requirement is search. With OneNote, I can just type in words and get results instantly. Gitea doesn&#x27;t seem to support search. NextCloud &amp; Gitlab seems to need ElasticSearch (which slowed down my Pi a lot). ElasticSearch seems overkill for this.<p>What kind of self hosted solution would you recommend that will allow me to<p>1. access the notes from mobile over VPN<p>2. provide full text search across all files (markdown files as well as source code) from both mobile as well as laptop.<p>If you have any other suggestions, please share them as well.')
