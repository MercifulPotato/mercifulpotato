For example Ugaritic had &quot;s&quot; and unvoiced &quot;th&quot; like in &quot;thin&quot;, while Phoenician pronounced both as &quot;s&quot; and kept only the sigma letter.<p>(I have used the names of the letters as used by the Greeks, as those are more familiar for most people)<p>The Ugaritic alphabet also used for certain purposes 3 supplementary signs, invented later, and which were added after the original 27 consonants.')
