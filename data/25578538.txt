Together, we try and make better decisions (in manual or automated ways). A DE can produce great data but it&#x27;s only useful if it helps the DA&#x2F;DS. There&#x27;s a lot of friction there.<p>Most of that friction disappears with SQL-based orchestration tools (I mean specifically dbt here, but there are others). Suddenly the analyst can create the data they need! With minimal guidance from a DE.<p>That can be with Spark SQL (+ DeltaLake &#x2F; Iceberg), or some warehouse. That&#x27;s not the issue.<p>The issue is around keeping orchestration simple when you&#x27;re not <i>just</i> doing simple stuff anymore. Keeping that DAG logical, clear, and smooth is difficult once you include non-SQL items.<p>This isn&#x27;t solved by Spark UDFs unfortunately :)')
