However this is a result of producers competing to offer the lowest prices and the consumer buying the lowest price they can find and being unaware of the suffering of the animals.&quot;<p>How is this different from this kind of videos? It&#x27;s all about  consumer buying the product (watching the videos) and being unaware of the suffering of the animals.')
