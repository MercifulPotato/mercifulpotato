Consider that the people that are most concerned at our poor treatment of environment probably do so in part because they see nature as an extension of themselves and give nature human-like emotions despite knowing it&#x27;s definitely not &quot;real&quot;.<p>The purpose of educators and writers giving animals etc. human qualities is intentional - it makes people more focused and concerned about losing nature and preventing the possible collapse of the environment&#x27;s food chains,  not about intentionally miseducating the public.')
