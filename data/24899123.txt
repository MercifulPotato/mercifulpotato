Although now it is mainly for personal scripts and developing proof of concept scripts for work.<p>If fact in 1999 I used TCL (and Expect) on an ISP I worked for to run various tests checking for Year 2K issues and we used the same framework for patching and system building. Talked to somebody I worked with at that place recently, he had found a bit of the old application, and we noticed we have a pretty good Ansible base written in it.<p>I also use it to write fairly easy DSL languages for various things, package them as tclkits, and have binaries that can be run on various machines.')
