Apple isn&#x27;t blocking anything w.r.t Facebook. All they&#x27;re simply doing is exposing to the user what Facebook are trying to collect about the user. And then, the user gets full power to approve or disapprove what information goes to Facebook. I think this is a great win for the users. I don&#x27;t understand how Apple is blocking small businesses here. Apple isn&#x27;t blocking tracking here at all, the user is, if at all they choose to.<p>If your business model involves fraudulently spying on the users and making money out of it, then too bad, that&#x27;s your problem.<p>And about the arguments on &quot;Facebook is free&quot;. \nI agree that Facebook is a free service, and they need to be compensated somewhat, but, if a user disables ad tracking, Facebook can simply block them from accessing their free service, which is fair, right? It&#x27;s only a problem if Facebook continues to allow their free service to such users.<p>Well, even then I would think charging iOS users who block Facebook tracking is a fair deal, especially if there is a premium version of Facebook with no spyware in it, I totally see myself and many others paying for it.<p>But Facebook won&#x27;t do that, because their core philosophy is just criminal - spy the users as much as you can without their consent. So, fuck them. I support Apple here. I hope Android follows suit as well and we can slowly kill Facebook together.')
