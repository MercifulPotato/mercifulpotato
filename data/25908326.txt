I don&#x27;t think this format is particularly conducive to achieving persuasion, synthesis, or producing comparisons between equivalent perspectives (some people are <i>just wrong</i>, some peoples precepts are so fundamentally incompatible with each-other&#x27;s that their perspectives are like apples and oranges).')
