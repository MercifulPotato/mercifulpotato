Are people listening to more, less or the same amount (quantity, diversity, songs, albums, etc) of music?<p>Listener behaviors have changed, to only cite revenue for the industry (already a subset of all music sources) is unscientific. Video killed something, what killed video and why?<p>I am going to go out on a limb here and conjecture that the vast majority of people do not listen to music, or listen to much less music than in the past, same thing goes for books. Both industries make the majority of their profits off a small and shrinking segment of the population.<p>Hit singles are cheap, easy and plentiful to source from anywhere, both paid and free. If the industry just makes hits, they won&#x27;t have the breadth to support a diverse revenue base. You can&#x27;t survive on icing alone.')
