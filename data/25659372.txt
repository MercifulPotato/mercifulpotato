It&#x27;s an entirely separate skillset separate from your role as a developer. The fact that there have now been several studies showing it doesn&#x27;t correlate with job performance makes its emphasis in interviews questionable.<p>There&#x27;s also some fear on the &quot;poseur&quot; factor that people worry about. If candidates can simply rote-learn their way into senior roles I wouldn&#x27;t really feel comfortable having them as team members.<p>With that said, I do like think the advice of reading <i>Programming Pearls</i> and <i>Designing Data-Intensive Applications</i> -- two books useful for the job at hand, and just your general knowledge of how systems work and how to approach problems. Leetcode, by contrast, is empty calories.')
