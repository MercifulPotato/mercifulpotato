Nvidia removed the DAC from their GPUs after GTX 9xx series and even that wasn&#x27;t that great (AMD also removed it some time before). So you&#x27;ll need to find some way to convert the digital signal to analog VGA signal and a good DAC for that. I think there is some thread in the HardOCP forums about that but personally i haven&#x27;t tried to go down that rabbit hole (yet :-P).')
