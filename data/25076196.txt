Expressiveness + easyness to read, even for a beginner. Python evolved from a project that was testing the UX of syntax for programming languages.<p>My favorite example here is that in a function definition, `def foo(): \\n pass`, the `:` isn&#x27;t needed, a machine can parse it with only the newline. The : is a requirement because it made it easier for humans to read the language in user tests.')
