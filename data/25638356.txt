It&#x27;s not about &quot;power in society&quot; at all, it&#x27;s about the genesis of gendered notions in the child which leads to shifting identifications and relationships with parents. As a result it is a feminist concern, but of an entirely different order.<p>And this is all in Freud himself! He was woke to gender!')
