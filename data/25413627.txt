I&#x27;m sure they should, but you may have a situation where 1) almost all (legit) purchases are put on a credit card, 2) fraudulent charges are almost never put on, 3) multiple adults share a credit card, and 4) credit card description lines are...not descriptive(this is getting better), it seems possible to miss charges.<p>My wife and I put ~$6k&#x2F;mo on our shared CC over hundreds of transactions. I <i>do</i> review the charges, but it is extremely tiring going through every single one, trying to puzzle out what it was for, and then bringing in my wife to see if she knows what it was for.<p>The only saving grace is that Chase lets me get an email for every transaction &gt;$0, so I review purchases approximately immediately after they are made, and not once at the end of the month. But, I can understand why that might slip past a lot of people.')
