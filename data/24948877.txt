A big waste of time for that extra path (even if initially sent by them) that I wish they didn&#x27;t had to maintain and triage bugs.<p>The experience with glitches and problems that the user above  just describe to you and I see every day on social media. And the blame went to Wayland. I don&#x27;t claim to know how it works deep down I can only comment about the smell and it&#x27;s not pleasant.<p>They promised many things years ago and we are still in the same situation. I will be the first to congratulate NVIDIA if they fix this issue and change their practices. I&#x27;m sure they have legit grievances with Linux developers but their behavior is awful if you&#x27;re a user or want the desktop to succeed.')
