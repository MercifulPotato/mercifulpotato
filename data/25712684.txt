But if that jury is just as extreme as the poster advocating murdering journalists, what then?<p>Section 230 doesn&#x27;t provide a safe harbor for criminal speech like advocating or planning violence. There has to be a second moderation channel to keep that from happening, or Parler should be liable as an accessory for violent crimes planned in the open on its platform.<p>I&#x27;d wash my hands of them if they&#x27;re that negligent.')
