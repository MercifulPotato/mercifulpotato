It&#x27;s actually ... really, really good. A lot of edit operations that I&#x27;d&#x27;ve had to think for a while about how to support UX for--they do a good job of. I even ran into more hiccups using Notion. It&#x27;s a huge plus for me to be able to see the same &quot;knowledge tree&quot; both at my computer and while I&#x27;m on the go.<p>I love the key-feel of Vimflowy tho, and it makes me wish they could both just talk about the same underlying data store... Pairs especially well with being added to the &quot;scratch workspace&quot; in i3 for example.<p>More generally speaking about this kind of tool: Workflowy has been amazing. The zoom aspect is really what makes it what it is for me, being able to enter a context, but then also have that as part of larger one, and being able to move things so quickly too.')
