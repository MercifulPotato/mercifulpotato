I think many also overestimate the FDAs ability to regulate &quot;useless&quot; medicine, so doctors that prescribe medicine also have the same problems surgeons do.<p>The article goes over more of this as well, but there&#x27;s some regulation just not by a federal agency (unless you count CMS compensation&#x2F;approval). Maybe we&#x27;ll eventually have a group that specifically monitors surgical procedures.<p>Finally, I think it&#x27;s fairly telling that the majority of these &quot;useless&quot; surgeries are elective procedures<p>(disclosure, if it matters: I&#x27;ll be entering a surgical field that almost exclusively only performs elective procedures)')
