The OP said that they trusted gorhill. I pointed out that gorhill already did exactly this once. <i>It is not a hypothetical</i>.<p>That said, it looks like 800k users still have the original uBlock installed. And also, uBlock Origin is blocking ublock.org on the basis of it being malware. Are you saying it&#x27;s not actually a malware risk, and it&#x27;s really on Origin&#x27;s blocklist for some totally unrelated reason?')
