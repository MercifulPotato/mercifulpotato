The underlying assumption that all packages will be latest till that date simply doesn&#x27;t hold.<p>That&#x27;s why packrat&#x2F;renv etc will use a lock file to record all package versions, and why you will need a project to manage libraries, because you will need to maintain different library environments and cannot install to same location.<p>Yet the author take installing all packages to a single location as a feature since you don&#x27;t need to install same package again, and try to avoid project and prefer script as much as possible when doing reproducible research?')
