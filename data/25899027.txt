I&#x27;ve been using Telegram for quite a few years, and back then I used to be more of an early adopter and tried to make my social circles to switch to Telegram and one circle did, the tech circle. The other circles didn&#x27;t care much about the features that Telegram had as much as the contacts they had on Whatsapp.<p>So now with that amount of people switching trying out Telegram, could mean that at least 2-3 people on a non-tech social circle might be using Telegram which might end up convincing the whole group to switch because of features (polls? utility bots?) or any other benefit they might find.')
