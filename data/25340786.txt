Given those circumstances, officer #1&#x27;s simply having his gun out of the holster and at his side, aimed at the floor, finger off trigger, is maybe reasonable.<p>Officer #2 is just on a power trip though. Anyone seen The Andy Griffith Show from the 60s? It&#x27;s like Andy is walking in unarmed and unconcerned while Barney Fife is behind him in full &quot;tacticool&quot; gear pointing his gun at anything and everything. Ridiculous.')
