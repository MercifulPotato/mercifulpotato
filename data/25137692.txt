Immigration can&#x27;t serve all of the generational pyramid scheme.<p>A &quot;retired people child care corps&quot; would be a nice thing to try. Mental and physical activity is key to health in retirement, and childcare is an excellent healthy disruption to retirement. They especially could help out with unscheduled childcare needs.')
