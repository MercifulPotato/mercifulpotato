Especially in winter, where everyone is wearing jackets, the train gets super hot and you&#x27;re just sweating next to some guy who won&#x27;t take his damn backpack off. Oh, train traffic ahead. Great - now my commute&#x27;s an hour.<p>I do miss the view in the morning and evening crossing the Manhattan bridge, though. That was nice.')
