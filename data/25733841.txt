I don&#x27;t mean to be a defeatist. But I would say if a <i>single</i> private entity (or alliance) did control all digital communication, any actions they took could be invisible to anyone that opposed them, assuming they had sufficiently advanced machine learning capable of preventing subversive communication. You would <i>need</i> alternative options for communication, digital or otherwise to have any hope of overcoming such a hypothetical scenario.<p>My hope would be that we continue to have <i>utilities</i> such as phone lines, that <i>internet</i> would ultimately end up treated as a utility in the same sense as phone lines (especially if it completely replaces them, which is largely is doing), radio (just as ham radio operators believe in the importance of maintaining their systems), etc.<p>And my other hope would be that we continue to legislate and enforce against monopolies, not just on capitalistic entities but especially on privately run communication channels.')
