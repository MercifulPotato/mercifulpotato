Probably an executable shell or Python file that doesn&#x27;t draw in any dependencies would be ideal for me since those can run on pretty much any Linux computer in my experience.<p>Based off the recommendations here, I&#x27;ll likely migrate my Jekyll site to Hugo or this one which was recommended by another commenter in the thread: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rgz.ee&#x2F;ssg.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rgz.ee&#x2F;ssg.html</a><p>Right now, do you just keep Hugo in your `$PATH`? If you do that, do you need to note in your site&#x27;s README which version of Hugo it should be built with, or are Hugo versions pretty backwards-compatible with each other?')
