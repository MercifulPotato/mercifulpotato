They basically form an annotated log of what I did, so I never have to remember long commands.<p>I can&#x27;t remember long commands so I always write them down.<p>Examples of using a JSON API, using a C++ tool uftrace, and hacking on Kernighan&#x27;s awk:<p><i>Shell Scripts Are Executable Documentation</i> <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oilshell.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;shell-doc.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oilshell.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;shell-doc.html</a><p>Admittely there are a lot of people who don&#x27;t seem to like reading shell scripts as docs.  But you don&#x27;t really have to read the code -- you just read the function names.<p>I also added doc comments to Oil, like this:<p><pre><code>    deploy() {\n       ### doc comment\n       cp foo bar\n    }\n</code></pre>\nwhich you can access with the &#x27;pp&#x27; builtin.
