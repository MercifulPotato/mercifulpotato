I could have probably done that with iptables or some such but partially this was a fun exercise in writing a small C program that did big things. The company I worked for relied on these UDP packets as they were a core part of our business and as we migrated from our platform version 1 to the newly developed version 2 we needed both systems to receive the same stream of data. My little program I called wedge did that really well, down to spoofing the sender’s IP address. This allowed us to make a seamless migration of a huge number of customers without any downtime.<p>I say all this because I highly recommend playing with Linux’s raw packet interface and learning the structure of IP packets to do so. You can really gleam a ton of interesting info about it that way. Writing your own TCP stack was outside of what I needed but even the comparatively much simpler task of routing UDP packets was really fun and rewarding.')
