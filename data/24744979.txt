But it&#x27;s gotta be called out, that&#x27;s an unnecessarily degrading sentence where I lost all respect for the author in a single punch.<p>I know it&#x27;s predominately nerd&#x2F;male. I don&#x27;t play D&amp;D but the only people I know who play it are one guy and two women. So that sentence really bewildered me and it shines a light on why not more women feel comfortable playing this stuff.')
