For example, vocational degree that signals high skills or petitioning for NIMBY laws.<p>The reason people latch on to these is simple. There is too much to lose. The crash is too deep. If one loses a job, they lose healthcare. Not because of shortages like 200 years ago, but because of the extreme capitalism taking over healthcare, incentivizing providers and insurance companies to lobby for shitty laws instead of true competition.')
