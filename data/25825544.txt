They are the ones who are supposed to handle stuff like this.<p>To me it is a cop-out to blame the feds. There is nothing to stop any state in our union from addressing this pandemic as they see fit. The states making up the Euro aren&#x27;t blaming Brussels for their problems.<p>The converse would be to have one world government make decisions for everybody, right? That would work if we all agreed on everything, but we don&#x27;t. So it is good to have different states try different solutions, and copy what works. Better then having a bad federal solution imposed on everyone.')
