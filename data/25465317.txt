Pijul guarantees that two patches that could be written independently always commute.<p>This has important consequences:<p>- You can push patches from the same branch in any order (provided they don&#x27;t depend on each other). This wont change their identity, meaning that if you decide to push the other patches later, you can do it without having to rebase, and review&#x2F;test the new order.<p>- Conflicts happen between patches, and conflict resolutions are modeled as patches. This means that if you solve a conflict once, you can push your resolution, even if you have your own, private patches on the same branch.')
