E.g. you can raise signals just like segfaults generate signals.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not sure how non-blocking IO is &quot;the problem.&quot;<p>The point is that non-blocking IO wants to abstract away the hardware, but the abstraction is leaky. Most programs which use non-blocking IO actualy want to implement multitasking without relying threads. But that turns out to be the wrong approach.')
