Item(by='aarchi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603731824, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24896650, text='&gt; If you leave your love of programming and the feeling of the computer revolution romance on autopilot, the industry will burn through you. It’s your responsibility to know exactly why you’re doing the specific job you’re doing, what your long-term goal is, how to develop a credible plan to achieve it, and what you need to do (and not to do) to keep your underground spring of creativity alive. Don’t outsource this to anyone else, and don’t neglect it. No one can do that job except you, and the job needs to get done. Unless you want to spend the rest of your life growing hydroponic tomatoes.<p>This is something that I think about often, but it&#x27;s difficult to find a path that is creativity-sustaining. In practice it hasn&#x27;t worked for me. Alternatively, I have considered seeking tech jobs that are not demanding and have fixed hours, leaving time to explore passions outside of work.')
