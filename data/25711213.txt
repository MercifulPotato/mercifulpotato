There&#x27;s little to adjudicate in these matters because the law protects platforms for content posted.<p>The real shortcoming in these matters is a total lack of legislation that reflects the world today on the Internet. Section 230 and the rest of the CDA were passed in 1996. The world looked a lot different back then.<p>Until legislatures act, private companies self-policing at their own discretion is the best we get.<p>&gt; For all we know there was a limited group of users of that service that caused this action, however we donâ€™t know and likely will never know the facts in this matter.<p>To my knowledge Parler was in part blocked due to a total lack of a moderation policy. It was the policy of the app, not the mere action of a minority of users.')
