Not only is Tesla behind the others, they&#x27;re basically in completely different worlds. No-one I&#x27;ve talked to in the self-driving car industry considers their approach to have merit if you&#x27;re looking for an actually autonomous car. This is an excellent example of how marketing can decieve.')
