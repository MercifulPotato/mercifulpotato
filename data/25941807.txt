I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions about the policy or the project itself. I was apprehensive about adding the closed-contribution policy but I&#x27;ve seen overwhelmingly positive support for it since I released.<p>Some commenters have noted that I could use another free code hosting platform. That&#x27;s a valid criticism. However, I like the tools and workflow that GitHub offers personally. The GitHub Discussions feature in particular has been a nice step toward improving communication. GitHub Actions have been really nice for a CI workflow too.')
