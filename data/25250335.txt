People who impose on others in this manner should still be punished, or maybe exiled.<p>But there are a lot of people in jail who have not hurt anyone else, for crimes like drug possession. In the comment you responded to I gave other examples where a majority imposes on others with dubious justification.<p>Look at how fickle U.S. politics is, with our federal-tribal-leaders now expressing the will of a new 51% majority that changes every couple of terms, increasingly treating the constitution as something to work around. It seems that there are way too many people&#x2F;groups who would be happy to force everyone to their way of thinking, worldwide, and that leaves lots of room for abuse and corruption.<p>I suppose there&#x27;s not much that can be done if most people think that&#x27;s ok.')
