Suffice it to say that your reasoning is not the one the court chose, so I don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;re going with this.<p>My point was simply the wording above: the court CHOSE to issue a very broad decision in Citizen&#x27;s, just as it chose NOT to issue one here.  And the reason is just simple desire and not any kind of principle.  The court wanted to, and that&#x27;s as far as it goes.  You see the same skew in logic in arguments about Roe, where the same people (like you) who think Citizen&#x27;s is fine for throwing out huge regulatory areas based on a novel reading of the constitution suddenly think it&#x27;s &quot;judicial activism&quot; to find a right to medical privacy in the due process clause.')
