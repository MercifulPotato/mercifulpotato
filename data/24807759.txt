Between 1924 and 1927 the famous lighting study was conducted. Workers experienced a series of lighting changes in which productivity was said to increase with almost any change in the lighting. This turned out not to be true.<p>&gt; Later interpretations such as Landsberger&#x27;s suggested that the novelty of being research subjects and the increased attention from such could lead to temporary increases in workers&#x27; productivity. This interpretation was dubbed &quot;the Hawthorne effect,&quot; although the data does not support that view.<p>&gt; Other researchers have attempted to explain the effects with various interpretations. J. G. Adair warned of gross factual inaccuracy in most secondary publications on the Hawthorne effect and that many studies failed to find it.')
