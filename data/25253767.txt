For me I have found staying away from HFCS after 6:30, and eating very light.  Staying away from anything with caffeine in it for the same time too.  Getting to sleep at the same time every night.  My diet played a large part of my sleeping well.  I have asked others in my family to try the same thing and they have seen similar results.  The caffeine bit was a big one.  Its effects linger for a long time even though you get little to no benefit from it.')
