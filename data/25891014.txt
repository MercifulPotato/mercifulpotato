So getting back and forth to all the classes was very difficult. Not to mention I had to work two jobs to support myself at the time.<p>I would have fucking loved to be able to do my classwork remotely and just hung out with other students as my schedule allowed. Of course it was not an option back then.<p>I have recently went back to university to advance my degree and it has nearly all been online. Much better! Frankly I met many more people than I did back in the day through the online tools and the fact that the classwork can be flexible around my life, versus the other way around was very convenient!<p>I can see how this might not work for labs, but for most other classes it seems to be a very viable alternative.<p>Also, I think you might be surprised about how much value people of any age put on being near other people at the time of learning. It obviously is very valuable to you, but I would expect you will find just as many that couldn&#x27;t care less about that aspect of it.')
