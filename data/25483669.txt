There are hints&#x2F;clues within the story to show why the narrator may be unreliable. You can&#x27;t say a narrator is unreliable because the fictional world does not align with the real world. That&#x27;s my point.<p>It would be like saying bilbo baggins is an unreliable narrator in lord of the rings because magical rings don&#x27;t exist in the real world. Absurd. But you could say the narrator in fight club may be unreliable since its revealed he has mental issues and the stories don&#x27;t line up within the movie&#x2F;book.')
