If an animal is born in captivity it will probably be killed for meat at some point, that&#x27;s just math...<p>I am pretty sure they&#x27;re just saying that after 6 months they aren&#x27;t suckling anyway and are grassfed through being a yearling until they&#x27;re adults. Few farms will talk about killing their animals, of course, keeping what is happening sterile in appearance is pretty important for keeping the amount people eat high.<p>I hope none of that is controversial, it can always be assumed that animals born on a farm ultimately are eaten as meat... I&#x27;m a vegetarian and I&#x27;m not thrilled about it, but that&#x27;s just math =&#x2F;')
