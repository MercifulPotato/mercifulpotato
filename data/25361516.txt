He&#x27;s not gonna live in California if for the next year or so he&#x27;s gonna be spending a majority of his time at installations in Texas.<p>I mean, Musk is opening up a Gigafactory in Germany near Berlin, a place that culturally and regulatory, out-California&#x27;s California in terms of politics.<p>People really really want to turn this into an anti-California story and sell conservative politics. I&#x27;m sure Musk will enjoy lower taxes, but if you listen to the same interview, he rakes MBAs and bean counters over the coals.<p>I don&#x27;t think Musk cares about profits or money as much are libertarians fetishize, he cares about what he can accomplish. He&#x27;s more concerned with his goals and how much stands in his way, not whether or not he can get a tax cut.<p>If anything, environmental and labor regulations that slow down his rate of building are more important to him.<p>How can people listen to the audio of this WSJ interview, where he claims corporate boards, and power points, and financial meetings, are all bullshit and a waste of time. This is a guy who doesn&#x27;t want to take investor Q&amp;A during earnings calls. He routine tells people not to buy Tesla stock! He tells people people to sell Tesla stock if they don&#x27;t like his answers to Q&amp;A. He literally gives two fucks about the kind of stuff hyper-libertarians on Seeking Alpha care about. He&#x27;s also tired of the games, the constant bullshitting and trying to short the stock.<p>He doesn&#x27;t care about the money as much as he cares about making cool shit and getting yo&#x27; ass to Mars.')
