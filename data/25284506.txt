Perhaps he didn&#x27;t do his full position justice.  Maybe he feels like the lost human connection, dress code for your face, forced shutdown of certain businesses, school closures (and online learning) are costs that are not worth the benefit we get.  I could hardly blame him.  The online communities I follow often seem to be overwhelmingly in support of stricter mitigations, etc.  Maybe he feels like he&#x27;s been yelling into the wind for too long to keep up the nuanced discussions.<p>For me personally, I likely feel similar to him.  From all the data I&#x27;ve seen - the vast majority of people - especially the workforce - have very little to worry about personally.  The small (but not negligible) fraction of people that have increased risk can often reasonable take their own appropriate extra precautions.  Then there is the even smaller fraction that can&#x27;t reasonable take the precautions that they feel they need - those are the people we should work to support directly.  We should be able to do this without broad, sweeping measures that are just completely not necessary for the direct benefit of most people.')
