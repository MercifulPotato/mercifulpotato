(Also, even without that, he would have neither the outsider ambiguity that help him win in 2016 not the power of incumbency that helped him, but not enough to win, in 2020. He might retain enough influence with the Republican base that if he isn&#x27;t disabled by legal issues he could win a nomination in 2024, but the general election seems more uphill.)')
