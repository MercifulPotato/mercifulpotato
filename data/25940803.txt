We all know how hard it is to build a community. To just say go use another platform is really not a fair comparison.<p>Discord and Reddit in this case, even if they&#x27;re not banned from Reddit yet, is their only means of communicating with eachother. Sure people can create some kind of group &#x2F; channel on another platform, but if they are banned from one there is no way for them to know where to go.<p>Obviously the group is going to be mostly dispanded when they are banned or removed. I would say this is a kind of censorship. If they would&#x27;ve been given some time, like a week or a month before the banning then I would agree it would not be censorship because then they can assemble somewhere else.')
