All the satellites need fairly accurate orbital information from all other satellites; there will be several thousand satellites capable of performing autonomous orbital adjustments to avoid debris and for their own station keeping.  There has to be a convenient and reliable fallback for automatically syncing satellites with the rest of the network after a reboot or loss of communication.<p>The packet network needs to maintain an efficient routing table and provide low packet loss to end-users.  My guess is that the only practical choice will be establishing a large number of point-to-point channels with their own retry&#x2F;error-correction management.  TCP&#x2F;IP isn&#x27;t capable of dealing with more than about 1% packet loss and I doubt raw optical&#x2F;wireless links will be reliable enough especially with topology changes, requiring extensive store-and-forward hardware to buffer transmissions waiting for a reliable route or de-duplicating multicast packets at the receiving end.  Reassembly and de-duplication on receipt is theoretically feasible; if a tight reception window can be maintained then specialized hardware could filter duplicates sent over 2 or 3 redundant routes to a local receiver without increasing observed latency or using unreasonable amounts of RAM.  A combination approach could allow a tradeoff between using double or triple the raw bandwidth but providing low-latency reliability vs. higher latency with retries while maximizing throughput depending on the current network load.  It could also be hardcoded for different traffic classes.<p>I&#x27;m not involved in this problem space in any technical capacity but it sounds like a very fun set of problems to solve.')
