Even if you&#x27;re looking at moving into a role where your domain knowledge would be immensely relevant (lots of ag + remote sensing startups these days), you will be seen as underqualified compared to someone with only a BS.  You&#x27;ll be seen as underqualified compared to someone with no BS or a BS in an irrelevant field.  You need to be strictly better at multiple roles than anyone they could hire to be considered, and even then you&#x27;ll be expected to work for 1&#x2F;3 to 1&#x2F;2 of what they&#x27;d pay someone with only a BS and no experience. Folks usually despise domain experts because they see the role of their company as &quot;disrupting&quot; all of the prior knowledge.  You represent what they want to replace and you&#x27;re likely to disagree with them about key approaches.<p>You will be much more effective, but no one cares about how much you contribute to the company&#x27;s bottom line.  People only care about appearances.<p>The appearance companies want is a &quot;self taught college dropout&quot;. That holds for data science and machine learning positions every bit as much as it does for developer positions, in my experience.<p>The upshot of this is that you likely know how to learn quickly.  Pick up multiple additional skillsets.<p>You won&#x27;t get hired because you&#x27;re an expert in X field that the company needs + a data scientist.  You&#x27;ll get hired because you can throw together a crappy web app on short notice, or debug their crazy duct-tape-and-glue CI system, or save a lot on their AWS bill by switching some things around.  You need those skills _on top of_ being a domain expert and a data scientist.<p>You have to be able to do more than anyone else they could possibly hire for the role to even be considered.  Otherwise, you&#x27;ll never overcome the fact that you have a PhD in their eyes.<p>Again, that&#x27;s the bitter&#x2F;jaded view.  Take the above with a grain of salt.')
