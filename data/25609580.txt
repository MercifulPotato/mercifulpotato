We wanted to remove the friction of influencer marketing, so we implemented the following things:<p>- Easily search &amp; filter through hundreds of influencers (more filters will be added soon)<p>- Instant message influencers directly through the site, all commication is centralized vs having to do it over DM&#x27;s &amp; email<p>- Pay influencers through Collabstr, we hold the money until the work is complete, removes uncertainty about getting paid for both parties<p>Would love to hear thoughts &amp; feedback!')
