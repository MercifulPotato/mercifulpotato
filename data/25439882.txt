These of course are increasingly common, they&#x27;re a plague on the Internet.<p>So I engaged with the cookie notification monster, wanting it to go away. I clicked on show details and immediately regretted it. What is all of that shit? I&#x27;ve been building complex applications online since the mid 1990s and my brain instantly spun around looking at that: I have to actually burn my time to figure out all those layers of cookie crap and what they all do or mean.<p>I immediately abandoned your site at that point. I&#x27;m not spending the time. It was annoying as a pop-over, it was doubly annoying to engage with.<p>To make matters worse, your site hung multiple times when trying to load it due to consent.cookiebot.com causing a loading delay. Ditch that pile of gargage immediately for a more simple cookie control engagement approach.')
