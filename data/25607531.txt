Obviously that&#x27;s not acceptable, so it&#x27;s not going to happen.<p>When I buy software, I certainly don&#x27;t expect to get drugs. When I buy a game called &quot;Surgeon Simulator&quot; I don&#x27;t expect to receive actual surgeon training any more than I expect to get amphetamine after getting an app called amphetamine.')
