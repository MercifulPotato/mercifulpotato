Item(by='tboerstad', descendants=None, kids=[24739629], score=None, time=1602320014, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24736559, text='Thank you for this article!<p>I wrote a CSV parser in Javascript for my site <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.csvplot.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.csvplot.com</a>.<p>Even the &quot;industry standard&quot; PapaParse JS library was a lot slower than my no-frills implementation, so I thought I was onto something.<p>Then I read the &quot;So You Want To Write your own CSV Code&quot; [0]. I realized if I supported every corner case I would lose my entire speed advantage, which in hindsight is obvious. That newlines can exist inside a column if quoted ( Something like &quot;my \\n value with newline&quot;) is specifically what caused the most issues. Incidentally the article also points at that this ruins the possibility of processing each row independently.<p>I started reading about highly efficient text parsing, but most of what I could find was dedicated to JSON parsing, with simdjson as one example. I briefly considered using webassembly to leverage existing fast implementations, but that never happened. My motivation for this specific side project ran out the minute it was fast enough for my own needs.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thomasburette.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;25&#x2F;so-you-want-to-write-your-own-CSV-code&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thomasburette.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;25&#x2F;so-you-want-to-writ...</a>')
