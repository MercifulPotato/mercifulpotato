That was back in October. There&#x27;s really no reason to live as a disfigured person for all people. Some people can do it and I respect those individuals. I rather continue just taking morphine (otherwise I cannot walk) and get assisted dying after the snow melts. I feel like I&#x27;ve enjoyed enough of this life that I could. I&#x27;ll email you if you don&#x27;t mind my mentality, I always like to write to someone about anything. It&#x27;s my favorite way to pass the time.')
