Not sure if this is bad faith or a reading comprehension issue.<p>Throughout my comment I made a few things explicitly clear. That I don&#x27;t blame the gamers, rather the game devs for including the option and the leagues for choosing to play games that have this. And that many games are fine. You chose to ignore that when making your case.<p>To your point, plenty of games exicitly have such behavior <i>built-in</i> via  fatalities, takedowns, executions, or some signature move and slow motion kill-cam to be shown to the victim usually, all with animations that go beyond &quot;I defeated my enemy&quot; into &quot;I humiliated them&quot;. There&#x27;s only one reason to include such mechanism in a game and that&#x27;s that they <i>want</i> gamers to use them. A league promoting those games regardless of whether it punishes using that feature still endorses them in their entirety. Those are the ones I&#x27;m having issues with.<p>The gaming and e-sports industries don&#x27;t do enough to call the offenders out on this behavior. At best they turn a blind eye while still playing and promoting such games. I&#x27;m sorry but this is like having Harvey Weinstein or Jeffrey Epstein at your birthday party and thinking it&#x27;s ok because they didn&#x27;t harass anyone while you were in the room.<p>The fact that I still have to explain this already speaks volumes.')
