Certainly, in this instance, non-operative management was appropriate. But the more important question is what on average happens to the entire &#x27;population&#x27; of people presenting with Hadfield&#x27;s symptoms and signs if they&#x27;re managed operatively and non-operatively.<p>If we imagine a disease where non-operative management leads to a 50% mortality rate within a year. If we take 100 people with this disease and manage them non-operatively, at the end of a year we&#x27;ll have 50 people saying how pleased they are to have avoided surgery and complaining about the aggressiveness of surgeons, and we&#x27;ll have 50 dead people.<p>That&#x27;s why the diagnosis and management of disease must be informed by high quality clinical studies, rather than anecdotes.')
