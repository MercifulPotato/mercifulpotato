Simultaneously give up their outdated idea that their core architecture is so valuable and secret that it must never be fabbed elsewhere. And spend the money to keep up with fab technology.  And possibly put an actual engineer at the helm. Right now Intel seems to be going the way of Boeing — plenty of money, but less innovation than they ought to have.)<p>Keeping fab and design under one roof does not require that the fab and the design sides of the business exclusively with with each other.<p>(I think Intel should keep Altera, too.  A paired CPU and FPGA solution has genuine value. One thing that Intel appears to still be good at is software tooling. If Intel were to provide tooling for their FPGAs that was anywhere near as good as their x86 tooling, then Altera could take off as everyone’s favorite platform.  Right now they’re at substantial risk of losing new developer mindshare to Lattice because of the IceStorm project. I have trouble imagining that more than a few $M of total resources have been spent there.<p>As it stands, nVidia is a major player in big chips that do serious computation.  Whatever one may think about CUDA, it’s in a whole different league from the garbage currently available from Xilinx and Altera.)')
