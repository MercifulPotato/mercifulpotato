Cloudflare runs a sandboxed V8 runtime in-process with its Nginx servers while Fastly chose a Function-as-Service platform using Lucet compiled WebAssembly modules with minimal runtime and fast startup. Fastlyâ€™s Varnish servers invoke FaaS modules and it sounds like Shopify&#x27;s Ruby centric platform is better suited to this architecture.')
