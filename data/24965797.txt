We still use redux for global application state, but there are also hooks for interacting with that redux state too.<p>I stopped writing React around the time Hooks came out, but I used to use a similar pattern with higher order components. In particular, I preferred HOC for forms. From what you&#x27;re saying it sounds like hooks replaced a lot of that HOC functionality. Are HOC still used at all?')
