I&quot;m talking about the second graph I linked to, AFAIK FT shows deaths per week from all causes and compares to historical average.  Then it basically does an integral of the deaths per week in 2020 compared to the historical average to see the excess deaths (it does appear to only consider the outbreak &#x2F; times when deaths per week is above historical average though).  That at least is what is labeled as the shaded red areas, I admit i didn&#x27;t read every footnote.<p>What assumption are they making here that is weird?  Unless there are fake deaths I&#x27;m not sure why this analysis is faulty, this analysis doesn&#x27;t care if something was labeled a COVID death or not.')
