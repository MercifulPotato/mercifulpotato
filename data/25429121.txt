If the EU were to have any locally home grown tech companies to speak of, it would be safe to assume the EU would let many of the current things slide.<p>I can only assume the EU gave up completely on its own businesses to ever be able to compete with any US tech company. These regulations upon regulations increasing the bar of entry continuously practically guarantee that there won&#x27;t ever be a competitor to any US tech company coming out of the EU.')
