The response is that the issue is considered fixed and that we are clear to go public on 2020-11-02 as planned.<p>&gt;  2020-11-01 Github responds and mentions that they won&#x27;t be disabling the vulnerable commands by 2020-11-02. They request an additional 48 hours, not to fix the issue, but to notify customers and determine a &quot;hard date&quot; at some point in the future.<p>Suggests to me that GitHub has no clue whether it&#x27;s resolved or not.  Project Zero were following GitHub&#x27;s lead.  Asked them if the problem was resolved or not, didn&#x27;t get anything, had to reach out to internal contacts, and then got a conflicting message saying &quot;NO WAIT!&quot;')
