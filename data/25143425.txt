They literally replace <i>reams</i> of texts on complex numbers, quaternions, octonions, spinors, etc. under a single unifying concept. (They don&#x27;t <i>replace</i> those concepts; and, for sure, if you want to learn quantum you&#x27;re going to need them; but they make getting your head around them so much easier.)<p>One issue is that most of the &quot;online&quot; references are <i>crap</i>. MacDonald&#x27;s presentation is a wonderful slow ramp: it starts with really basic linear algebra and then just slowly segue&#x27;s into geometric algebra.<p>I firmly believe that in 100 years we just won&#x27;t be teaching &#x27;bare&#x27; linear algebra, complex, quaternions, ... we&#x27;ll just teach GA and then introduce the physical concepts separately.')
