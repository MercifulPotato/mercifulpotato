This provision will allow carriers to charge passengers traveling with emotional support animals (dogs and other accepted species on board of an aircraft) with pet transportation fees. This represents a transfer of surplus from passengers to airlines, and does not have implications for the net benefits calculation of the final rule.&quot;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.transportation.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;dot.gov&#x2F;files&#x2F;2020-12&#x2F;Service%20Animal%20Final%20Rule.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.transportation.gov&#x2F;sites&#x2F;dot.gov&#x2F;files&#x2F;2020-12&#x2F;S...</a>')
