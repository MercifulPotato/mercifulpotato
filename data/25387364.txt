I definitely wouldn&#x27;t want to write all of our tests that way, because that sounds like a nightmare to maintain and run, but was considering a handful for covering a few major features. We do already have a very extensive backend integration test suite (http &#x2F; rest interactions) that doesn&#x27;t do anything with UIs, though.<p>Cypress is a recent addition for us, so this is more a curiousity than anything else. I&#x27;ve done similar fully e2e &#x2F; functional tests with puppeteer in the past.')
