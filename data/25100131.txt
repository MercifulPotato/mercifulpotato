There are many other interesting sets of functions.  For example, polynomials, or derivatives of the gaussian functions (called Hermite functions).<p>Bonus point: sines and cosines <i>are</i> polynomials evaluated on the complex unit circle.<p>&gt; Basically the Fourier basis diagonalizes the convolution operator.<p>It also diagonalizes the second derivative, which is the linear operator that governs many physical processes, like wave propagation and heat diffusion.')
