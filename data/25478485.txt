Tell that to Facebook, Netflix, and the YouTube part of Google. Tell that to Twitter, Snapchat, and TikTok.<p>There’s another principle at play here, and I think it’s an important one. Pleasantly, it also operates as a kind of Golden Rule for economics in platform development (and has legs at a wider scale, too, but I won’t cover that).<p>Specifically: Create more value than you capture. Apple of course captures some of the value of their ecosystem. So do other platform providers. The thing that distinguishes a healthy platform ecosystem from unhealthy ones is whether or not more value is on offer to platform adopters than the platform itself captures. Unsuccessful platforms generally fail at this, either because they don’t provide enough intrinsic value themselves (and therefore “end users” don’t benefit) or because they don’t make it profitable to operate on the platform (they try and capture too much of the value for themselves, and thereby strangle their own success).')
