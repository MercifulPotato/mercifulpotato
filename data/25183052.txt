Unlike C++, there is no name mangling, so stack traces are a breeze to read, especially with -fno-inline-functions and -O0 or -O1. There is no implicit action at all (i.e. no exception handling or destructors) so there is a simple mapping between the assembly and source code.<p>My favorite &quot;programming&quot; trick only applies if I&#x27;m not sharing my code. I just forego header files entirely, and just #include the .c source files. Also, put `#pragma once` in all the .c files to avoid double-inclusion without the hassle of #if ... etc. This requires a bit more diligence since you can&#x27;t have mutual recursion between source files.')
