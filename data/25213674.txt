Most laptops didn&#x27;t have WiFi and sometimes not even Ethernet. In many cases they still had a modem.<p>Also there was much more scrutiny in those days. I think Windows phoning home in those days would have been a huge thing. Similar to the resistance to the TPM which eventually made it in (but in a more watered-down version which didn&#x27;t  have so many privacy and vendor-lock-in concerns as the original proposal).<p>Of course now all companies are doubling down on all of this. The TPM on steroids now exists as Apple&#x27;s T2 (and built into M1) chip, Intel&#x27;s ME, and Windows systems are getting next-gen lock-down crap with Pluton now.<p>I feel like when we protest for privacy, even a major win is just slowing down the other forces, not stopping them.')
