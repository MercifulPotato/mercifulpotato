It fits squarely into espionage &#x2F; warfare.<p>None of the terrorism boxes get ticked. It wasn&#x27;t a splashy, overt thing meant to instill fear. It wasn&#x27;t carried out against emotionally-charged targets attempting to incite, nobody claimed credit, etc.<p>Everything adverse that happens is not terrorism. The term has kinda worn itself out, which is bad, because that word invokes a whole bunch of executive power shifts.')
