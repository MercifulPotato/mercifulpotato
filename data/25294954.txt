We&#x27;d only miss responses from potential respondents who are between 23 and (23 + (time to build replacement &#x2F; 2)) light-years away.<p>Fortunately, the message was sent to globular cluster M13, which is 22,000 light years away. As long as we get it done by the 47th millenium AD we should be fine.<p>Unfortunately, applying Parkinson&#x27;s law to that task means we&#x27;ve got a lot of work to do!<p>[1] Side note: It somehow never ceases to amaze me how very year, my mental shortcut for approximating the number of years since a given date by subtracting it from 2000 gets less and less accurate.')
