I maintain a shell account now for Marketplace, Groups, and Messenger. I have the &quot;light&quot; apps on my phone with all requested permissions denied.<p>Marketplace SUCKS from a usability perspective, but it&#x27;s become equally as active than CL in my area.<p>Groups are a goldmine of information - my neighborhood has one that is active, I have an active one for my model vehicle, and there are B&#x2F;S&#x2F;T groups that are nice, as well. Groups have effectively killed the old Forums&#x2F;Bulletin Boards.<p>Messenger is required if you want to buy&#x2F;sell, etc. I don&#x27;t use it for anything useful.')
