Item(by='skytreader', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610216873, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25700135, text='Erdem (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;skytreader&#x2F;erdem" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;skytreader&#x2F;erdem</a>) is a small &quot;media-center&quot; webapp that I&#x27;ve been building. I&#x27;m also using this as an opportunity to learn React.<p>Over the years I&#x27;ve amassed a collection of video files with filenames similar but not exactly like, &quot;Lionel Messi vs Miroslav Klose&quot;.<p>The actual data set is dirtier, can&#x27;t be regexed, etc. A key property of my data set is that a name features in the filename of different files.<p>I made this to easily answer the question &quot;Hey, I want to watch a video about Messi. I wonder what I have?&quot;<p>So, being the computer scientist I am, I thought it&#x27;d be interesting to index the filenames. Hence, the indexer whose code I experiment with a lot; dirtier than usual, very &quot;academic&quot; style.<p>Then I realized all I need is a search function (which I have implemented already!). Life works. Maybe I&#x27;ll keep with the indexer idea but just for something to play with.<p>P.S., I have words to say about React but this isn&#x27;t the thread for it I guess. Been a frustrating experience so far. But well, that&#x27;s why I used it in such a rough hack in the first place.')
