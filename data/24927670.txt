A lack of vendor lock-in means you can view the patch using whatever application you want.  And there&#x27;s room for a better mailpatch viewer, if anyone could be bothered to make one.<p>I&#x27;m guessing one disadvantage is the method of diff is hard-coded into the patch.  It would be good to switch to word-diff, or ignore whitespace, but I&#x27;d imagine these could be applied as transformations on the generic format.')
