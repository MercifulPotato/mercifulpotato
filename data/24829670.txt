And while, sure, the lakeside real estate has a higher tendency to be owned by the wealthier people in the area, there&#x27;s loads of land with fantastic views and easy access to beautiful woods, streams, hilltops overlooking wide valleys, etc.<p>The caveat is, of course, that it&#x27;s <i>rural</i>—you can&#x27;t have this sort of thing and still be 5 minutes&#x27; walk from four different top-quality restaurants, or even, in some cases within a half-hour&#x27;s drive of a Starbucks.')
