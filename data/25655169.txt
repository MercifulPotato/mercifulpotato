I think people are looking at this tech like it&#x27;s only going to be used for deepfakes, and they&#x27;re underestimating the extent it&#x27;s going to be used to create voice-acted game mods, animations, anonymization tools, and other creative&#x2F;helpful projects.<p>If you&#x27;re really worried about this stuff though, you can take some comfort in the fact that by far the worst examples on the site are of real-world voices. This is currently technology that as far as I can see is far more suited for generating new voices or voicing cartoon characters with well-defined patterns&#x2F;inflections than it is for imitating the president.')
