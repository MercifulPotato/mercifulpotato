I think it is fair to say it’s a mess.<p>I fail to see why the US constitution’s protection of the press would apply to organizations indistinguishable from political action groups engaging in the dissemination and promotion of lies with the intent to shape narratives and manipulate the audience.<p>What the media has devolved into should be outside of constitutional protection.  This protection should be reserved for the truth.  A high bar, yes, yet the only metric that can assure the delivery of information rather than political indoctrination through lies and careful manipulation.<p>Too difficult?  Well, if what is being said can’t be determined to be truthful, don’t say it or print it.  It’s that simple.  Go look for a story backed by facts.<p>That’s the other point:  The constitution should be about protecting quality, not quantity.<p>These enterprises are doing unmeasurable damage to society.<p>Again, all sides are guilty.')
