Item(by='throwawaygh', descendants=None, kids=[24900210, 24898738], score=None, time=1603725304, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24896328, text='<i>&gt; it means a part of a system of power that benefits people considered &quot;white&quot; at the expense of others.</i><p>This definition doesn&#x27;t even bother me on face. Obviously, systems can be designed to advantage one group and disadvantage another group. And, obviously, Jim Crow effects the distribution of family wealth to this day.<p>What bothers me about BigCorp diversity training is something a quite different. Choose a random public company. Its stocks are almost certainly disproportionately owned by white people. Many of the older companies even did business with apartheid states in the USA (and elsewhere) pre-1960. The ones that have been around for a century might&#x27;ve even done business with Nazis or were even run by anti-Semites (eg Ford). But even if not, just due to the fact that wealth is disproportionately owned by white people, so too are most stocks in large companies.<p>Racially skewed allocation of large company&#x27;s stock due to a combination of historical discrimination lumping capital into white folk&#x27;s pockets until ~60 years ago and the compounded nature of wealth is EXACTLY the sort of thing actual social theorists mean when they say &quot;structural racism&quot;.<p>The problem with diversity training at BigCorps is not that they talk about structural racism per se. The problem is that they use the training as a way to distract from the <i>actual</i> structural inequalities in our financial system and instead put the onus of change on low-level employees who have almost no access to actual power and agency within the org (or larger society). I&#x27;m half convinced that this sort of diversity training is intentional miseducation.<p>When I listen to these training seminars, I can&#x27;t help by hear them as the board&#x2F;CEO saying &quot;please don&#x27;t pay attention to our mostly white and ivy-educated executive&#x27;s stock-based compensation plan or our disproportionaltely white stockholder&#x27;s dividends, which are actually excellent examples of structural racism in action; look over there instead&quot;.')
