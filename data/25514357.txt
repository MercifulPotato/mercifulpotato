You have to have a zeal and delight in seeing your bigger competitor struggle to be able to develop a healthy competitive marketplace where there was a (<i>de facto</i>) monopoly before.<p>AT&amp;T had been around long enough (100 years) to generate that sort of deep-seated loathing.  The loathing seems to be there for Facebook, but I don’t know how deep-seated it would be.  If it was started, its roots would need to be somewhere outside the Pacific Coast to generate a sense of alienation from “the enemy”.')
