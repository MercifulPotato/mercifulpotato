Nor do you need &quot;a team of PhD engineers, a year of time, and the best tools in the world&quot;. An angle grinder and a couple days should suffice.<p>As for making it explode, that may indeed be very difficult, but I am not highly confident given the military&#x27;s general attitude and track record. Hopefully my cynicism is unfounded, but supercomputer simulations primarily designed to ensure that aging weapons still function doesn&#x27;t really help with security.')
