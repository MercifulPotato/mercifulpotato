How is it legal for someone else to give away <i>your</i> phone number, <i>your</i> addresses for the last 30 years, <i>your</i> email addresses, and the rest of your personal contact information, along with all the contact information of everyone else they ever met to any app they like? Why can apps run your mic and camera 24 hours a day in the background because you wanted to record a gif once? Why should an app be able to read every sms for all eternity because they wanted to verify your phone number once?<p>Ungoogling is a fine step but the whole thing needs to be rebuilt:<p>- Sharing Contacts: Should be illegal and removed as an option. Apps shouldn&#x27;t be able to trick&#x2F;coerce&#x2F;incentivise people to harvest and sell <i>other</i> people&#x27;s private information. When people give out their phone numbers and addresses they do it with some expectation of care, not with the intention of having it immedietly uploaded to Flappy Bird. The most that should be allowed is <i>perhaps</i> some sort of hash of contacts to be able to bootstrap some friend graph, but that&#x27;s it.<p>- Sharing Files: There should be a single general default &quot;file manager&quot; app that acts as the intermediary between your files, and other apps, giving them only the files they need for the specific task at hand. Permission for the filemanagers themselves can be given with multiple ALL CAPS permission warnings not to do it.<p>- Camera&#x2F;Mic&#x2F;Location: Trusted intermediate app should capture and provide the data needed for the task at hand. At the absolute minimum, permissions should default to only recording while the app is open (like android location <i>now</i>). Persistent background recording should only be allowed after multiple ALL CAPS stern warnings and suggestion to reject unless absolutely necessary.<p>- SMS&#x2F;etc: Have intermediate trusted apps select and share the specific messages you need to share for the task at hand.<p>In short, data access should be handled by few, trusted, vetted, intermediary apps, with heavily gated permissions for those apps themsevles; and sharing other people&#x27;s private contact information should be illegal.')
