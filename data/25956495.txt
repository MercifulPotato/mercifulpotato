UX designers at e.g. Amazon, do have huge optionality to go elsewhere and still get paid good salaries. They are not e.g. clothing workers in Bangladesh.<p>&gt; Moreso this argument isn&#x27;t one to be taken seriously because it assumes every collective failure is a failure of millions of individual choices rather than any of the cultural inertia or environmental influences that steer our choices.<p>That&#x27;s a strawman - I&#x27;m not saying this applies for &#x27;every collective failure&#x27;. Systemic factors are important, however we shouldn&#x27;t absolve individuals at large tech firms of their own responsibility.')
