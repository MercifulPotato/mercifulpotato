You didn&#x27;t gain any knowledge that you couldn&#x27;t have known before you were teleported 5,000 ly away.<p>What&#x27;s also more difficult is that the balls wouldn&#x27;t have definitive colors, but exist in a probabilistic state &#x2F; superposition. But you couldn&#x27;t send the message &quot;I have a red ball&quot; to the individual 5,000 ly away because collapsing your ball&#x27;s wave will be random and you can&#x27;t determine which color you want. You could &quot;mistakenly&quot; collapse your ball to blue, not red.')
