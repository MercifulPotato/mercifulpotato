Modern science is based on the Latin injunction ignoramus – ‘we do not know’. It assumes that we don’t know everything. Even more critically, it accepts that the things that we think we know could be proven wrong as we gain more knowledge. No concept, idea or theory is sacred and beyond challenge.<p>2    The centrality of observation and mathematics. Having admitted ignorance, modern science aims to obtain new knowledge. It does so by gathering observations and then using mathematical tools to connect these observations into comprehensive theories.\n    And then trying to repeat faked or fluke results<p>3    The acquisition of new powers. Modern science is not content with creating theories. It uses these theories in order to acquire new powers, and in particular to develop new technologies.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;ceoeducation&#x2F;notes-on-sapiens-a-brief-history-of-mankind-26e35553bd7d" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;ceoeducation&#x2F;notes-on-sapiens-a-brief-his...</a>')
