What if the hardware forces the PRNG to be predictable so they can remotely know my crypto&#x27;s private keys without any internet connectivity whatsoever?<p>B) Knowing 100% for sure that the device they sell will be used to store money. They don&#x27;t need to first find victims, they know ALL of their customers can be. It&#x27;s like writing &quot;MONEY INSIDE&quot; on your house IMHO. Better use a general purpose PC whose vendor doesn&#x27;t know what it&#x27;ll be used for.')
