Back then there was a review somewhere that said it’s better than others in its price class (310 € ≈ $ 364) and most importantly it had no smart features. I am still happy with it and I dread the day I’ll need a new one. The much mentioned (including in this article) Sceptre TVs don’t seem to be available in Germany and HiSense seems to have switched to smart-TVs only.<p>Before I bought it, I saw smart TVs at other’s places and never understood why anyone would actually want those.')
