Some of my most cherished travel moments have been when, under no particular time constraints or schedule, I&#x27;ve been able to just do something interesting &amp; random.  At the risk of sounding churlish, I&#x27;m also impressed you were able to walk several hundred more miles in 4 days through a highly mountainous region that&#x27;s ~500 x ~200 miles in size.  (Of course, they&#x27;d have been using metric there - 800 x 200 km.)    I imagine the area&#x27;s mostly commons, as far as nomadic farmers are concerned, but they do sound like highly energetic cattle - hopefully they were dairy rather than meat breeds.<p>Second, evolutionarily speaking I believe humans have adapted to groups (herds) of ~30, but we&#x27;re all on various spectrums, including the need for social interaction.  It&#x27;s a nice idea that there&#x27;s a tipping point that any of us could reach where solitude is exclusively sought, but my (anecdotal) experience is that there&#x27;s plenty of people who, no matter how much time they may be forced to spend with their own thoughts, have no interest in embracing a primarily solo arrangement.<p>I&#x27;m trying to guess your age - you mention people you knew from 30 years ago - so presumably you&#x27;re 35+, but then you mention &#x27;your own or other people&#x27;s dads in their 50s&#x27; which implies a (conventional) upper limit of ~39.  In which case I&#x27;m 10-15 years older than you, and can attest to a) a decreasing interest, or perhaps just available energy, in developing new friendships, but also b) an utter delight, absent the &#x27;common struggle&#x27; that you think is a prerequisite, when I get to really &amp; properly know someone over the space of many months, and despite subconscious protestations, am led to the ineluctable conclusion I have a new friend.')
