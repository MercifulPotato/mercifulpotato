Item(by='MrMan', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610465589, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25747659, text='anti trust action is needed against a few big tech firms, but this article for some reason frightens me. I dont understand the perspective and there seem to be contradictory undercurrents. I dont use any social network apps except occasionally browsing my couple of dozen friends feeds on my private Instagram account. I know Insta is not good, but I dont feel particularly threatened by it, since no discussion is ocurring (on my feed), just pictures and videos of music and places people have been, meals they have cooked.<p>I don&#x27;t really care if Amazon crushes Parler. I also don&#x27;t find back-doors, infiltration and R&amp;D relationships with the government alarming or surprising. What matters to me is whether the government itself is corrupt.<p>I am a globalist and I do hope for more, not less integration between trade blocs. I think it would be beneficial to avoid the supply chain panic that underlies the extreme pursuit of labor cost arbitrage, but not in pursuit of national, but rather regional, balance of power and trade.<p>Surveillance is not going away. We cannot fight it. What can be combated is the willingness to harm others and the tendency to view others as separate from ourselves and as a danger to our interests.<p>But these tech firms are not yet absolute monopolies - Amazon, Google, Facebook, all display in my opinion anti-competitive and in some cases anti-consumer behaviour, but I think a new framework is needed to quantify harm in tech antitrust regulation.<p>I think Facebook is the most egregious offender because, as I have hyperbolically stated before, have constructed what amounds to a genocide machine. So while they are not &quot;anti-consumer&quot; in terms of price, they are anti-peace and stability of the system which hurts all of us. They disrupt the political process and not in a fun way.<p>Greenwald seems to be inviting pretty draconian anti-trust action, which would certainly be a bit controversial because  some libertarians might not like it - ideologically the founders of Parler might be among them. On the other hand he seems to be stroking Parler as being some kind of underdog that is less bad somehow than other social networks. In my view Parler is only different in scale.<p>Again, Greenwald makes me very uneasy in this article because he comes out hard against &quot;monopoly&quot; but whose side is he on? I feel weird that I agree on paper that antitrust action is needed, but his article feels bought and paid for in some way.')
