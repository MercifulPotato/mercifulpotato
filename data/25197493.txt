The designers of SNI didn&#x27;t leave this vague, they spelled it out first in RFC 3546 and most recently in RFC 6066<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc6066#section-3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tools.ietf.org&#x2F;html&#x2F;rfc6066#section-3</a><p>&gt; &quot;HostName&quot; contains the fully qualified DNS hostname of the server, as understood by the client.  The hostname is represented as a byte string using ASCII encoding without a trailing dot. †<p>So, when your web browser sends the hostname &quot;news.ycombinator.com.&quot; that&#x27;s not an &quot;absolute hostname&quot; that&#x27;s just an error. Maybe you can demand that web browsers stop doing that, but they&#x27;ll likely tell you they don&#x27;t care, and you should stop writing URLs incorrectly.<p>† The trailing dot rule was in every version, but earliest sources talked about using UTF8 because they pre-date the insight that all this backend (ie not human-facing) stuff can use A-labels which are ASCII and avoid any complicated Unicode problems. This version just says to use ASCII here.')
