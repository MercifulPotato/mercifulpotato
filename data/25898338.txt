Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=[25898461], score=None, time=1611541259, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25898193, text='&gt; UBI is a death sentence within direct democracies<p>Direct democracies are virtually nonexistent at the national level; Switzerland, which is still a mostly-representative democracy, is probably the closest thing there is.<p>&gt; Introduction beforehand sows the seed for a direct transfer of wealth from the 49% haves to the 51% have-nots.<p>Means-tested welfare plus taxation, which most countries have, does that, too; I don&#x27;t see how UBI is any more dangerous in that regard, nor do I see the runaway spiral of voting unsustainable benefits anywhere, despite the popular meme that this is the natural consequence of democratic control of the public purse. So, before I take this particular slippery slope argument seriously, I&#x27;m going to need to see some convincing argument of how UBI is <i>different</i> in some relevant way.')
