They had humans answering the phone, but everything about it was scripted and highly optimized.  Purchasing the thing was very very easy, but after that there was an upsell gauntlet to get through before hanging up.  &quot;This is rediculous, I don&#x27;t want to hear about this&quot; &quot;But sir, people call back after they&#x27;ve missed these offers etc...&quot;   The ONLY method to escape it was to say &quot;I will cancel my order&quot;.  Additionally the call center employees would be fired if they deviated from the script.<p>Given that, it&#x27;s quite easy to see why it&#x27;s hard to find a customer service phone number or any other option except the one they want you to find.<p>Personally the one that annoyed me was amazon customer service to find &quot;Package says delivered but not received&quot;.  Searching for this finds <i>lots</i> of variants in the quick-search bar, and a &quot;helpful&quot; faq that says something like &quot;ask a neighbor&quot; or &quot;look under the porch&quot;, but no way to contact customer service about it despite forms for hundreds of other meaningless interactions.')
