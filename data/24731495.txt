I’ve heard that with the current administration after filing to naturalize it takes 6-12 months due to additional interviews in the green card (not naturalization) backing up the naturalization queue. Covid is probably having a big affect too.<p>Anyway, if the administration changes to the democrats, in your opinion, do you feel wait times will decrease and will this be get fairly rapidly.<p>Further, can one be tactical and move to another state to naturalize and hopefully we processed by a state office with a lesser backlog?')
