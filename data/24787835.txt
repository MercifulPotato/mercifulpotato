Correct me if I am wrong, but this book seems to have recycled the ridiculous Theodore Adorno&#x2F;Frankfurt school nonsense pathologizing Christian Western civilization. The entire idea that people who go to church on Sundays and have world-normal psychological responses, rather than the defective WEIRD[0] emotional pattern that literally only appears in some fraction of highly educated Westerners seems .... a bit questionable. I&#x27;d posit that &quot;RWA&quot; is a contradiction in terms in the sense it seems to be used.<p>I mean I get where Adorno was coming from: a bunch of seemingly normal people had just massacred a bunch of his cousins. That doesn&#x27;t mean I have to take his insane response seriously; particularly when current year WEIRD non-authoritarians so casually massacre members of neurotypical civilizations[1]. The persistence with which people cling to this nonsense indicates it must scratch some psychological itch. It is, however, nonsense.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;WEIRD#WEIRD_bias" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;WEIRD#WEIRD_bias</a><p>[1] I dunno, nobody seems to give a shit we&#x27;ve been blowing up &quot;barbarians&quot; in the middle east for the last 20 years in hopes of making them more .... tolerant.')
