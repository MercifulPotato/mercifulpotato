I would love social media which wasn&#x27;t controlled by a single Mega company, but I&#x27;m just not sure how this could exist.<p>I have heard of projects, say a local group of college students set up zoom socializing, which does provide a much needed alternative. But I just don&#x27;t think this can scale, once you have no obligation to the group to be a decent human being, it becomes extremely easy to be nasty and mean.<p>I&#x27;m lucky enough to be a part of one zoom ( for now, I met the owner in real life) community. He has to personally let everyone else in to the room, and he&#x27;s already had to ban a few people for over the top racism.<p>Before you know it everyone is meaner on social media than they&#x27;d ever be in the real world . It&#x27;s at the point where I don&#x27;t want to feel my mind with that, therefore I just don&#x27;t partake.<p>If this ever was something Facebook had to do, within hours you&#x27;d be flooded with bots dming you nonsense. As is Facebook has major issues with Spam and abuse, what&#x27;s the stop someone from creating a service which just sends bots in to hurl racist insults')
