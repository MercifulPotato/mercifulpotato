If the individual motherboard makers ever decide they need to be &quot;certified for Windows 10&quot; and start auto-trusting a certificate for closed-source commercial software, I&#x27;m left with no choice but to either stick with my &quot;old&quot; (not really that old) hardware or switch to another platform like POWER9.')
