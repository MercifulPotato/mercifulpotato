When I talk to them I don&#x27;t get the impression most of them follow the news in that much depth. Many have been retired and zoned out from any kind of public life for many years. (Not a criticism - maybe they have other interests than me. Maybe they&#x27;re happier than me for that?)<p>&gt; I get the strong impression you don&#x27;t care.<p>No, sorry you&#x27;ve imagine that out of nowhere. It isn&#x27;t implied by anything I&#x27;ve said - I haven&#x27;t talked about my personal beliefs at all.<p>I&#x27;m just a realist about what the people around me outside the tech and media bubble are reading and thinking.<p>Do you live on a street in the Valley with 100 Google engineers?
