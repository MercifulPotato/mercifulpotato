Admittedly it&#x27;s been some time since I did ruby but as I recall there was a shocking amount of mutability going on in the core language and throughout the ecosystem. Mutable lists, tables and strings everywhere, even the &quot;constants&quot; of ruby were mutable by default which bit me more than once.<p>I&#x27;m just not convinced that good parallellism is something you can successfully bolt on to a language 25 years down the road. The languages I&#x27;ve seen do a really good job all embraced parallelism as an important problem from the start and had a strong policy of immutability by default and good persistent data structures. Such a clear  commitment permeates the ecosystem and you get libraries with clear parallelism stories .<p>Hopefully I&#x27;m wrong and this will all work out great for ruby.')
