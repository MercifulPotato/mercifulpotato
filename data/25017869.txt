If you know nothing more than this, you may at least pause before making them.\n(2) Be an expert on your users and the problem you&#x27;re solving for them.\n(3) Don’t neglect the one thing that&#x27;s actually essential: making something people want.\n(4) Get yourself to the leading edge of some technology — to cause yourself, as Paul Buchheit put it, to &quot;live in the future.&quot; When you reach that point, ideas that will seem to other people uncannily prescient will seem obvious to you.<p>How to plan MVP \n(1) Focus on a small set of initial users and their highest order problems, and then ignore the rest until later.
