Not every day, something like 3x&#x2F;week for a few months.  It was all 100% manual typewriters that were built for practice, and had pull-out plastic sheets built in that would hide your hands from view for test time.<p>I actually genuinely enjoyed it.  The force of the long-throw of the manual keys was fun to feel, and the different heights of the rows made it pretty easy to learn where your fingers should be.  It did always annoy me a little to use the lower-case l as the number one, though.')
