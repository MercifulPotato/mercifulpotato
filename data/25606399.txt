Item(by='jakelazaroff', descendants=None, kids=[25606739], score=None, time=1609531554, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25605746, text='I&#x27;d like to focus on this particular argument, because it&#x27;s a fallacy I see a lot:<p><i>&gt; This is actually the problem restaurants are facing: How to adapt to change technology and consumers habits?</i><p>The implication is that technology is an inevitable, uncontrollable force. But of course that&#x27;s not true: <i>we</i> create technology and the laws around it. Restaurants only need to adapt because GrubHub, et al. have decided they want to shape technology and consumer habits in a way that makes their VC investors money. It makes no more sense to ask restaurants to adapt than it does to tell tech companies that they can&#x27;t change technology like this.<p>Put another way: delivery platforms are pissing on restaurants and telling them that it&#x27;s raining. We can either tell restaurants to suck it up and carry umbrellas now, or we can tell delivery platforms to stop pissing on them. I&#x27;d prefer the latter.')
