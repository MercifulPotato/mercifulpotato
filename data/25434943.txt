But it&#x27;s hardly undemocratic.</i><p>I don&#x27;t really want to start a rehash of the entire Brexit debate we had in the UK, but the EU does have a serious democratic deficit.<p>Ask yourself this simple question: Can a citizen who is governed by the EU meaningfully influence who is doing that governing? In particular, can a large group of citizens affect who holds power within the EU and vote out those individuals they don&#x27;t want, so any individual office holder has some degree of personal accountability to the electorate?<p>It would take quite a leap to argue that the European Commission, which is where most of the real power still lies in practice, would meet any of those standards.<p>It is debatable whether even the European Parliament does, though it is at least more directly affected by the public vote.<p><i>For example in the UK our prime minister isn&#x27;t directly elected, the general public didn&#x27;t &quot;choose&quot; Boris Johnson. Instead the conservative party did, via its own methodology which it can change any time it does.</i><p>Our arrangement here in the UK suffers from a similar problem of failing to faithfully represent the will of the electorate. FPTP is a deeply flawed voting system on purely mathematical grounds, and then the mechanics through which the PM and by extension the government come to power once MPs have been elected can be even more distorted.<p>If you don&#x27;t think it matters that many of our population have little influence over who occupies Number 10, I would respectfully remind you that one of the first things each new PM does is handwrite four letters that could literally cause the end of the world as we know it.')
