The only problem is that every time I go to one it takes me good 20 minutes to solve all of the captchas to connect to discord, spotify etc. before I can actually enjoy the experience. So often when I only have 2 hours to spare I really don&#x27;t feel like spending 15% of that time doing slave labour for google for free instead of enjoying the social gaming experience I went there for.<p>Sure the cafe could be setup better with more IP addresses or something, it&#x27;s a small niche scenario and there are probably some hacks around it but it shouldn&#x27;t be this way - it&#x27;s just so disgusting how the web got hijacked by this nasty invasion.<p>Unfortunately minority affected don&#x27;t have big enough voice in this to bring any change.')
