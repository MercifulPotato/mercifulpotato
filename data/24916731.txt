There&#x27;s no special card, there&#x27;s no police involved. It&#x27;s how I&#x27;d expect the idea of free movement within the EU to work.<p>I understand the problem with people coming to Spain to just get a surgery but surely for a EU citizen it could be simpler since the idea is that we all have the same rights. I don&#x27;t think the health system in Spain is much different to the NHS where there&#x27;s no payment involved.')
