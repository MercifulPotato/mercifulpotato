They can use moons which are delegated by the planets that issued them. The only limitation is that they are not fully independent (can&#x27;t be resold, can be &quot;canceled&quot; by their planet) - just like an account on the website (just being run independently).<p>&gt; not to mention the 8-year-old daughters or 12-year-old daughters or 16-year-old daughters who need conditions on their digital freedom.<p>Nothing is really stopping them from using a moon issued by their school, university, a random website offering such an account, other family member or a friend etc.<p>Right now most of the world is using identities issues by Facebook, Twitter, Github etc. and not many people seems to mind. Also most people have their devices behind a NAT and also don&#x27;t mind. That&#x27;s exactly what using a moon would mean.<p>Having a planet is for more serious usage: where one wants to guarantee independence: proper identity that can&#x27;t be canceled and so on. Akin to owning a root DNS name for your personal server. So 4 billion is probably even way more than we are going to need, even if world population grows x10.')
