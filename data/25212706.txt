Item(by='pydry', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606329928, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25211986, text='&gt;I subscribe to the Keynesian philosophy that the government should at the very least hire displaced workers to dig holes in the ground and fill them back up.<p>Keynes didn&#x27;t actually advocate this. He just said that it <i>would</i> be stimulative to do this - i.e. that it was <i>sufficient</i> as a means of escaping a liquidity trap.<p>He was much more keen on public works programs &quot;government as an employer of last resort&quot; that built things like the Lincoln tunnel.<p>I find it deeply ironic that this myth of what he said is most popular among gold bugs - people who advocate digging up gold and subsequently burying it.')
