And in fact, that would be my preference.<p>In the past, a lot of projects I&#x27;ve seen started with Bootstrap + maybe some theme. Then they slowly add custom stuff that ended up being horribly bloated and impossible to refactor well. With Tailwind, so long as you&#x27;re using @apply properly, or a decent component system (I prefer Svelte), then it&#x27;s very easy to keep things in a nicely updated, non-custom design.')
