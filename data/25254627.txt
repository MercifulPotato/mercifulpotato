There&#x27;s no point in waiting an entire development cycle to get a new smaller x86-alike when you could solder an ARM chip or similar to the board today.<p>The vast majority of CPUs shipped are not x86 compatible.<p>Statista claims 23.5 billion microcontrollers are shipped annually.<p>I know microchip (the PIC people) made press releases roughly annually as they shipped another billion flash microcontrollers.  Google found the one from 2011 when they shipped their tenth billion PIC chip.<p>I find it difficult to get x86 sales figures.  Intel gross revenue is high because they have their fingers in everything.  AMD financial statements claim about $2B&#x2F;quarter total revenue, so if you figure the average shipped price of a AMD cpu is $200 and they made all their revenue off CPUs, that would be 40 million CPUs shipped per year, which seems both ridiculously high AND about a 25th the quantity of microchip PICs shipped.<p>One way to look at the number of ARM CPUs shipped is the licensing &#x2F; holding company has made enough licensing fees to pay for about &quot;a hundred and fifty billion&quot; ARM chips in its lifetime.')
