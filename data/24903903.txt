As a software engineer, I Worked in pharma, aerospace, heavy industry (mining), logistics and some general web development as well. I got so fed up with the industry BS; tool churn for tool churn&#x27;s sake, brogrammer culture, etc. Particularly sick of BS mantras like &quot;move fast and break things&quot;; the attitude that technology is necessarily a force for good, because... well... its technology. Silicon valley &quot;solving&quot; non-existent or BS problems.<p>So I took a huge pay cut to go works as an electrical and control systems engineer (zero experience). I love every minute. After 5 years I&#x27;ve significantly overtaken my tech salary and I&#x27;m solving real problems for real people instead of the bullshit work that is 90% of software &quot;engineering&quot;.')
