Item(by='GordonS', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606848223, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25267651, text='Some of the big benefits of major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP):<p><pre><code>  - the sheer number of services available\n  - managed services\n  - high availability, within and&#x2F;or across regions\n  - APIs&#x2F;SDKs for many of their services, for many languages\n  - monitoring and alerting built-in\n  - RBAC\n  - means of grouping and organising resources and subscriptions\n</code></pre>\nI work as an architect in the enterprise space, where those last 2 are pretty important because a lot of different teams are building&#x2F;using a lot of different systems, and often multiple organisations are involved. High availability of <i>some</i> services is vital, because downtime can affect the bottom line, or mean an entire workforce has to down their tools.<p>Considering only the first 3 items, <i>most</i> of the non-huge systems I design - and, I would imagine, most non-enterprise&#x2F;FAANG-scale systems - have only modest availability requirements, very rarely needing cross-region availability. And <i>most</i> of those systems only really need web apps and APIs, proxies&#x2F;gateways, a database, a message queue, blob storage, and often some form of background processing (VMs, containers, serverless). OK, that&#x27;s still a fairly long list, but it&#x27;s a tiny fraction of what the big cloud providers have on offer, and the database is probably the only tricky thing on the list.')
