Yes, if you add in controls it lessens, but why? Why do women as a population have systematically lower levels of work experience? The pay gap is an assessment of how well our society is structured to allow people of both genders economic opportunities.<p>Shouldn&#x27;t choosing to raise a family account for the experience gap? Yes, this is an example of one way that we&#x27;ve structured society so that women tend to have fewer career opportunities.
