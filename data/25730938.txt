Houses are going for 20% over asking (that&#x27;s pushing $80k over for very average houses).<p>This is because there&#x27;s just nothing available. A healthy market has 6 months of product on the market. Austin has less than one month&#x27;s worth.<p>Thankfully the city is full of new builders that are developing large swaths of land into new neighborhoods, but even they can&#x27;t keep up with demand.<p>These new communities&#x27; waitlists are filled with hundreds of people, racing for the 5ish available lots that come out each month.<p>There are thousands of people moving here and only hundreds of houses.<p>It&#x27;s a wild ride and it&#x27;s hard to know if this will only continue, get worse, or slowly calm down.<p>Source: I&#x27;m among the masses, clamoring for a place in or around the city. I&#x27;ve lost on two contracts where I offered well above asking.')
