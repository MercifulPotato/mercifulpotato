This means actual technical strategy gets distributed to large number of desperate managers as opposed to getting systematically aggregated at the top. This same thing happened with Ballmer, Scully and now Pitchai. I think Pitchai and likely others are MBAs as well :).<p>Aaron Patzer, founder of Pando Daily has said that businesses should subtract $250K for every MBA and add $500K for every engineer. When you have MBA at the top, subtraction weight grows exponentially. I know I shouldn&#x27;t so severely generalize MBAs so much but here we are... Just like Gates and Jobs, Larry Page chose an MBA to run the business while praising need for &quot;product person&quot; all their lives. All of these CEOs will show continuous revenue growth and doubling of profits somehow while products will linger in the limbo.<p>It is quite funny that Google has (or had) 6 different meeting apps and during COVID they are no where on the map in this business!')
