Setting up these systems for enforcing injections could well be abused in the future. And you are only going to create more distrust among vaccine skeptics... Why enforce a vaccine for a disease that barely kills anyways? To me it feels like this crisis is being uses to push legislation which would otherwise never be passed.')
