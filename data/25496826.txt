How quickly are you actually able to trade. I understand with low level trading, through a broker, the trades can be pretty instantaneous. On penny stocks, though, sans broker and with just an API or website that you set up with a field bot, how quickly can you expect for these trades to go through, really?<p>I hear these horrid tales of people killing themselves over bad trades and lines of credit and I wonder how much is poorly written code and how much is the chaos and whim of the market (don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m not going to try algo trading).')
