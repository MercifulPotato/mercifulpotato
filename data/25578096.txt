We got here a lot faster in many different ways.<p>1. Moderna only took 2 days to develop this COVID vaccine. [1] That was thanks to major advancements in vaccine development over many, many years. It wasn&#x27;t just Moderna, other vaccine candidates were developed extra quick too thanks to advancements in science.<p>2. This vaccine was developed taking advantage of research done on very similar human coronaviruses over decades, starting from SARS in 2002.<p>3. Most diseases just aren&#x27;t very prevalent in the population. For instance, if you created an ebola vaccine, there were a total of 14,000 cases globally between 2014 and 2016. Determining the efficacy would take <i>years</i>. On the other hand there have been 82 million cases of COVID since March. 19.2M in the US alone -- that&#x27;s a prevalence of 5% (!!). It doesn&#x27;t take long to prove the vaccine works when 1 in 20 people in the US have or have had COVID.<p>4. Most of the time human and animal trials are done back-to-back to reduce risk. With the government footing the bill and high confidence you can do them both at the same time.<p>All in all the result is a vaccine much faster but with all the usual rigor.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;moderna-designed-coronavirus-vaccine-in-2-days-2020-11" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;moderna-designed-coronavirus...</a>')
