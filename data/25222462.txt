This should highly influence the cost of laying new lines and manpower costs. From the map it looks like broadband is cheaper in lower income countries mostly.<p>- Normalized for speed. It seems pointless to compare connections otherwise. I checked the 1 Gbps fibre plans in India as that is shown cheaper. It seems like the cost of 1 Gbps plans there as well is around $60-80, some of them seem to have FUP as well.<p>- What qualifies as &quot;broadband&quot; is consistent throughout.')
