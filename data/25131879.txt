That is, can we expext that it will aim for fast compiles for ever, and not slowly accrue features and optimizations? From what I can tell, Cranelift was originally designed for Wasm, and that&#x27;s still its primary purpose. That means that its goals might not be permanently aligned with that of Rust developers who desire a fast, non-optimizing backend.')
