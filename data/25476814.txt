Some people even started to believe that patients fake chronic pain just to get those sweet sweet opioids. \nI&#x27;ve been taking them for over five years and I have not noticed that they lose effectiveness, nor I had to increase the dose. You do still feel pain, but the difference is between being able to function in the society and thinking about killing yourself. \nI&#x27;ve been through many of those therapies and I have seen disbelief on people faces. You can&#x27;t get your life back just by thinking there is no pain or that the pain will not take it away. What they do is they get people to learn some basic thought patterns that any CBT therapy do and then sprinkle it here and there with theories about pain.\nThis is not bad in itself, but when you marry it with the thought that opioids are unnecessary, you sentence people for unimaginable suffering, while patting yourself on the back, that you are &quot;helping&quot;.')
