Their name seems to mostly be used either to accuse people of being like them or as shorthand for &quot;evil corporate&#x2F;government henchmen&quot; in historical works. Merely talking to them is going to anger an employee base. Why wouldn&#x27;t they just change it to something more innocuous like &quot;Allen&#x27;s Neighborhood Union Breaking Thugs&quot; or &quot;Academi?&quot;')
