Both for portability and to make things easier for human brains. How much you should abstract away obviously varies, based on what you&#x27;re trying to do, and on how varied the hardware is.<p>And it depends on how much computation &amp; memory you can give your compiler. One reason new languages can have nicer abstractions is that they don&#x27;t have to compile on 1970s hardware.')
