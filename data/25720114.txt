The proliferation and role of &quot;business people&quot; in traditional companies is IMO their defining characteristic. It shows how much or how little a business trusts engineers (and also engineer&#x27;s &quot;status&quot; within the company, e.g. are they respected and valued or treated as a disposable resource) to run the business as general problem solvers.<p>The ironic thing about Agile is that it has a cottage industry of &quot;scrum consultants&quot;, &quot;scrum masters&quot;, project owners, etc. which advocate ostensibly for letting developers self-organize but which also has a vested interest for career and self-preservation reasons in inserting itself above software engineers in the decision making process.')
