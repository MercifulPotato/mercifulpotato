Its not &quot;the internet&quot;&#x27;s fault that, of all the content available youtube recommended Alex Jones&#x27;s videos 15 billion times. Or that facebook has been recommending and promoting antivaxer content and communities to mothers&#x27; groups. (And specifically mothers who its algorithms think might be taken in by conspiracy thinking).<p>The blame lies with our peers who work at those companies. And every manager who prioritises their own advertising profits over healthy sensemaking amongst their billions of users.')
