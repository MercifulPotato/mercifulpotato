I&#x27;ve been on the interviewee side of this a couple times and absolutely love it. It has so many nice properties:<p>1. It fosters meaningful conversations about code that is not dependent on the candidate solving a toy problem.<p>2. As you said, it tests a candidate&#x27;s ability to read and understand code.<p>3. It&#x27;s actually representative of the type of work you _will_ do at any given company, i.e. code review.<p>The major downside is if you give the candidate code in a language they&#x27;re totally unfamiliar with then that candidate will likely bomb. I think this can be mitigated by sticking with mainstream languages like C&#x2F;Java&#x2F;Python, or domain specific languages where not-knowing would be a deal breaker anyway, i.e. must know Swift for iOS dev.')
