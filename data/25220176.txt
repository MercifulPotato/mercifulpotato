There are a few guides where you can write a git in a weekend (e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wyag.thb.lt&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wyag.thb.lt&#x2F;</a>).<p>Really understanding git is really difficult, though.<p>A few years after you build a git, you&#x27;ll get git. I&#x27;ve met only a handful of developers who really grok git, deeply, but it&#x27;s a journey well worth taking.<p>The good news is that the surface understanding of git, from having built one, is enough to safely work with the complex commands that trip up most programmers.
