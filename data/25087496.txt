Why? Because the way it&#x27;s done now is a pain. Stakeholders, especially engineers, are required to spend unnecessary time manually finding underutilized or overly expensive EC2s. We believe the optimization process should be done automatically through a series of sophisticated algorithms. At the moment, there are over 70,000 AWS EC2 prices - doing that manually just won&#x27;t scale at most organizations. My background is in software engineering.<p>Previous to founding Usage, I worked on high-performance computing research at JP Morgan Chase and as a software engineer at a number of smaller startups.<p>Here&#x27;s how it works: We are typically hired by the head of engineering or the CFO. Usage analyzes your cloud usage at 5-minute increments to find cost reduction opportunities.  You&#x27;ll see up-front savings within minutes, and then we&#x27;ll continue to email you additional savings we find that you can approve or deny.<p>We&#x27;re free for your first 2 instances, then charge a flat rate of $14&#x2F;month.<p>Have you experienced any issues with managing your company or organization&#x27;s AWS expenses? We&#x27;d love to hear your feedback and ideas!<p>Here&#x27;s a demo video https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.loom.com&#x2F;share&#x2F;79f88ab43f58484181d86dc6b918813a')
