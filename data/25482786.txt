Anecdotally, the NIH hasn&#x27;t raised this as an issue in any of the grants I&#x27;ve been involved with.  Would you mind clarifying the context in which you&#x27;ve seen &#x2F; heard of the NIH requiring budget revisions to exclude staff?<p>Overall I agree that the NIH &amp; NSF extramural funding policy is designed with the sole goal of maximizing the number of tenure-track faculty.  The messaging around sequestration, and the Grant Support Index mechanism, made it explicit that the main policy goal was to keep creating tenure-track faculty at the same rate.  Even if this isn&#x27;t sustainable.  There are many programs to buoy the supply of (aspiring) tenure-track faculty, but few for any other career path.  I&#x27;m just not aware of any policies to prevent grant recipients from hiring staff should they choose to do so.')
