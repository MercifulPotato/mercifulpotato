While I am thankful for Tassie&#x27;s dam&#x27;s and what they&#x27;ll mean for our future, it&#x27;s hard to not notice how much they change the environment.<p>&gt; They are probably still burning lots of fossil fuels for heating and vehicle traffic.<p>Car&#x27;s YES... although I&#x27;d say a LOT of people (perhaps most) heat with electricity.')
