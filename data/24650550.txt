Python is definitely more readable - but it is less helpful than e.g. line numbers in helping form a mental model of a running program; and from my experience, &quot;goto&quot; and then &quot;gosub + return&quot; are easier to explain than funcs with local scope.<p>If I had to teach newcomers today, I would definitely teach Python -- because, once they do get it, it is actually useful for whatever they need to get done tomorrow morning. But I suspect e.g. BBC Basic (which has goto, gosub but also proc and local) would be easier for them to learn, and would get them farther in understanding programming in a shorter time.')
