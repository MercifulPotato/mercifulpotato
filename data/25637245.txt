It&#x27;s not <i>impossible</i> a company the size of Slack would be reliant on a specific engineer logging on in the morning before a traffic spike so the service can handle the spike in load, but that&#x27;s a misuse of modern distributed cloud-based computing.<p>Hate on the cloud all you want, but AWS has (several flavors of) load balancers and various ways to automatically scale up and down resources (and if you&#x27;re conservative, you can disable the &#x27;down&#x27; part). If you&#x27;re operating a major SaaS company like Slack and not taking advantage of them, something&#x27;s gone wrong.')
