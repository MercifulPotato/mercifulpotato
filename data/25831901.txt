Channel 4 is a commercial station and doesn&#x27;t receive any licence fee funding. Yes it is publicly owned but aside from that it shares no relation to the BBC.<p>It&#x27;s probably also worth noting that the BBC does also have a few subsidiaries like BBC America which are also commercial entities and operate independently to BBC Television. They are at least owned by the British Broadcasting Corporation (albeit sometimes only in part), unlike Channel 4.')
