I have more time.  I have less adversarial interactions and stress in my thoughts.<p>At first I wondered how I could do this, since it would mean losing contact with friends.  But a surprising number of friends contacted me via messenger to ask how I&#x27;m doing, and now we just interact one to one, like in the old days.<p>I find the interaction I get on HN far more satisfying and challenging than FB.  The HN guidelines make it so.<p>It&#x27;s not rocket science.<p>&gt; Be kind. Don&#x27;t be snarky. Have curious conversation; don&#x27;t cross-examine. Please don&#x27;t fulminate. Please don&#x27;t sneer, including at the rest of the community.<p>&gt; Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive, not less, as a topic gets more divisive.<p>With guidelines like these, and a community mod system that works, there is no need for sisyphean AI or data scientists.<p>What concerns me for the future is that HN is dependent for its discussions on the existence of independent journalism to provide the articles on which the HN community comments.  If the economic and political trends that gave FB its power continue, what will HN readers have left to discuss?  Tech news?  That might not be enough.<p>I understand why HN excludes political discussion, and that makes sense in isolation.  But outside of HN, this article about FB highlights that quality civics requires informed, civil discourse.  How is that going to happen?')
