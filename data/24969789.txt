It starts at 720p ~10fps and then drops to 270p ~30fps after a few seconds (I&#x27;m not actively cooling the Pi). This is a slight improvement since it didn&#x27;t hit &quot;HD&quot; at all in the first test. Note the camera connected to the Pi is only 720p so it&#x27;s at its top resolution.<p>I can add active cooling to the Pi and test further once I find the fan I have lying around here somewhere.<p>EDIT: Added active cooling and increased video memory from 76MB to 512MB (although I think it&#x27;s capped at ~400MB if I remember correctly), I&#x27;m now getting encode of 640x360 @ 15FPS on the Pi, so a slight improvement.')
