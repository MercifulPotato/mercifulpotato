For example, <i>toe the line</i> is sometimes written as <i>tow the line</i>. Another example is <i>the hammer and the anvil</i>, now always used with the implication that the anvil gets the worst of it. In real life it is always the anvil that breaks the hammer, never the other way about: a writer who stopped to think what he was saying would avoid perverting the original phrase.&quot;  <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.ucalgary.ca&#x2F;~rseiler&#x2F;orwell46.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;people.ucalgary.ca&#x2F;~rseiler&#x2F;orwell46.htm</a>')
