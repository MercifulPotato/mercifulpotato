I can tell you some stories.  Gangsters and just crazy shit.  It&#x27;s still pretty wild there despite gentrification.<p>Sunset used to have something called &quot;Sunset District Incorporated&quot; or something like that.  Skinheads basically.  Dunno how it is now.<p>I went to high school in Hunters Point.  Doublerock isn&#x27;t as famous as Compton but it gets respect.  East of 3rd street down there is where the enlightened progressives of San Francisco segregate our Black folks.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is we have lots of different sorts of gangs here in SF.  You don&#x27;t get jumped for your Nike&#x27;s on Muni so much these days, but still.<p>But that&#x27;s not all.<p>Go walk around the Tenderloin for a minute  (DO NOT ACTUALLY DO THIS, I am speaking rhetorically.  It&#x27;s physically dangerous.  Highest incidence of male-on-male rape in the nation in the Tenderloin.)  I lived there briefly and saw some wild things.<p>I haven&#x27;t even touched on the folks living in tents and in Golden Gate Park and down by Lake Merced, or the rampant public drug abuse downtown.<p>&gt; Russian Hill, North Beach&#x2F;Telegraph Hill, the Marina, Ocean Beach, etc.<p>Are you trolling?  Those are the <i>nice</i> neighborhoods!<p>Even Detroit has nice neighborhoods.<p>In contrast I lived in a Canadian city for a little while and I can remember the night I was coming home late and it dawned on me that I was perfectly safe, in a way that I had never felt growing up in San Francisco.<p>I love this town, but she&#x27;s a shady lady.<p>- - - -<p>And BTW wtf are you doing going for walks and doing &quot;many things&quot; in the middle of a pandemic!?  Goddamnit dude.')
