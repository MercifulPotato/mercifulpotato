Item(by='axegon_', descendants=None, kids=[25038062], score=None, time=1604947003, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25037147, text='Full disclosure: game development beyond the cli-based games and some simple asteroids-like games are the most I&#x27;ve ever done with games. I find them incredibly boring, both to make and play(kind of ironic considering up untilrecently I was working as a developer for a company that made games and I worked there for 8 and a half years). But 3 weeks ago I switched jobs and I am using rust in my current workplace, again, not for gaming but for data processing. I have no idea if rust will ever go deep inside the game development business but if it does, I feel like it will be in the very distant future. The main problem being the limited ecosystem compared to the big players. I do however believe it has the potential to give C++ a run for it&#x27;s money should the ecosystem ever catch up. For starters it sits on top of llvm, so out of the box you have windows, linux, mac, ios and android covered and the tooling is the most batteries-included beast I&#x27;ve ever seen(namely cargo). I guess only time will tell but my bet is it won&#x27;t happen in the next 5-10 years.')
