Item(by='addaon', descendants=None, kids=[25150519, 25150473], score=None, time=1605799451, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25149477, text='One of the challenges of using a large-screen device in the sun is that most screen technologies (including transmissive LCD and OLED, but excluding eInk and transflective LCDs) are inherently &quot;black&quot; -- they absorb light energy that hits them. Even when they&#x27;re displaying a white screen, they&#x27;re absorbing nearly all of the light hitting them, and then emitting their own energy.<p>One of my mild annoyances with the iPhone 12 is that there&#x27;s no white option. I have a white iPhone 10, and it&#x27;s essential equipment for me as a convertible driver -- on a sufficiently sunny day, the phone will overheat on the center console screen-up, even when it&#x27;s powered off! But with the white side up, it&#x27;s fine even on sunny days breaking 110 degF.<p>The only way around this I could see for laptops and tablets in the sun would be a return to transflective displays or other non-black options... which would also be a huge boost to battery life in well-lit conditions. But none of these techs seem to have comparable image quality, and there are some inherent challenges (potentially addressable, but challenges) with color balance etc.')
