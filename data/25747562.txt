Item(by='massysett', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610462857, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25747088, text='I used to worship at the altar of plain text, and indeed text is ideal in some situations. However I have found that text falls apart when I need to programmatically manipulate data and write it to a file. It’s hard to formulate structured “plain text” formats that are human readable, human writeable, machine readable, and machine writable. Yes it’s easy enough with simple data (and Ledger is relatively simple.) with richer and more complex data this gets very hard.<p>After years of using Ledger and trying to adapt it and my own systems to store richer financial data and manipulate it programmatically, I have migrated to my own solution based in SQLite rather than plain text. I realized that what I have is a data storage and manipulation problem, which is exactly the problem SQL databases solve very well.<p>Text works well for some things but it doesn’t deserve all the worship it gets in geek circles. Part of this was my own fault because I tried to make text work in situations where it wasn’t suited, but hopefully others will read my comment and not make the same mistake solely because they read some blog posts and other things from old-school UNIX heads saying “text is great!”  Don’t try to make text do everything.')
