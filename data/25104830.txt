He has little choice but to workout like crazy and take statins and is OK with that.<p>But I have only borderline high cholesterol. My experience has been different:<p>After starting 10 mg pravastatin daily, I drop  things, my energy level is down, my legs feel weak (although they are not), gym workouts are miserable and I feel <i>so extraordinarily heavy</i> when I collapse into bed at night.<p>Maybe for me it is &quot;better to burn out than to rust&quot; (though there&#x27;s not much &quot;burn&quot; left in the rocket).')
