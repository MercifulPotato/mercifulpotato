Can&#x27;t wait to live in a world where blasphemy is forbidden again !<p>I guess nowadays: diversity is great, except for opinions. Can&#x27;t wait to see the left crashing itself trying to compose with opposed sides, against homophoby on one hand and against islam criticism on the other, but islam is like christianism and probably other religions: homophobic.<p>Oh, shouldn&#x27;t I be allowed to state that anymore ? Funny world you want to live in, but I guess that&#x27;s what it is when you get confused and believe that your CS degree is worth a pol sci or law degree.')
