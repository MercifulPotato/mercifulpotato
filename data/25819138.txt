This kind of mindset puts you in a very weak position.<p>I look at it like this: I work for a company because it&#x27;s a win-win. They need some work done, and I need money.<p>In fact, as a coder, the company is the one in the weak position. If I leave for another company, I can get paid the exact same amount instantly. They will have to get a new person, pay them the same, but first have to get them up to speed to get to the same productivity level as me. They lose, and I even might gain a raise. So they better make sure they don&#x27;t piss me off.<p>If you have this kind of mindset, people can&#x27;t fuck with you.<p>Take for example a manager that says &quot;Hey, this customer expects it to go in production on Monday, so make sure you finish it this week, maybe do some weekend work&quot;. Now the problem is in your lap. What you do is you push that shit right back, so you tell your manager &quot;Why did you promise this customer it will be finished on Monday? You&#x27;re going to be in a lot of trouble when it isn&#x27;t. Maybe next time check with the developers first about the time schedule, then you don&#x27;t end up in situations like this again.&quot;<p>You have to educate your managers a bit.<p>I know that some people will respond &quot;not every employee is in this position to make demands&quot;. Well, it&#x27;s all about how valuable your skills are. Make sure you can do things that other people can&#x27;t,  and you put yourself in a position where you always have the option to go work for another company.<p>A company selling services to other companies, is not that different than a person selling services to companies.<p>Feudal system my ass.')
