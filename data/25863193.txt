You can definitely track that a procedure was done: you have the patient that you can contact to verify, bills for the materials that were needed, and bookings that guarantee no one was operating on multiple patients at once. If you just pay for capacity regardless of whether or not it&#x27;s used, how do you know that they aren&#x27;t just turning half of all patients away at the door and claiming that they provide the full capacity? There&#x27;s political unrest about not enough capacity but your healthcare providers are saying no one&#x27;s coming in and still taking the full amount of money.')
