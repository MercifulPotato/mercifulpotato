Your commas should be full stops because they represent three separate thoughts. You could connect them with &#x27;and&#x27;, but I&#x27;d suggest most native speakers would find this unpleasant to read.<p>I don&#x27;t want to make it sound like I&#x27;m not a fan of long sentences - I think fiction writing benefits from a varied cadence. For business writing, however, I think short- or medium-sized sentences are less intrusive to the average reader.')
