Half a cycle for an add or less, and cycles are every 1&#x2F;3 nanosecond. So upper bound for an add would be around 1&#x2F;6th a nanosecond. Likely less than that still yet, since the M1 is probably closer to an add in 1&#x2F;8th a cycle not 1&#x2F;2. Skylake by comparison is at around 1&#x2F;4th a cycle for an add, and since M1&#x27;s IPC is higher it&#x27;s not going to be worse at basic ALU ops.<p>6 nanoseconds @ 3ghz is 18 cycles. That&#x27;s on the slow end of the spectrum for a CPU instruction.')
