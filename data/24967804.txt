He has strong opinions and no fear of hiding them. That is actually a huge draw for people voting for him.<p>Accusations of racism are mostly political play.<p>I don&#x27;t really see how it is self-evident though. What do you think makes him racist? The Obama stuff could be seen as that but I am unsure if it is racism or craziness, but I would tend to think the latter to be more correct.')
