Not only is it debatable whether they <i>ever were</i> relevant, but I&#x27;ve heard this sort of phrase used too often in a way that is dismissive.  No one even replied that COVID isn&#x27;t real, or whatever nonsense, but you&#x27;re already arguing against some nameless side of the COVID debate.<p>The pandemic, like everything else, must have its costs weighed against benefits, even if it involves people dying; for that reason alone, whether or not people think the pandemic restrictions are justified, the debate should be <i>ongoing</i>.  It should never be considered a settled issue because the facts often come out long after it has passed.  I&#x27;d be concerned if everyone agreed on anything in unison.')
