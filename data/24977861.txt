This outcome does &#x2F;not&#x2F; make sense nobody sane without a huge vested interest would design a system to achieve less tax paid when you earn more. It&#x27;s entirely contrary to the intent and spirit of the tax code. This is not sensible. How to fix it? That&#x27;s harder. Start with its a problem and morally and ethically wrong. It&#x27;s really the only place to start from. I would say keep in mind two wrongs is not an improvement and unchecked government power is far worse than tax cheats but that does not change where this discussion should start.')
