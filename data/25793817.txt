Whether or not that path is in $PATH is none of node&#x27;s business, and if you (for whatever weird reason) work on a system where that&#x27;s not the case, you probably wouldn&#x27;t want the node installer to mess with that.<p>Note that the installer is <i>not</i> saying &quot;please make sure &#x2F;lib&#x2F;node.js&#x2F; is in $PATH&quot; - this would certainly be something to expect the <i>node.js-specific installer</i> to set up by itself.')
