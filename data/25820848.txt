It&#x27;s interesting that they put so much focus on tracking, but actual usability is in dire straits. \nThey even dared to push this crap in my Windows machine without my consent. \nI think the problem is that such tracking of employees is largely unregulated, so greedy execs are milking the situation while they can to stroke their egos and count those beans.
