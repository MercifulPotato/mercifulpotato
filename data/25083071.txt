Rockets are not Lego blocks that you can just mix and match. They&#x27;re explicitly designed a certain way to support a certain load profile. Even if the parts of the SLS _look_ like they have low risk, they do not and that&#x27;s why the vehicle has taken so long to develop.<p>One example, if the shuttle boosters were could actually have been used directly they wouldn&#x27;t have needed to extend the number of segments from 4 to 5, redesign the liner between the segments, and completely redesign the nozzle. It&#x27;s a new booster.<p>Second example, even though the shuttle external tank looks like it&#x27;s being used, in previous iterations the shuttle external tank did not support any axial loads, it was simply held on to the bottom of the Orbiter. Now the external tank has to withstand the entire axial load of the rocket so it&#x27;s basically redesigned from scratch.')
