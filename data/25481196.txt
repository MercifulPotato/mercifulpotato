Streaming services and the proliferation of headphones probably exacerbate the effect.<p>I think the genre&#x2F;taste aspect is significant. Yes, rock is a great genre, but maybe it is not really possible for a great rock band to achieve mainstream appeal or even critical acclaim just on the back of good songwriting and great musicianship today, because that is not novel or interesting like it was in the 70s.<p>Personally I find just the sound of Sia&#x27;s voice makes her much more interesting than a lot of the more generic rock songs from the 70s in that list.')
