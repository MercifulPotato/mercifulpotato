The dementia and alzheimer&#x27;s usually come about in professionals, as they spend much more time without air compared to a hobbyist. I am unsure what the exact relation is between dive profile, brain degradation, and the long, poorly documented list of other biological variables. I don&#x27;t think any of the major global war criminals ever thought to study the effects of freediving on the human brain, though there&#x27;s probably some study on oxygen deprivation itself.<p>Now that I try to think of all the countries who have performed illegal medical experiments on prisoners... I didn&#x27;t expect the list to be this long in my head... I thought it would be shorter.')
