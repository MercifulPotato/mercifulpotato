It&#x27;s well possible that a toxic manipulative person enters a company, destroys a lot of value production and efficiency by pitting people against one another, taking credit for apparent wins and pushes losses to others and into the future and still makes it quite high in promotions. Perhaps at some point they get booted, but they can do a lot of damage, perhaps make skilled people leave rather than enter an uncertain fight when they have high job market value, leaving the more desperate to stay who don&#x27;t dare to stir things up. Meanwhile others don&#x27;t feel responsible for helping a cold megacorp so they just want to get out of this with the best CV and social standing and a good reference.<p>You must interpret &quot;worth&quot; in a tautological manner if you consider the toxic persons behavior valuable. It&#x27;s an organizational pathology. Just because it happens doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s good or teaches us we need to re-evaluate what we consider value.<p>Cancer can displace useful cells and kill the organism. It doesn&#x27;t mean that &quot;well in the end it was for the better anyway since cancer cells are more worthy since they ended up winning&quot;. That&#x27;s twisted logic. Also note that megacorp won&#x27;t die so easily and the effect of one such person may not show up visibly until after they&#x27;ve voluntarily left for a better job to another place to repeat the cycle.')
