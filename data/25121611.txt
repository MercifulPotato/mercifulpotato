Item(by='sriku', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605604725, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25110442, text='&quot;simply one equation&quot; that expands to the same set of vector equations which expands to the coordinate-system-specific equations.<p>âˆ‚F=J (barring constants) is a beautiful restatement, but I think it puts the cart before the horse to focus on it because that formulation is possible <i>because</i> of the invariances that hold and that comes from the raw Maxwell&#x27;s equations .. at least historically.<p>The abstract formalisation is  even harder to convey (at least for me, and so far) since it takes away the familiar &quot;electricity&quot; and &quot;magnetism&quot; and you need to think about the more complex F that combines both. One way perhaps is to start with circuits - which are discrete and circuit laws can be expressed with the same equation and then argue for the continuous case .. but speed of light invariance would still be a long way from that compared to the raw Maxwell&#x27;s equations route.<p>Or maybe I misunderstood what you&#x27;re suggesting.')
