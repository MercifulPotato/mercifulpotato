You can never tell when it is happening and when it works correctly it causes people to independently mimic and generate new content for you. Even better when you push the very topics to the extreme. Either this is being done at such a large scale with such precision that the lizard people effectively are mind controlling the population vs it doesn&#x27;t happen at all (for what it is worth I&#x27;m on the very mundane end of the spectrum). The former I would call gaslighting but I don&#x27;t have a great term for the latter, maybe someone else does?<p>Side note: interesting to see you outside your moderator role and thanks for the service to the community and your thoughtful addition to the discussion.<p>Edit: (You got a ninja edit on me!) I think the point you make about the <i>sufficiently</i> smart enough effect. And I do like that the community here is (imo) much better at self enforcement with good faith arguments. But would not a simple tactic be to encourage the use of bad faith arguments? That seems fairly simple to execute and an easy way to generate a Divide and Rule[0] tactic. But I think when it comes down to it the impossibility to even know is what makes all this both very interesting and frustratingly difficult (as well as effective).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Divide_and_rule" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Divide_and_rule</a>')
