So cancer patients get priority for surgery before the skier who blew his ACL).<p>I still have yet to meet a single person who doesn&#x27;t think the US system is batshit crazy.<p>Canadians recognize that their system has problems, and can be improved (which is true of ANY complex system). But they also don&#x27;t think that the US system is functional or desirable.<p>I know that the nearest border crossing to me regularly has ambulances waiting for people that preferred to travel sick or injured than seek healthcare in the US. In other words, people literally flee the country to avoid being treated in the US.')
