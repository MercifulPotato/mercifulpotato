Last year, doing it in a relaxed manner, I never finished them, I&#x27;d just keep putting off doing the next puzzle.<p>This year I think I&#x27;ll just watch from a distance.   I think it is really worth doing it as fast as you can at least one year, it really highlighted a bunch of areas I was quite rusty in.')
