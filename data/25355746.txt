Rather, it&#x27;s to provide an answer to the original question of whether people with dark personality traits are more likely to succeed.  I think the answer is yes because the less attached you are to morality, the more choices you have at your disposal.  And, the more choices you have at your disposal, the more likely you are to achieve your goals.  The important caveat being that others don&#x27;t catch on.<p>Note that this point isn&#x27;t mutually exclusive with the idea that there&#x27;s a spectrum of conscientiousness, and where you fall on that spectrum changes with age and experience.')
