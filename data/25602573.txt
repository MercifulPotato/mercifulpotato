For example, I believe Walmart decides how much it wants to pay suppliers who want to have their stuff sold at Walmart. If a delivery app is big enough, it can dictate the prices and terms of sale with a restaurant and demand deep discounts and forbid restaurants from making the deal public. The challenge is how does a delivery app become big enough to do that? Feels like a chicken and egg problem.')
