I use Python for everything from Jupyter notebooks to a roughly 8000 line program that runs a prototype of a product. Python pulled me away from Visual Basic several years ago, and then I have a longer history going back through Turbo Pascal and ultimately originating with primordial BASIC. On the hardware side, I use C within the Arduino ecosystem. I&#x27;ve got roughly a half dozen other scientists at my work site using Python at various levels.<p>Confession: Code quality is a problem. I care a lot about code quality. My team recently brought on a couple of people with real programming background, and I&#x27;ve asked them to help me bring myself up to date on good techniques, and it has helped. I was lucky that some of my former training, e.g., in Pascal, was not just about how to program, but actually how to write good code (for its time).<p>But here&#x27;s my view. Don&#x27;t just tell us that our code sucks. We already know it, but we&#x27;re under the same pressures as anybody else, and programming is a force multiplier that we won&#x27;t give up. We need instructions that we can understand at our level, that will help us do this stuff better, perhaps incrementally. Starting with a strict discipline is hard, but Python supports the ability to go back through working code and improve it.')
