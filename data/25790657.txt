I try to build most of my personal projects in it (as I&#x27;m still trying to get better at it)\nMy latest project is a Discord bot library written in Elixir, seemed like a good fit as the Discord backend is written in Elixir as well<p>My only complaint is IDE support, though VS Code works well enough for me (and for HTML I use Webstorm, as I find the Jetbrains Elixir plugin is a little better for EEx)')
