In Nicaragua, for example, the police are so badly underfunded that if you want their help, you may be asked to pay for the gasoline to run their cars. If you can&#x27;t pay, you don&#x27;t get help.<p>This type of behaviour is massively wasteful and a drain on the wealth of a country. It&#x27;s wise to avoid it.')
