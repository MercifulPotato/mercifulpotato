A sample that required 30+ replication cycles is unlikely to come from a person that is infected&#x2F;infectious, yet it would be counted as &quot;positive&quot;. The thresholds are derived from experiments under lab conditions, providing a safe lower bound.<p>That does put into question the validity of counting PCR test positives as a benchmark of viral load among the population, but as a safety measure for potentially infected individuals, the trade-off is worthwhile.')
