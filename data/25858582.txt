If they&#x27;re learning from multiple sources and tutorial series A teaches Python 2-style %-formatting, B teaches str.format, and C teaches f-strings, then the novice programmer will learn all of these equivalent features.<p>This also shows up when the novice programmer wants to understand other people&#x27;s code.  If there is only one way to do things, then all common examples of a task should use that one way.  If there are multiple ways (as here), then common examples (or an open source project of interest) may use any combination of them.  To understand the code, the novice programmer needs to understand <i>all</i> of the right ways to do something rather than <i>one</i> of them.')
