That would require compressing roughly 6.5 billion miles&#x2F;second of spacetime into this bubble!<p>All matter in those 6.5 billion miles will be sucked into your passenger area of the warp bubble and decompressed back to Earth spacetime.  This would be a weapon of galactic destruction.<p>But that&#x27;s not the real issue, how exactly would we be able to warp spacetime faster than light at such large distances?  The main engine would have to already be breaking the speed limit as part of its technical specification, which becomes a paradox, trying to use the solution as the foundation.<p>Find an alternative solution to breaking the speed limit, and we can overcome the paradox.')
