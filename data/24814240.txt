By way of example: &quot;enlightenment liberalism&quot; doesn&#x27;t tell us much about whether property taxes should fund schools or whether teachers should earn merit pay, but the term &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot; strongly suggests what someone believes about those issues. It&#x27;s about as persuasive as coming up with some definition of &quot;conservative&quot; that conservatives fail to meet.<p>In a discussion like this, about American policy, the right thing to do is just to accept the working definition Americans use; otherwise, all we&#x27;ll do is argue about semantics, and the debate we&#x27;re having over social media sites suppressing things isn&#x27;t about semantics. It&#x27;s substantive.')
