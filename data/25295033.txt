It is not exceptionally hard as an employee on a H1 to have an employer sponsor PERM for you, most (90+%?) employers do it, so it&#x27;s not an added draw towards Facebook if they do sponsor the PERM &#x2F; GC.<p>If they leave after the PERM + I-140 have been approved, companies have a limited period of time to revoke the I-140 but this is extremely rare and won&#x27;t happen unless the employee has really burned their bridges. Six months (afaik) after the I-140 has been approved, the company can no longer do anything about it, the employee can leave without any immigration related ramifications.')
