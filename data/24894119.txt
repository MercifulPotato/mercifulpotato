Its source was open to boot. It&#x27;s GUI-based and looks spiffy It has a large ecosystem of plug-ins for different languages etc. Lots of people use it -- it&#x27;s the #1 tool in Stack Overflow&#x27;s 2019 Developers Survey [1]<p>But VSCode phones home (Microsoft is known to be obsessed with telemetry) and some folks are not happy that the binaries are licensed as freeware [2].<p>A solution to these issues was devised: VSCodium [3], a project that creates downloadable binaries from Microsoft&#x27;s source code that do not have the licensing or telemetry issues that VSCode does.<p>(This is discussed in more detail on the project&#x27;s home page [3]).<p>So, VSCode&#x2F;VSCodium might be worth looking at for your students. Note that, despite being GUI-based, it will still take a bit of time to learn and configure with plug-ins, etc. But it will be easier for most than learning vim or emacs.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.visualstudio.com&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Visual_Studio_Code#Reception" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Visual_Studio_Code#Reception</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.to&#x2F;twitmyreview&#x2F;issues-with-vscode-license-you-should-worry-1li4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dev.to&#x2F;twitmyreview&#x2F;issues-with-vscode-license-you-s...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vscodium.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vscodium.com&#x2F;</a>')
