They have vastly larger area.<p>The albedo of the surface does make a difference, but the color of rivers doesn&#x27;t really come up, because it doesn&#x27;t necessarily correspond to a change in albedo (and they&#x27;re too small to matter anyway). A change in color is more about the way it fits into the local ecosystem (both the plants&#x2F;animals that use it, and what it says about the lands around it).')
