But I believe it is only shades different from what someone who believes in election fraud does.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s a complex and very human problem that is not readily solved with gut reactions, broad strokes and absolutes.<p>Sadly, though I feel the same as you, this kind of mindset is a vanishing minority in the US, or so it would seem based on most allowed speech these days. One can daily find entire reddit threads about how one side or another is absolutely unreasonable, and one shouldn&#x27;t even consider that the other side may have reasons. And this goes for all sides. For those of us who try to remain objective and rational, the only option is increasingly to remain silent or find safe spaces (ironically, from the very crowd that popularized the concept of safe spaces). That&#x27;s the main reason I started spending more time on HN. I&#x27;ve written before, this is one of the few popular places on the internet where being rational and impartial is common, though even here that seems to slowly be changing.')
