It is you who can fix issues. If something does not work it is a signal — no one bothers enough to implement. You don&#x27;t. Quite a lot of people like you don&#x27;t. Entire niche can&#x27;t code or hire to code.<p>Linux users is not homogeneous group. I do not care about you and your use case. Maybe you&#x27;ve found some trolls, good for you.
