I know plenty of small folk artists that tour Europe regularly as there&#x27;s plenty of interest over there. Usually they can chain a few festivals across the Netherlands, Belgium, and France with smaller gigs as well. These are people who already survive on an extremely low margin of profitability, and every single one voted against brexit. And it&#x27;s not like the UK is going to magically replace that income, what with the collapse of half the smaller festivals due to covid.')
