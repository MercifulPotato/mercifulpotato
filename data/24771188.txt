It&#x27;s solving the same problem in a much simpler way.<p>AirPower&#x27;s big promise was that it was a multi-device charging mat that didn&#x27;t require perfect alignment to get high power charging. Apple ultimately cancelled it, likely because this proved too difficult to do safely.

Instead of carefully aligning your phone, the magnets just &quot;suck&quot; your phone to the optimal charging position.')
