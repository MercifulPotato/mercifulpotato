And thanks for pointing Hays code. I&#x27;ve dug into some history of censorship and morality in US cinema.<p>However, by cultural sensitivity I refer to something beyond codes. Nothing that this article points out is particularly illegal, immoral or even shocking. Yet, probably due to cultural globalisation, social media, and the polarisation of the debate in the US on certain social issue, I am under the impression that this kind of clumsiness is more likely to be  noticed.')
