I have defined services in protobuff and generated static typescript definitions for the services and associated messages. I then implemented my own flavor of RPC over a WebSocket connection, where RPC calls are implemented as two calls— a “start” call from client to server, and a “result” call from server to client. It’s interesting and I don’t know if I would go this far down to the “metal” if you will on a team, but for my own project it’s been interesting.')
