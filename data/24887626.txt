What if, after that happens, another person set up a public repo called, I dunno, ld-ebutuoy. This repo would contain no source code but would allow collaboration, PRs, issues, and so forth.<p>Each time there&#x27;s a push, only the changed files would appear in the repo. Both the private and public repos would be active simultaneously in order to do a build. In other words, your project would have two folders with git active, and the build would combine those folders as part of the CI&#x2F;CD pipeline. Every now and then the process of taking all of the current master branch and moving it offline would happen again. In this way, you&#x27;d never have a public repo that would have anything more than a few files in it.<p>In this scenario, the only things that are being hosted publicly are tiny bits of source code that are changed in order to keep the base updating. And even then, on a regular basis they would be deleted.<p>tl;dr: simply because you have to take down a repo doesn&#x27;t mean you have to take down a location for publicly developing F&#x2F;OSS software. &lt;&#x2F;speculation&gt;')
