I don&#x27;t think the &quot;hardcore&quot; platforms will ever remove it.<p>Regarding Nintendo, while they&#x27;ve never shipped a console with an Ethernet port built-in, they have supported it since the GameCube (Broadband Adapter); the Wii, Wii U, and Switch all accept standard USB Ethernet dongles. Use of these adapters is somewhat widespread on the Switch, particularly for Mario Maker and Smash (although this is more due to Nintendo&#x27;s incompetency with netcode than inherent latency in Wi-Fi).')
