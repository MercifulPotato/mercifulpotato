In 10 years, Bitcoin will have 20+ years of history behind it. Your BTC2 will be much younger, probably have had a creator, a foundation that directs where it goes, possibly changed the proof-of-work and supply schedule a few times and possibly picked winners and loser on their ecosystem. In other words, your other currency won&#x27;t be that different than normal fiat money.<p>Most people don&#x27;t really get that Bitcoin is unique in this regard. Literally every other coin has less credibility and more intervention and a shorter history. That&#x27;s why BTC will be more valuable.')
