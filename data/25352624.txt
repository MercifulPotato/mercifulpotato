At some point, they did some testing that involved forcefully streaming cold water into my ear. As you stated, it made my head spin something serious.<p>As an adult I got a cholesteatoma in that same ear, which is probably directly related to the issue that caused so many infections in my younger days. I had surgery to remove it, and now I have to visit the surgeon once a year for ear cleaning because that ear doesn&#x27;t self-clean so efficiently anymore.<p>I have to use oil drops the night before so it isn&#x27;t painful. I really dislike getting it done, but it sure feels better afterward.<p>I&#x27;ve tried those effervescing concoctions, and I&#x27;m not convinced they actually do very much at all. It does sound really cool though.')
