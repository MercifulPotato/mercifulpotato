Not just killing people on TV.<p>In order for a coup to be successful, institutions need to endorse the new order or have their heads replaced with loyalists. Capturing the symbolic seat of power, or even killing elected representatives doesn&#x27;t accomplish that. In this scenario there would&#x27;ve needed to be a body of bureaucrats and officers in every branch and every agency who would see the house leader lynched on TV and then said, <i>yes I&#x27;m ready to do the bidding of the usurping administration.</i><p>This would be hundreds of people, if not thousands, in the highest ranking civilian positions who would all have to endorse or be arrested. Then because this is a federalist system, local governments would all have had to endorse the new system or be replaced. Also, the judiciary. Also, all branches of the military.<p>Unless you believe we were on the precipice of this happening, it wasn&#x27;t a coup, and if you do think we were anywhere close to seeing this happen, you&#x27;re insane and wrong. It was at best a bumbling terrorist attack. More accurately IMO, it was mob violence resulting from an epic failure of crowd control.')
