The same people who often argue loudly for privacy, security, are willing to have a hole in the election system, probably the more important of any of those things.<p>Up to now, it&#x27;s been &quot;well, there&#x27;s very little fraud going on&quot;, as if that makes it fine to ignore.   Showing ID to vote in our most fundamental democratic process is <i>NOT</i> a stupid or crazy idea.  And it has become the rallying cry of the paranoid and conspiracy believers.<p>Fault the Democrats for letting themselves be accused of voter fraud in the name of not making it hard to vote (solution: give everyone the IDs they need, easily, as suggested), and fault the Republicans for using voter ID as a way to make it harder to vote (solution: stop being underhanded jerks).<p>And lastly, I have to fault the people who can&#x27;t get their shit together enough once per 5 or 10 years (ID expiration timescale) for such an important piece of identification and key to so many other things.  How do they get through life every day if they can&#x27;t even do this one thing that infrequently?   And sadly, how bad a situation is it that your party has to rely on these people to get you over the majority line?')
