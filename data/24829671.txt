It would be no different than building any feature into software that violates the law, say DRM circumvention as an example.<p>However I don&#x27;t know if obfuscation alone would be considered illegal: In this case, the services went beyond merely facilitating obfuscation. They were not properly registered as a Money Services Business, and they specifically marketed their services for use in illicit transactions. Going back to the DRM example, it&#x27;s the difference between software that has legitimate uses but <i>could</i> be used to break DRM (Think binary editors to crack a video game&#x27;s DRM) as compared to advertising your binary editor not as a general purpose tool, but for that specific illegal purpose.<p>(Disregarding, for a moment, the philosophical issues surrounding the use of DRM, on which I tend to lean more towards less use of DRM)')
