It&#x27;s the same reason we allow them to invest in companies like Theranos. They know the risks they were getting into and will still be fine without a extra 0 in their bank account. Regular followers of WSB are aware of the risks as well, so I&#x27;m fine with them attempting a short squeeze. The problem is that they&#x27;re encouraging regular people to join their crusade against hedge funds who are most likely going to time the market incorrectly. What&#x27;s worse is that most of the world, including politicians are cheering them on.')
