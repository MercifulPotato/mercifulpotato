How do I get my accounts imported from the old Google Authenticator into the new one?<p>I&#x27;m currently locked out of my AWS account because I made the mistake of adding MFA to my root account at the wrong time.<p>The crazy thing is that AWS have my phone number but due to formatting or similar they can&#x27;t send me an SMS!
