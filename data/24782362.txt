You used to get the paper from a news stand&#x2F;paper boy and could glance at all the headlines in comparison to each other, your colleagues knew what the tabloids were running and what the different takes on the headlines were.  In the radio and TV age, a small number of commentators were directly compared by channel surfers on the nightly news.<p>We&#x27;re now in an unfortunate scenario where individuals only see algorithmically curated bubbles of news and facts that reinforce their world views regardless of those facts correspondence to reality.  They&#x27;ve elected politicians that parrot those facts and world views back to them.<p>Breaking down these bubbles or removing the peddlers of alternate facts is required for a functional society (as well as a healthy platform).  Neither of these actions is likely to be well received by all parties.<p>History does not look kindly on governments that denied reality.')
