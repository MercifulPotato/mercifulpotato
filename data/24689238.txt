In practice, not just in theory?<p>I believe the EU has different cost&#x2F;benefit tradeoffs, but they&#x27;re still not something to be done casually or easily by a consumer at this scale of damage. For instance, &quot;loser pays&quot; sounds great until you lose. Even if your obligations are statutorily limited it&#x27;s still not something to take on over, let&#x27;s say, Amazon restricting access to the 40 books you purchased, to pull an example from nowhere.<p>The damages in such a case are so low that it&#x27;s difficult for <i>any</i> legal system to provide a reasonable mechanism for redress. Even if you valuate your time at the local minimum wage, even a small claims court is going to take more time than is worth it for one person. You&#x27;ll probably be waiting in the courtroom for longer than the value of the books in question.<p>The real problem here isn&#x27;t that the US is a consumer rights wasteland when it isn&#x27;t; the real problem is the huge asymmetrical advantages companies have, in any jurisdiction, in screwing significant numbers of people just a little bit.')
