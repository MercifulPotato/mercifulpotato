I fear that nothing will come forward in any case. My point is: It could be true and we&#x27;d never see proof. That doesn&#x27;t mean we should assume it to be true. Neither does lack of proof imply that it has to be untrue. In other words, we will probably never know for sure. But absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.')
