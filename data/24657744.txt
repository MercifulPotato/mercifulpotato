Conversely, I&#x27;ve seen instances where people purposely post things in B&amp;W to make it feel old.<p>I&#x27;m 49 and my old school has an alumni facebook group where they occasionally post old photos. Sometimes they&#x27;re from my era (ie high school in the 80&#x27;s) and they post them in black and white. When I first see them, I think they&#x27;re from the 40&#x27;s or 50&#x27;s.
