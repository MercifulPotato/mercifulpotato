Ethereum, EOS â€” all of them made fabulous promises of applications just around the corner, but nothing has materialized except shitty gambling and Ponzi schemes.<p>EOS alone raised over $1 billion in its year-long ICO. A startup that spent this much money and delivered so little actual utility would be out of business long ago. But these coins just keep going because end-user value was never the point, they&#x27;re all about siphoning money from new suckers whenever there&#x27;s a &quot;crypto boom&quot;. The endless refrain of &quot;maybe it&#x27;s like the early Internet, you never know!&quot; is an important part of this scam.')
