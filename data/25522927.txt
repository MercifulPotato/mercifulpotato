Recently tried Pluto notebooks and they&#x27;re way better. Pluto is reactive, you can change a value of a variable in a cell, for example, and the change will propagate to all cells that depend on that value. In the end you can save the code and run it normally outside of a notebook. For now these are Julia based, but Julia&#x27;s a pretty nice alternative for data science at this point - much faster then Python, higher level (more python like) than C++.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fonsp&#x2F;Pluto.jl" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;fonsp&#x2F;Pluto.jl</a>')
