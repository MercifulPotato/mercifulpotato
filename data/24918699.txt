I have no idea, and I don&#x27;t need to know who they are to read the rest of the article. (Which itself is extremely well-written.)<p>IMO: Have an introduction that doesn&#x27;t rely on unneeded context. It&#x27;s appropriate to credit people; but do it in a way where a reader unfamiliar with the context doesn&#x27;t assume that they need to know the context to read further.')
