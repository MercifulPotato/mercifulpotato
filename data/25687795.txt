Unless you have 10+ people on the call, a typical home connection is sufficient. That&#x27;s how Skype worked fine for a decade before Microsoft screwed it up.<p>But even if we assume WhatsApp should be multiplexing the streams on their end, unmetered bandwidth is cheap and again we aren&#x27;t talking about 4k streams and hundreds of participants per call.')
