If they weighed the cost of doing a port versus the cost of staying on GTK1 or GTK2 and backporting things, and they chose the port, it seems like according to them that would be the least time-wasting option.<p>I get what you&#x27;re saying, but asking &quot;why doesn&#x27;t my old API get new features&quot; is a different thing than asking for backwards compatibility. If someone wants to step up and backport features to GTK2, that&#x27;s always possible, you don&#x27;t need to wait for the GTK4 developers to figure it out.')
