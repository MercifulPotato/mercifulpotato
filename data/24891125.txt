So you can&#x27;t sell them a $5000 &quot;new&quot; C64 that promises to have a four core 64-bit ARM CPU because that&#x27;s not what they&#x27;re here for - they specifically like the Commodore 64 which they&#x27;re aware is not a modern computer.<p>Amiga is still wrestling with that. There are &quot;classic&quot; fans who thought the 1980s A500 was cool, but unfortunately there are still a loud contingent who are sure that somehow Amiga is the future, and this makes them easy victims for a long parade of hucksters and charlatans.')
