The biggest benefit of ARM are the fixed length instructions and only Apple is actually taking advantage of this by decoding 8 instructions at once. The big question is whether decoding that many instructions is actually a benefit. It&#x27;s entirely possible that branch prediction and other factors are greater bottlenecks that have to be tackled first to take advantage of the faster instruction decoding.<p>Intel&#x27;s Pentium processors (the original ones) were doing pretty badly because they made the pipeline too deep at the expense of other things.')
