Item(by='spaetzleesser', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609808827, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25638279, text='When you look at recycling facilities there are people sorting the trash that goes by them on conveyor belts. To automate this you need to somehow detect what the item is and then you need to be able to handle it. Seems like a great challenge for computer vision or other sensors and then robotics. Or have robots that can find trash in oceans or on beaches and remove it. This would be super useful but unfortunately our system rewards producing trash way more than removing or even better avoiding it.')
