I think that Twitter even warns you before you can retweet something to make sure that you read the entire article, so you don&#x27;t spread whatever they consider to be false. But there is the same problem with fact-checking. People just search for it, see the headline that it was &quot;debunked&quot; and assume it&#x27;s not true, without reading through the actual article. Here are some of the examples of articles, that suggest the story is not true, but once you get past the headline, it basically says the opposite:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;25&#x2F;trump-keeps-claiming-that-most-dangerous-cities-america-are-all-run-by-democrats-they-arent&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;politics&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;25&#x2F;trump-kee...</a> (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.md&#x2F;EK0rq" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.md&#x2F;EK0rq</a>)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;fact-check&#x2F;hillary-clinton-suppressed-haitis-minimum-wage&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;fact-check&#x2F;hillary-clinton-suppressed...</a> (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.md&#x2F;hhWnv" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.md&#x2F;hhWnv</a>)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;fact-check&#x2F;dems-impeach-gop-presidents&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.snopes.com&#x2F;fact-check&#x2F;dems-impeach-gop-president...</a> (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.md&#x2F;HNgc9" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;archive.md&#x2F;HNgc9</a>)<p>I don&#x27;t disagree that it doesn&#x27;t happen, but it&#x27;s not always that people just &quot;don&#x27;t care about the facts&quot;. Sometimes it&#x27;s that these so-called fact-checks are - to put it bluntly - complete garbage. When there were claims about the voter fraud circulating throughout the social media and Facebook and Twitter was putting the warnings on such posts, I happened to actually read those fact-checks, and let me tell you - they weren&#x27;t good. Most of the time it was either a straw man or it had nothing to do with the actual claim that was being made.<p>People laugh at conspiracy theorists, but most of them are not any better.')
