Many of them are so awash in money from rich donors that they buy new clothes and their clients no longer will accept used.<p>The only choice left was to donate to organizations who took the clothes and sold them to a local business who then either sell them locally at a high price (often higher than new) or ship them overseas.<p>Lately even that market has dried up and now used clothes go into the dumpster.<p>This isn&#x27;t just clothes, but everything from housewares to high end electronics.')
