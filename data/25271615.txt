I absolutely love my Garmin Vivomove Style, but because of the small screen I can&#x27;t really see any activity other than very basic things, which requires that I fall back to my phone app... which doesn&#x27;t work when camping or hiking because I don&#x27;t have cellphone reception.<p>If they could fix this one problem, I&#x27;d buy more of their sports-oriented watches, but this is the one thing that I find really hard to deal with.<p>Otoh, the watch is phenomenal and beautiful, and I love having a watch that lasts 5+ days on a single charge and looks like a normal watch, but tells me my calendar and such, and can be used to track running and hiking.')
