Item(by='jariel', descendants=None, kids=[25876302], score=None, time=1611345370, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25874924, text='Neither of your examples illustrate the nature of monopoly, even by technical definition.<p>There are basically <i>zero</i> markets in which there is one completely dominant player due to the nature of &#x27;product quality&#x27; alone, there are always external factors or even natural artifacts of the system that facilitate a dominant player.<p>For the same reason that YC companies don&#x27;t go ahead and just compete with airliner manufacturers such as Boeing whereupon the only competition is derived from massive, state-backed players - it is not possible to complete with Google today.<p>The barriers to entry towards building a great search engine are likely more insurmountable than even those for airline carriers, the notion that some entity with the &#x27;right stuff&#x27; could go ahead and do it is laughable at face value.<p>Compounded with the fact that Google has entrenched and most likely anti-competitive distribution to market via Android, Chrome - the argument becomes moot.<p>So first, we need to separate Android, Chrome and Google at very least, and then ensure that access to browsing technologies is on a truly level playing field. That would be a good start.<p>At this point, frankly, many other browser technologies - even those materially inferior would start to come to the fore - which is probably illustrative of where the &#x27;true power&#x27; of Google comes from, i.e. more from distribution dominance than from actual search tech.<p>While we are at it we can legislate grounds for app competition, platform openness, personal data ownership and the rules concerning the objective self-regulation of social media companies.<p>At the same time, we shouldn&#x27;t leave the &#x27;sleeping giant&#x27; MS Windows distribution monopoly out of our sights either.<p>Google has been a barrier to progress for almost a decade now, they are just another Oracle but with pink and green hair.')
