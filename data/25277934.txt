Maybe do milk next?<p>Right now, we use unskilled labor (cows) to perform chemical reactions with biomass (grass) to produce milk. I find it surprising that we can&#x27;t do the same but significantly cheaper and cleaner with vats.<p>I&#x27;m not talking about plant substitutes like oat or almond extracts, I mean actual milk that&#x27;s produced using the same process that cows perform internally.')
