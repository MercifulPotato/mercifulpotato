By the time you can explain your side work and have some level of understanding&#x2F;explanation that you can share, that&#x27;s strongly positively correlated to me.<p>If you <i>happen to be bad at programming</i> and grudgingly trudged through it, that might show up once you&#x27;re employed, in which case it was a false-positive. But it&#x27;s at least a somewhat expensive false-positive for you to generate.')
