You should have &gt;90% retention on mature cards however (it&#x27;s what the default settings are configured for). There&#x27;s plenty of charts that show the diminishing returns of aiming for higher retentions, and surprisingly aiming for 75% retention is actually much more efficient, however your sanity would likely take a hit from missing so many cards.<p>&gt;Even people who stick with it 7 days a week for 50 weeks could use a 2 week vacation.<p>Then you&#x27;ll need the discipline to do ~10x your normal daily volume when you get back (not doing new cards ever day makes it not a clean 14x).<p>&gt;That is not a given. Just several days ago I lapsed on a 4.5 year card. The interval went down to 2.2 years or so; hopefully I will get it that time around.<p>The default settings set it to 10% of the interval after an again, so you must have messed with that. You can also configure that to be 0% if it bothers you.')
