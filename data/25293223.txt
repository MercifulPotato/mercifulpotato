The US has historically been one of the most racist and discriminatory organizations in North America. Does that mean we shouldn’t engage the US? Does that mean the US can’t be less racist? Does that mean the US isn’t a tool we can try to use to make the world a better place?<p>I&#x27;m not sure this makes much sense. &quot;Racism&quot; (I&#x27;m guessing you mean things like slavery or <i>de jure</i> discrimination) were practiced concurrently in the US and elsewhere in North America, not to mention many other countries. The US was one of the first countries to have major movements to end slavery (Britain was the first global power to do so, and they preceded the US). I think it would be most accurate to say that the US has historically been both among the most racist and least racist countries, just depending on how\nyou measure.<p>&gt; Unions provide countervailing power to corporate power. Racist people are racist. Sometimes these can overlap.<p>Unions, on the other hand... Unions are a monopoly on labor. Monopolies reduce the amount of a good they supply and drive up prices. This means unions depend on certain people leaving the labor market that a union has captured. When a bunch of unions formed in the late 19th century and early 20th centuries, which people did the unions choose to exclude? More or less across the board, they excluded women, immigrants and black people. This was extra convenient, as members of those groups would typically work voluntarily for less pay, so the unions had double incentives to get rid of them. Many early Progressives were quite proud of this and other policies like a minimum wage forcing &quot;inferior&quot; groups to have to work harder to catch up to the white man.<p>The question we should be asking is why unions, minimum wage, hours restrictions, etc. were useful in eliminating &quot;undesirables&quot; from the labor force 100 years ago but help these same groups today.')
