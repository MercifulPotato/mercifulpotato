Then you can pass the second one known datasets and verify it gives you correct statistics, and at least be confident that that part is correct.<p>Of course that still leaves the generation and randomness part. You could make a separate function for numberToTailOrHead(...) that you can test. Or maybe you should have the ability to send in which source of randomness it uses. And then you can provide a fake random implementation that tests the edge cases (0, 0.5, 0.999).')
