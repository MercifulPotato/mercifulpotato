They buy them as white label products from other companies, most of whom make the name-brand products that appear in their stores alongside the store brands.<p>This is a distinction without a difference. The mere fact that they don&#x27;t own the factory producing the goods doesn&#x27;t change the fact that they are acting as both producer and distributor in the same marketplace. If Costco buys bottled water from Nestle they are only a distributor, and there is no conflict of interest. When they put Kirkland Signature water on the shelf next to it, there is a pretty clear conflict of interest that allows Costco to leverage it&#x27;s power as a distributor into pricing power against producers. Additionally, there is only a single buyer for the product line, regardless of whether the producer is legally independent. This is a vertically aligned operation - if Costco stopped selling Kirkland Signature tomorrow, it would cease to exist. The fact that they are buying the store brand products from the <i>same producers</i> who make the name brand product makes the entire operation look more aligned and concentrated, not less.<p>&gt; The second half of that statement is false (&quot;in order to...&quot;), and demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of how the retail market works. Product manufacturers derive their profits from selling to retailers not to end customers. They sell their goods at &quot;wholesale prices&quot; that are far below what the end customers pay. The wholesale prices for store brand products are generally the same or close to the same as the price of name-brand products.<p>Don&#x27;t be patronizing. The entire dynamic as it exists gives chain stores negotiating leverage against those name-brand products, allowing them to get better prices on goods than a smaller, independent operator would be able to get. That is price discrimination, and it&#x27;s why small businesses in the US are getting killed and big, consolidated corporations keep getting larger.')
