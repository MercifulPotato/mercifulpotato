Item(by='newswasboring', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602598987, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24751702, text='There is always a distinct abundance of &quot;trippy&quot; games in these competitions. This list has &quot;Track not found?!&quot;, &quot;FourFold&quot;, &quot;I want to Google the Game&quot;, and my favorite &quot;CHOCH&quot;. I think it has to do with lack of resources pushing people to abstractions, but people more knowledgeable about these things can comment on that. There is a distinct lack of trippy games in the main stream, I am not a gamer but whenever I come across these small games I always wonder how it will feel like if this was a full fledged game. The last one I remember is perhaps Braid with its time travel (again, not a gamer, very out dated info) but its graphics are very normal.')
