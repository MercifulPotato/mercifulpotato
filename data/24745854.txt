This doesn&#x27;t work on OSX yet. Works really well in windows though.<p>2. There&#x27;s no microphone.  I&#x27;m looking for a directional mic setup for the rpi but haven&#x27;t found anything I&#x27;m satisfied with yet.<p>3. The 6mm lens is total crap.  The 16mm lens is decent but the zoom makes it difficult to use as a webcam.  I&#x27;m still looking for a good rectilinear lens in the 4mm to 8mm range that has minimal distortion and doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg (after all, the whole point of this is to do it on the cheap). There&#x27;s no obvious candidate yet.<p>4. Commonlands has a couple M12 lenses that look promising. I&#x27;d prefer a C mount but you have to go with what&#x27;s available.  I&#x27;m going to pull the trigger on one of them to test out when I get back from vacation.<p>5. Arducam has a bunch of lenses, but I find them to be very strange.  Maybe it&#x27;s a language barrier issue, but the videos and the marketing copy are all very odd and don&#x27;t quite tell you what you want to know.  It feels like a Chinese company masquerading as an English company.  It&#x27;s all weird enough that I&#x27;m not ready to pull the trigger and purchase one of their lenses.<p>6. Focusing is a pain in the ass with all these lenses. You will not have the same experience as a typical webcam but once you have the focus dialed in things look great.  Just don&#x27;t move.<p>7. The HQ camera is very capable but it&#x27;s limited by the bandwidth limitations of the pi interface. 1080p 30fps is the max you&#x27;ll get. Don&#x27;t expect 4k video.')
