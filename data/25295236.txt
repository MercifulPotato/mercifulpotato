I&#x27;ve designed, user tested, and built interfaces for a range of local NYC government agencies, as well as NY, DE, and NC State government agencies. I&#x27;ve also developed scrapers, automation scripts, data analysis, and other tools in Python for the same client base.<p>About a month ago, after 6 years of working at my last employer, I was laid off, due to 95% of their clients being local and state government agencies, said agencies cut their budgets&#x2F;contractor work due to the economy, and I was unfortunately a casualty.<p>That said, I understand that the front end job market is demanding JS frameworks, such as React (mainly), and I am currently in the process of picking it up. My capabilities are not limited to the listed languages&#x2F;libraries above. Whenever I need or want to learn something, I do, and when I&#x27;m not learning something new, I&#x27;m refining what I already know and practice.<p>My hobbies range from making digital art to building trading strategies in Python for cryptocurrency exchanges. My most recent digital art project is a 24&#x2F;7 Twitch stream of a 3D, motion captured, voice&#x2F;lexicon cloned, Joe Biden w&#x2F; interactive chat. It was built using Python, Twitch API, Python transfer learning libraries, 3D cloning and motion capture software. With this I was able to join the Twitch affiliate program. Please don&#x27;t be offended by his appearance, as it was initially used as a means of marketing to a target demographic. I&#x27;ve been meaning to update his appearance, but job applications&#x2F;interviews have filled that time.<p>If you wish, check him out at:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitch.tv&#x2F;biden_unleashed" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitch.tv&#x2F;biden_unleashed</a>')
