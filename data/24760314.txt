Item(by='brundolf', descendants=None, kids=[24760344], score=None, time=1602542552, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24756902, text='I posted this in a thread below, but I think the word &quot;empathy&quot; is an overloaded term and was the wrong one for the author&#x27;s point. Some people take it to mean &quot;the ability to care about others on a moral level&quot;, and others take it to mean &quot;the emotional intelligence to detect and understand the nuances of another&#x27;s thoughts and feelings&quot;. But those are independent things, and I believe the author was talking about the second, not the first. It&#x27;s entirely possible to be an idealistic and good-hearted person without having the least bit of emotional intelligence. Conversely, it&#x27;s entirely possible to have lots of emotional intelligence and use it to manipulate people instead of help them.')
