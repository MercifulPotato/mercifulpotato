A hello world in React requires far less code than what CRA provides[0]. If they&#x27;re gonna compare to create-react-app, then at least mention HMR.<p>The comparison of syntaxes also sounds a bit shallow. There are legitimate arguments for why one syntax might better than another (e.g. using a full blown templating language in order to allow the compiler to optimize more aggressively, like in the case of svelte and angular, vs using the parent language for ease of learning, like is the case for react). IMHO, the syntax argument in this article merely boils down to opinion (i.e. &quot;X syntax is ugly, mine looks nicer&quot;) and ignores other alternatives (hyperscript being one big omission in this space).<p>As far as what React actually gets wrong, I think that are certainly things that can be criticized about it. The author of Crank.js does one such exposition quite eloquently IMHO[1]. The author of Solid.js has written at length about what performance could look like if we left various preconceptions and tech debt behind. Etc. Unfortunately, I feel that this article doesn&#x27;t showcase nearly as much substance as some of these other libraries in the same space.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reactjs.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;hello-world.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reactjs.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;hello-world.html</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crank.js.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;introducing-crank" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crank.js.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;introducing-crank</a>')
