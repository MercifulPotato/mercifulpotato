I&#x27;m sure you know, such situations aren&#x27;t possible in zero-sum.<p>What can be zero-sum is if no new value is added, but you shuffle around who gets what. If Peter has a way to make $100 himself if someone else helps, and he decides to go from paying Mary $30 to paying Paul $5, he has enriched himself by taking from Mary.<p>I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s ethical for Peter to enrich himself as long as he enriches everyone, and it is unethical to take from others to give to himself.')
