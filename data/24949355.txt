There&#x27;s no reason to not at least try it once if you&#x27;re making electronic music. I personally find it does often produce results that sound better or more interesting to me; chords and intervals are definitely (by definition and subjectively) more consonant and &quot;pure&quot;.<p>However, not only must one adjust the tuning each time you want to switch keys, just intonation actually doesn&#x27;t work for all intervals even within a single key: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;music.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;22017" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;music.stackexchange.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;22017</a>. This is something I often don&#x27;t see mentioned.<p>If you&#x27;re programming the music entirely in software, you could avoid this by basically forgetting about the notion of notes&#x2F;pitch classes&#x2F;scales&#x2F;keys entirely and focus solely on the frequencies and ratios. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if a lot of the best music of the distant future is partly created in such a way (by humans, AIs, and&#x2F;or both working together). But if you&#x27;re working in a DAW, the best option may be to consider a few intervals off-limits, if you want everything to be pure.')
