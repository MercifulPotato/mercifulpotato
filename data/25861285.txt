Sort of like federated forums. My gut tells me it won&#x27;t reach critical mass though and I have mixed feelings about it (e.g., maybe that&#x27;s fine, maybe it has a circular uptake problem).<p>I&#x27;ve liked Gurlic too a lot, but I&#x27;m not sure how well it will scale to a more heterogeneous community. It reminds me a lot of HN but broader in its focus and smaller.')
