Buy the one that has the form factor you want and cooks the way you want to cook. When I see “counter-top convection ovens” they are large things that take up a ton of counter space, but have limited functionality and capacity. Meanwhile, the “air fryer” I bought is a lid on my Instant Pot, which means I’ve got 6 quarts of space to “fry” things they way I want. It’s been a fantastic addition for us to quickly whip out fish and chips without gallons of oil and mess.<p>Edit: Suppose I should mention I have an in-wall convection oven in my kitchen as well. It does “fine” but frankly sometimes I’m cooking for a large enough group that I need both the convection oven and the Instant Pot air fryer going at the same time. Plus, my convection oven takes <i>forever</i> to come up to full heat, so often the “Air fryer” is a better choice in terms of capacity and time.')
