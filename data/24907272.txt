I&#x27;ve tried tons of options, from things like Evernote to very different approaches like GTD with an all-physical tickler file. I also picked up and dropped Org&#x2F;Emacs a couple of times before they really &quot;clicked&quot; - but once they did, they clicked for good.<p>Obviously no system is going to be the objectively superior choice for everyone, but I think there&#x27;s a very strong case to be made for Org for anyone who (a) finds the plain-text approach to this problem appealing and (b) wants agenda&#x2F;calendaring functionality built right on top of the other organizational functions.')
