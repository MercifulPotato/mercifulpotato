Nowhere in that process is serverless.com required to be involved.  Are my AWS credentials being pushed to serverless.com when I do a deploy?   If so, how do I disable this? We’re in a regulated industry and serverless.com is not an approved vendor of ours and should not be receiving any of our AWS credentials.')
