Some of the Tech you need for mining might transfer directly into tech  or building structures like this. For instance refining metals in zero-G via rotating smelters to separate materials might serve as system to spin up and control the cylinder rotation.<p>You might even get most of the stuff aside from metals as byproducts of the metal refining process (water, oxygen(from oxids) and carbon mostly). Nitrogen and Phosphor might need importing.<p>Most of the leftover asteroid serves as Protection against small collisions.')
