It may be a broader problem globally due to power and influence of the US.<p>The same can be said about consumer motives. I probably <i>should</i> shop locally more often, but I may not be able to afford local rates and have to pass the costs down the line if I want to continue supply more basic underlying goals (eating, staying sheltered, etc).<p>At some point we have to have the difficult conversations of choosing the tradeoffs we do and don&#x27;t want to support, otherwise we may let flawed underlying goal structures guide us to the paths of least resistance, which may ultimately not be good for humanity (or it may be, who knows).<p>Given a lot of current directions, I find it hard to believe our underlying system structures are great for human well being. It may have been a good run for awhile but that may be a short temporal anomaly. We may have to more throughly consider long term consequences of goals we set that may run counter to their actual intent.<p>It&#x27;s easy for some to simply ignore the underlying problems and play the game optimally for oneself. Personally, I&#x27;ve never been happy with that option (the option which OP sort of alludes to).')
