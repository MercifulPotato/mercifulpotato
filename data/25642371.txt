Item(by='tombert', descendants=None, kids=[25642383], score=None, time=1609823612, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25642182, text='I quit caffeine recently, sort of accidentally.<p>I&#x27;ve never liked coffee, but I&#x27;ve been a diet soda addict for about 15 years, going multiple days in a row where it&#x27;s the only liquid I ingest, but due to the pandemic, I don&#x27;t go out for groceries much anymore, opting instead to just order from Instacart.  At least in my area, soda is substantially more expensive online than picking it up in the store, and because of this, I bought a SodaStream machine, a 20lb CO2 tank from a welding supply store, a refill adapter, and low-calorie water-flavoring packs that don&#x27;t have any caffeine.<p>The headaches stopped after a couple days, and I fortunately didn&#x27;t have any other side effects (I think because the caffeine concentration in soda tends to be a lot lower than that of coffee).<p>The positives were almost immediate; my sleep improved after a day, and while it might be psychosomatic, I think my focus for work improved a bit.')
