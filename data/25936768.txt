You can still walk to work. (Ottawa is the original Shopify HQ.)<p>Most film cameras don&#x27;t work because of metal contraction and frozen batteries. Don&#x27;t touch any metal objects like fences or your fingers will freeze to the surface.<p>- -30C is not that common, but you need mittens and a hat. This starts causing problems, like frozen eyelashes, fairly quick frostbite.<p>So on a clear day with no wind, those temperatures are livable. But if there&#x27;s wind, then the situation can get serious.<p>&quot;On the coldest days of the year, the temperature can drop to -25 째C (-13 째F) or even below. In 2018, it dropped to -30 째C (-22 째F).&quot;<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.climatestotravel.com&#x2F;climate&#x2F;canada&#x2F;ottawa" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.climatestotravel.com&#x2F;climate&#x2F;canada&#x2F;ottawa</a>')
