Is that not safe enough for these numbers? The real question is: why is this &quot;safe&quot; side shoving down their &quot;solution&quot; down everyone else&#x27;s throat? At what point does coercion becoming a solution? &quot;DO AS I SAY OR ELSE&quot;, is really the problem here, and not the virus. People are surviving, and are building antibodies, this is not an apocalyptical virus that we have to completely shutdown and obey.')
