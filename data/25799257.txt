It is my opinion that they mean nothing and are worth nothing.<p>Asking how a company’s development practices protect against the OWASP Top 10 doesn’t make a lot of sense. The top 10 isn’t a static list, nor is it backed by any real data, and many of the entries are fairly generic concepts that aren’t something that can be addressed holistically with any particular development practice.<p>Everybody lies on these. They’ll just say a best practice, or they’ll quickly run a scanner in response to the question, or they give you the policy that no one actually follows, or they’ll give a partial truth, like saying that they use 2FA, when they only use 2FA in some places, etc.<p>Every company you hear about getting hacked had great answers on their security questionnaire. I guarantee that Equifax had a policy of patching vulnerabilities for example. These are just paperwork that wastes everyone’s time.<p>Certifications like SOC 2 are even worse, but they sure do make some people a lot of money.')
