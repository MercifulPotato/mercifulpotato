Item(by='ookdatnog', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611078817, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25834368, text='&gt; In my country Sweden the state media is very biased and paints my points of views in a bad light - but I am forced to fund them.<p>I understand that that&#x27;s frustrating for you, my objection with your post is merely your claim that this constitutes forced speech. It does not, unless you believe that money=speech. Some people hold that belief, but I suspect very few of them will be consistent about accepting the logical consequences of that belief (therefore they don&#x27;t really hold the belief, they just reasoned backwards to justify a belief they _do_ hold).<p>There&#x27;s nothing in the belief that speech should be free and unforced that prohibits state-owned media (as long as other speech is not suppressed), or even outright state propaganda. That doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t be against these things, merely that being against these things doesn&#x27;t automatically follow from believing in that free and unforced speech is a fundamental right.<p>If you want to make the case that state-owned media are immoral (which, just to be clear, I don&#x27;t currently believe), you need to refer to different rights. I&#x27;ve heard some people on the internet make the claim, for instance, that all taxes constitute theft, and that taxes are fundamentally immoral. I don&#x27;t believe this at all, but that would give you a moral basis to renounce state media.<p>But really, sometimes the state is just going to do something that you don&#x27;t like, perhaps even hate with a passion, without violating a fundamental right. I know I&#x27;d be furious if the state broadcaster started propagandizing a religion, for instance, but as long as they don&#x27;t infringe on my freedom to believe what I want, they&#x27;re not violating any of my rights (I could, at most, argue that it&#x27;s a slippery slope to violating my rights, which may be a convincing argument by itself).')
