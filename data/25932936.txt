I realized this early on, hired a total expert in the field (the guy has contributed to C++ standards committees before), and am Loving how smoothly this project is going thanks to learning from him. It&#x27;s incredibly fun.<p>I pay the guy $150&#x2F;hr in 10 hour chunks and get the most in-depth insight into what I&#x27;m doing, how to revise my code, what the code means in the first place, etc. It&#x27;s perfect if you know how to code but find yourself in a brand new domain. I still learn outside of our hour-long mentor sessions, of course.<p>Skip the MOOC, hire the teacher.<p>..and then also do the MOOC, honestly they&#x27;re pretty great.')
