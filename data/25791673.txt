It&#x27;s said that TSMCs 5nm is 1.8x more dense than 7nm, 30% more efficient and 15% faster.<p>So if both were on 5nm, one could extrapolate that the single threaded performance would be similar, but ryzen would still lose on battery life. But it&#x27;s a speculation.<p>As to whether it&#x27;s fair, Apple can pay premium for 5nm exclusive access, and then charge the users hundreds of dollars per 8GB of RAM or storage upgrades.<p>AMD is selling the chips to the OEMs which have to make money themselves, which means that using cutting edge nodes might not make sense economically.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t matter, both are businesses, it&#x27;s AMDs fault that they didn&#x27;t rush to 5nm and are comfortable at staying behind.<p>The ones to lose will be the premium laptop manufactures, that sell laptops at 1000+ usd. As the agressive Apple marketing will most likely cut into their sales.<p>It would be interesting to see if the rumors, about Intel using TSMC  5nm this year, are true. Intel had the single threaded perf lead, even on their less dense 14nm node, vs AMD on TSMCs 7nm. Could be that on TSMCs nodes they would be faster than both Apple and AMD, but still probably at a higher TDP than Apple chips.')
