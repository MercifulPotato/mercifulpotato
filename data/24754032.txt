It was a phone first, and app running device second. Android and iOS feel like the phone part was a second-thought add-on in comparison. The Windows Phone did its best to make it so you could make a phone call or send a text, at the expense of email, running apps, etc. when the battery was low which took Android and iOS many years to implement. There were probably some other interesting things, but I don&#x27;t remember them any more.')
