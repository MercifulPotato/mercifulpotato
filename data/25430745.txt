Why would anyone ever sell? All the land would effectively be owned by hereditary feudal lords.<p>You&#x27;d sell for the usual reason, i.e. you&#x27;d prefer having money rather than that particular piece of land? That money would be then spent on either consumption or an investment with higher yield than land-holding.<p>In my home country Poland the land tax is negligible and yet the market for land exists, it&#x27;s not held forever by &quot;feudal lords&quot;.')
