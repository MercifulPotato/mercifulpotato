Lazy-loading for features that are rarely used (and you&#x27;ve actually done the analytics to justify this) can be a valid trade-off.<p>Against: this behaviour in some form has made it even into Microsoft Word. Click the &quot;select font&quot; dropdown and it can freeze for a couple of seconds to create the list, especially if you have a big document open. The same, if you&#x27;re unlucky, for the styles dropdown, the &quot;insert special character&quot; button because it insists on showing you the most-recently-used ones in a menu it has to build on click (as well as in the dialog box), and a few other places.<p>I expect better than this from a desktop application, especially as I remember these things being almost instant back around WinXP days. Sure it didn&#x27;t come with Bing integration, but I can live without that.<p>And web sites and applications should aim to emulate the responsiveness that we used to have on the desktop.')
