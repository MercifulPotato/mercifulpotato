If you think everyone who buys into it knows what&#x27;s going on (that it&#x27;s a pump, and that the last people in are going to be the bagholders), then I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s not really a scam because there isn&#x27;t deception going on (IANAL, THIS ISN&#x27;T LEGAL ADVICE). On the other hand, the posts I&#x27;ve seen definitely are not mentioning the risk aspect, and are advertising it as a get-rich-quick scheme. In that sense it&#x27;s a scam.')
