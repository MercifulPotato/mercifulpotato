(It&#x27;s even possible that many have already tried, and failed.) Of course this doesn&#x27;t mean that we shouldn&#x27;t try again and again. But we also have to realize that even if we&#x27;re successful, this doesn&#x27;t mean that the solution won&#x27;t be left completely forgotten, as long as &#x27;good enough&#x27; systems exist. (See the other threads for examples.)')
