Item(by='JoshuaDavid', descendants=None, kids=[25505713], score=None, time=1608632689, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25501164, text='The tornado trick <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> work if you don&#x27;t combine it with the Von Neumann trick, though.<p>&gt; What we’re going to do is take 5 coins, ideally all of different shapes and sizes, and put them into a large cup. You want the cup to be large so that as you shake the coins around, the coins get jumbled in a highly random way. Give the cup 5 good shakes where the coins are tumbling around, and then dump the coins out and count the number of heads. If there are an even number of heads, record a ‘0’ for the random bit. If there are an odd number of heads, record a ‘1’ for the random bit.<p>Consider the extreme case where all of the coins have a 0.1% chance of coming up heads: you have a 99.501% chance of getting 5 heads (odd), 0.498% chance of getting 4 heads and 1 tails (even), a 0.001% chance of getting 3 heads and 2 tails (odd), and a vanishingly small chance of getting 3 or more tails.<p>So if you use the tornado trick with 5 coins that biased, your &quot;random&quot; bitstring is going to look something like &quot;11111111111111...&quot;.')
