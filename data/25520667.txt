The ad industrial complex was a way to fast track processes, however it doesn&#x27;t account for the externalized costs of manipulative advertising on society - lower quality, addictive products-services having a higher profit margin and therefore a higher budget for marketing&#x2F;advertising as part of sustaining the complex. Decentralization therefore isn&#x27;t a necessity except as a failsafe against potential bad actors, however data and network portability is necessary law&#x2F;policy to be in place to counter actions of bad actors who use this current lack of easy mobility as a network defense mechanism.')
