People with mental disorders, tend to have lower paying jobs, and also kids with mental disorders.<p>2. We must fix income inequality to protect the kids.<p>3. Low income people should not be allowed to have children.<p>4. People who will have kids with mental disorders can usually predict that by using their income as a marker (this one kinda breaks the laws of physics but whatever)<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s more.
