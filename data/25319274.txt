The tax administration evaluates the property&#x27;s value (both land and infrastructure) and taxes it accordingly, eg 0.5%. For unused land the municipality can set an extra tax to coerce the land owner to develop the land, for example 1 to 3 percent. But I wouldn&#x27;t say it is a miracle maker, just a part of an effective taxation system.<p>What I personally would do, if I could, is to target the unscrupulous rich by banning companies located in tax havens from operating in the country, unless they can prove that they have proportionally high enough of employees working full-time in the said tax haven compared to their assets. That, I would say, is very achievable goal that would affect mostly just tax-dodgers and give a strong signal that those practices should come to an end.<p>I think it is just unfair that normal people have pay taxes up to 50% on their earnings (depending on the country of course) while millionaires and billionaires can just bypass the whole system by incorporating a holding company in Cayman Islands. Or mega corporations that can even negotiate special tax privileges.')
