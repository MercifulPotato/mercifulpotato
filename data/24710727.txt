Here&#x27;s an incomplete list of what they don&#x27;t know that makes &quot;but you should know my taxes!!&quot; arguments moot:<p>* You got married, divorced, or became a widow[er]<p>* You had or lost a child<p>* You paid mortgage loan interest on a primary residence<p>* You paid student loan interest<p>Or any number of other things that could have changed your <i>adjusted</i> gross income, which is what you&#x27;re actually taxed on.<p>The only way the IRS can bill you for actual taxes owed is if the tax code is simplified (an objectively good thing). The only way the tax code is simplified to that level is if most deductions and credits disappear, and whether or not that&#x27;s &quot;good&quot; is arguable at best.')
