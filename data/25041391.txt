What animals do isn&#x27;t a good moral compass. Animals rape each other, steal, kill their children, and do all sorts of morally reprehensible stuff.<p>&gt;Some animals are abused and we can work on regulation to prevent that<p>The best solution to stopping animal abuse is to not breed the animal in the first place.
