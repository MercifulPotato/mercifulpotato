The quantum interacts with a universal machine, called universe that computes the result. So that the entaglement is only delayed computation, like in Haskell. So there is no problem understanding how the physics works, the universal machine is in a monad and we can  only call return when the time is due. So I suggest considering space time as a delayed computation (more as a monad or time stated encoded) for a universal machine called our universe.')
