Item(by='jjk166', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609902048, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25651279, text='&gt; If this were possible, they would already be doing it<p>Unless the effort of doing so isn&#x27;t currently worth it but would be under the new circumstances. Further, many already do this. Combined with moving bus stops to more convenient locations (ie closer to people&#x27;s homes) and it&#x27;s easy to imagine this satisfying the vast majority of people.<p>&gt; But that requires money.<p>Having a motor vehicle drive up the street to the pedestrian rather than having the pedestrian walk down the street is a pen-stroke away. It was one thing 50 years ago when the route had to be determined by a random guy with a paper map to keep it simple, but nowadays forcing kids to go long distances to get to a bus stop is inexcusable.<p>As for heating bus stops, a 1500W space heater is $50. Assuming it&#x27;s on for 1 hour per day, 120 days per year, it&#x27;ll use $20 worth of electricity. Assuming 2 kids per bus stop, that&#x27;s 29 cents per day per student the first year and 8 cents per student per year subsequently. You only need to do this for a small subset of students who have long wait times at a bus stop and no reasonable alternative. Even if you had to provide it for every single student, that cost would be about 0.2% of the current average education budget allocation per student for the first year and less than 0.1% for subsequent years. Even if you wanted to go really fancy and add a solar power system to the bus stops to power the space heaters, you&#x27;re still looking at less than $5 per student per day to pay it off in one year.<p>Again, these or any one of the other countless methods humans have devised for solving this problem make a lot more sense than pretending the sun rises earlier.')
