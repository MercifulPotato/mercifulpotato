That will defocus some progress that happens with LLVM (every feature has to be implemented on both backends) and can make dev lives hard (eg “oh this problem comes up with GCC so use the LLVM backend “)<p>No.  The correct way is to create a Rust language specification that describes what the correct behavior is.<p>Then whether LLVM, GCC, or something else is used does not matter.  There won&#x27;t be one implementation with defacto behavior, there will be multiple implementations that follow the spec.<p>This is the way mature languages work.')
