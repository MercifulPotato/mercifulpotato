I almost always pick priority delivery but on many occasions I’ve had food sit at the restaurant for 30+ minutes waiting for pickup. And Uber always was hiding behind we’re waiting for the restaurant to prepare the order when in reality they’re waiting to assign a driver.<p>After 3 such incidents I gave up and deleted the app. I don’t mind paying $10+ in fees for convenience, but not knowing if the food will show up on time or an hour late destroyed all the benefit.<p>Problem is they all seem to be flaky. The challenge of working with an unreliable army of independent contractors I guess.<p>So at this point when I need food to show up on time I go and pick it up myself, and save delivery for when I don’t care if the food is an hour late.')
