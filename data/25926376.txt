So editor A says &quot;you should really quote authors B, C and D.&quot; And somewhere else, editor B is saying &quot;you should really quote authors A, C and D.&quot;<p>Machine learning might be a way to tackle this at scale, by teasing out these associations. Of course, this relies on a degree of transparency. Some journals publish all editors&#x27; comments and all revisions of a paper. This is a Good Thing, but humans aren&#x27;t reading all published research, let alone all the meta data.<p>If someone with relevant ML skills wants to address this, and fancies starting a project, do get in touch :)<p>A note on the Chinese insinuations that have been mentioned: As always, it&#x27;s a bit more complex. There may well be reasons that some states might sponsor or &#x27;encourage&#x27; gaming of intellectual institutions. If the world is viewed as a zero-sum game, and the currency is power, this unfortunately seems inevitable. Science tends away from this and towards collaboration, but &#x27;politics&#x27; often seems to tend toward competition. I&#x27;ve seen university heads explicitly declare to all staff how they intend to game the national rankings, and nobody bats an eyelid, it&#x27;s business as usual. It&#x27;s daft and harmful, and frankly I think it requires hard effort from idealistic grassroots activists to address it. Societal improvements are often won through struggle, they&#x27;re not given away, they don&#x27;t happen by incremental evolution.')
