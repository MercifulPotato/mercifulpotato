The false sense of urgency created by emails &amp; instant messaging are human creation (if we agree on that) by organizations that have self-interests to protect. I fully understand availability of service. Most of package&#x2F;mail carriers told us how deliveries will be delayed due to cyclone in Florida or increasing load due to holiday+covid in recent days? Let us translate all of this to internet traffic as well. Hell didnt break loose or sky didnt fall on our head when it happened. Hoping we are in agreement till now, what worries me is not messaging or availability of that service. But the commercial interests  that will use such services for their data mining. As soon as one agrees to new terms &amp; conditions, what if WhatsApp roles out updates that suck in more info about me from my phone to build their dark profile &amp; strong social connectivity maps? I think some of us are opposing that. It comes at cost of, lets say half day of service outage once in a while. How did we spend our childhood days when there were lengthy blackouts?')
