Not how it works or worse yet, how it will know how to self-correct.<p>You could think of it that the universe where we exist must have a stable&#x2F;consistent state.<p>If we go back in time and change the state, then that universe can&#x27;t (didn&#x27;t) exist, so it can&#x27;t be the universe that we are in. From our point of view in the present (before time-travelling), the state change was in the past, it will have already happened before we start time-travelling.<p>This doesn&#x27;t technically preclude us from going back in time. It&#x27;s more that the present state (at least as we observe it) is pre-determined, since we already exist in the present.')
