I did not know what that\nis so I followed the links provided:<p>&gt;&gt; The Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) is a long-term study of a random sample\nof 10,317 men and women who graduated from Wisconsin high schools in 1957.<p>So, in other words, it is a small dataset that is not representative of most\nhumans on the planet. It is also specifically populated by high school\ngraduates which is likely to introduce some unknown bias to the dataset- and\nany results drawn from it in particular with regards to IQ.<p>In short, please don&#x27;t abuse statistics, or if you do, don&#x27;t do it in an\narticle that starts by accusing another text of being &quot;just a rant&quot;.')
