Steam Link was previously a hardware dongle but has been replaced by android&#x2F;smart TV apps with the same name.<p>I&#x27;m surprised Nvidia didn&#x27;t attempt to partner with them rather than developing GeForce Now as a separate product, they could have taken advantage of Valve&#x27;s developer relationship&#x2F;client&#x2F;store front and handled the actual running of the hardware, which Valve seems much less interested in.<p>Stadia on the other hand is just a demonstration of the level of hubris Google is capable of engaging in. They thought they could launch a brand new store with the twist that people would need to pay a subscription to continue playing the games they had bought and without the option of using your own hardware should you end up purchasing a capable machine.')
