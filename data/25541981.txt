Item(by='cko', descendants=None, kids=[25542081], score=None, time=1608967459, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25541950, text='Rice, beans, pasta, oats, eggs, nuts, chicken thighs, tomatoes, paprika, onions, potatoes, olive oil, etc. All quite cheap. Requires a bit of initial thought and planning, and maybe experimenting with ingredients.<p>Carbs and fat are both cheap, and protein can be in the form of chicken and eggs. Vegetables are kinda expensive so I go with mostly broccoli, cabbage, and stuff from the Asian supermarket.<p>As for groceries, things like hygiene and cleaning products bring up total &quot;grocery&quot; bill, but $5 a day is very possible if it&#x27;s pure food expenditure.<p>German groceries are quite cheap actually. When I visited, I bought a kg of sauerkraut for 1 euro and a liter of soy milk for 1.5.')
