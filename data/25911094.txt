I personally moved from the Bay Area to Austin early 2010s. I can finally have a reasonably affordable place to raise a family. Summers are bad yes. But, i grew up in even hotter place before. For a mid 30s guy like myself, i think I made a right move by moving here. Don&#x27;t get me wrong I love the Bay area. But family life and simple life triumphs any other benefits for me. Which I have plenty here in Austin. If you are thinking about moving to Austin, it really is a good place.')
