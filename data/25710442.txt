It was more like the lone nutjob, except there were a few more nutjobs. And a bunch of LARPers and miscellaneous morons tagging along to riot because the protestors outnumbered the cops.<p>When I see a term like &quot;coup&quot; being bandied about inconsistent with its conventional usage, it looks to me like a rhetorical play rather than an honest analysis of what happened. &quot;Sedition&quot; carries all of the same gravity and probably is more accurate.<p>Edit: I found a good piece on Quartz that argues this point better: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;1953602&#x2F;is-america-experiencing-a-coup&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;qz.com&#x2F;1953602&#x2F;is-america-experiencing-a-coup&#x2F;</a>')
