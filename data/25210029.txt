Indicated in outdated literature but contraindicated in current literature? Absolutely. I am old enough to have experienced it, and haven&#x27;t. I&#x27;m also not against doing things differently than I did in the past. I&#x27;ve worked with 30 year olds who were completely unwilling to compromise, and folks in their 60s who were. I don&#x27;t know anyone who would rather work with the former over the later because of age.')
