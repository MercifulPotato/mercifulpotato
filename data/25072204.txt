Have you used Youtube Music, their replacement service?<p>It&#x27;s garbage. It&#x27;s barely usable. I&#x27;m going to have to switch to Spotify.<p>Google always does this thing where it trashes a mature service and replaces it with something really new and immature that doesn&#x27;t fit the use case of their previous customers in the hopes that they&#x27;ll acquire new customers. But there&#x27;s no sales pitch for Youtube Music. It doesn&#x27;t do anything new. It&#x27;s just, &quot;the last one wasn&#x27;t as successful as we&#x27;d like, so let&#x27;s change things up a bit.&quot; And with an attitude like that, the next one won&#x27;t be successful either. Which is why Google <i>keeps doing this over and over.</i><p>They have corporate commitment problems. They never take a service and make it good, they just scrap it and start a new one in the hopes that they&#x27;ll luck into a big hit. They&#x27;ve had like a <i>dozen</i> different instant-messaging apps in the past decade, and none of them ever caught on, because they keep scrapping them. I couldn&#x27;t even tell you what the current iteration is. I used to use Google Allo a bit, which was their last one, but then they scrapped <i>that</i> and made this most recent one. I don&#x27;t know why they do this.')
