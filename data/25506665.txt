Hell even Wikipedia doesn&#x27;t do that!<p>Unfortunately I don&#x27;t see how the definition fits to the three classical examples of fascist regimes, Japan, Italy, or Germany. In all of those cases the nationalized industries were aligned with the groups perceived to be &quot;the people.&quot; The oppression was against perceived internal aliens but the majority of people benefited in the short term and that&#x27;s why these leaders were popular.<p>The genocide is a necessary side effect of perceiving some internal groups as authentic and others as aliens or oppressors.<p>The real parallel can be drawn with attitudes on the Left today who perceive BIPOC people as authentic Americans and those of European descent to be Colonizers responsible for everything wrong with our society who should give the land back. Unfortunately this attitude has also energized morons like the Proud Boys to &quot;fight back,&quot; but at least for now all these idiots are just LARPing revolution. Hope it stays that way.')
