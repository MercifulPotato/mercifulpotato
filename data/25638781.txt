I&#x27;m a bit surprised at the reasoning, after all he knew how long the commute was, and what the product was. But it&#x27;s fine, we don&#x27;t all know how we&#x27;ll feel, like any relationship that goes from maybe to signed up.<p>As an employer, I tend to think we dodged a bullet. I&#x27;ve had one or two early quits over the years, and it&#x27;s fine, we mostly avoided investing too much in them. People come, they sniff around for a week, they leave. Or they come, we find out we don&#x27;t like them, and they go. Both have happened.<p>I&#x27;ve also been on the employee side of that. I joined, and then found the place to be a mess. So I left immediately when something else presented itself a few weeks later.<p>The thing about jobs, as opposed to school, is that the only way a job ends is that someone calls time on it. School ends because you&#x27;re done. You graduated, passed the viva, whatever. A job you have to decide to end if you don&#x27;t like it. You can&#x27;t just slog it out through that course that you don&#x27;t like, because there&#x27;s no end.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t worry at all about the CV impact. Chances are you can explain what happened if you decide to have it on your CV. Alternatively, I don&#x27;t think anyone would hold it against you if you omitted or obscured a few weeks of your life. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t.')
