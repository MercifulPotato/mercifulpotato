Based on this, the statement is false. If your <i>only</i> objective is to get a t-shirt, sure then it limits you. But if your objective is contributing to OSS, nothing is stopping you of making meaningful contributions! The only change is getting the t-shirt, but sylveon&#x27;s comment sounds a very generic statement so wanted to clarify that open source actively welcomes contributions.')
