Item(by='function_seven', descendants=None, kids=[25322005], score=None, time=1607241063, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25321787, text='&gt; <i>Where do people get their info from to just go with a &quot;time to contact the FTC&quot;? If feels like the equivalent of people threatening they will contact the BBB.</i><p>I&#x27;m well aware of how toothless and irrelevant BBB is these days. (&quot;Yelp for old people&quot;). Almost nobody visits BBB <i>before</i> making a decision, only after a bad experience. Given that, a business with a bad grade there probably doesn&#x27;t feel much of a sting.<p>But I&#x27;m totally unfamiliar with FTC&#x27;s power or purview. Is involving them on something like this a waste of time because of the dollar amount? I don&#x27;t expect they would recover the money, or mediate a dispute. But I think the author is coming at it from the angle that the other party would rather not rack up complaints at all. Especially if they could get other affiliates to follow suit.<p>I work in telecom, and complaints to the Public Utilities Commission are treated seriously within my company (and in the wider industry AFAIK). We really do not want customers to file any. When a customer mentions the PUC at all, we take them seriously enough to get some more eyes on their problem.<p>My guess is that the author&#x27;s checklist includes small claims as the next step after the FTC complaint. Or maybe they just stop at the FTC complaint and consider a lawsuit—even if small claims—to not be worth it for the amount involved.')
