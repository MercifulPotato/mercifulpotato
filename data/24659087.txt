I am relatively new to programming, and as a newbie I got excited that there was an event like this. It prompted me to read about how pull requests work, and to research several open source projects that I could contribute to. I haven&#x27;t made any contributions yet, but it&#x27;s on my to-do list for October.<p>I suppose you can already count me as one of the beneficiaries of this program, simply because it got me to learn new things. I think Hacktoberfest is a good idea, speed bumps like this one notwithstanding.')
