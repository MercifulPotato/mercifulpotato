Google took the money that was supposed to go to the publisher, kept it, and didn&#x27;t refund the advertisers. They probably never do.<p>I have also worked with hundreds of advertisers in the SEO space, and I have never, ever, seen someone say they had ad money refunded because of click fraud, yet I&#x27;ve seen plenty of publisher earnings held back because of supposed click fraud. Google&#x27;s fight against click fraud is really just a fight against paying out to publishers, full stop.<p>Google also used to do this crazy shit (don&#x27;t know if they still do as I&#x27;m not in that space anymore) where they would change the TOS at midnight and then retroactively block the past month&#x27;s earnings on hundreds of accounts that are violating the seconds-old TOS. Pretty sure that is illegal as well.<p>I will happily forward what I have if someone knows how to get in touch with investigators.')
