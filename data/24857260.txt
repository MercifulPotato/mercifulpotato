I&#x27;m saying that the logic is analogous to the argument in the article.<p>I do think there&#x27;s something to &#x27;shared experiences&#x27; across ethnic groups to an extent, though it probably won&#x27;t have as strong an effect as sharing a religion, given that religion is at least nominally a choice, and has an explicit ideology backing it. Nevertheless, you see this effect when you see viral memes with captions like &quot;only asian american kids get this&quot; -- obviously these don&#x27;t apply universally, but there&#x27;s enough of something there to drive their virality. Hell, sometimes it may be as simple as shared experiences dealing with racism.<p>&gt; Saying that people naturally converge on a shared culture based on their skin color just sounds like thinly veiled racism.<p>I don&#x27;t really see how you got this from what I said.')
