If not, may i invite you to kindly give it a try. Beyond the users of one&#x27;s network and the local timeline, there is also what is known as the &quot;whole known network&quot;. At some points, it is quite broad and doses not address the perceived shortcoming that you asked&#x2F;commented on. At other times - because of how the different instaces and their relevant users are connected - it may in effect operate in a fashion that you noted. No offense to you, but normally, i would not go out of my way to invite folks to the fediverse...but it sounds like your question is legitimate so i really wish to invite you so that you can learn for yourself how deep the rabbit hole can go.
