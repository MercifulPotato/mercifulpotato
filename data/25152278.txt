I&#x27;m talking about me and all other humans who are not able to do so.<p>I would also argue that on an ethical level, you would require to make sure that every new human being has the best chance our society can provide for him&#x2F;her. Like if technology is so far advanced, that you can just scan an embryo, you see why it would become much smaller or way too tall which would lead to medical issues and you could fix it with a press of a button, you would need to do it.<p>I would argue that not doing this, is the same thing as denying a preterm baby an incubator.')
