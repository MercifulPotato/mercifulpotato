For example, I think people have had huge type understanding entropy, energy, power, transmission, information, etc with all of the neologisms that people have coined (or converted into fiat currency, or concentrations of power or information, or net 0 carbon obligations vPPAs like google has).<p>But I gotta say, isn&#x27;t it a bit exergy-poverty potentiating and lack of laser focus on how fundamental heat transference actually works, both in vivo (important for targeted medicine), in silico (needed to improve the probability of quantum error rate and controllability of decoherence) and in environment (especially with the carbon cycle).  This has frequently lead to anti-trust issues in the past, and maybe too much regulatory capture.<p>The funny thing is that you can metabolize google (and the generalized polyad business pattern pathogen) with hydromel of work to be stolen by outputting work over a distributed work stealing queue (for example, outputting stuff into a private distributed peer to peer distributed version of git, like the laconically named <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fossil-scm.org&#x2F;home&#x2F;doc&#x2F;trunk&#x2F;www&#x2F;index.wiki" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fossil-scm.org&#x2F;home&#x2F;doc&#x2F;trunk&#x2F;www&#x2F;index.wiki</a>). You can in fact, intentionally skew (or ideate euler or complex-dims of spinor space) words to bias things (this would be traditionally a stein encoding over a homogenous linear space), by analyzing the ROC curve of a virtualized Google flattened to VC-dims, then pushforwarding societal pathologies (can be interpreted as a failure to recognize tragedy of the commons, or failure to invest, spend time on, or be incentivized to think about the over-commercalization of the www, which was certainly not the original intent @ CERN etc. Since google has become over reliant on combinatorial algorithms and things that relate to some encoding of numbers, you can re-discreetly digitalize many logarithms that encode to transcode network-theoretic online modulated wavetrains of datums of infos to be &quot;lifted&quot; up into their internal servers, especially due to the implications of the CCPA and GDPR, it&#x27;s still fairly trivial to abstractly reinterpret &#x27;0&#x27; as transience using more raw logical prims or much more complicated physical models but shouldn&#x27;t come to a surprise are much more stable fundamentally when you are modeling things in the digital world. Probably any one set of services (or people) that have too much digital service providing digital presence may quixotically have destabilizing disequilibria of effects. Not that I think google hasn&#x27;t immensely positive world good over the long run, they&#x27;ve just spread themselves too thin, when one entity becomes &quot;the truth&quot; but might not have everyone&#x27;s interests aligned (in a semantic meaningful way), it&#x27;s very much prone to abuse, especially when <i>people</i> become the products in an unethical fashion. Not too dissimilar to that of Facebook.')
