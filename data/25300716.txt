You don&#x27;t need web fonts unless your website is either heavily type-centric, or has font-related dependencies (such as embedded content of some kind). Icon fonts are also a neat use of web fonts, but they don&#x27;t make the page &quot;feel slow&quot; when their rendering is slow, because icons loading slower affects our perception of a page&#x27;s loading time less than its text.')
