For your product, the question comes simply to what is the size of your market that would potentially pay for your accountability service for bike riding. The second question is how would you even reach this market.<p>Is it possible that this product would reach $50K, $100K, or more in a year in revenue? How many months, years would that take? How much marketing effort is there in terms of time and cost? I don&#x27;t know the answer to these but considering you are targeting B2C and competing with products like Stickk my intuition tells me it would be hard.<p>So, I guess one constructive feedback I can give you is that I see a lot of projects that you are working on. It seems that you enjoy building these projects. I don&#x27;t see the type of deep critical analysis that would indicate that you have a path to substantial revenue.<p>Out of the projects you have listed, which one could actually generate $100K a year in revenue after 1-4 years in the market? Personally, I start with that question and go from there. Just based on cursory look, it seems that this question is at the tail end of your analysis.')
