I agree there is some fringe simulation cases, but most gaming is not inhibited by CPU. Once you&#x27;re up in the 2k and 4k land, the GPU is the bottleneck. This video focuses on 1080p performance benefits. There is zero reason to be upgrading between generations unless you&#x27;re just burning money. Anyone paying $500+ every time there is a new CPU platform, is guaranteed already running 2k and 4k content.')
