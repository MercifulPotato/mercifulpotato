Item(by='dragontamer', descendants=None, kids=[24869347], score=None, time=1603459822, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24869178, text='&gt;  The best antidote for bad ideas and conspiracy theories is transparency and public debate.<p>I&#x27;ve been on the internet for decades. I fully disagree with this. EDIT: Mass bannings, aka an &quot;Exodus Event&quot;, was the solution to almost all major conspiracies I&#x27;ve witnessed.<p>1. When GameFAQs LUEsers gained conspiracy theories against the website and other reckless behavior, to the point of harming the website, the solution was to cut off LUE and prevent the public from viewing that message board.<p>2. I never visited SomethingAwful, but clearly the toxic subset of that community was banned and eventually moved to 4chan.<p>3. 4Chan&#x27;s prominence in the late 00s &#x2F; early 10s was clearly toxic and always was. 4chan was just focused on hitting &quot;safe&quot; targets, such as harassing Scientology &#x2F; Scientologists. As soon as 4chan&#x27;s toxic behavior was unleashed to more mainstream ideas, it was clear that the toxicity had to be stopped, and 4chan moderators stepped up their game.<p>4. 8Chan was created in response to the Gamergate conspiracies, as was some legitimate sites like Resetera (though they took the less conspiracy-minded side).<p>----------<p>For the most part, the bannings on 4Chan worked. We don&#x27;t see Gamergaters pushing their silly conspiracy theories today, or other vile attacks on people. Furthermore, the doxing &#x2F; swatting mostly stopped on that subject.<p>&gt; This move will serve to push these movements underground to Tor or other uncensorable networks where they&#x27;re even harder to monitor.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s called an exodus. But as various websites gain prominence, they discover again-and-again that with prominence comes responsibility.<p>When you have a group of doxers and swatters visiting your website, you start to punish that subgroup. That&#x27;s just what must happen. Yeah, its a temporary fix (doxers &#x2F; swatters will move elsewhere), but at a minimum, it sends the message that such behavior won&#x27;t be tolerated.<p>&gt; It also sends a message to them that they&#x27;re on to something (because if the QAnon conspiracy was real, the &quot;deep state&quot; would indeed try to snuff it out).<p>Tell me: when a child is misbehaving and thinks &quot;Adults are out to get me&quot;, do you go more lenient on them?<p>EDIT: Adults are just like children: you have to punish bad behavior and reward good behavior. That&#x27;s just the basis of building a modern society.')
