In my own experience, even science is taught in a doctrinal way, i.e. we were told to believe what scientists thought and discovered. It seems to me that it&#x27;s no different from religion--just replace God with Newton. Most students worship scientists but don&#x27;t study them in details.<p>It&#x27;s bad that when those students grow up, they believe science is the absolute truth and they&#x27;re hostile to people who doubt about it. They become the new priests. And probably today&#x27;s biggest &quot;scientific doctrine&quot; is big data-people unquestionably believe whatever data tells them without caring about nuance or bothering to think what it implies. Interestingly, it seems most of those people don&#x27;t have a strong background in science while most trained scientists rarely hold the same view that science is superior and we know everything.')
