It&#x27;s a stressful, uncomfortable and not particularly efficient way of studying a language, especially for introverts. Some polyglots study this way, some do not - it&#x27;s absolutely not a necessity. Some polyglots go by the motto: &quot;if you can understand the spoken language, and you&#x27;re able to write in it, then you&#x27;re able to speak in it, too&quot;.<p>There is no shortcut to learning a new language - even if you&#x27;re fluent in 9 languages, the 10th will still take 1000+ hours. The most efficient way appears to be a loop of listening and drilling vocabulary, particularly listening to excerpts that come with text transcription.')
