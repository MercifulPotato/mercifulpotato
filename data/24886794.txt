We partnered with Sony Music and have over 600,000 artists accessing their fan data through our API. One thing we constantly noticed was that artists were posting on Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, etc. about their upcoming releases. The problem was that since their releases weren’t out yet, they didn’t have any destination to send fans.<p>Posts like “new merch dropping next Tuesday at 3 PST” assumes that fans will actually remember. It also uses up valuable social media real estate and doesn’t give the artist any usable data.<p>That’s why we built Laylo Drops. Drops lets you create a landing page for your upcoming releases, captures your fan data (emails and phone numbers), and automatically reminds them at the time of the drop.<p>Drops links are sharable anywhere that you can put a link: IG Stories, Twitter, etc. Fans don’t even need to create an account to RSVP. We also provide social media templates, custom messaging tools and more to make the marketing simple.<p>We set our sights on the music industry (because that’s where we started) but ultimately our goal is to help creators of all kinds connect directly with their audience and make announcements with ease.<p>We would love to hear your feedback and your experiences as creators or working with creators. We’re very excited to be sharing this with HN, and we’ll be here to answer any and all questions you want to throw our way!<p>Thanks,<p>Alec')
