To further give you an idea of how different those times were, here is my email address from the signature on one of my Usenet posts from the &#x27;80s:<p><pre><code>  ihnp4!{cithep,wlbr!callan}!tim\n</code></pre>\nWhat that meant was that to get an email to me, your computer should arrange to deliver it to ihnp4. That was the name of a machine at a Bell Labs office at a place named &quot;Indian Hill&quot; in Naperville, IL. It stood for &quot;Indian Hill Network Processor 4&quot;.<p>ihnp4 was very well connected, so it was reasonable for me to expect that you could find a way to get the email to it.<p>The rest of my email address is saying that ihnp4 should deliver the mail to cithep (Caltech High Energy Physics) or wlbr (a machine at the Westlake Village, CA offices of Bunker Ramo). If it goes to wlbr, wlbr should send it to callan (a machine at Callan Data Systems). I had accounts on cithep and callan, both with user name tim.<p>You didn&#x27;t have to start at ihnp4, of course. As long as you could find a way to get it to one of {ihnp4, cithep, wlbr, callan} you could get it to me.<p>Periodically there was a posting on Usenet giving a list of machines that would publicly relay mail and their interconnections. (I want to say this was monthly and in net.general, but I&#x27;m not sure).<p>Given that and a list of machines that your site connected to, you could find a path from your site to me. Let&#x27;s say you were in Boston, and you knew your company exchanged mail with decvax (a machine at Digital Equipment Corporation). You could see from the connection list that decvax connected to trwrb (a machine at TRW Redondo Beach, CA, I believe), and trwrb connected to wlbr, so from your machine the email address decvax!trwrb!wlbr!callan!tim would work to reach me.')
