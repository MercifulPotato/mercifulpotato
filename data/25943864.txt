It looks to me like the trend lines broke in 1973-1975, but by the nature of this type of chart, careful choice in starting year can provide a chart that suggests a different break point. (It&#x27;s probably better to think of these as &quot;fuzzy&quot; lines, which are 10% starting in each of 1946, 1947...1955.)')
