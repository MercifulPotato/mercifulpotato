Here&#x27;s how I imagine it would work:<p>1. User gets banned by Facebook without an explanation<p>2. User asks Facebook for an explanation<p>3. Facebook declines to answer<p>4. User goes to the government regulatory body with a complaint<p>5. Regulatory body forces Facebook to provide a reason<p>6. Facebook tells user what they violated and when<p>Step #5 would allow the regulatory body to require identification to make sure that the user is under their jurisdiction (or you just have to show up in person). This would allow them to identify bad actors and would decrease the chance that the system could be abused.<p>Obviously this should only apply to platforms&#x2F;services that are beyond a certain size (&gt;1M users?). Also, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if some consumer protection agency doesn&#x27;t already have powers akin to this.')
