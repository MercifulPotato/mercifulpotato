Seems like most&#x2F;many banks are still running on cobol today...<p>I think just because something was bad before yesterday does not mean it cannot be used in good ways today or tomorrow. And I think everybody talking bad about PHP should not even think about JavaScript.<p>Todays PHP gets its job done in a really good way. It has very good frameworks, is amazingly fast and is easy to start with and quite easy to deploy. And it‘s absolutely not comparable to something that was many years ago. And I think too, PHP before something after PHP 5.5 was not „that good“ compared to C# or Java.')
