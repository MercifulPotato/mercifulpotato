We&#x27;ll pay the interest from the operating income. It will also be secured against the assets of the company.&quot;<p>So from the point of view of a bank or bond-holder, it&#x27;s not such a bad deal if the company survives. It&#x27;s not a bad deal either for the past owner who does cash out. Then, after the acquisition, they put the debt on that company&#x27;s books because they were technically costs incurred from that company, and there is nobody to stop them anyway.')
