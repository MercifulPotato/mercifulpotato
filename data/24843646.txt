(writeSpeedToEngineComputer() doesn&#x27;t count, because I need to implement that also.)<p>Your reason for doing so is, I think, in your last two paragraphs.  But this isn&#x27;t particularly reusable code - I&#x27;m not going to use getNextCruiseSpeed() or handleButtonPress() in the windshield wiper controller.  It&#x27;s pretty much tied to the specific use.  (There may be a handleButtonPress() in the windshield wiper controller, but I can&#x27;t reuse this one.)<p>So you offer me something that is more verbose, based on a benefit that I can&#x27;t actually benefit from.<p>(I presume that getCurrentSpeed() returning void was just because of quick typing.)')
