You&#x27;d be surprised how many engineering decisions only favor the group of people who develop them, you are less likely to consider non-white-male demographics as a homogeneous group, leaving those users out as prospective clients.<p>- you have a less diverse QA and testing without diversity. That means you&#x27;re only testing your products against white people. Lots of famous products struggle with being used with people of color because of that reason. For example many early photo augmentation software didn&#x27;t work with anyone unless they were white.<p>- diversity begets diversity. The lack of diversity may (and often will) create a work culture that prevents a suitably qualified PoC from being hired. And even if they do, the lack of diversity may be unwelcoming. It&#x27;s almost certain that lack of diversity will mean people will make innocent faux pas comments to the one diverse hire, pushing them out of groups. They therefore get disenfranchised from the work place, simply by non diverse culture being unaccommodating and not outright racism.<p>Basically, end of the day, by not having diversity, you&#x27;re likely both pushing away people outside your demographics, both as clients and employees, and also leaving money on the table as a result.')
