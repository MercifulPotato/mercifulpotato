Any product, not just tech, runs into problems when manufactured at scale. Tech is more visible because it is newer and in the spotlight. Nobody says &quot;stop manufacturing cars&quot; when one manufacturer issues a safety recall because cars have been around so long. The entire premise of producing 100X fewer cars so we can hand-craft cars and hand-check them is ridiculous - we simply accept the occasional manufacturing defect or product recall as the rates at which they happen are so small. These are all rounding errors, and the benefits of scale far outweigh the cons.<p>The same applies to tech. Content moderation has been ~solved as well. The overwhelming majority of content on social media platforms, websites, etc is regular, legal content. The illegal content that makes it through the filters and stays up for a significant period of time is a rounding error.')
