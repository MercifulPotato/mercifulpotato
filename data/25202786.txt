Item(by='packetlost', descendants=None, kids=[25204200, 25205647], score=None, time=1606250427, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25201024, text='IMO there should be a mandatory waiting period of 24-48 hours for any firearm, but you should be able to start the process over the phone&#x2F;online etc.<p>Alternatively, require training + passing an exam similar to getting a drivers license for owning anything except a manual long-barrel rifle or shotgun. Semi-auto firearms especially should require licensing&#x2F;training IMO. Restrictions on magazine size or appearance (&quot;assault rifle&quot; lol) are generally dumb and fail to address real problems. I think it&#x27;s reasonable to know <i>who</i> probably has a gun (ie. through a license program), but I&#x27;m generally against mandatory gun registration (though voluntary registration is fine).')
