Because I have, and I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference.<p>The &quot;transcoding is bad&quot; story is about low quality settings, archival, and&#x2F;or bad encoders. E.g. don&#x27;t do repeated transcodes with the ffmpeg AAC encoder, not even at 320kbps. But one final transcode with SBC for over-the-air delivery at the max allowed bitrate? That&#x27;s totally fine, especially for typical Bluetooth use cases (listening on the go, casual headphones, etc).')
