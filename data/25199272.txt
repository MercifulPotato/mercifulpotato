Things can be scarce without being difficult to refine from raw materials (a stamp).  Things can be difficult to extract without being particularly scarce (aluminium).  Things can be valuable without being scarce (TVs), things can be scarce and not valuable (an original artwork by my 4 year old daughter).<p>The <i>only</i> thing that makes something valuable is that it is valued by people.  People are weird and have lots of different reasons for valuing things.  There are lots of things I could burn an insane amount of energy and money on that would not result in anything valued by others.<p>The idea that something should be valued based on the work that went into creating it is interesting as a hypothetical idea but not something that is very relevant to the actual world we live in.<p>If anything, you&#x27;ve got it backwards:<p>&gt;  it&#x27;s scarce because it requires a lot of work to extract<p>It requires a lot of work to extract because it was so valuable that all the easy-to-extract gold was taken and put in jewelry and vaults.')
