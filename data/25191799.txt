Weed is minor bad, cocaine is bigger bad (except in finance, but that&#x27;s another story).<p>By suggesting that MJF disease was fueled by his drug habit:<p>- you will be causing more people to see him with a negative light<p>- you might impede what seems to be his good will effort to put his money and fame against the disease<p>There is no perfect solution, but I think we should at least be aware of these second order effects -- see also The Dark Knight for when Batman decides that preserving the previous good reputation of Double Face was more important, because it gave hope to people.<p>My personal take: Disease do not come from doing &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; deeds - they just are. As someone else said, even if it was 100% due to drugs, that does not precludes compassion.<p>Also, even if I&#x27;m neutral on drugs, lots of people aren&#x27;t.  Therefore, making this connection, while technically true, may bring very little upsides but lots of downsides, so it&#x27;s better not to, if only because we should leave MJF himself decide what to disclose or not, while by default extending the benefit of doubt.')
