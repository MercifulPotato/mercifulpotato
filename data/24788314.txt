The hardware in an Airpod is effectively the same as that in a hearing aid. Wearing an Airpod isn&#x27;t a sign of a disability, with all the stigma that comes attached to that.<p>Something like these earrings blur the line even more between hearing aid and headphone. You could actually imagine wearing it all the time (including during conversations) without appearing rude - a big problem with just wearing earbuds.<p>The only thing missing is the software to do local DSP and amplification. It&#x27;s almost certainly possible - bluetooth headphones have all the required components - but the manufacturers aren&#x27;t writing the software to amplify ambient noise directly. Either because they don&#x27;t believe the market is there or because they don&#x27;t want to venture into the &quot;medical devices&quot; category that hearing aids land in, with all the added R&amp;D expense that entails.')
