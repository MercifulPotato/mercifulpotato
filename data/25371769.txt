Pointing out that a law certainly isn&#x27;t something brought in to protect Bangladeshi values and culture, but a relic of the former colonial powers&#x27; values it&#x27;s now extremely embarrassed by is a useful line of argument. Of course it would be wrong to assume that prejudice against LGBT people in Bangladesh stems primarily from fidelity to the values of Victorian Britons, but when you&#x27;re arguing against people who insist that those arguing for greater tolerance are importing foreign values to replace what Bangladeshis have always believed, the actual historical context can help.')
