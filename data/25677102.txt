I think that can&#x27;t even be disabled.<p>It may be that the toolchains you&#x27;ve seen were built with only one set of libraries. If you specify --enable-multilib when you build the toolchain then libraries for a dozen or so common combinations of extensions are built.<p>If you&#x27;re doing something embedded then you can build precisely the core and toolchain you want. If you&#x27;re doing an OS for packaged software then you&#x27;ll specify one (or a very small number) of combinations of extensions. Linux distributions such as Debian and Fedora decided on RV64GC a few years ago already.<p>By the end of this year the B and V extensions (and a few smaller ones) should be ratified and the Linux distros will make a second set of supported extensions.')
