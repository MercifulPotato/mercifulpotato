A house is THE biggest expenditure for most tech people, because the tech jobs are concentrated in a few places with high housing prices.<p>Notwithstanding all the downsides of WFH, I will happily permanently WFH since I can move to cheaper place and enjoy a large house to myself, even if I need to accept a lower wage (but not so low that the cheaper house price is no longer worth the move). As for all the socialization, I&#x27;d rather find it outside work.<p>As for the mental health some people talk about, being able to afford a large house will do tremendously better for my mental health than being able to interact with people face with face, especially when those people are only bonded to me by money.')
