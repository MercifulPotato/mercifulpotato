It&#x27;s a classic dictatorial distraction tactic to point to the US and say they do bad things too. But this is hardly just against the US. They tried to murder two people in the UK and shot down a commercial airliner in Ukraine.<p>Russia seems to shamelessly go around assassinating people so they make easy pickings for him.<p>One of his latest investigations and podcasts was some random African country (Cameroon) based on video evidence online.<p>A better question to ask is why hasn’t Russia or China freaked out at NSA hacks? Like the west just did with SolarWinds (I’m sure the western media would eat it up and so would we here). We had to wait for a western (Snowden) to find our rights are being violated domestically. The answer is Russia and China are on their own spree and keep any of the failed NSA ops quiet (assuming they exist). So there’s not much to go on for some random open intelligence blog. Russia et al don’t care about defending rights or exposing evil.<p>But Russia and the other mafia states provide plenty of open source evil to sort through.<p>I also don’t see the US shooting down a plane with a hundred people and denying it or openly assassinating their enemies in ‘enemy’ territory.<p>There’s so many answers here.')
