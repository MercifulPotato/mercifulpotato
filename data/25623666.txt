I rarely get distracted by trying to optimize my config, as a result I use almost the vanilla defaults and I&#x27;m mostly happy with that.  TRAMP is pretty great, I wish it would not make a new connection for every network interaction though.  Setting ControlMaster on ssh helps a bit but it&#x27;s still not as fast&#x2F;transparent as I&#x27;d like.  There are far too many &quot;blocking&quot; operations in emacs, as much as I love working in it, there is the non-zero times that it locks up on me and it drives me crazy when that happens.<p>If it was ever the case that I had to wait 30 seconds to open a file, I&#x27;m sure I would abandon emacs instead of trying to debug it.  That said I can&#x27;t imagine working on a 70,000-file repo.  That sounds like a terrible idea.')
