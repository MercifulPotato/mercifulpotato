Hi! :)<p>One thing I didn’t see mentioned here yet, and what makes look suspicious in my eyes, is the timing.<p>It seemed to me, and I saw this charted in some places afterwards (sorry, don’t have proper sources right now), that the disabling of the   options on MULTIPLE brokerages happens almost exactly at the same time a heavy ladder attack was started which dropped the price significantly from - maybe 300-ish? to 120-ish in minutes.<p>It looked like stop losses should get triggered and the whole market brought to the bottom without the smaller investors a) being able to buy the dip and b) being able to rally the price by buying back thusly.<p>All the reasons given for the disabling and more might apply, but still this could have been used through the timing as part of a multiple pronged attack, seemingly also coordinated with bots flooding wsb with disheartening messages and a DDOS attack on Reddit’s DNS infrastructure, to try and keep individual investors alone with their decisions to either hold or keep their profits and ruin, thus trying to trigger a panic sale.<p>What, maybe to get out of some kind of squeeze? :)<p>It was great to see that most people seem to have held on even whilst disconnected from the hivemind for a bit.')
