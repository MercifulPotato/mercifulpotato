The point is, the safeguards should be same for everybody if we are aiming for merit based employment.<p>Sure, go ahead and implement ban for 12 hour work days but don&#x27;t do it on nationality&#x2F;race&#x2F;gender base. Of course you can have exceptions for certain groups(like women who give birth to a child can have special benefits) but blanket bans for based on those is simply not O.K.  if you want to have a fair society.<p>On the other hand, you may not want to have a fair society or fair means a different thing. I understand that there are different ideologies who would advocate different structures in the benefit of a certain race&#x2F;gender&#x2F;social status. Racism, sexism, classism are not novel ideals.')
