Most of these imagined scenarios are not mutually exclusive.<p>I&#x27;d bet on some combination of the above like &quot;nobody has even made a complaint in 20 years because &#x27;everybody knows&#x27; such complaints are ignored, but the Good Old Boys responsible for stonewalling back then have since retired&quot;.')
