I don&#x27;t sell anything on any App stores currently but I do like the idea of having some way of creating &quot;applications&quot; that are a bit more discoverable. Last I checked GitHub search is pretty awful for discovery (maybe I&#x27;m wrong on that?). I could imagine an interface where it would be easier to browse &quot;apps&quot; that do something specific.<p>Mathworks (MATLAB) has a decent version of this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mathworks.com&#x2F;matlabcentral&#x2F;fileexchange&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mathworks.com&#x2F;matlabcentral&#x2F;fileexchange&#x2F;</a><p>People can provide feedback and ratings which makes it easy to see when projects are dead or when there are big issues that aren&#x27;t being fix. You can also reference other projects - &quot;This project is like that project but it is faster ...&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think PyPi is all that good for this. Also, I&#x27;ve never really invested the effort to learn how to deploy an application to PyPi whereas something that simply points to my repo may be valuable?<p>Anyway, the main problem I want solved is not having people discover my code (although that would be great too), but being able to find other code more easily so I don&#x27;t need to constantly reinvent the wheel.')
