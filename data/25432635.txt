Isn&#x27;t GRPC better for raw TCP?<p>When we are using HTTP, diluting HTTP standards - eg. using POST for both creating &amp; updating, returning HTTP 200 for errors seem to be hacky in GraphQL.<p>I always found REST to be more simple &amp; straight forward. With progression in HTTP itself - HTTP&#x2F;2, HTTP&#x2F;3 etc., chatty behavior of REST may not be expensive.<p>Implementing roles &amp; permissions in GraphQL tricky. We need clear schema definitions to control it. Huge learning curve as well.')
