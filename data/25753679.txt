Some words can harm in a way it is unreasonable to expect guard against, or those for which it is impossible to guard against.<p>The scholarly literature on speech, harm, and legality has dozens of such examples.<p>&gt;but I do not see any of the advocates of limiting free speech having the courage to tell<p>I can courageously say now that I&#x27;m not in favor of restrictions on speech for reasons of &quot;stupidity&quot; but rather the demonstrable harm speech can cause.')
