A random publisher not posting something is not censorship. It&#x27;s literally the editorial board&#x27;s job to decide which gets published and which is left out. Not posting false or deceitful information forced upon by third parties is also not censorship. Just because you have a personal view that is not aligned with an editorial  board&#x27;s mission statement that doesn&#x27;t mean the editorial board is engaged in censorship.<p>This topic seems to boil down to some people wanting the benefits of abusing a publisher&#x27;s reputation and readership to force-feed their own personal opinion on the public. Not being able to perform that kind of abuse is not censorship.')
