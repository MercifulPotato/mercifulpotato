The cave was immediately sealed off from the public and a team of professionals has studied it ever since. They installed pathways to prevent damage, climate control, special lights, etc. Werner was the first person they let film inside. Absolutely incredible film. We watched it on a lark and we were all mesmerized. It isnâ€™t just about the art but about ancient Stone Age man in general.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cave_of_Forgotten_Dreams" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cave_of_Forgotten_Dreams</a>')
