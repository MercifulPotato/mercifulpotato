This despite the fact that many Western countries have a handful of large, old families which own an inadequate proportion of the companies, resources, have outsized political influence and so on, and those families are almost exclusively in many generations from the country in question. They are as clan-ish as a &#x27;clan&#x27; gets, but since they do not match the &#x27;criminal immigrant&#x27; stereotype, nobody ever calls them a &#x27;clan&#x27;.\nIt irks me.')
