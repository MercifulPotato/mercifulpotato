GPL doesn&#x27;t give you freedom to use the resources of the project. It doesn&#x27;t give you freedom to expect gratis work from developers. It doesn&#x27;t even give you freedom to reuse the name of the project for something else. What it does give you is the freedom to use the given resources as you please, to modify and distribute them however you see fit. The servers of OpenWhisperSystems are not part of these resources, the free time of its developers are not part of these resources.<p>&gt; One doesn’t need to think hard to see what Merlinspike is advising.

The author seems to have discovered that software projects can be run and thrive as authoritarianisms, like Python and Ruby have for so many years: there is one person at the top who has the final word, and they are called BDFL. There are way more projects under this type of management and it works exactly because it is free software: unhappy people can fork the project and propose a new leadership if they want.')
