It&#x27;s not out of spite. On the one hand, it comes from my frustration with what I as an engineer perceive to be wrong advice. It feels to me like OP is using Docker because he read a blog post about it somewhere, never seriously thought about alternatives, then stuck with it and now recommends it to others, repeating a cycle where software gets worse and worse. And on the other hand, being direct is more concise. We all have little time and I feel that to get a point across on the internet, one has to get it across quickly and succinctly. I have no problem with my views being criticised and I&#x27;ll be happy to concede where I was wrong if someone makes a clear and harsh point. But either way, I&#x27;m sorry if I offended you in particular or others who did not comment; It was not my intention. Having read this thread, I think much of the difference of opinion comes from different contexts. People who like Docker often seem to be working in larger teams, which is totally fine and they&#x27;re probably right to use Docker. I just couldn&#x27;t help but disagree with a statement that I felt pertains to an area I work in, which is small SaaS of tiny teams with usually no scalability requirements.')
