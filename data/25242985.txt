A low rolling resistance lightweight XC tire will have significant advantages over a dual casing 2.6&quot; DH tire. The XC tire will smoke a DH tire but not have better longevity on dirt. The XC tire will be slower on some DH tracks and the DH will be slower on XC. If you ride a DH tire on a road it will ironically wear down more quickly than a typical XC tire, and you can shred an XC tire in one day on technical DH.')
