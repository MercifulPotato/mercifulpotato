It invests $10M in R&amp;D to create software. This software will continue to be useful in the future, but per GAAP accounting, it will expense all of the $10M this year. So in year 1, the impact on earnings of this investment is a $10M expense, and the balance sheet reflects nothing.<p>This is wrong. R&amp;D gets capitalized to the extent it has future benefits.<p>&gt; &quot; In addition, let’s say they spend $10M to acquire recurring revenue customers. They will earn revenue from these customers for many years in the future, but many of the costs are expensed immediately.&quot;<p>This is also wrong. Under revenue recognition rule (ASC 606) any costs to acquire customers are recognized on the balance sheet and not expensed immediately.<p>I stopped reading because it&#x27;s clear the author isn&#x27;t writing a factual article.')
