I currently live in a 1br apartment, with a 15 month old and my wife, and yes it is hard when I work from home. Fortunately in my country the pandemic has been handled well, and I am still able to go to my office (25 desks, usually no more than 5 are occupied now).<p>I imagine if we lived in a house, with a garden, enough bedrooms that my work desk isn&#x27;t 2m from my bed, it would be a completely different story. If you don&#x27;t need to go to the office very often then living further out the city would not be that big a deal. In my area a 3br home with a garden is around the same price as a 1br apartment in the city.')
