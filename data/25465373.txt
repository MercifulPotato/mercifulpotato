Darwin award winning dipshits. Plenty of &quot;merely ignorant&quot; people have the common sense required to refrain from shoving grams of factory produced mystery chemicals down their throats because some marketer convinced them it might be a good idea.<p>I realize there is a large contingent of HN numskulls who just luuurb to chime in with a list of their &quot;meds,&quot; for conditions imaginary and otherwise, whose idea of activity is playing video games while subsisting on a diet of microwave pizza rolls. Such people probably got that way in the first place by being coddled, rather than encouraged to not commit slow suicide by remaining inert lumps of dung who think their Jetsons fruit salad is doing them any good. Maybe being confronted with harsh language will save a few of them. Either way, it won&#x27;t hurt them. But hey, that&#x27;s just, like, my opinion man.')
