Thatâ€™s the starting point for this discussion.<p>The only incentive to mine then is to earn the transaction fee. These fees ($8) are currently orders of magnitude smaller than the mining reward of 6.25 coins ($125,000 at $20,000&#x2F;coin). Either fees have to dramatically compensate by <i>rising stratospherically</i> or miners will depart for greener pastures. Yes, difficulty level drops eventually, but by then a large number of users have also followed miners off the network, in which case the price will drop too. As the price collapses, there will be a selling frenzy, further reducing the price. In this scenario, Bitcoin may settle to something as low as $10 per token.<p>Once miners depart en masse, network resilience will drop precipitously. That makes it an attractive target for someone to stage a coordinated attack, which would destroy remaining residual trust in the network and bringing about the end of Bitcoin original.')
