If I had youtube premium and my entire $10 went to only the creators of the videos I watched using some egalitarian algorithm, then I would be into it. However, it is actually more like Spotify where some portion of my $10 (lets say $7, even though it is probably lower) gets put into a large pool and then distributed among all content creators on the site along with everyone else&#x27;s premium money.<p>I have a patreon which I budget $20&#x2F;mo to actually pay the creators that I care about. Don&#x27;t kid yourself into thinking your YT premium money is going anywhere except unboxing videos and Minecraft screaming videos and the like.')
