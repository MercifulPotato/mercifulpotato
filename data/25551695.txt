For each project, I keep an Evernote [1] note. If I ever need to think something through, I&#x27;ll add a new, dated entry at the top and just describe what I&#x27;m doing and considering.<p>This is sometimes useful to refer back to. E.g., to find a specific command, or to remember the factors behind a choice. But honestly, most of the value is that it requires me to linearize and structure my thinking. The advantage to me over self-speech is that I can put something down and pick it up again later. If I take a break and reread an entry, I come at it with a little distance that helps me see things I was missing before.')
