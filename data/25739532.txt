Item(by='orthecreedence', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610407408, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25738999, text='&gt; this is the year that decentralized social media will become mainstream<p>I really hope you&#x27;re right, but I am also very skeptical. For every centralized platform that a community is cut off from, another centralized platform opens to accept them.<p>And then you have decentralized platforms that <i>specifically build in censorship in the stupidest places</i> [0] in an effort to stave off &quot;rightoids.&quot; It seems most of the people building the decentralized platforms aren&#x27;t actually interested in the merits of open communication or free thought, but rather pushing their inconsistent, amorphous identity politics bullshit down everyone&#x27;s throats (and I&#x27;m saying this as a communist). They bring their ruling-class-approved &quot;us vs them&quot; mentality into the platforms they are building and try to force participants to &quot;bend the knee&quot; or be banished. Sure, you can run your own instance, but why would you on a platform where you&#x27;re not sure where you stand? Decentralized social media platforms will need to exercise a bit more tolerance before they see mass adoption.<p>I&#x27;m excited for things like Holochain though, which might help to turn everything on its head.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LemmyNet&#x2F;lemmy&#x2F;pull&#x2F;816" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LemmyNet&#x2F;lemmy&#x2F;pull&#x2F;816</a>')
