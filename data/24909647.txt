It&#x27;s either resistant or it&#x27;s not.<p>Bacteria multiply far far too fast for them to notice multi-day courses of treatment, a bacteria only &quot;notices&quot; the current conditions before it either multiplies or dies.<p>By prolonging medication you wipe out all the susceptible bacteria leaving only the resistant ones. It seems to me that instead we should use just enough antibiotic to keep the patient alive (to turn the corner) and then let the patients immune system do the rest.<p>If I&#x27;m wrong about any of the above, I would love responses explaining why.')
