However, the government has not subsidized the healthcare industry to the point where healthcare is as accessible as food.<p>Healthcare is not just a demand-side issue. There is also constrained supply. I&#x27;d be happy to see the government subsidize supply production (building new medical schools etc) in a similar way that it subsidizes food production.<p>I&#x27;m by no means advocating government negotiation or single-payer or medicare-for-all as the thing the government <i>must</i> do on this issue. I&#x27;m fine with a form of intervention that allows the market forces to go the last mile in this.')
