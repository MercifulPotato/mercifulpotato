We use Python extensively for &#x27;glue&#x27; scripts on my project (build, deployment etc.). It&#x27;s wonderful and convenient for programs that are 10 to 1000 lines long. The result is clear and predictable and maintainable (particularly when compared to a bash script alternative).<p>I would never write a large production app in Python though (having done it a couple of times). The flexibility becomes unwieldy at that scale and you <i>have</i> to have tests that exercise every corner or you&#x27;ll have problems hours or days into running.')
