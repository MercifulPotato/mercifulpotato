No one is stating this is some sort of CIA operation. But the idea that all this stuff just sits collecting dust overlooked in a datacenter forever is naïve. Data is gold, and it&#x27;s traded and monetized at an incredibly high frequency. Your statement that the data is only used in a static fashion for low impact implementation related functions belies the fact that in 2-3 years when the implementing company loses funding and becomes an asset heap some smart PE investor will connect the dots, get the right team together and extract value from the data and sell off the assets.
