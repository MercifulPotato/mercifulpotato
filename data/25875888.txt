Item(by='jpaulmorrison', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611346824, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25848542, text='General comment about the Wikipedia article - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Flow-based_programming" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Flow-based_programming</a> : given all the interesting discussion on the &#x27;Net, including this thread, it might be time to update the Wikipedia article.<p>The most substantive addition in recent years is Akaigoro&#x27;s comment about Actors, added Jan. 2020 (@guitarvydas, care to jump in?!), preceeded, I think, by Joe Witt&#x27;s reference to NiFi in mid-2018.  This general lack of activity I feel might lead readers to assume that FBP is an outdated concept, whereas this thread proves it&#x27;s definitely alive and kicking! I, personally, am not allowed to update the article, due to the WP ban on self-promotion, so I would like to encourage people to add topics, controversies, anything, to the WP article...  Freshen it up a bit, as it were!  Thanks, and stay safe, everyone!')
