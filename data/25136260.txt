So I understand that a Dentist may sometimes say: Just suck it up, who are you to judge that life should be without pain entirely? Still, I do believe you should be entitled to make your own choices but the physician should educate you before you do so, imho.<p>I am from the Netherlands where natural birth without painkillers is also still the norm. You can always opt for them and cesarean but one should know that numbing everything away and taking the kid through a newly cut hole also has its downsides (studies show). Spoken like a true man ;) Seriously, I&#x27;m not judging, just sayin&#x27;.')
