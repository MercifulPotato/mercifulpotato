We have mega-churches and weddings of thousands of people. We have governors and other local leaders who STILL refuse to wear masks in public. We have states allowing large public sporting events. We have representatives and entertainment news networks pushing laughable conspiracy theories at an alarming volume - all of which empower and support the anti-mask movement. We have grown adults throwing temper tantrums in private businesses for having to wear a mask.<p>That masks and covid prevention measures became politicized at all will be one of the greatest shames of our generation.')
