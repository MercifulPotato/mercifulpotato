You might think the service isnt worth it but it&#x27;s not market manipulation.<p>&gt;Bailing out greed isn&#x27;t?<p>That one usually isn&#x27;t (most bailouts are other  private actors&#x27; loans) but yes, I guess it can be if it allows actors to make risky plays without having real risk.<p>That said, what WSB is doing here isn&#x27;t market manipulation either.')
