If you are wondering if contributing will be a problem because you don&#x27;t know Haskell: no, it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue, especially in this early stage! Right now most valuable for us is getting insights into what features are missing, what we could do better, how to make Wasp + JS&#x2F;React experience better, and how we can generate Javascript code in a better way.<p>Best way to start is by taking a look at the Todo app tutorial and possibly joining us on Discord to stay in touch!')
