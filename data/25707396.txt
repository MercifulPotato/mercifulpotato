Item(by='esoterica', descendants=None, kids=[25708078], score=None, time=1610242014, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25700088, text='&gt; (which also isn&#x27;t even a legislative concept)<p>What do &quot;legislative&quot; concepts have to do with the judiciary? You&#x27;re just throwing around random jargon you don&#x27;t understand.<p>&gt; but not all claims were on the face of it crazy.<p>All the fraud claims were crazy. Every single one of them.<p>&gt;  allowing interrogation of serious claims in court<p>Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but I don&#x27;t think a single plaintiff with standing (i.e. Trump or another candidate who allegedly lost a race due to fraud) ever litigated a voter fraud claim in court. Do you know why? Because no serious government lawyer is willing to destroy their reputation by litigating obviously frivolous claims. All the fraud claims were litigated by 3rd party cranks with no standing, hence their dismissal on &quot;procedural grounds&quot;. The only lawsuits initiated by Trump or other candidates directly were procedural ones (e.g. complaining about whether or not certain deadlines were changed legally), NOT fraud related. If no one with standing wants to put their reputation on the line to litigate nonsense fraud claims then it is not the fault of the courts that the fraud claims cannot be properly evaluated.<p>&gt; Nothing was stopping the Supreme Court from hearing the (e.g.) Texas v. Pennsylvania lawsuit; it&#x27;s up to the court itself to decide standing<p>Yes there was, it&#x27;s called federalism. Texas doesn&#x27;t get a say in how Pennsylvania holds its elections. Texas v. Pennsylvania also had absolutely nothing to do with fraud. Texas was just complaining about changes PA made to PA state election laws. And again, the SCOTUS response was, correctly, &quot;fuck off, state&#x27;s rights&quot;.<p>&gt; If they are groundless, great; many people will recognize that and you will increase confidence in the results.<p>This is extraordinarily naive. There is no evidence of fraud and every single non-brainwashed person is already aware of that. The ONLY reason why so many people believe fraud happened is because Donald Trump says so, and a large fraction of the population treat him as an infallible cult leader. It doesn&#x27;t matter how many cases the courts rule on and how thoroughly everything crank theory is investigated. The Trump cult will just claim the courts are controlled by the deep state pedophiles.')
