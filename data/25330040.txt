Item(by='camgunz', descendants=None, kids=[25335704], score=None, time=1607325421, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25326831, text='&gt; I disagree that the right way to approach [encouraging entrepreneurship] is by focusing on underserved groups. The right way to approach it is to make it easy for anyone to start a business.<p>The numbers are real bad though [1] [2] [3]. White people own 80% of small businesses, and men own 64%. In 2012 (admittedly old but, the Census site is very bad) white men owned 2,933,198 firms with employees on the payroll. Everyone else owned 356,816 firms. Those same white men&#x27;s firms had sales receipts of $8,221,010,815. Other firms had $88,657,443. That&#x27;s <i>nuts</i>. Even more so when you consider white men are only ~33% of Americans. My guess is that COVID-19 makes this even worse, but who knows really.<p>&gt; The unfortunate reality is that you will never be able to pick from a menu of all possible career options because you (whoever you are) are not cut out for all possible careers. There are many people in the world who are better suited to doing job X, even if you think you&#x27;d like to do job X more.<p>I 100% agree but, I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s unfortunate. I just think people should get equal pay for equal work, and CEOs aren&#x27;t 270x more valuable than average workers. Maybe it&#x27;s 5x, maybe even 10x, but not 270x. And that&#x27;s salary difference, we&#x27;re not even factoring in lifetime earnings.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;23&#x2F;the-financial-risk-to-u-s-business-owners-posed-by-covid-19-outbreak-varies-by-demographic-group&#x2F;ft_2020-04-23_smallbusinessowners_01a&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;23&#x2F;the-financi...</a><p>[2]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.experian.com&#x2F;whitepapers&#x2F;BOLStudy_Experian.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.experian.com&#x2F;whitepapers&#x2F;BOLStudy_Experian.pdf</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.census.gov&#x2F;cedsci&#x2F;table?tid=SBOCS2012.SB1200CSA01&amp;hidePreview=true" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;data.census.gov&#x2F;cedsci&#x2F;table?tid=SBOCS2012.SB1200CSA...</a>')
