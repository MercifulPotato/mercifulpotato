Even though they did space mining there is no way they would be able to put all that in place without RLVs. IIRC they even show them a couple times, basically big NASP like SSTO aerospaceplanes.<p>They also have regular transcontinental flights going through space, even though its IIRC not clear if its sub orbital ballistic trajectories or FOBS like partial orbit ones.<p>Still, many would-be hard SF films get this completely wrong - huge space stations and&#x2F;or interplanetary spaceships yet they launch it all on rather dated looking expandable boosters!<p>Already The Martian it&#x27;s pushing is pushing it with using basically improved EELVs (launched by ULA, none the less!) yet having hundreds if not thousands of tons of equipment and propelant in place.<p>Interstellar or Ad Astra is bad shit insane - dinky ELVs and multiple interplanetary colonization attempts and humongous space ship in the former and KFC &amp; artillery fireballs on the Moon in the former. And Ad Astra even has booster stages being dropped when launching from Mars because hey, why not waste even more resources!')
