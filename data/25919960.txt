Item(by='wombatmobile', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611688629, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25915615, text='&gt; My intuition is that most animals can’t or don’t distinguish much in what life they feed on and so if they eat humans, it’s simply according to nature and not problematic in the least.<p>I agree with the second part of your statement, and also much of the first part, sort of... but what I&#x27;m about to write may at first glance sound like a snarky gotcha.  That&#x27;s not my intention at all.  It is an informed, educated view, and I don&#x27;t like it any more than you might, because it bursts an illusion, at least for now.<p>Firstly, I think animals can distinguish what they eat in a very sophisticated way.  At least as sophisticated as humans.  Animals, after all, feed themselves with their own energy, guile and knowledge.  They don&#x27;t rely on supermarkets like many humans do, so they know exactly what is going on.<p>I am mostly vegan, because I prefer vegan food.  When I eat animals on occasion, I do it in the same spirit you described in your consideration of animals who kill humans and other animals for food.  It is part of nature, and I can embrace that.<p>You also said this is &quot;a choice&quot;.  Ethically, morally, spiritually, and out of shared interest, I can agree with you.  However, I learned something recently from a radio show that followed a group of people who set up on virgin land, trying to be self-sufficient.  What they found is important for our discussion.<p>It isn&#x27;t possible for everyone who wants to live self-sufficiently to grow enough protein to survive.  The soil in most places, and the climate won&#x27;t support it.  In order to live as a pure vegan, we need supermarkets and globalism, or at the very least, food transit on a global scale.  Those giant South American soy plantations are built on destroyed forest habitat.  :-(<p>The people in the radio documentary had to grow animals in order to obtain protein to survive.  When they ate those animals, they did it with profound respect and understanding for the value of life, having raised the animals themselves.  I&#x27;ve heard conventional farmers speak this way about animal lives too.  It&#x27;s something I think we need to understand and come to grips with intellectually, because the pure choice some people have of going vegan, is not a choice for everyone on the planet, at least, not with current technology and environmental constraints.')
