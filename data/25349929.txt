I was recently looking at an item that is sold by a shop in Texas, and after chatting with the owner I learned their stuff is just made in China in a factory. They’re just reselling the stuff at a healthy markup. Is that allowed now? I thought it was all supposed to be handmade or vintage or whatever?')
