I asked an audiologist\n  about the prevalence of T-coil equipped hearing aids.  She told me most\n  users prefer small and rechargeable.  There is not much space in the unit\n  and rechargeable would likely be selected.  So, the T-coil does not get\n  included.  She thought T-coil units were common in Europe.\n\n  There are special amplifiers to drive the audio loop.  The makers don&#x27;t\n  tell us much about them.  I think we would call those transconductance\n  amplifiers.  Reading the subject article is encouraging.  Perhaps we\n  will just try this after the virus is not such a threat.</code></pre>')
