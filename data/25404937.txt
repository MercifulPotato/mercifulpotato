Item(by='brewdad', descendants=None, kids=[25408145], score=None, time=1607844180, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25404511, text='When allowing for a reasonable margin of error, speeding is also one of the fairer ways of enforcing traffic offenses. Anyone can be inattentive and touch a wheel to the lane line once. If it happens repeatedly, the driver is likely distracted or impaired. but one time can be a simple mistake that doesn&#x27;t require intervention unless it leads to a crash or other conflict.<p>A driver exceeding the speed limit by 20%, to throw out a number, isn&#x27;t likely to do so as a one-off mistake unless he misses a signed change in the speed limit. If exceeding by 20% was a one-off under an unchanged speed limit, it most likely means the driver was already exceeding the speed limit by 10-15% as a matter of course. I am much more comfortable with a driver being cited in this case.')
