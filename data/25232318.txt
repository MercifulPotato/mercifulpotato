No clear indication how to return to my profile.<p>- After some time I realized I need to click on Start Writing to access my dashboard. Ok, but I really think that should have a clear indication if I am already logged in.<p>- In dashboard post listing would be useful to have something indicating which posts are published. And for each post, a button allowing me to quick publish it or &quot;unpublish&quot; (make private again).<p>- If I am reading a published post and I am already logged in, add a link somewhere to allow quick access to editing mode.<p>Thank you!')
