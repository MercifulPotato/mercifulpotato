There&#x27;s a reason jargon is such a big deal in the corporate world - words have power.<p>Consider this - if it <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> a civil rights issue, would there be so much discomfort and&#x2F;or backlash around it? Would it even be a big deal at all if it <i>didn&#x27;t</i> matter?<p>Again, I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s straightforward - it&#x27;s not.<p>But a quick google search says civil rights are &quot;the rights of citizens to political and social freedom and equality.&quot;<p>So that&#x27;s pretty complex and broad in and of itself.')
