They knew of an investor that wanted to own more shares and brokered a price that was well above the most recent 409a, so I was able to exercise everything and sell off exactly enough to cover the tax consequences of my &quot;gain.&quot;  Not only did it let me exercise options to get stock without having to come up with a bunch of cash, but it gave me more confidence that I actually <i>wanted</i> the stock.  Very cool move on the company&#x27;s part, in my opinion.  I have no idea how common this is.')
