Item(by='dTal', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611251544, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25847264, text='BASIC, for explaining the fundamentals of imperative programming. Its weakness as a &quot;real&quot; language is its strength as a training language.<p>Then Scheme, once they feel straightjacketed with BASIC; it will teach them what abstraction is and how to break code into chunks. It should be a bit of a lightbulb moment. They also get a type system.<p>Finally, Julia, once they get sick of the parentheses and difficulty of building &quot;real&quot; programs (you&#x27;ll do a lot of DIY FFI to use standard libraries in Scheme). From this they will also learn array programming and the idea of a type hierarchy.<p>The only trouble with this curriculum is the student will be completely ruined for ever programming in C or Java. They will not have learned to tolerate the requisite level of tedium, or even programming without a REPL.')
