Visualize at a glance the plants that need something, in the form of a list, a calendar or a timeline. Configure the amount of water and how often you want to water each of your plants.\n-   Never forget to add fertilizer to your plants again.\n-   Never forget again which plant you need to spray.\n-   Set up a photo album for each of your plants to track their growth over time.\n-   Remember your dead plants.\n-    Assign a room in your house to each plant, so you know which room is where which plant is in.\n-   Display a scoreboard so you can see your oldest, most expensive plants, those that need the least light or water.\n-   Keep a journal to keep track of the most important events. If you move a plant, make a note of it: if it doesn&#x27;t look good afterwards, you will remember it.<p>You will also have access to the documentation, the FAQ, the rodmap and the changelog.<p>PS: You can have the template at -50% with the code halfpricelaunch.
