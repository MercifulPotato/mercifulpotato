As far as I can tell, it is. (Funding a reputable journalistic organization is entirely consistent with &quot;broadcasting the benefits of freedom&quot;, and doing the opposite would probably undermine those goals.)<p>The person who started this thread is trying to discount an RFA report solely because of the source.
