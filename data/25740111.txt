Item(by='AnthonyMouse', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610409517, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25739845, text='&gt; It is “axiomatic,” the Supreme Court held in Norwood v. Harrison (1973), that the government “may not induce, encourage or promote private persons to accomplish what it is constitutionally forbidden to accomplish.” That’s what Congress did by enacting Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which not only permits tech companies to censor constitutionally protected speech but immunizes them from liability if they do so.<p>I don&#x27;t buy this part exactly. The existence of Section 230 on its own doesn&#x27;t require or induce them to censor any speech in particular. It&#x27;s content-neutral.<p>But when public officials then make demands for censorship under threat of adverse regulatory changes, well, that&#x27;s &quot;induce, encourage or promote private persons to accomplish what it is constitutionally forbidden to accomplish&quot; then isn&#x27;t it?')
