Better learn the Java eco-system.<p>UNIX was written in Assembly for the PDP-7, C only came into play when they ported it to the PDP-11 and UNIX V6 was the first release where most of the code was finally written in C.<p>IBM i, z&#x2F;OS or Unisys ClearPath in 2020, have completly different hardware than when they appeared in 1988, 1967 and 1961 respectively, yet PL&#x2F;S, PL&#x2F;X and NEWP are still heavily used on them. Looks like portable code to me.<p>Mac OS, you know the predecessor for macOS, was written in Object Pascal, even though eventually Apple added support for C and C++, which than made C++ with PowerPlant the way to code on the Mac, not C.<p>BeOS, Symbian were written in C++, not C.<p>Outside of the kernel space, Windows and OS&#x2F;2 always favoured C++ and nowadays Windows 10 is a mix of .NET, .NET Native (on UWP) and C++ (kernel supports C++ code since Windows Vista).<p>NeXT used Objective-C in the kernel, that&#x27;s right, NeXT drivers were written in Objective-C. Only the BSD&#x2F;Mach stuff used C.<p>macOS replaced the Objective-C driver framework with IO Kit, based on Embedded C++ again not C. Nowadays with userspace drivers the C++ framework is called DriverKit in homage to the original Objective-C NeXT framework.<p>Arduino and ARM mbed are written in C++, not C.<p>Android uses C only for the Linux kernel, everything else is a mix of Java and C++, and since Project Treble you can even write drivers in Java, just like in Android Things allowed to since version 1.0.<p>Safe Ada is used alongside C++ on the GenodeOS research project.<p>Inferno, the last iteration of the hacker beloved Plan 9, uses C on the kernel and the complete userspace makes use of Limbo.<p>F-Secure, you might have heard of them, has their own bare metal Go implementation for writing firmware and is used in production via the Armory products.<p>IBM used PL.8 to write a LLVM like compiler toolchain and OS during their RISC research and only pivoted to Aix, because that was what the market wanted RISC for.<p>Contrary to the cargo cult that Multics was a failure, the OS continued without wihtout Bell Labs and was even assessed to be more secure by DOJ thanks to its use of PL&#x2F;I instead of C.<p>There is so much to the world of operating systems than the tunnel vision of UNIX and C.')
