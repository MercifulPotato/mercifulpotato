They could charge the review fee and that&#x27;s it. If they wanted more money they could charge data transfer fee similar to Amazon&#x27;s S3. The 30% or 15% has no justification and it is just a cash grab because app developers can&#x27;t go to an alternative app store with better terms. I am hoping that EU will stop this abuse.')
