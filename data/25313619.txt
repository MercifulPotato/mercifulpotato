The best notebook I&#x27;ve ever bought was&#x2F;is the HP EliteBook 2530p; it runs 12 hours on battery, more than I need for my work day. I bought a new one in 2009 and a couple of used ones and parts since then. Most of my software and firmware development happens on this machine (Linux i386; I also have to support macOS though). It always works, never had downtime (I can replace parts within minutes if need be). Even Netflix works. And of course also all the embedded systems I produce are 32 bit, about half of them with Linux (the others are microcontrollers).')
