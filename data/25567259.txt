When it&#x27;s 100% unit that are below market rate, it gets blocked. When it&#x27;s 50% BMR, it gets blocked. When it&#x27;s 20%, it gets blocked.<p>This is because the true position of Progressives is that any development has a chance to cause harm, and they prefer the current situation to any harm, in a messed up form of the trolley problem.<p>I would also urge you to capitalize the P, as the Progressive positions in SF are not really recognizable as progressive in most of the US or world. It&#x27;s more of a factional battle in the culture war than about what are more generally agreed to be progressive values.')
