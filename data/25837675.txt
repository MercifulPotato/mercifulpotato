I said &#x27;moral principle&#x27;, not &#x27;absolute&#x27;, and you continue to refer to &#x27;the law&#x27;.  You&#x27;re not distinguishing between the laws the government decides upon, and the moral principles we use to evaluate good laws and bad ones.<p>From the outset, I said that there is a difference between saying that freedom of speech is something the government allocates to us, and something which the government ought to allow.  Do you think the government gets to decide what we are, and are not, allowed to say?')
