I&#x27;ve built infrastructure for multiple companies on top of AWS Lambda.  Usually bog-standard REST endpoints in Node or Python.  There are a few weird bits and a few &quot;huhs&quot; (DB connection timeouts after a Lambda wakes up from sleep) but that&#x27;s true of most systems.<p>True, we were only doing a few req&#x2F;s but Lambda was easy to setup&#x2F;use and was mostly maintenance free.
