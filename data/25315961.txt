Item(by='modzu', descendants=None, kids=[25316485, 25316441, 25317678], score=None, time=1607187101, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25313268, text='this made me think about my car&#x27;s infotainment UI (typically have android auto running) and how annoying it is that much of it locks while the car is in motion. searching for an address in waze, accessing a text message, etc. even worse is some things work for a few seconds (scrolling down my list of songs) before it locks and says &quot;eyes back on the road... wait a minute&quot;, and unlocks again. this is terrible when i have a  passenger who could help (could you search for a gas station, or please reply to that message we will be late) which requires <i>pulling over</i>. whats more safe on a freeway? it sort of reminds me of red light cameras, which have been proven to cause drivers to burn through yellows at 100 miles an hour (increasing crashes on the other side) to avoid the fine for what would otherwise be a minor issue. i digress..')
