Nobody complains about the TGV&#x2F;Shinkansen&#x2F;ICE being slow.<p>Building a new train line cost millions of â‚¬&#x2F;$ per km&#x2F;mi because you need to expropriate properties, build tunnels and bridges, fine tune the tracks (any small distortion in the tracks will cause significant annoyance for the travelers). Hyperloop will have all these issues, but worse, as the speed is higher, and as the hyperloop trains will not be able to run on existing tracks.')
