My rough calculation is something like 5 MA(in each conductor, spaced by 1mm) would do the trick, assuming that much current and B don&#x27;t interfere with superconductivity (I have no idea).<p>Looks like the highest current ever achieved is 100 kA. A mere 100 fold increase and we should be good to go.')
