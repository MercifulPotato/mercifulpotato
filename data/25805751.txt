So Ruby had a beautiful simple syntax, and I think Groovy was an experiment to see how close you could get to that while maintaining compatibility with Java syntax. It&#x27;s actually a remarkable success as far as it goes - most Java code can be copy and pasted in and is valid Groovy. But of course it only works because it optionally accepts parentheses, explicit vs implicit arguments etc.<p>It does lead though to one of the biggest lies which is &quot;if you know Java then you already know Groovy!&quot; - that&#x27;s just a mean trick to play on people.')
