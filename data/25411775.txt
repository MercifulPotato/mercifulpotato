There are hovering diacritics and proofing marks everywhere!<p>It does real-time syntax checking and quick compilation to check interfaces (at least with TypeScript, JS, HTML, pug, css, Vue, and NodeJS).<p>I resisted fancy editors for years, as I found them crazy annoying, but over the past few months I&#x27;ve grown to adore VSCode because it has made me about 50% more efficient: I don&#x27;t have to run the app to find errors, the IDE finds them for me, and it works on Win10, macOS and Linux. It is extremely context aware of my project.<p>It&#x27;s like JetBrains but free (or Android Developer Studio, also made by JetBrains...).')
