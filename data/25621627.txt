Didn&#x27;t look like it. What about udev? Why did systemd devs have to pick the slack on that too?<p>Is is perhaps because the other init systems are only willing to touch a very narrow definition of init while depending on rotten, unmaintained pieces of the ecosystem like consolekit without being able&#x2F;willing to maintain it themselves?<p>Or perhaps the plan is to let systemd folks do that while shitting on it so we can cook up a 600 LoC &#x27;minimal init&#x27; while outsourcing a whole lot to systemd maintainers while taunting our minimalism?')
