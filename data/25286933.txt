So it isn&#x27;t just slow and unreliable, the real humongous cherry on top is that it has very short lifetime enforced by automatic deprovisioning - thus even when you finally were able to spin up our platform - which is far from guaranteed and may take many attempts as the platform is the product what we&#x27;re developing, and it naturally has issues, etc. - and now you&#x27;re happy and ready to start working on it, and at that moment it all disappears because of that short lifetime enforcing automated deprovisioning. Thus not surprisingly the results are exactly as you described - despite the management running around chanting cloud!cloud!cloud! our products&#x27; cloud story has so far made it practically nowhere .')
