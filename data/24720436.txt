Same with CRKT.<p>I&#x27;ve taken a &quot;buy good knives&quot; stance. My favorite is definitely not cheap, but it gets a ton of carry time. I&#x27;d also hate myself if I lost it lol<p>But if you&#x27;re the type to carry a knife, a good knife goes a long way and getting a knife steel on it that can last is also a good way to go. Modern super steels are insane.')
