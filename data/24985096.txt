I can agree with you in this case because I&#x27;ve got the Brother DCP-L2540DW. I got it on sale for $99 CAD (~$75 USD) when it was still the newest model available. I&#x27;m using the stock cartridge still, though I have a refill purchased and ready to go in case it&#x27;s not possible to buy one when the original powder runs out.<p>This line of Brother printers is indeed good. It&#x27;s impossible to say whether this applies generally to any laser printer, or to any Brother laser printer, or if we were simply lucky to have picked up these particular models.')
