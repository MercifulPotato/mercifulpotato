For it to succeed, a\nproper enabling environment must be put in place to guide, encourage and nudge change across the\norganisation.\nThe strategy and the action plan are inextricably linked. The pivotal point will be an Open Source\nProgramme Office that enjoys genuine political and organisational support, involving all directoratesgeneral. The Office will act as facilitator for all activities outlined in the strategy and the action plan. It\nwill assist subject-matter experts, encourage the directorates-general and help balance internal focus and\nexternal activities.\nAs domain leader for IT, DIGIT will be responsible for setting up and running the Programme Office.\nThis will allow it to set priorities, measure outcomes and report on progress.\nDIGIT will make an annual budget request for the Programme Office and the action plan, to be reviewed\nand approved through the normal budgetary procedures. Using the existing corporate IT governance\nstructures, DIGIT will report on, monitor and review the action plan, and deliver a mid-term review of\nprogress and implementation of the strategy.<p>Interesting nontheless')
