One is almost certainly fabricated, or at least heavily rewritten by later Christians.<p>&gt; For eyewitness, you can find first person account in the New Testaments.<p>The Gospels aren&#x27;t first person accounts. The closest you get to first person accounts of Jesus in the NT are brief mentions of Paul&#x27;s conversion experiences in his epistles. The Gospels probably draw on first person accounts to some extent, but they themselves aren&#x27;t first person accounts.<p>There&#x27;s a very strong case to be made for the historicity of Jesus, but you make a misleading one by leaving out some very important context regarding Josephus and mischaracterizing the accounts of Jesus in the NT.')
