I&#x27;ve seen Contact several times, and nothing struck me as odd about this mirror scene until this article pointed out the obvious.  Or maybe I become to engrossed in the story to notice these types of artifacts?  Anyone have another favorite instance of subtle(?) movie making magic that a casual observer might have overlooked?  And I wonder if the filmmakers would consider that good or bad that I missed this ingenious tidbit.')
