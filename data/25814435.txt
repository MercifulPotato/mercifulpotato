Are you also commenting how you can&#x27;t see the source of your phone&#x27;s baseband, Google&#x27;s services, your ISP&#x27;s router firmware, WhatsApp&#x27;s servers, Facebook&#x27;s service&#x27;s, etc?<p>Because Signal&#x27;s client is open source it&#x27;s considered a unique-to-Signal downside that we don&#x27;t have access to the server&#x27;s source. I feel like some people would bring up the server source issue if someone was asking if it would be a good idea to migrate off of Facebook Messenger.')
