Also: a phone without a microphone will be of limited utility on calls. ;-)<p>The only way to be sure these devices aren&#x27;t listening to you is to not have one at all. Or, as the person in this article did, take it apart and de-cap the chips to make sure.<p>In the case of smart phones, I think it&#x27;s a mistake to assume that switching some of these functions off in the settings will actually have the desired effect: preventing the phone from recording audio without making the owner aware of this recording.')
