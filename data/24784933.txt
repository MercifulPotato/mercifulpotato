No DNA sequence is more likely than any other to exist.<p>I think that means we need to identify strong physical processes that produce useful DNA strands; you, apparently, aren&#x27;t as concerned about it. Maybe you&#x27;re right, but from where I&#x27;m sitting, it&#x27;s hard to imagine what those physical processes might be since the strands they must produce are extremely, unimaginably rare in practice.<p>DNA is basically information[0], and we literally have no example of a chemical process producing valid DNA information, nor is it all obvious how such a process might work in practice. In the past, large amounts of time + equal likelihood of producing random DNA was considered sufficient to think &quot;well, <i>useful</i> DNA stands could appear randomly.&quot; We now know that&#x27;s extremely unlikely to the point of being effectively impossible, statistically-speaking.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;scitable&#x2F;topicpage&#x2F;dna-is-a-structure-that-encodes-biological-6493050&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;scitable&#x2F;topicpage&#x2F;dna-is-a-structure...</a>')
