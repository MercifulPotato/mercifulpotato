Item(by='pierrec', descendants=None, kids=[24791577], score=None, time=1602777654, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24787852, text='I&#x27;ve been keeping notes on all the browser-based audio playgrounds I come across, should probably make a review of them all at some point. In the meantime here&#x27;s the list: Estuary, Zupiter, Synthesine, Gibber, Slang, Beepbox... (missing some since my notes are disorganized)<p>They range from unfinished toys to epic environments. Also my project AudioMasher is supposed to be the latter. This seems to do one thing well (FM synthesis for effects) which is probably a much better idea!')
