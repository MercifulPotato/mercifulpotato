Because memory access times are inherently more or less nondeterministic.<p>I consider it to be roughly as important as being able to reorder instructions across non statically determined branches and function calls. And both of these expose the fundamental weakness in explicit VLIW, if it&#x27;s essentially nondeterministic it cannot be taken advantage of.<p>Then we naturally have some other benefits, like hyperthreading. Which basically is just compiling two instruction streams together on the fly.')
