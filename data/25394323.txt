Clearly <i>abilities</i> depend on economic factors. I interpret this thread&#x27;s root comment to refer to <i>capabilities</i>. To add more anecdotes to the mix, I work with a few Africans on a daily basis and they are highly talented, more so than myself. Perhaps this is skewed by immigration; that would lead me to believe that intrinsic capabilities approximately average out between the continents and hence my agreement with the root comment.')
