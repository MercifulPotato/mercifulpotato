Especially for beginners.<p>But as a counter-example:<p>I&#x27;ve done most of those &quot;types of vim porn&quot; I guess, then moved to spacemacs, then my own custom emacs&#x2F;evil setup. Always with some similar window manager and command line tweaking as well.<p>Probably spent a hundred hours on all this kind of thing easily, in a small number of big bursts.<p>Over 20 years.<p>During which time I&#x27;ve had a very comfortable, understandable, debuggable and pleasant dev environment that made development, testing, documenting, debugging and planning a thing I can just work on without really thinking about the tools. Switching between the files, the command line, the failed tests, the docs,  the repls and the browser tabs as fast as my eyes move.<p>I don&#x27;t need to break out that one efficiency-tradeoff XKCD either because while it was definitely mathematically worth it time-wise, there is no question the wins were happiness-wise and not-swearing-at-my-tools-wise (just the project code).<p>Learning to type was probably a better ROI, can&#x27;t think of what else is in the ballpark though.')
