Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603982488, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24930292, text='&gt; I wonder if a better solution would be allowing people to really own digital goods they buy the way you do physical copyrighted goods.<p>the situation with blurays and dvds is not much better. &quot;own&quot; is not quite the right word for what&#x27;s going on here; it&#x27;s more like a permanent transferable license. you can freely buy&#x2F;sell them second-hand, but AFAIK it is technically still illegal to make backups, even for personal use (since it involves circumventing DRM).<p>as both a long-time torrenter and someone who works on proprietary software project, I&#x27;m somewhat conflicted on this topic. for the consumer, it&#x27;s best to just get the product unencumbered by DRM and do what you want with it. on the flip side, I really need people to actually pay for the thing that I work on so I can get an income. not all pirated copies are &quot;lost sales&quot;, but some are. I&#x27;ve certainly pirated stuff that I would have paid for and paid for stuff only because it wasn&#x27;t cracked yet. not sure what the middle ground is here.<p>sadly, I&#x27;m not sure the average person even cares that much. I follow a couple specific TV shows where I&#x27;m invested in what happens next. with the current balkanization, it would probably cost me $50+ a month to have access to the handful of things I actually want to watch. but most people I know just want <i>something</i> to watch, often just to have it playing in the background. they don&#x27;t particularly care what it is or if it was well-made.')
