If you wanted to reach many people and not in print, you <i>had</i> to be on them. As you note, this is no longer the case.<p>The resource you want access to is, variously, either the internet itself or (e.g.) Signal&#x27;s audience. You don&#x27;t need Signal for the former, and you don&#x27;t have any constitutional or moral right to the latter.')
