So Microsoft should&#x27;ve sent Guido van Rossum a note saying, hey study algorithm&#x2F;DS for at least a month and do 100 leetcode before you come talk to us or it&#x27;s a waste of time, thanks, bye.<p>Discussions of the industry tech interview process are now poisoned by these factors:<p>* There is an entire industry built around tech interview prep now (books, websites, practice&#x2F;mock interviews).  Many would defend this practice because their paycheck directly depends on it.<p>* Many see this as a hazing ritual that protects their high compensation and often their egos as well.  These people are often young and will eventually see how harmful these interviews are when they get older and need to switch jobs.  But by then there will be a new generation of young engineers defending the practice.')
