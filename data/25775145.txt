Item(by='jura12', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610624016, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25774484, text='&gt; Are students at Stanford Business School really so far below the 95th percentile nationally?<p>In my previous big bank company we had some tests for our internal business school. Tests were mostly IQ type so the result was that, in the first few years, school was filled mostly with IT people. Later they changed tests (e.g. live case study test) so more business people did manage to go to the business school. So I guess, the answer would be yes :)')
