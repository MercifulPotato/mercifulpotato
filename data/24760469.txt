But I personally make use of a lot of keyboard shortcuts and find that they make my process not necessarily faster but seamless. I don’t have to think of how to do something as my muscle memory translates the intent into command. That also helps not break my context by using the mouse, opening a menu, etc so it keeps me in my creative&#x2F;productive zone. So the typing speed is not necessarily the productivity boost we need but the seamlessness of the process I think. If you’re using emacs for example the typing speed may also hold you back a bit if you’re slow.')
