The excitement was quickly replaced by sober frustration.<p>Yes apple did a remarkable job with the M1, no they&#x27;ve still lost their mojo when it comes to high quality software.<p>I&#x27;ve spend the last 3 hours trying the wipe and reinstall the thing, because their non-virgin-os migration assistant is simply unreliable.<p>So far, I&#x27;ve had issues where the fused Data&#x2F;OS drive would just split apart, with no clear way on how to properly format the drive back to an installable state. Disk utility giving no indication whatsoever on which level of nested APFS concepts a wipe should even occur. And with absurd error messages like &quot;can&#x27;t install MacOs, no admin user found&quot; - &#x27;yeah no shit&#x27;, during install.\nI really really really wanna like this machine, but MacOs is stuck in this limbo of not wanting to give you any control, yet not taking over those functions for you, so you constantly have to guess what&#x27;s doable and expected.<p>Update:\nRight now I&#x27;m trying to reinstall Mac Os via a bootable USB drive, which is actually what&#x27;s recommended by apple support. (hello mid 2000s)<p>This is basically my last option, before having to bring it into an apple store.<p>The previous method apple recommended involved downloading Big Sur via the command line, which didn&#x27;t work for me, becaue curl failed to write to disk.<p>I mean, how do you even manage to break curl...<p>Feels just as much work as settung up a linux laptop...')
