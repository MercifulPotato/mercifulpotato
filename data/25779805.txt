Item(by='908B64B197', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610647737, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25770134, text='&gt; Pretty sure expats are included in Gini calculations.<p>I meant European nationals living in the US. Pretty sure the salary distribution would be different between &quot;Software Engineers in France&quot; and &quot;French Software Engineers&quot; as the second includes all expats living in the Bay Area...<p>&gt; I should also say, just because you raise money in the bay doesn&#x27;t mean you have to run your business in the bay. Should you choose to do so remotely, you&#x27;ll like take a bit of a discount, but it&#x27;s worth mentioning this year&#x27;s YC class was entirely remote.<p>Had there not been a global pandemic would that have been the case?')
