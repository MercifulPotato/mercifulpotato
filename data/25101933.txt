I think the division is good.  There&#x27;s no reason people in the valley should have to live by the cultural rules of the people in Jackson Mississippi or vice versa.  That&#x27;s exactly what happens right now under our political system.  The US has at least two distinct cultures and the more they grow to despise one another the sooner we can have an amicable divorce and allow each group to live freely.  There can never be mutual respect when we toggle back and forth between who is forcing their will on the other.')
