GObject and COM are object systems that have C implementations.<p>I suppose it’s a mental thing when you’re “below” the abstract object system instead of getting to treat them as tangible things unto themselves. Like how C doesn’t really have strings — they’re pointers or structs and so you don’t get any sort of encapsulation that’s not enforced by convention. You have to maintain the invariants or only use methods that maintain them.')
