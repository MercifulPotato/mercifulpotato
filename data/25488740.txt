No dynDNS server, no ports forwarding, not inspecting what is wrong, not even blocking internet for certain MAC addresses. And when I asked if I can just buy my own modem, they said that whenever there is a problem and you have your own modem, they will charge you a fee PER DEVICE that is connected (how would they even now if I use my own modem?).\n Quite overwhelming for me who just ALWAYS just buys and configures Fritz!Boxes anytime I need to setup a new internet connection somewhere.<p>Here we have the richest country in the world, inventor of the internet with the most innovative tech companies with the absolute worst internet experience among developed countries: Overpriced, bad quality of service and zero flexibility. Customers are treated like absolute dummies, it is a totally different world. And Germany is actually quite bad compared to asian countries.')
