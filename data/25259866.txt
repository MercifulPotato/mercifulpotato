Pickup trucks are popular for some subcultures and some forms of professional work, and will always be needed and will never go away.  Mainframes &#x2F; trains have morphed into datacenters, but are functionally similar. None of these form factors will go away, except maybe minicomputers, but the vast majority of the populace will move onto the smallest safest thing, unless they need the extra space that a pickup truck gives them :)')
