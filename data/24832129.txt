Every device I&#x27;ve tried connects and loads the drivers without issue (including a macbook).<p>Aside, I really wish Google hadn&#x27;t removed the Print options from Android&#x2F;Chrome.  Being able to buy tickets and send them to my printer from my phone was awesome... having to save&#x2F;share links and go to my desktop to print something, less so.  I know I can often show a code on my phone, but there are times and places where wifi and mobile connections aren&#x27;t reliable.<p>Not really in favor of HP over other mfg&#x27;s, only that I&#x27;ve had far fewer issues with them than any other mfg for laser printers at least.  Been using a color laser (m451nw) for about 5 years now.  I don&#x27;t really print <i>that</i> often, a couple pages a month, and always had issues with ink printers gumming up when I&#x27;d go a couple months without printing anything.')
