Sometimes we even make fun of people who are afraid of flying.<p>Incentives make a big difference here. Ignoring everything else, airlines don&#x27;t want to lose their hundred million dollar machine in an accident. And the person most directly responsible for the safety of the flight -- the pilot -- is sitting right there in the machine with the rest of us. It&#x27;s a good arrangement with a long track record.<p>I could imagine corporate-run nuclear plants that have the same incentives as airlines. I could also imagine bad ones, run by Homer Simpson. It probably makes more sense to judge case by case.')
