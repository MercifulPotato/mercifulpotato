Allows uploading and then streaming your own songs, has a streaming subscription option <i>and</i> a store to purchase music, and works on the devices I use. And while iTunes on Windows may be clunkier than Spotify, it&#x27;s a hell of a lot more usable - for my use cases anyway.<p>I have lots of music that is not available on streaming services, so being able to upload and stream songs is a must for me. Spotify only offers syncing between devices which is definitely not the same.')
