It&#x27;s a shame that it doesn&#x27;t work on ARM processors, but there are good fundamental reasons why it doesn&#x27;t (it&#x27;s basically impossible iirc[0])<p>EDIT - just to mention, rr is mostly compatible with gdb, so frontends such as gdb-many-windows in emacs can work with it.<p>In terms of U.I&#x27;s I found `gdb-many-windows` to be the nicest i found. While I hate almost everything about the platform, I have to concede that visual studio&#x27;s debugging integration is actually really good. The only thing I found annoying was that I needed to use Visual Studio for it! (emacs on windows could be annoying enough that I got used to it eventually, but still preferred my linux environment. This is back when working on a cross platform C++ project if that much weren&#x27;t already clear).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rr-debugger&#x2F;rr&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1373#issuecomment-151642482" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rr-debugger&#x2F;rr&#x2F;issues&#x2F;1373#issuecomment-1...</a>')
