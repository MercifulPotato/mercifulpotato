But that&#x27;s me.<p>That&#x27;s also FUD, two ways.<p>First, what the Timescale License prevents is somebody offering our Community Edition as a standalone &quot;TimescaleDB-as-a-Service&quot;, a la AWS bundling it as part of RDS, or Microsoft as part of Azure Postgres. There is a clean technical test for &quot;DDL access to the database&quot; by users in the license.  It&#x27;s not tricky.  You can absolutely develop&#x2F;sell&#x2F;distribute&#x2F;provide analytics, monitoring, or data analysis products on top of TimescaleDB Community Edition.  Many companies do.<p>As to &quot;hopelessly-entangled source&quot;, if you know what a directory is, you can tell the difference.  There&#x27;s a &quot;&#x2F;tsl&quot; subdirectory with Timescale Licensed code.  Everything else is Apache2.  You can compile pure Apache-2 versions with a single compile flag, and we distribute Apache2 binaries.  In fact, the Postgres community itself distributes Apache-2 binaries, and Microsoft, Digital Ocean, Rackspace, and other clouds make the Apache2 version available as part of the managed database offerings.')
