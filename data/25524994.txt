Nobody is asking or even suggesting that you develop software in a notebook, and I haven&#x27;t met anyone who does it.<p>Spyder and RStudio are very much not oriented toward traditional software development and very much oriented toward interactive work between the text editor window and the console&#x2F;REPL window. That is, they are fancy implementations of the Editor+REPL workflow. The fact that you <i>can</i> develop software in that kind of environment is not the point.')
