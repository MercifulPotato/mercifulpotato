Currently I&#x27;m finishing my Master&#x27;s in Physics at University of São Paulo and working as a Python Engineer at startup in the field of Artificial Intelligence.<p>My Master&#x27;s studies are almost done (I&#x27;m finishing the last chapters of my thesis) and I am looking for the next steps of my career. The simulations I&#x27;m writing for my Masters&#x27; are written in C++17, with Python for plotting the results. I am evaluating a Random Walk based solver for the Boolean Satisfiability Problem and studying the phase transition of random Boolean formulas.')
