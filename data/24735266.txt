It sucks so much - every tiny little thing has extensive datasheets: from extremely detailed specs over test and application circuit examples that <i>actually work</i> to bitfield docs for i2c registers.<p>But the more intelligence a Thing has, the inversely worse the situation becomes: good luck finding, for example, datasheets for a USB controller for Intel HDA codecs (if anyone has a hint on these, email is in profile)... and it&#x27;s outright <i>impossible</i> to find anything for more complex stuff like Thunderbolt controllers, much less CPU &#x2F; GPU &#x2F; SoC chips. The closest a hobbyist comes across to real performance beyond RPi is COMexpress, which is not an as open standard as many would like plus the connectors cost a fortune...<p>And to top it off: even for components that <i>have</i> datasheets... these lack licensing information, which means it&#x27;s technically illegal to put a pcb design based on them as open source.<p>Seriously I&#x27;d appreciate it if our governments could do something about that situation. The creativity decent rules about datasheets could unleash...')
