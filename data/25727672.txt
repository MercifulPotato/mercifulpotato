Dont know about other jurisdictions, but in my EU country law is clear on this one - the gap between yourself and the proceeding car must permit safe stop in case of emergency at all times. If you rear end someone emergency braking (child ran into the road, car caught fire, front window shattered with debris, etc) you are 100% liable and the sole guilty party.')
