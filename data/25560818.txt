Item(by='sonotmyname', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609174967, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25560513, text='&gt; Its more realistic if a kid goes on an adventure in a city than in the suburbs were the only practical way around is being driven around.<p>As a kids who grew up in a few different suburbs in 2 different countries, I&#x27;d challenge that assertion. We had tons of adventures, visited a lot of cool places, and did a lot of exploring (on our own), all within a few miles of our homes. We&#x27;d ride out bikes to the liquor store &#x2F; arcade &#x2F; cemetery &#x2F; 7-11 &#x2F; park &#x2F; community center &#x2F; museum etc.  When younger, we&#x27;d have to get off and push out bikes back up the hill the last few blocks sometimes (I lived on a very steep hillside).<p>Nothing about living in the &#x27;burbs precludes adventure...')
