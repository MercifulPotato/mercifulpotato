That&#x27;s about all you can say about it, generically speaking.<p>Impulse radar with range gating substitutes time resolution for spatial resolution, and has been used to &#x27;look&#x27; through walls with varying degrees of success.  I think you can even buy a studfinder that uses similar principles.<p>Also, when you catch yourself writing things like this:<p><pre><code>    One of our radar scientists accurately \n    described the phenomenon (to reporters,\n    presumably): It helps to think of it \n    just as your brainâ€™s interpretation of \n    a two dimensional representation of the\n    coherent sum of backscatter responses \n    from electromagnetic waves.\n</code></pre>\n.... it&#x27;s probably time to hire some marketing folks.')
