Thanks for that.<p>But I have to disagree with your counter around airworthiness. Even after adjusted training, a plane crashed, and ultimately two planes crashed from the same issue regardless of the fact that the latter team was trained on the matter. At that point, the correction should be in hardware and controls, not in crew expectations.<p>I suspect we fundamentally disagree at this point, but I&#x27;m glad the rest of the world has concluded on the in the direction of correcting the plane rather than increasing human expectations.')
