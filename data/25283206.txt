To someone not in the field it seems to give a large boon to being able to create proteins with desired structures and therefore specific effects. Unwanted side effects would still need to be screened but that’d be much easier to do if you can make a hundred proteins that target a given functionality. Perhaps this would enable the creation of designer enzymes?')
