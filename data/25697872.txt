Freedom of speech means you are free to speak and people who choose to listen are free to listen, not that you get equal airtime.<p>Second, we already have amplification taking place of non-factual voices.  It&#x27;s not like we can just not amplify once kind of voice systematically over another, because anything we do results in that, including doing nothing.  It&#x27;s just inevitable.<p>A well-intentioned free-for-all in communications leads immediately to the uneven amplifications we see now.  There is increasingly justified concern that it is becoming dangerously unfactual lately, perhaps due to an interaction between human instincts and rapid changes in information technology, leading to a breakdown of society and democracy, thus the suggestion to promote factual voices.<p>&gt; Who gets to decide which is which?<p>Something inevitably decides.<p>If by that question you are providing the implicit answer &quot;nobody should&quot;, then you are favouring the current system of biased amplification, where things like outrage culture, economic incentives promoting polarisation, and widespread avoidance of good-faith reasoning about basic concepts is looking rather evident.<p>So we already have a system deciding which is which, even if we don&#x27;t want one.  It is impossible to avoid having one, even in principle.  Let&#x27;s acknowledge that hard reality, and discuss how to make a better system than the de facto one that emerges otherwise.<p>I don&#x27;t know the answer of how we decide, but I think it is worthwhile to investigate the question in more detail than dismissing it outright, given what we see at the moment.<p>I suggest ways to determine facts and factual voices could echo systems that have been developed over thousands of years for this.  We have a long history of developed legal, justice, political, journalistic, academic and scientific systems with a variety of methods for finding (or deciding upon) facts, to cope with the problem when people dispute about what is true and false.')
