In the UK most of our internet infrastructure is, frankly, a bit shit, and maintained by a small subset of companies. These issues occur on every ISP I&#x27;ve had here, as unfortunately most rely on OpenReach&#x27;s infrastructure.<p>The reason I chose to automate it is that when I&#x27;m away from the house I want the connection to self-repair where possible, and resetting the modem is something basically everyone in the UK has to do sometimes to fix their line (seriously). Yes I could probably have A&amp;A investigate it, but at some point, if it is an identifiable issue, they&#x27;d likely have to request an OpenReach engineer to work on something and then there&#x27;s just the risk of it being made even worse.<p>RevK&#x27;s blog has plenty of interesting anecdotes about the issues with our internet infrastructure here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.revk.uk&#x2F;search&#x2F;label&#x2F;BT" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.revk.uk&#x2F;search&#x2F;label&#x2F;BT</a>')
