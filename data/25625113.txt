I am going to reflect on this and see if there&#x27;s a way to support dump files long term in our app. We sorta support it today but it&#x27;s ad hoc implementation since an export can range from a few hundred of a thing to tens of millions of a thing.<p>Is there any good literature or patterns on supporting dumps in the tens of millions or larger?<p>I wrote a sheets plug-in that uses our cursor API to provide a full dump into a spreadsheet.
