We Americans have no idea how good we have it in terms of shipping options.<p>I can ship via USPS a videogame that is, including the padded envelope, 4 oz or less in weight for ~$3 to anywhere in the US (even AK, HI, and PR and other territories).<p>I can ship as much as fits into a USPS-provided free padded Priority Mail envelope for $7.75, and reasonably expect that it will arrive anywhere in the US in two to three days.<p>After FedEx ended its relationship with Amazon, it gave eBay Amazon&#x27;s previous steep discount. In many cases, FedEx 2Day through eBay is <i>by far</i> the cheapest way to get a package from one US coast to the other, even cheaper than USPS Priority Mail and Priority Mail Cubic. This is <i>guaranteed</i> two days or less, as opposed to Priority Mail; think SLA versus lack of same.<p>Such a discount is available to others, of course. I&#x27;ve written before about how I a month ago made $1700 in profit in three days by dropshipping a popular video game-related accessory from its manufacturer to dozens of customers around the country. I leveraged the manufacturer offering free FedEx shipping to fulfill my orders.')
