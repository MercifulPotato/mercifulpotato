Here are the reasons why Resolve beats Premiere today (in a hobbyist&#x27;s view):<p>- Premiere sucks for handling 4K footage, even with a powerful CPU&#x2F;GPU. Either you live with stutters in the editor, or use Proxy clips which requires &quot;downsampling&quot; tons of videos. If you got a semi-large project, most of the time will be spent on just converting clips. Contrast with Resolve which just handles 4K footage directly imported into the editor.<p>- UX of color grading in DaVinci is miles ahead of what Premiere does.<p>- OpenFX support!<p>- Use the free version or buy one version ($299) you&#x27;ll get to keep forever, compared to forced subscription model of Premiere (~$20&#x2F;month)<p>- Resolve beats Premiere in render speed, at least on a powerful desktop computer (i7-7700K @ 4.20 Ghz - RTX 2080Ti - 32GB RAM)<p>- Every workflow I&#x27;m used to is much faster to execute in DaVinci than in Premiere. Feels like the UX team over at DaVinci has a bit more thought behind their UX than Premiere, which just seems to put features wherever nowadays.<p>- Non-linear and procedural workflow with nodes (similar to how Houdini does it) saves so much time as well')
