I confess I&#x27;d expected quiet but farm equipment, tractors, etc. make quite a lot of noise.<p>Fortunately, the dawn chorus is nearly deafening and brings me joy every morning.<p>It&#x27;s been great, but now I realize that a few acres an hour from the city isn&#x27;t quite enough for solitude, you&#x27;re mostly in a working food factory (fair enough I suppose); if you want real quiet it seems you might need 50-100+ acres many hours away.')
