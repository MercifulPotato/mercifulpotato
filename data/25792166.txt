While I&#x27;m not a physicist by profession, I took enough high level physics to be dangerous. The way I interpret lorentz contraction and time dilation, there will always be a possible observer for which the photon does not need to exist because the interacting particles collided.<p>This is in much the same way that there is always a possible observer that sees only electrical interactions when magnetic fields are involved for other observers.')
