Am I correct ? I say this because I run a small SAAS company and we are a very small team. I would love to hire owners who can own an entire piece of work which for developers means starting a real feature based on client feedback and finishing it up and releasing in production to see real effects on actual customers. All within few days or sometimes even quicker. You own the piece. But that means you discuss the requirements, brainstorm ideas, suggest and negotiate ways to implement it and then code the heck out of it. The problem is that in companies like mine, I cannot offer some perks like unlimited vacation (is that even a thing anymore), or great benefits like larger or more well funded companies.')
