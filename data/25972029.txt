It&#x27;s more art than science at this point as there&#x27;s no clear path to achieving this status, just like there is no clear path to winning the International Chopin Piano Competition.<p>But I&#x27;ve met 2x developers, where &quot;x&quot; is your average corporate code monkey such as me in my current role or my teammates, whose children&#x2F;spouses don&#x27;t seem to be at peace with the concept of their family member working from home.<p>I know <i>three</i> people who at the moment are working two jobs. What they have in common is the uncanny ability to squeeze out 8h of focused work a day.<p>I&#x27;ve measured my ability in this regard and best I can do is 4h of taking orders from other people on a given day.
