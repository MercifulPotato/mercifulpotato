I should add &#x2F;r&#x2F;Sino to that list. I also subscribe to ChinaTalk, but I&#x27;m not sure how valuable a it is for really gauging what goes on in that part of the net. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t read Chinese, so I have to trust someone to translate and aggregate that content in the end.<p>I haven&#x27;t tried anything outside of US, China (these two being the two major geopolitical players), and Russia (because I am from there and understand the language). I would love to expand that list, but my time is limited.<p>Another factor is that reading American commentary is entertaining because I live here and am immersed in the culture. The same goes for Russia. I haven&#x27;t been able to make this work with China: there is a mass of cultural material that I&#x27;m not &quot;in&quot; on, so it feels much more like work.')
