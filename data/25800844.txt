I just launched the MVP a couple of weeks ago (built over the last 6 months or so with help from my wife and son (the Minecraft player).  This is my first foray into consumer SaaS.<p>My second project is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;golang-labs.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;golang-labs.com</a>.  This is much earlier stage, but the first product idea is a Golang module proxy designed to make builds repeatable, auditable, and put programmatic guiderails around which open source licenses are allowed. I&#x27;ve built the website, and prototyped enough of the product to know it can be built. I am primarily focused on customer discovery before committing.
