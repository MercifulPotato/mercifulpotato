Today a friend and I are launching an iPhone app called Open Hours (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;open-hours-call-a-friend&#x2F;id1540104215). The app lets you turn on your availability by phone anytime, anywhere.<p>In real time, you can easily let your close friends, family, colleagues, or clients know that you’re free to accept calls. Just flip a switch. And you can find out who is free to accept a call from you.<p>We&#x27;re building Open Hours because we believe spontaneous one-on-one phone calls are one of the most powerful and meaningful ways to stay in touch with the people we care about and collaborate with.<p>But they don&#x27;t happen nearly as much as we&#x27;d like because we don&#x27;t know when people we want to call are free and social norms prevent many of us from calling people in our social&#x2F;professional network out-of-the-blue.<p>You can think of Open Hours as an alternative to texting a bunch of people “I’m free to chat. Are you?” anytime you’re available.<p>We think Open Hours could be a useful tool when you&#x27;re commuting, running errands, doing light work in the evenings, or feeling bored. We also think it could potentially be useful for people in their jobs.<p>We’re looking for feedback on two main things:<p>* In user testing, our main challenge has been getting users to remember to turn on their availability whenever they’re free for phone calls with their friends. We know it&#x27;s very hard to create a new habit. Any thoughts?<p>* We want to explore B2B use cases. Can you think of any industries or professions where someone would benefit from letting colleagues, clients, or customers know whenever they&#x27;re holding &quot;office hours?&quot; We’re thinking about how we might make turning on your availability in the app part of doing your job.<p>Otherwise, we welcome any additional feedback on use cases and how this might address a pain point in your life.')
