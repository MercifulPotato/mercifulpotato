If you say &quot;all mature societies need division of labor&quot; does that mean you believe that everybody should be pigeonholed into a particular occupation forever?<p>It seems like there is a bigger point you are trying to makie but you need to write a little more to make it clear. Some of your spelling and formatting could be improved as well. It is strange but you can make a really excellent point but if it is poorly formatted or you have spelling mistakes, people will downvote you.')
