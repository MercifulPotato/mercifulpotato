Item(by='xyzzyz', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609785750, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25632098, text='&gt; Look for data on this and you’ll learn the opposite.<p>I looked at the data and stand by my assessment.<p>&gt; Teaching requires a master’s degree in most cases<p>It does not. Most teachers get masters degree because pay schedule pays extra for master degree holders. Master degrees are less prevalent in private schools, because private schools are not typically so dumb to have rigid pay schedules that pay extra for degrees, regardless of whether these degrees are actually useful.<p>&gt; that’s only getting you pay in the $40-50k range<p>That’s already above median wage. It’s slightly below median wage of all workers with a university degree, but once you take into account hours actually worked and non-wage benefits, this is actually significantly above average pay of workers with university degrees.<p>&gt; A popular propaganda claim is that teachers work fewer hours based on the hope that reader doesn’t know teaching includes more than direct instructional time.<p>A popular propaganda claim is also that non-instructional time is a lot. It might be for <i>some</i> teachers, especially younger ones fresh into their careers who need more time to prepare for their classes. The non-instructional work sometimes is also pretty concentrated, making some weeks very busy and requiring hard work in those. However, most weeks are not busy, and most teachers do not spend more than a handful of hours each week on non-teaching work.')
