Masks are a no-brainer IMO; they&#x27;re cheap &amp; data generally leans towards them having some level of efficacy even at the lowest ends of the cost-spectrum (ie cloth coverings), and they appear to have rapidly-increasing efficacy as the cost-spectrum value rises (ie N95+, respirators, etc).<p>I should have included the last sentence from that paragraph in the study, because it&#x27;s pretty concise:<p>&quot;Therefore, careful consideration should be given to the cost‚Äêbenefit of implementing such measures.&quot;<p>IMO it&#x27;d be impossible &amp; fruitless to attempt to get even moderate numbers of businesses to do health &amp; temperature screening, much less small businesses;  it&#x27;s just cost-prohibitive, and with the benefit being mediocre at best, there are likely better places to allocate resources.')
