This move will force the community to start from scratch to build a new entity which continues to meet those guarantees - something Elastic plans to capitalize on by capturing more users on its paid offering while the open source community struggles to set up a new entity at the same level of sophistication from scratch.<p>The community is not without options, but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that what Elastic has done is wrong.<p>Note: HN has been rate limiting me rather strictly today, so I&#x27;m losing my ability to keep up with this discussion. Sorry.')
