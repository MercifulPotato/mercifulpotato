Nowhere do they evangelize Haskell like other language like Rust for example. I never see such comments on threads on other languages, even though some of articles posted are of subpar quality.<p>In the end the insecurities and failures of snarky commentators don&#x27;t matter to others who are in the arena solving real problems in production with an unsexy language.')
