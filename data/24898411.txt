We work with G Suite as well. What concerns do you have? Please check out <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nat.app&#x2F;privacy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nat.app&#x2F;privacy</a> to understand how we treat your data, to summarize:\n- Your data is never accessed by a human\n- We don&#x27;t share it with any third parties\n- Your data is safely stored and sent to you when needed (aka. before your next meeting). That&#x27;s it.<p>If you&#x27;re fine writing down notes into a web app, sending them per email is the same level of safety&#x2F;security.<p>2) Its Nat indeed. We were previously called Nat Bot (initially we tried to build a chatbot, but pivoted a bit. Nat it is :)')
