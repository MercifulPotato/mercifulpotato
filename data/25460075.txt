Item(by='oarabbus_', descendants=None, kids=[25460648, 25463588, 25463956, 25461764], score=None, time=1608237461, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25459556, text='&gt;Coinbase should be viewed as a wealth &amp; asset management company at this point. The real profit center of the company is Coinbase Custody, which is all about extremely secure holding of Bitcoins for extremely rich customers.<p>If this is actually the case, I&#x27;d much rather use Gemini than Coinbase. Gemini seems much more fiduciary-minded in their verbiage on their site, and the fact they don&#x27;t throw a bunch of &quot;shitcoins&quot; at your face on every other click. Their fees are lower, too (but higher than Coinbase Pro, which is more for the trading-minded) and they have a daily auctioning system which to my knowledge coinbase has no equivalent.<p>Also, Coinbase is notorious for the servers crashing on every price spike. Gemini, on the other hand, stays out of the headlines regarding uptime, which is what a wealth management company should do.<p>Full disclaimer: I have accounts I use in both Gemini and Coinbase, I don&#x27;t believe myself to be biased here, and I actively use both services.<p>But if you really want a &quot;wealth and asset management&quot; service, I would personally recommend Gemini as the platform. If you think you have a leg up on the market and would like to trade for profit, go with Coinbase.')
