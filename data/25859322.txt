I&#x27;m an expat here in France and the market for ISP&#x2F;mobile is pretty great. Companies are very competitive in their offers, and I can switch at any moment since contracts are less common.<p>Whats more, fiber is mostly available throughout the country. Our current administration has an objective of providing even more infrastructure to remote locations. Obviously, US is much larger than France, but I still maintain that it can be vastly improved.<p>Concluding that 3Mbps is _enough_ is not grounded in reality. Lots of people are working from home these days, and I suspect remote work will continue to climb now that companies are becoming more comfortable with that option.')
