I moved away from there this summer.<p>&gt;  I&#x27;m really uncomfortable with the notion of backseat drivers<p>I assume this is referring to her being accountable to Socialist Alternative? I understand why this sometimes seems weird to people. But it&#x27;s impossible get anywhere as a politician without a base of support. Kshama is open about who hers is. Corporate Democrats (and Republicans of course) are not, and tend to surprise people after the fact with their governance when they refuse to, for instance, tax the rich, or hedge on the question indefinitely. I think Kshama&#x27;s ability to campaign for things and then consistently fight for them after getting elected is closely related to having SA, to not just do necessarily collective political analysis, but also do the work of mass campaigns. By contrast, traditional politicians also offload a lot of political work, but to an array of personally appointed policymakers, lobbyists, private-company executives, and others; while SA is democratically run, the corporate lobbying groups are only accountable to capital. I don&#x27;t think there is a sustainable path in between these two options.')
