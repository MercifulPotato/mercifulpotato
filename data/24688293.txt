Dutch law prescribes that a non-compete can never block you from practicing your profession as a whole, so at most it can block you from working in a very specific, limited sector of the market (e.g. direct competitors). The burden of proof seems to be on the previous employer to show that you potentially could do damage by working at your new employer.

Non-competes should also be limited in time to a reasonable duration (commonly understood to be 2 years)<p>It&#x27;s much easier to instate a &#x27;relationship&#x27;-clause in Dutch employment contracts, where you forbid ex-employees from contacting customers&#x2F;suppliers at their new employer in a professional fashion. Those are much easier to enforce.')
