But, just like you can&#x27;t expect to make a proper dinner with your kid&#x27;s toy-utensils, if you want to build nontrivial software, you need to learn suitable tools for that. And the command line the most basic of serious tools.<p>(Hell, situation in programming is actually quite good for beginners. You can go very far with toys. For instance, people make and sell complex video games in clicker tools. The experience of pushing such tools to the limit tends to shine a light on why programming is complex in general: you&#x27;re pushing at irreducible complexity. Serious tools like command line exist to help you manage that complexity better.)')
