Currently I use DigiKam[1] for general photos, but I don&#x27;t include extensive metadata on files themselves.<p>All my resources are kept in a single directory, with subfolders generally using &quot;lastname, firstname m&quot; naming. I don&#x27;t do as much cross-referencing (shortcutting) as I should, but that&#x27;s also handled to some degree in the GEDCOM and full-text search of the filesystem.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.digikam.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.digikam.org&#x2F;</a>')
