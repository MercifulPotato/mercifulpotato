GIL is released on I&#x2F;O. So threads can parallelize during I&#x2F;O calls.<p>This means if your application is bottle necked by IO threading is better. If it&#x27;s bottle necked by both IO and compute or only compute then multiple processes are better.<p>For your specific case it sounds like the latter, your application is bound by both, therefore multiple processes are better, but what you are implying with your post of using multiprocessing over multi threading as the more &quot;correct&quot; way to &quot;speed up&quot; IO is categorically wrong.<p>Dealing with the IO bottleneck by allowing IO calls to make progress while switching to other threads is a very common pattern in web development and the pattern has literally been baked into several frameworks and languages. NodeJS, GoLang, Erlang and Elixir can handle around 10k concurrent IO calls on a few threads without skipping a beat.')
