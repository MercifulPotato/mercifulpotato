It&#x27;s cheaper and much less complex to have 200-300% of average capacity running 24&#x2F;7 on dedicated servers (OVH&#x2F;Hetzner, whatever) than trying to scale up and down according to demand.<p>Changing capacity automatically always has the potential to backfire. And as AWS &amp; Co need to keep those servers running during times of less demand there&#x27;s no way it&#x27;s cheaper unless you have really unusual traffic patterns (even then it&#x27;s probably not).')
