It just depends on what you want to get out of it.  In fact you get more information about your outcome variable from Bayesian Inference as it is a distribution.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it is better than DL by any means, as DL can scale much better.  Just that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary to pigeonhole Bayesian inference to just predicting the parameters. In my opinion the &quot;fundamental difference of focus&quot; is just a personal decision, not something inherent to the method.')
