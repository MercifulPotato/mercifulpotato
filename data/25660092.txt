For example, the data for Synagis indicates it only works to prevent RSV in a very narrow set of cases.  It&#x27;s a very expensive medicine.  And it&#x27;s vastly over prescribed based on the efficacy data, so a parent who is already emotional over their premature baby is going to be frustrated if&#x2F;when the insurance company denies it.  The doctor isn&#x27;t going to into detail and explain that the data doesn&#x27;t support its use.  They&#x27;re incentivized to &quot;do something&quot;, even if it&#x27;s a shot in the dark.')
