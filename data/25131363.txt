On election night, most betting markets had Trump a severe favorite (75-80% in many places), which in retrospect seems severely mis-calibrated.<p>This year betting markets were swamped, and continue to be swamped, by money supporting Trump.  This year happened to also have a polling error that underestimated Trump&#x27;s chances.  Those two facts aligned together to form a situation where the betting markets seemed to better predict the election results than polls.  However, based on one very strange election I wouldn&#x27;t extrapolate out that betting markets are always better than polls.')
