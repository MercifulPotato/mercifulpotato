For example, you might define a type, CompleteBicycle, which is used as an argument to a ride() function. In your definition of complete bicycle, you could require a non-null gear property of type Gear. Sure, Gear exists independently in the type system, but you haven’t defined any uses for it, so it (by definition) can’t be used (or misused).<p>Edit: Grammar')
