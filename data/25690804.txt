I convinced my mother to use Signal as her default SMS app on Android, and when I bought her an iPhone, all her SMSs were lost (except to open up the old device). Not the worst problem in the world, but it leaves a very nasty taste.<p>Never mind that transitioning between iPhones (we almost bought her a new phone this year) has the same problem. That this is not supported invalidates Signal as a replacement for SMS or Whatsapp for many many non-technical users.')
