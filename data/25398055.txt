While they offered a refund after being called out they did not advertise such a refund in game or even on their own site. Duplicate premium ships used to reward the premium currency but that was replaced with another roll last year.<p>Their World of Tanks sister game operates under more generous rules but that may be more from their primary market is in a different region. Neither publishes odds but a version of the game on consoles does publish its odds because that platform requires it however there is no play against PC<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;WorldOfWarships&#x2F;comments&#x2F;k6ivy5&#x2F;how_wg_chooses_your_santa_gift_ship_and_why_you&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;WorldOfWarships&#x2F;comments&#x2F;k6ivy5&#x2F;how...</a>')
