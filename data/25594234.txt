I feel pretty stupid for just having looked over that all the time. It comes pretty close to what I hoped to get.<p>I do see some surprising behavior though, eg I ran it on WhatsApp Web, where it complains about image links that have no `alt`. But these links do have a `title`. Wouldn&#x27;t every screen reader fall back to the `title` when there&#x27;s no `alt`? What I mean is, is that an actual issue or just a &quot;satisfy the tool&quot; level thing to fix? I&#x27;m not sure how people build up an intuition for stuff like this, any suggestions?')
