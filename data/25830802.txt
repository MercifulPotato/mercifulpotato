The overwhelming majority of them have been peaceful. The overwhelming majority of the violence inflicted during them has been done by... Police forces. Most of it was done against people legally protesting, not against looters, trespassers or vandals.<p>Meanwhile, one &#x27;stop the steal&#x27; capitol insurrection resulted in five deaths, the evacuation of congress, and the interruption of the peaceful transfer of power.<p>If every BLM protest killed five people, you might be able to draw some equivalence between the two. As is, the only equivalences you can draw are false ones.<p>And besides - this is an irrelevant tangent. The parler messages mentioned in the Amazon lawsuit were not something that would have been tolerated on Twitter, or YouTube, regardless of whether they had been posted by BLM protestors, or anyone else. People get banned from Twitter for posting things like that. People do not get banned from Parler for posting things like that. That&#x27;s why Parler got booted off.')
