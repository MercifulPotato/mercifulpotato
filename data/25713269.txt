Hold on to personally identifiable information for upto 7 days post which they (pseudo)anonymize it to store it indefinitely. Now, without more information on how they do so, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d trust the effectiveness of their anonymization, given they <i>may</i> store logs (and other metrics) &quot;as long as necessary&quot;.<p>4.

Everyone just reads the headlines and FAQs.<p>&quot;Ecosia is a “privacy friendly” search engine. We take user privacy very seriously.&quot; <i>Right</i>. I wish they were upfront and admitted to collecting data instead of trying hard to convince they don&#x27;t do so for nefarious purposes (in their own eyes, that is).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;info.ecosia.org&#x2F;privacy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;info.ecosia.org&#x2F;privacy</a>')
