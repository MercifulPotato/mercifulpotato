Item(by='mjevans', descendants=None, kids=[25931848, 25931982, 25931962], score=None, time=1611769626, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25930931, text='California, from every source I&#x27;ve seen, has a major, systemic, generations long market failure.  The supply of housing has been nearly inelastic while demand remains high, with the obvious results.<p>However there are also less obvious results given the time domain involved.  The problems have followed those retiring out of California&#x27;s market as other regions follow in the same footsteps.<p>As an example; the greater Seattle &#x2F; Puget Sound metro area reached a combination of sprawl &#x2F; urban growth boundary &#x2F; natural features (mountains, lakes, the sound) at about the same time that the 2008 recession killed what little development was still occurring.<p>The price of a very cramped, noisy (poor insulation) apartment in the city without even a parking spot to store the vehicle for anything you&#x27;re doing outside of the city (E.G. visiting family on a weekend, going hiking, etc) was easily at least 3K (offhand, the last time I looked), and similar units in the suburbs quite far out, if available, were about 1.5K per month.<p>There might be more rural areas, but those were excluded from my search as the last time I looked they failed even the FCC&#x27;s definition of broadband (25mbit down, 3mbit up).  I suspect any areas out that far with good Internet would still have bad prices.')
