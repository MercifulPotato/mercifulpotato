I can&#x27;t find many of the articles I&#x27;ve read on this over the years, but Wikipedia has a decent summary: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gulf_War_syndrome#Causes" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Gulf_War_syndrome#Causes</a><p>The thing with DU and what ended up ruling it out as much of an exposure factor is that it is <i>extremely</i> heavy. Particulates of it don&#x27;t travel far. They sink, fall short, etc. They don&#x27;t waft around in air or get suspended in water like some compounds do. I don&#x27;t think anyone would suggest that you ingest the stuff, but from what I&#x27;d read, the extreme weight of the stuff kept it localized and unlikely to be ingested or exposed to in any amounts that would cause wide issues.<p>That there were other factors that could cause these effects I don&#x27;t dispute. But it was my understanding that it was determined that it was concluded DU wasn&#x27;t one of them.')
