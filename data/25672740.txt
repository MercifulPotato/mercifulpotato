Item(by='saalweachter', descendants=None, kids=[25673171], score=None, time=1610036023, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25672237, text='I don&#x27;t know enough about this particular contest -- and since it happened in 1984, I&#x27;m not going to attempt to find more information on the internet -- but typically the goal isn&#x27;t to have an <i>unwinnable</i> contest, just to have it drag on long enough while drawing more and more people into listening.<p>At the start of the contest, you might have 0.1% of the people in your listening area tuning in for the reading of the serial number, and by the end, 1-5%, before dropping down to, say, 0.2-0.5% after the contest is over.  Early on, there&#x27;s a 1 in a 1000 chance of someone listening having the bill, more or less, so the contest won&#x27;t end too early, but by the end, you are up to a 1-in-20 chance, so once it gets popular enough, it will end fast enough that people don&#x27;t get too much into grumbling that your contest is rigged.<p>Meanwhile, the radio station probably didn&#x27;t actually put up the $30,000 -- it was probably an <i>advertiser</i> who paid the radio station $40,000 out of their advertising budget to run the contest, or should I say, the Wonder Widget&#x27;s daily drawing, brought to you by Wonder Widgets, your wonderful source of wonderful widgets.  You repeat the advertiser&#x27;s slogan three or four times as people are tuning in to the station to listen for the day&#x27;s serial number, and three or four more times throughout the day reminding people to tune in at X o&#x27;clock.<p>There&#x27;s no need for the contest to be rigged or unwinnable -- it&#x27;s a bargain for everyone at half the price.  The advertiser <i>knows</i> people are listening to their ads, the radio station is getting paid outright as well as getting a boost in their listeners (which gets them more money from <i>other</i> advertisers).  And actually paying out the money, eventually, lets you go back to that same gold mine again and again.')
