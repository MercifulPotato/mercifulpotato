The issue with Intel&#x27;s dominance is it&#x27;s complete dominance on the supply side as well.<p>You fail to realize that this isn&#x27;t like 3D printing, or other low volume manufacturing. You can&#x27;t just setup a 100nm Si lithography lab in your spare room and churn out RISC-V chips.<p>In 5 years - realistically we will have a few high performance(non-mobile) ARM chips manufactured at economic scale. Any other type of disruption would require Intel and AMD to fail and relinquish the supply side capacity... or China investing billions into new chipmaking facilities now.(it takes a few years to build that capacity)')
