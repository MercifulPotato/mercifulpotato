I didn&#x27;t even make any claim that the South is more discriminatory against LGBT people than elsewhere, though if you&#x27;re going to project that onto me anyway...<p>I guarantee you apply this kind of radical stance against all generalization in a very selective way. Do you get upset if someone says that Russia is a repressive country? Or that California is expensive?<p>Even if I were to give my entire life story, you can always feign offense, claiming &quot;city A 20 miles away from city B is totally different, you can&#x27;t generalize an entire county!&quot; At some point I&#x27;d have to be listing all the individuals I had negative experiences with, and even then, isn&#x27;t it unfair for me to represent the entirety of their person with a single selective moment of their life?')
