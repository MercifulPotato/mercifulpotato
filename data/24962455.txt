I often see a well-crafted comment that is being downvoted, and upvote it although I do not agree with it. I think it&#x27;s nice to have opposing views, and it&#x27;s a tragedy when one viewpoint is silenced. Especially on a tech-focused forum.<p>If I were downvoting people who disagreed with me, I wouldn&#x27;t always feel compelled to defend myself with a comment. I think those comment threads are almost always quite boring and so I try to avoid them. Being several &quot;generations&quot; deep is often indicative of this.')
