But running Java with 16GB pool does not fall in that category. The same holds for small cloud instances.<p>Admittedly even with a C program the size of a problem requiring 16GB might not run well in a 2GB machine, but the fact remains that Java applications are often much more memory hungry than comparable C&#x2F;C++ implementations. And if you have the memory they will just use it without any Xmx. That sounds really like computing in the 1960&#x2F;70s that you need to allocate memory in advance. (I&#x27;m old enough to have seen such stuff, although not when it was new.)')
