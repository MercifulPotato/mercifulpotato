I made no comments on the measures being taken. Please, invest an effort into reading and comprehension. Following the logic of the article, i can dismiss the severity of this exact pandemic, because WW2 nets much more casualties than COVID.<p>Then if you want to classify deliberate murder as something natural, i can come and simply murder you and it will be perfectly OK. And as viruses have killed more people than the sum of all wars and homicides, it will be literally of no relevance to anyone.<p>I don&#x27;t know how long you&#x27;ve been living on this planet, but not knowing the difference between being murdered by someone who shot you and dying from a disease speaks of immaturity i can&#x27;t do nothing about.')
