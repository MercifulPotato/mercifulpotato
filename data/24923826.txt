I have never seen tearing on Gnome on Wayland, and with X11 I saw it every day. I haven&#x27;t used KDE on Wayland extensively, but in my short time with it it was a lot less glitchy <i>graphically speaking</i> than X11. For all the shortcomings of the &quot;&quot;&quot;Wayland ecosystem&quot;&quot;&quot;, there seems to be true technical merit Wayland has over X11. If only because it fundamentally solves X11&#x27;s buffer sharing problem.<p>But the writing&#x27;s on the wall. This change is not coming about through market forces as you&#x27;re suggesting, but where the developer&#x27;s interests are. And that&#x27;s pretty clear X.org&#x27;s development has slowed down significantly compared to whatever is happening around a Wayland ecosystem. Although sadly not as much effort is put into the stuff that is needed <i>outside of</i> Wayland.')
