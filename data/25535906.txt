Nikola&#x27;s stock lost 11 percent on Thursday and is down an additional 15 percent in Friday morning trading.<p>At the December 2016 event, Nikola Chairman Trevor Milton repeatedly described the truck as fully functional. But that wasn&#x27;t quite true, as Milton admitted to Bloomberg earlier this year. The supposedly hydrogen-powered truck didn&#x27;t have a hydrogen fuel cell, nor did it have the motors and gears required to drive the wheels. Milton claimed the parts had been taken out of the truck for safety reasons.&quot;')
