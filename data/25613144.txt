Most of them run Windows. Running a virtual machine often means accessing the UEFI to be sure they have virtualization extensions enabled. And many of them have shitty personal laptops, which means running a VM will really slow the &quot;Linux&quot; experience. Sharing files between the host and the guest is also sometimes tricky, and I don&#x27;t want to force them to install another OS on their personal laptops. WSL is nice in that it allows them to have a bit of Linux world without being very intrusive, and runs better than virtual machines on many of their laptops.<p>I&#x27;m what is called a &quot;vacataire&quot;, which means I&#x27;m also not in the position of asking the school IT departement to enable stuff on the computers for the classesâ€¦')
