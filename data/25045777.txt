After dealing with HP printers I get nautious when looking at an HP logo, I get this bracing defensive adversarial feeling, this can&#x27;t be good for a brand&quot;.<p>But then I realize I&#x27;m not a typical consumer, and most of us aren&#x27;t, here on HN.<p>Do typical consumers even have the vocabulary and mental concepts in place (the basics you learn in e.g. free software philosophy, right to repair movement, etc).<p>I think most people don&#x27;t. They just see that &quot;Hm, the machine says this ink is bad. Damn those guys who sold it to me! I guess I can only trust genuine HP products.&quot; I don&#x27;t think normal people&#x27;s reaction is to suspect malevolent marketing and updates. I think when people don&#x27;t have a good mental model of what is going on they will just take it at face value and therefore the HP brand won&#x27;t suffer much damage even in the long term.')
