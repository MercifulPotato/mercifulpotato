I was a kid in the 90s exploring AOL chat rooms, forums, the web, etc. It was a very groovy time. Lots of discussions about politics, but it wasn&#x27;t toxic like today. There are sharp lines today and if you are right of center you&#x27;re either being deplatformed or shadow banned or called a neo-Nazi.<p>I mean, you mention gay rights. AOL, the most mainstream internet app had a prominent Gay &amp; Lesbian section and a chat room for folks to meet or discuss commonalities. Nobody was canceling AOL over it. It was just another interest group next to Sports, Video Games, Politics, Religion, etc. You&#x27;d wind up meeting gay people through some discussions on the various chat rooms. And we&#x27;d honestly debate about whether homosexuality was a choice or not. And in my naivete I took one side of that issue and a gay boy that posted in that vg forum took the other side. It taught me how to understand them. Today, if someone says something outside of whatever the prevailing dogma is, they are treated like they&#x27;re terrible people. Experiences like that are how you grow as a person. And we cut that off at the knees today trying to make sure no one&#x27;s feelings are hurt. But all that does is create resentment and divide.')
