Here is Epic&#x27;s claim of harm:<p>&gt; In retaliation against Epic for introducing competition to Google Play Billing, and in furtherance of Google’s anti-competitive scheme, Google removed Fortnite from the GooglePlay Store. As a result, Epic suffered—and continues to suffer—irreparable harm to its reputation, goodwill, and competitive standing. Each day that Epic remains off the Google Play Store causes Epic unquantifiable harm because Google’s other restraints ensure that downloading apps outside an app store is threatening and technically challenging to most users,which prevents Epic from effectively distributing Fortnite to many Android users.<p>Epic only calls out their absence from the play store. They don&#x27;t articulate any other harms. So, it&#x27;s natural that Google would only react to this one harm, Epic didn&#x27;t claim any others!')
