I&#x27;ve never seen that tube before, but it is equally interesting and has its own charm. It seems to be more or less a really small CRT, but with little stencils inside. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nimo_tube" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nimo_tube</a><p>Incidentally there are a few modern takes on the Nixie tubes. Here is one: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coolmaterial.com&#x2F;home&#x2F;gixie-is-a-modern-nixie-tube-clock" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coolmaterial.com&#x2F;home&#x2F;gixie-is-a-modern-nixie-tube-c...</a> that does manage to look both nostalgic and modern at the same time.<p>There are also some LED &quot;Nixies&quot; that I once saw posted as part of a Raspberry Pi project, but I find they don&#x27;t have at all the same character. They look cool in their own right I suppose, but not the same thing.<p>The different methods we&#x27;ve come up with to display numbers and other characters are pretty interesting.<p>Some of the older digital multi-segment displays flickered slow enough that if you were chewing something hard (like an ice cube) the display would look like it is doing the wave. Pretty weird when you first see it.')
