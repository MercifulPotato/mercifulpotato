It is snapshot based, and maintains a database backed backup catalog (using SQLite), and is quick to set up  &#x2F; low maintenance.<p>Since it uses &quot;tar&quot; as a serialization format (it ingests tar files, storing the metadata from the tar headers in the DB), I was able to add encryption by creating &quot;tarcrypt&quot; as a filter for tar files.  This extends that tar file format a bit (documented in the above page), and uses public key encryption with HMAC verification.  The tarcrypt program can stand on its own.')
