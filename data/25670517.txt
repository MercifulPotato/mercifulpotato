Modern operating systems are made out of code, and I know it sounds weird but we can change them!<p>Ideally I&#x27;d like applications to work the same way websites do. I want to be able to open an application directly from its URL, and it should download and run a contained wasm pack file in a sandbox. The app should then be cached locally - maybe with some ability to pin it to my start menu (and pin the cache entry).<p>The app should be given some access to a rendering context (with fonts, sound, etc) and some limited storage. And not much else by default - though the user should be able to bless the application to access other files on the filesystem. There&#x27;s a huge laundry list of APIs the apps will need eventually - and thats going to be a lot of work and I have no idea who&#x27;d fund something like that. But it&#x27;d be fantastic if we could pull it off.')
