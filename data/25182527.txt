If you say: “I’m not doing politics!” and decide to sell them the service, you are being complacent in the policy that ICE enforces, and therefor just did some (highly questionable) politics.<p>Is there a way to go back from your binary opposition:<p><pre><code>  - &quot;I support what you are doing and will help you&quot;\n  - &quot;I oppose what you are doing and will fight you&quot;\n</code></pre>\nto at least a ternary:<p><pre><code>  - &quot;I support what you are doing and will contribute to your cause&quot;\n  - &quot;I don&#x27;t care what you are doing and will sell you the same services as to anyone else (I am only interested in your money)&quot;\n  - &quot;I oppose what you are doing and will do what I can to impede your cause&quot;\n</code></pre>\nI find the binary exceedingly demanding and almost insane.')
