Item(by='megameter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607824445, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25403145, text='The CF design, which I own and have been meaning to use again, is actually surprisingly simple(albeit with good materials) and relies on panel flex like the Mayflash, but it uses layers of clear lexan screwed into the platform rather than a steel construction. Both are a lot different from the DDR arcade design which uses a deeper stage with a well for each panel and a sensor lining each side of each well(so, 16 sensors for a 4-panel stage). On an arcade stage, the player can rely a lot more on bounce since the panels don&#x27;t exhibit &quot;bottoming out&quot;. They perform quite a bit differently in  expert play and I never got totally used to the feel of the CF, but I would be happy to use it again as a cardio device.')
