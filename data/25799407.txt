Was it the huge datasets required by the internet?<p>Before SQL, there was already no SQL. I don&#x27;t mean that as a semantic joke, but that databases existed before relational databases that were faster. Relational DB were too slow to even be usable, until B-trees made them barely feasible in performance (and still much slower than previous DB).<p>The advantage was flexibility: you could change the database organization without having to rewrite application. Similarly, if your application needed data in a different form, you could make it seem that the database was already in that form.<p>So SQL was like a glue between systems that could transform the <i>structure</i> of the data - much like high school algebra can put an equation into a different form, that is equivalent but more convenient.<p>I can imagine, that back in 1970&#x27;s, computing power was growing much faster year-by-year, than typical database sizes were. So, although &quot;slow&quot;, they became &quot;fast enough&quot; for more and more use-cases.<p>But in 2010&#x27;s, internet datasets were growing much faster - and computing power wasn&#x27;t. So Relational DBs weren&#x27;t &quot;fast enough&quot; for these cases... hence &quot;NoSQL&quot;.<p>Is that about right?')
