Item(by='jrochkind1', descendants=None, kids=[25104173], score=None, time=1605468379, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25103487, text='&gt; possibly not complying with the MIT license.<p>I think this author is trying to make the MIT license do something it was not designed to do and is not generally understood to do. I think he chose the wrong license if he wanted his work to legally require his permission to be copied.<p>I&#x27;m not even sure what parts of the license he thinks have been broken. (The idea that it&#x27;s even possible to violate terms of the MIT license is I admit somewhat new to me).<p>Elsewhere in the thread, commenters suggest the violated clause is: &quot;The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.&quot;<p>But I have never before seen it suggested that the MIT License is in fact &quot;viral&quot; like the GPL, that it requires derivative works to also be licensed MIT. The license is usually understood as quite the opposite, and often used intentionally because of that. If that&#x27;s what you wanted, you chose wrong with MIT license.<p>Generally when I personally see code with an MIT License, I understand that I am able to copy whatever I want from that project to my own projects, I thought that was the <i>point</i> of it. Do y&#x27;all not do the same?<p>Copying <i>ideas</i> or a <i>name</i> does not seem to me to be &quot;a copy or substantial portion of the Software&quot;; but even aside from the particular license terms, the worse part for this argument is they are generally not protected by copyright at all.<p>&gt; has reimplemented the app with almost the same features and configuration syntax using GitHub actions<p>Reimplementation? So nobody is alleging actual code got copied? &quot;Features&quot; are not <i>generally</i> even copyrightable at all, it doesn&#x27;t matter what license you use.<p>Whether &quot;configuration syntax&quot; is copyrightable or not... I guess the author is taking the Oracle side in Google v. Oracle, on copyright protection of APIs. But if you believed your &quot;configuration syntax&quot; was copyrightable and you wanted to require people to ask your permission before copying it -- you really ought not to release it under an MIT License.<p>Even apart from licensing, in general I don&#x27;t think &quot;features&quot; or &quot;configuration syntax&quot; are or <i>ought to be</i> protected by copyright at all. I&#x27;m sorry, yes, people can copy them from you.<p>If the David and Goliath roles were reversed, I have a hard time believing a large corporation alleging someone had violated copyright for cloning &quot;features and configuration syntax&quot; -- for something <i>released under the MIT license in the first place</i> -- would get any sympathy at all. We (software devs) have generally supported the right to clone software, for good reason.<p>Re-using the name is certainly rude. I am not sure if it is actionable. The rest of it... it&#x27;s not even about open source, its about that cloning software has always been allowed (although Oracle v. Google may be about to change that, which will be a disaster).')
