Is this really a salary or is it effectively a bribe to have someone ambitious doing anything, clean or dirty, to advance the interests of the company? I wonder if an experienced professional, receiving a decent but normal salary would do the kind of absurd things that these companies are doing. To me it seems that CEOs and high executives in these companies are more partners in crime than just business managers.')
