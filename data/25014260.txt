Rare (obviously long since part of MGS) were&#x2F;are based near Twycross, and Sierra Online were based in MFN long before it was cool.<p>Many years ago I once had to visit Rare for work and was surprised by the security. I wonder if part of it is that they aren&#x27;t going to be visited by a constant stream of fans if they&#x27;re harder to reach&#x2F;find. From outside the gates it was totally un-obvious that it was the HQ of one of the most influential game dev studios of the 80s and 90s.<p>That being said, plenty of companies are still based in reasonably sized towns: Jagex and Frontier are both in a science park on the edge of Cambridge, EA in Guildford certainly used to be and maybe still are in an otherwise normal business park.')
