Item(by='VBprogrammer', descendants=None, kids=[25100060, 25100390], score=None, time=1605435492, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25099615, text='I stayed clear of smart appliances for a long time for the reasons I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;re all well aware of. However, recently we had our central heating boiler changed and my partner was very keen on having Hive. It&#x27;s almost useless. I can&#x27;t believe how incompetently it seems to have been designed.<p>Essentially there are three parts, a receiver connected to the boiler, a network bride connected to the router and the thermostat connected to both.<p>Within the first week of having it installed we had times when we realised the heating hadn&#x27;t come on as scheduled. Checking the display on the thermostat would show no signal. In effect the receiver on the boiler had disconnected from the thermostat and as such you have no heating. After several occurrences of this I broke down and moved the thermostat to the closest reasonable place I could.<p>The thermostat is now in the worst place in the house for taking a temperature reading but at least it vaguely heats the house up when I expect it to. However, it is now almost constantly disconnected from the network bridge which enables the &quot;smart&quot; part. The solution to this if I can ever be bothered is to run a network cable from the router to the same room as the thermostat.<p>Why it was designed like this is beyond me. Why not have the schedule stored on the receiver, at least in memory. That way if it lost contact with the thermostat at least it could put the heating on full during the schedule.<p>Why make the wireless bridge a separate part? If I could add my WiFi details to the thermostat I guarantee it would have a reasonable connection.')
