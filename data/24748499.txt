Like, <i>really</i> want to—Atlas was <i>really</i> cool, and I check in on Cappuccino a couple or three times a year and was even poking at it last night to see how smooth their bootstrap.sh script is, and I marvel at what we&#x27;ve lost when I compare how the early 2010s were looking compared to where things are now.<p>Aside from Objective-J, though, Cappuccino has performance problems.  Every time I try the demos, there&#x27;s so much jank, even though our hardware and browser engines are a lot better than they were in Cappuccino&#x27;s original heyday years ago.<p>It&#x27;s also at risk of being in questionable legal status depending on the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in Google v. Oracle.<p>One of the cruxes of that post also stands out to me:<p>&gt; Your day job is to build a piece of web software and you can’t take a few days to learn the ins and outs? [...] I’ve seen this reaction many times in the web culture. This mentality is pretty rare in the world of native development though. Almost every decent developer I know has no problem spending a weekend learning some new and cool tool, but sadly, this spirit seems to be absent from the web culture.<p>Looking at the state of tooling in the post-narwhal NodeJS era, the &quot;web culture&quot; has now &quot;caught up&quot; on this side of things, but unfortunately, that&#x27;s not a good thing.  This is another example of the deprogression we&#x27;ve seen.  Webdevs had it right the first time on this one.  It should <i>not</i> cost a whole several days to get started.  The attitude that it should is pretty antithetical to the original value proposition behind Objective-C and Cocoa, in fact.')
