I imagine that many people such as yourself were put off by the fact that they downloaded Debian and thought it was crippled out of the box.<p>They do provide &quot;nonfree&quot; install media which include firmware blobs that many people need to get their wifi up - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdimage.debian.org&#x2F;cdimage&#x2F;unofficial&#x2F;non-free&#x2F;cd-including-firmware" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cdimage.debian.org&#x2F;cdimage&#x2F;unofficial&#x2F;non-free&#x2F;cd-in...</a>. But it&#x27;s not easy to get there (I google &quot;Debian nonfree&quot;) and it has &quot;unofficial&quot; in the URL which I imagine doesn&#x27;t help things either.<p>I understand that Ubuntu is meant to be the user-friendly Debian-based distro and that Debian is meant to be Free Software first and foremost.
