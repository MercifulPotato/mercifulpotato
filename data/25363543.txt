The thing about velocity is, energy goes quadratically but momentum imparted to the vessel (the impulse) only goes linearly with velocity.<p>Since no process can be 100% efficient, you&#x27;re dealing with quadratically more and more waste heat from the engines. And space is an excellent insulator.')
