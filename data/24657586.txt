Cozy, pleasant, and peaceful.<p>By comparison, Catnip in Norfolk, VA, was in a desolate little strip mall and full of very skittish black cats. I get that black cats are statistically the least desirable ones by pet owners, and I wouldn&#x27;t object to having a black cat as a pet myself, but the ambiance there was kind of sad when I visited last year.')
