Item(by='DoreenMichele', descendants=None, kids=[25997027], score=None, time=1612233759, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25996255, text='Friendly reminder: If this is not the internet you want, please try to support indie content producers whose work you think is decent and who take tips&#x2F;Patreon&#x2F;et al. And if you can afford it, subscribe to online newspapers and the like (because journalism is in a world of hurt and it is negatively impacting minor little things like freedom and democracy).<p>I blog and I take tips and Patreon and I sometimes hit the front page of HN. I make a pittance. This means that I have no real choice but to do other kinds of paid writing.<p>So I&#x27;ve thought long and hard about this and I&#x27;ve read the stuff on HN for years where people here don&#x27;t want ads on the sites they visit, don&#x27;t want paywalls, don&#x27;t like content marketing and &quot;pay for play&quot; affiliate sites, etc etc etc.<p>And then also do not want to leave tips, support a person&#x27;s Patreon, etc.<p>If you give writers and other creatives no means to earn an adequate income trying to meet your prissy high standards for so-called <i>ethics</i> [1], then don&#x27;t be all shocked that they will do whatever happens to actually work to line their pockets, though it involves lying, writing reviews for pay without actually ever touching the product, etc.<p>People need to eat. Not everyone can be a programmer.<p>Make it possible for creatives to establish a middle class income. Stop telling people like me &quot;Writing doesn&#x27;t pay. You know that. Go get a real job.&quot; and find a way to make it pay such that doing the kind of writing you want to see is what gets rewarded and not sketchy garbage.<p>Writing does pay. It just pays for doing bad things and occasionally someone like J.K. Rowling gets stinking rich. It doesn&#x27;t have to be that way. The world can decide it values good writing and that writers deserve a decent income and make choices to move the world in that direction.<p>[1] These so-called &quot;ethics&quot; seem to boil down to &quot;we expect writers to write for free and find some other means to support themselves while producing quality content as...a hobby, I guess&quot; -- aka <i>slave labor</i>. And then folks get upset if you frame it that way.')
