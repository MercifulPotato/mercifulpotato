If they had purchased Dropbox and Slack they could&#x27;ve gotten a foothold rather quickly and slowed down one of Microsoft&#x27;s major selling points (you already use Office, why not Azure?). Discord could be another interesting company in the chat space, as I&#x27;m sure they are considering an enterprise play (if they aren&#x27;t they are insane, considering they have one of the more user friendly chat services and with SSO and a SLA they could probably charge $10 per user).<p>(Yes, I know Chime exists. But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever heard of anyone using it, and Slack is still rather popular.)')
