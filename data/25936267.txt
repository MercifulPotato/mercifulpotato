C# and Winforms.<p>Couple years back, I once did a prototype of a web app in C# and Winforms connected to Firebase. Less than a day, done.<p>Month later, had it working in React. Granted the React website looked nice, but the difference in efficiency is <i>huge</i>.<p>Data binding 20 fields on C# is a matter of minutes. Data binding 20 fields in React, and with Redux, ugh. I really should have just learned Redux Forms.<p>And for any given forms library in React, you then get to practice learning how to beat it into shape and style it how you want.<p>I, no kidding, think writing CRUD apps was easier with VB6 and Microsoft Access.')
