It&#x27;s my first woodworking project, so it will be very simple&#x2F;functional and hopefully solid. I learned a lot in the process, made a lot of mistakes. There&#x27;s almost only finishing left to do (sanding, paint for the legs, tint+varnish for tabletop). It&#x27;s built out of very cheap material from the hardware store.')
