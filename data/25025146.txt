I did personally think (before learning more) that my monthly payment was divided to the artists <i>I</i> listened to. But all money is pooled to a single bucket from which money is then distributed to all artists. So even if I never listen to any of the 0.4% artists here,  9.9% of my payment goes to them anyway.')
