For example, I wrote a popular one for Weather Underground that I had to retire because WU stopped allowing free access to their API.<p>My latest effort is one that just deals with NWS&#x2F;NOAA directly, and reading this article has me wondering if part of their bandwidth trouble is a product of the way their API works.<p>The API is a huge set of <i>linked</i> JSON documents.  So it very often happens that a request for data is actually half-a-dozen requests through embedded URLs (all of which are made by the client one after the other).  It&#x27;s all very logical in some ways, but at the same time a bit byzantine.  I often wonder which entity is served by the way it&#x27;s set up.  From my perspective, it&#x27;s easily the hardest API to work with.  Weather Underground was wonderful, and so was Dark Sky (which I played with for awhile).<p>I&#x27;ve had people over the years ask if one or another of my tools could be used for large scale or very rapid weather data collection, but all of the services I have worked with throttle connections exactly as NOAA is proposing.  I suppose I&#x27;m at least relieved to hear that they&#x27;re not restricting access by independent developers!')
