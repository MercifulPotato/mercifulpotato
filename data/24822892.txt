It’s also a <i>serious</i> underestimate—10k is more typical for the initial filing.<p>&gt;file a provisional patent application yourself ($150) before revealing your product. That will give you 12 months to explore whether or not your product is viable. If it is, get an attorney before the 12 months expire.<p>Almost every single provisional application I’ve seen filed without a lawyer’s input has been close to worthless. This is a false economy.')
