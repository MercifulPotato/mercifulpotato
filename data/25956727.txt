You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold —&gt; price goes down —&gt; the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place —&gt; price drops even more —&gt; they keep doing that —&gt; price drops lower every time —&gt; but as long as we hold they weren’t able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!!
