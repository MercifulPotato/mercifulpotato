But if you then need to make a basic html page, you will probably search.<p>If you use an ide with autocompletion, you probably won&#x27;t remember the correct camelCase of even common functions (is it instaceof or instaceOf?) but if you work on an embedded system with a plain console editor you probably remember them all (or at least the most used ones).<p>I remember when I was actively using Lightning Launcher (an android launcher with JavaScript capabilities) that I could make full scripts almost without pressing delete, when its editor was simply a big textarea (no autocompletion, no colors, not even automatic indentation). I did need to check the docs from time to time, but their limited (and logical) set of basic functions made it easy for me to remember.\nNowadays I need to check everything again, because I simply forgot due to not using it much.<p>Answering the question: yes, yes I can, a very basic but working one, simply because I like making small tool pages for myself, coding directly from my phone (in a basic text editor). But when I need to do something not so basic, like checking if the user has scrolled to the bottom of the page, I search it.')
