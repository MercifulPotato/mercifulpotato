I am using <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;timeular.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;timeular.com&#x2F;</a> (along with their neat physical tracker widget) and it has become the tracker interface to beat, as the UX is really solid. I use it every day and find it extremely productive in ensuring that I spent time coding&#x2F;learning etc instead of too many meetings or other activities that can hijack your day.<p>Having said that, this is a good effort. I really like the continuing trend of useful software coming via Open Source, via a vibrant tech community.')
