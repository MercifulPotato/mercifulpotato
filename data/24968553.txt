If OVH only has servers on the east coast, then you find another provider for the west coast. I&#x27;ve never used OVH, but I doubt creating an account with them (and other providers) is difficult. Shopping around is the only way to get the best prices.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s mildly annoying to have to deal with multiple hosting accounts, but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for potentially huge savings, IMO.')
