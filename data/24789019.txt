Made with love by a passionate group of word gamers, and it is free for all. The app is open source; code can be found at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;domino14&#x2F;liwords" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;domino14&#x2F;liwords</a><p>The app was inspired by lichess and the fact that we can&#x27;t play live word games during this pandemic. We hope to host prestigious tournaments in the near future.<p>One of our eventual goals is to revolutionize AI for the game of Scrabble and other crossword games. Our current state of the art AI (Quackle) is roughly as good as the best players in the world, but I think we could do better than that. This started as an AI research project but we decided to expand it into a word game platform. We have a data scientist on the team who has good ideas for applying ML to the game of Scrabble, and we will focus on that in the coming months.<p>Check it out and let us know what you think!')
