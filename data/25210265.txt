Top down regulation will just make startups less likely to enter new disruptive tech. The solution is choice, stop using Apple products and all their shadyness stops being an issue.<p>And since people have demonstrated that they&#x27;re not appropriately incentivized to stop, that&#x27;s where the regulations snap in, which brings us back to where we started: there&#x27;s a need for it.<p>Solution could just be to regulate based on a tightly managed definition of age. Enable younger companies to have a bit more flexibility in determining their business model as controls slowly snap in as the company ages. There are some pretty clear loopholes that immediately come to mind (e.g. re-chartering the company every few years and transferring assets) that&#x27;ll need to somehow be managed, but it should be enough to give companies runway to figure out how to disrupt and monetize while coming into compliance with consumer protections.')
