History has proven that dynamic linking causes a large number of headaches, and static linking has drawbacks as well. There is a reasonable middle ground: base system functionality that is utilized by most software (stdlib, cryptography, networking, gui, etc) should be dynamic and everything else should be static.<p>The problem is that Linux userspace has historically payed little attention to backwards compatibility and has  no definition of &quot;base system&quot;. Consequently, Linux distros tend to be their own little mutually-incompatible worlds where you either play with the package manager&#x2F;repo combo you have or jump through hoops and dodge conflicts to try to get anything to work.<p>Oasis is interesting in this way: there are no conflicts, there is no package manager, and the binaries should work anywhere provided the arch is the same.')
