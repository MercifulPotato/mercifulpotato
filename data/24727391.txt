Regardless, I&#x27;ve managed this (although I don&#x27;t have anything loud and maybe that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re talking about.) Personally I put the rack in the middle of the room and use it to partition sleeping space from workshop space.<p>IMO the advantage to having everything as a single room is that you can define what space is used for what much more precisely this way (which is pretty great when you&#x27;re working from home.)')
