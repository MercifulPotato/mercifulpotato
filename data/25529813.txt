The M3 remains a benchmark, and by most accounts even the base 3 series is one of the better driver&#x27;s cars in it&#x27;s class.<p>But BMW has been rewarded for producing over-styled cars that are more known as a status symbol by the general public than as a benchmark for fun, practical, rwd cars. They have been plagued with absolutely shameful longevity issues, caused by mind boggling engineering decisions, and catering primarily to people that love cars will never be the most profitable option.<p>They aren&#x27;t alone, Mercedes has made many of the same choices, although Porsche remains relatively true to form, with the people who choose to buy them being no fault of theirs.')
