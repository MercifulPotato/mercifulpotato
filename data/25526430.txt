However, every app I tried can launch the browser given an encoded URL.<p>This solution allows the reader to inspect the data (visiting the url, email etc) before downloading the VCARD and polluting their contacts.<p>There&#x27;s no reason you can&#x27;t self host this and add a URL shortener. I reason I choose not to embed such a feature is I wanted this to be 100% client side so I can develop this into a PWA.<p>Hope I was able to clear up some confusion.')
