Her family immigrated to USA when she was 2 years old. Recently for some reason her family didn&#x27;t get green card. Everyone had to leave USA. Her whole family is disbanded. Parents and siblings are living in different countries. She couldn&#x27;t join her cousin&#x27;s wedding because according to USA immigration officials &quot;she has too much ties with USA&quot;. Her family was law-abiding, tax-paying and highly-educated. This begs the question. At what point do we care about people who don&#x27;t have backing of the poiltical outrage machine?')
