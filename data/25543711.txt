Take the simplest living structure, you&#x27;ll see it will break down over time. Then go progressively bigger - you&#x27;ll see the organism is doing work to keep itself together and well. These mechanisms are increasingly complex with scale, and not designed with that (or any other) purpose in mind, that makes it extremely convoluted and sometimes even counter-productive. The problem (from our point of view) is that there is no reason to keep doing this work after we procreate, that caused us to evolve workarounds instead of solutions (e.g. telomeres long enough for few decades, but not more).')
