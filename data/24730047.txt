For instance, the top marginal tax rate in the US for much of the 1900s was over 90%. It&#x27;s now, what, 37%? So much for inflation taking away your gains :)<p>However, progressive tax rates mean as much for the viability of an  inflationary currency as they do for a deflationary currency like a hypothetical BTC. That is therefore outside the scope of this conversation.')
