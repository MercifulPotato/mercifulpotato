The &#x27;big risk&#x27; isn&#x27;t attacking humans (tho it&#x27;s a concern), it&#x27;s destruction of ecology and agriculture.  If you&#x27;re going to dig up and eat the farmers crops, doing at night is worse for the farmer.  And there&#x27;s another farm 100 miles away.  Further, there&#x27;s nothing in the article that indicates the hogs are less efficient at night.  Since hogs already have poor eyesight and extremely good smell, there&#x27;s no reason to believe night is much impediment.')
