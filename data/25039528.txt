Also, you&#x27;d presumably define things such that new &lt;script&gt; tags would be ignored if they were parsed temporally after the first non-&lt;stript&gt;, non-&lt;html&gt; tag, regardless of their position in the DOM, so that you&#x27;d need to explicitly eval any dynamically loaded scripts.<p>Thanks for the pointers to CSP.  I&#x27;ll have a look.  In any case, the default should have been to ovoid in-band signalling, and perhaps have a CSP-like mechanism to relax security constraints.  Sure, hindsight is 20&#x2F;20, but precedents in phreaking are obvious.')
