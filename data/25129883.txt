It&#x27;ll hold a certain number but it&#x27;s sort of inefficient because the fixed width decoded instructions are a lot larger than the variable length instructions so it doesn&#x27;t hold too many.  Because it doesn&#x27;t help on code with large footprints and not too much time in inner loops you don&#x27;t necessarily want the number of ops you can get form it to be too much more than the width of the rest of the system if you want a balanced design.')
