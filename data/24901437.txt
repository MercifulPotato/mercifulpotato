Item(by='iguy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603746540, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24900892, text='&gt; With respect, I&#x27;ll defer to the career sociologists and psychologists on the topic, much as I&#x27;d defer to the risk management PhD on the topic of risk management.<p>This isn&#x27;t a good heuristic, without some way of judging the entire field. Would you defer to expert career scientologists about E-meters? Would it help if they published papers on the topic and held conferences and you picked only the best-cited ones from that process? Why not?<p>I think the relevant question is: If they were completely wrong about how the world actually works, would this have had any negative consequences for them?<p>This would lead you to some degree of skepticism of risk management professionals, too. If the risks are small and frequent (like estimating how many car crashes per month) then you can trust that people &amp; methods that are badly wrong will have been weeded out. But when the risks are of rare events (like, say, housing market crashes, or nuclear war) then professionals can pass an entire career without being tested against reality. So you should be wary that the most prominent voices are chosen for reasons other than actually predicting the risk.<p>And career sociologists, of course, aren&#x27;t heavily rewarded for accurate predictions.')
