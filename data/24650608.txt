I quote [0]<p><i>Running [code] is a good thing because in Cartwright and Fellisen[1], [there is a] trivial typo (- instead of =). When you write things in TeX it&#x27;s easy to make some mistakes, it&#x27;s a good thing that it happens as a clear typo here but it could be a less clear typo and then it requires significant thinking  [..] what was the correct thing. The advantage of using Haskell as a metalanguage is that if you replace = with - by mistake, almost certainly the compiler will not let you get away with this, you will catch it right away.</i><p>Oleg does exactly this in [2]. If the sequent calculus-style rules put you off, there&#x27;s an OCaml implementation!<p>As an example I did this to the denotational semantics of R5RS Scheme, translating them to Haskell, the final result[3] is essentially a one-to-one mapping from the math to code.<p>However there are some aspects of PL theory where you cannot write things as code directly (e.g. operational semantics, typing rules), and you have to resort to notation, but it&#x27;s used pretty consistently.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;GhERMBT7u4w?t=4395" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;GhERMBT7u4w?t=4395</a><p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;citeseerx.ist.psu.edu&#x2F;viewdoc&#x2F;download?doi=10.1.1.41.8026&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;citeseerx.ist.psu.edu&#x2F;viewdoc&#x2F;download?doi=10.1.1.41....</a> (typo fixed)<p>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;okmij.org&#x2F;ftp&#x2F;tagless-final&#x2F;ski.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;okmij.org&#x2F;ftp&#x2F;tagless-final&#x2F;ski.pdf</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;siraben&#x2F;r5rs-denot" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;siraben&#x2F;r5rs-denot</a>')
