This is what I am following from a long time:<p>1. Already deleted FB and Instagram account. When I came to know different sites also sends your activity data to FB. Deleting Whatsapp is in process and thanks to FB for opening about the privacy policy now many are moving to different channel.<p>2. Not using Chrome browser. Using Brave&#x2F;Edge which are using the same chromium engines and are very Fast. Also I use Firefox for its container tabs feature. Personal stuff in Firefox tabs and rest on Brave.<p>3. I am using VPN, browser extension are also available, I keep my gmail account in a separate browser container tabs.<p>4. Tried DuckDuckGo for sometime but results are not good as Google, so I am using google search in separate tab where my account is not logged in.<p>5. Same with youtube, opening in different tab and without logging in.<p>6. Turned off timeline history in google maps.<p>7. Stopped using Google Home.<p>8. Planning to move from Android to _____ whichever is much safer. This is where I think doing all above won&#x27;t make any sense as long as I am using Android. Believe I am using my phone in a restricted mode. :d<p>After doing all this, I still think they can track my activity. Haha... But I am trying to make it little difficult to connect the dots.<p>P.S: I do like Google as a developers company.')
