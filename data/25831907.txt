It is done by the government, and has fared poorly in the US and Europe.<p>I live in the UK. I compare the vaccination distribution (run by the NHS and Public Health) and the Test and Trace system (contracted out at huge expense) and I see that private provision fucked it up.<p>For vaccination we&#x27;ve don over 5% of the population, over 4 million people, have received at least one dose and it&#x27;s working well although there is tension between vaccinating the most at risk (old people and people living in poverty) vs people at lower risk.<p>For test and trace, well, read this: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;committees.parliament.uk&#x2F;work&#x2F;906&#x2F;covid19-test-track-and-trace-part-1&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;committees.parliament.uk&#x2F;work&#x2F;906&#x2F;covid19-test-track...</a><p>---begin quote---<p>Contracts worth £7 billion have been signed with 217 public and private organisations to provide supplies, services and infrastructure, including test laboratories and call handlers for tracing. NHST&amp;T has plans to sign a further 154 contracts, worth £16.2 billion, by March 2021. In total, 70% of early contracts by value were directly awarded without competition under emergency measures that were in use across government.<p>International comparisons show that outsourcing is a part of many testing systems but is unusual for tracing. A range of stakeholders have queried why the government did not involve local authorities more in its initial approach to tracing, given their previous experience in this area. The government did not document with a business case the basis for the delivery model it initially chose until September.<p>A target to provide results within 24 hours of in-person testing in the community has not been met. Turnaround within 24 hours peaked in June at 93% but subsequently deteriorated to reach a low of 14% in mid-October before rising to 38% in early November.<p>NHST&amp;T did not plan for the sharp rise in testing demand in September when schools and universities reopened. Laboratories processing community swab tests were unable to keep pace with the volume of tests and experienced large backlogs, which meant NHST&amp;T had to limit the number of tests available and commission extra help from other laboratories. Rationing of tests meant some people were told to visit test sites hundreds of miles away.<p>It is important to get hold of people with COVID-19 or who might have been exposed to it quickly so they can self-isolate, but the service saw increases in the time taken to reach people between May and mid-October, before improvements in the last two weeks of October.<p>At times, parts of the national tracing service have barely been used: in May, DHSC signed contracts for the provision of 3,000 health professionals and 18,000 call handlers. The call handler contracts were worth up to £720 million. By 17 June, the utilisation rate (the proportion of time that someone actively worked during their paid hours) was low for both health professional (4%) and call handler staff (1%), indicating that they had little work to do. This means substantial public resources have been spent on staff who provided minimal services in return.<p>National and local government have tried to increase public engagement with tracing, but surveys suggest that the proportion of contacts fully complying with requests to self-isolate might range from 10% to 59%. NHST&amp;T acknowledges that non-compliance poses a key risk to its success and has taken steps to increase levels of self-isolation, for example by making follow-up calls to people while they are self-isolating. For as long as compliance is low, the cost-effectiveness of NHST&amp;T’s activities will inevitably be in doubt.')
