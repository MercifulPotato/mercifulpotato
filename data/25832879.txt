Item(by='rob74', descendants=None, kids=[25834123], score=None, time=1611059834, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25831757, text='Thanks for sharing that, now I know that I&#x27;m not the only one who has been using htop for years and didn&#x27;t know that you could hide the threads with Shift+H. It&#x27;s not even on the help screen, for crying out loud :D<p>Plus, after looking through all the options, I couldn&#x27;t find an option to hide threads by default. EDIT: later I realized that pressing Shift+H automatically sets the option &quot;Hide userland process threads&quot;, and I overlooked it because I was looking for a disabled option. So htop was actually smarter than I was giving it credit for. However, it definitely wouldn&#x27;t hurt to mention Shift+H on the help screen :)')
