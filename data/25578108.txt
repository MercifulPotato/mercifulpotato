They incorporate a trinucleotide cap 1 analog ((m27,3′-O)Gppp(m2′-O)ApG), contain N1-methylpseudouridine instead of uridine, and encode an optimized (P2-mutated) full-length S glycoprotein encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing polyethylene glycol and cholesterol. The BNT162b2 LNP also contains (4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate) and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, whereas Moderna’s LNP contains SM-102 (most likely heptadecan-9-yl 8-((2-hydroxyethyl)(6-oxo-6-(undecyloxy)hexyl)amino)octanoate) and 1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol-2000 (PEG). ...<p>I&#x27;ll disagree here. Imagine I tell you a white powder of pure molecular composition is made up of just four elements: carbon; hydrogen; nitrogen; and oxygen. Would you ingest it?<p>It could be strychnine (poison) or glycine (an amino acid). You have no way of knowing.<p>Likewise, the physiological effects lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are still mysterious. First, the exact composition isn&#x27;t known or even revealed in the FDA filing (thus the &quot;most likely&quot; above). Second, even given known composition, there&#x27;s no way to know how large, how stable, or how aggregated these particles are or what any of that means.<p>The model for LNPs that gets most widely discussed is an artificial cell membrane. There&#x27;s a water-filled center surrounded by a bilayer of lipid (grease). These particles may show variable sensitivity to degradation depending on how administered, composition, size, shape, trace impurities, and so on. For example, Moderna&#x27;s vaccine contains cholesterol, presumably for the same reason our cells do - to modulate membrane fluidity. It&#x27;s not clear just yet how persistent LNPs might be and what effects they might show, separate from the RNA payload.')
