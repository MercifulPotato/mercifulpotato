They aren&#x27;t. There are many minimum wage positions that are more important than higher wage positions.<p>They&#x27;re not lower paid because they&#x27;re less important, they&#x27;re lower paid because they&#x27;re more <i>replaceable</i>.<p>So, when you force the employer to choose between not having a janitor, or paying 3.5$ more per hour, they will certainly decide to pay 3.5$ more per hour.<p>Assuming that there is profit, which is a good assumption as the average surplus value rate is of around 5-7%, then what will happen is that profit will decrease, and employment will stay more or less the same.<p>It&#x27;s very important to realize that the market values replaceability, not importance.')
