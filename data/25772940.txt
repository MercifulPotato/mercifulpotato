Most of these schools are also going to emphasize that Hobbes lived during a time of civil war and intense strife.<p>It’s the foundational and most coherent argument for the social contract that would eventually come to define liberal democracy. I don’t think students are reading this thinking they need to “wield power.” That’s pretty disingenuous and is seems like unsubstantiated anti-elitism. Almost everyone disagrees with Hobbes’ conclusion, but understanding where exactly his argument breaks down gives very good insight into the theoretical underpinnings of western democracy.')
