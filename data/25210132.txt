To be honest I did the same back-of-the-napkin math that you did prior to buying my MBP - the thing is the TCO is <i>even worse</i> if you customise the machine.<p>Example - a Mac is a Mac for resale purposes - if I attempt to later sell an XPS that I&#x27;ve opened up and put an SSD in and a couple of SODIMMS - I now need to recoup my cost on all of those things.  The problem is that if someone is looking at a used XPS with upgraded SSD and upgraded RAM they&#x27;re statistically unlikely to fully investigate and value the (probably really good) parts that you upgraded it with - they&#x27;re just going to see X,Y,Z numbers and price accordingly.<p>Generally though, a 5 year old Windows laptop with 16GB RAM still commands the value of a 5 year old Windows laptop as best I could tell looking at resale values.')
