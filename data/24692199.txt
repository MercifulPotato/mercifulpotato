You need 140 degrees * 60 pixels&#x2F;degree =8400 pixels to get that same visual acuity as 20&#x2F;20 vision in real life.<p>Using HP&#x27;s new G2 goggles (coming out soon) as an example, they have a screen resolution of 2,160 pixels,and (I&#x27;ve read) about a 100 degree horizontal FOV.  That works out to about 22 pixels per degree.  Which is about like having 20&#x2F;55 vision.  This is why in VR, you can&#x27;t read things from a normal distance if drawn to scale.  You have to either get closer to them (in VR) or scale them up to make them readable.<p>You CAN give the user effectively better vision by reducing the field of view.  If you don&#x27;t mind having a 36 degree wide field of view, you&#x27;ll have 20&#x2F;20 vision.')
