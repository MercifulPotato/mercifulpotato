Is the goal of Ruby right now to claw back all the people who moved to Elixir by adding Erlang features to Ruby?<p>Not to say I’m not grateful! I’m mostly an Elixir dev, but since the Erlang Runtime System sucks at POSIX (bad at pipelines, bad at exit codes, bad at trapping signals, etc.)  I personally switch to Ruby when I need a glue language. It’s nice to see the available paradigms in these (actually very different) languages “coming together”, in a way where I can spend less time mentally mode-switching, and just keep thinking in (functional, pattern-matching, concurrent-actor) terms.<p>Just think how pleasant it will be to write a “show a spinner as you poll a resource in the background” code in Ruby, now that we’ve got actors. :)')
