Usually you can just pipe to `cat`, which is super low effort to do.<p>I&#x27;ve occasionally seen scripts that install some other application where it was not clear that it was a dependency and there was no heads up to the user that this was going to happen: that kind of behavior makes me more distrustful of the author, so there&#x27;s a useful signal there.<p><i>Most</i> scripts like this seem to amount to &quot;configuration defaults + cli completions installation&quot;. To that end, I find looking at them useful because it gives me a sense of the expectations of the tooling and hints at where I might find things if I need to go debugging later.<p>When they are provided by the same entity as the program you wish to run, I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s significantly more risky to run these scripts than running the application code itself with the active user&#x27;s permissions. Still, if there was something, by glancing at the script, you have half a chance of seeing it. If there&#x27;s something there that doesn&#x27;t make sense, that&#x27;s both a &quot;proceed with caution&quot; and a learning opportunity.')
