It kinda felt to me like a lot of your code was trying to write OCaml in Rust, which causes a lot of this friction. But it was only a feeling; I didn&#x27;t have the capacity to really dig in. It is also very true that taking time to get up to &quot;what is the Rust-y way to do this&quot; is a challenge for folks learning Rust, and a valid reason to use a language that works closer to how your brain works.<p>I&#x27;m excited to see how F# works out for you; it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve always wanted to spend some time with, but never found the chance to actually do so.')
