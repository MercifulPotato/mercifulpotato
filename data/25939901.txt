Humans aren&#x27;t wired in a way that allows them to gather in that number and be able to communicate with each other well. The only workable solution is software moderation which can never possess the moral agency required to legitimize tough decisions and make ethical calls.<p>Rather than one big community, why not a whole tree of sub-communities. With some clever discovery mechanisms to share content and discussions between sub-communities, this would enable both the larger sense of community while allowing individual circles of tighter knit communities to also form. I think this is the basic idea behind federated social media too where the &quot;clever discovery mechanisms&quot; are human curated lists. It&#x27;s a good pattern that could work in a more centralized model too.')
