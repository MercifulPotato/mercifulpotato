There wasn&#x27;t a first invasion, so your premise is wrong from the start. The first Iraq war wasn&#x27;t meant to topple Saddam at all, which is why George HW Bush wisely didn&#x27;t attempt to invade Iraq with an occupation force. The first Iraq war was to push Iraq out of Kuwait and smash the Iraqi military to reduce them as a regional threat (eg to Saudi Arabia). It was a huge concerted success (the US was joined by a very strong, diverse coalition). Saddam&#x27;s once vaunted military was left in shambles, their hardware and capabilities were dramatically reduced. And then aggressive sactions prevented Saddam from rebuilding the military effectively.<p>&gt; Oh, and we lost in Syria as well<p>The US didn&#x27;t lose in Syria. From the position of the warmongers in DC, it was a stellar victory. On the cheap Syria was reduced to rubble and is a non-actor now, they&#x27;ve been almost completely destroyed. Russia is still the dominant big political-military ally of Syria, so nothing changed about that. At worst the US neither gained nor lost, at best - again, from the perspective of the hawks in the Pentagon - Syria is crippled as a regional power. Israel and several other regional powers are also thrilled with Syria&#x27;s situation, to say the least. It&#x27;ll take decades for Syria to just get back to where they were before. As a player in the Middle East, they got almost entirely neutralized.')
