My base hypothesis is, given enough computer time and an accurate potential function, molecular dynamics indeed would solve the limited protein folding problem (small domains that are soluble in water), but I also think there must be a far simpler and less expensive way to do it (most likely using deep neural nets that incorporate a wide range of information).<p>That said I also believe that QC in principle could be a way to address this effectively as well, but I&#x27;m waiting until I see somebody demonstrate something interesting and useful before I get excited.')
