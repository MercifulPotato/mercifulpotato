More than once. The first time was a very severe injury. I took painkillers for a couple of days then stopped. It would wax and wane, multiple times a day, I would be crying without a single thought going through my head. Then I realized, pain is designed to provoke a response from danger, I know there&#x27;s no danger, so pain is just a feeling. That&#x27;s all it is, like the wind blowing in your face. Just a feeling.<p>That helped. I had a big pain tolerance after that for many years. That isnt a good thing because you tend to ignore things that hurt. I had a few equally painful experienced that I managed to be fine through.<p>This mindset that helped me doesn&#x27;t work for chronic pain though. It does, at first, but after a while you just get worn down. When you&#x27;ve had a pain somewhere or other for a decade, even a mild one, it wears on you. At any point in time something hurts for me. Mostly the result of those injuries I suffered a long time ago. It isn&#x27;t debilitating. But it is always there. Some days are worse than others.')
