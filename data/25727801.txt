Item(by='thorin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610366462, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25726567, text='Generally the UK leisure&#x2F;outdoor industry has done pretty well this year, lots of people buying bikes, kayaks, canoe, SUP, and other sporting gear. They are definitely selling as many as they can get. I guess any UK based manufacturers will have been able to sell as many as they can make, maybe more local fabricators or at least assemblers will be able to start up as a result.<p>Of course the 2nd hand market for all this stuff has been booming too, physically as well as on fb&#x2F;ebay. People have been paying new prices for old goods. I could have made a bit of money buying and selling kayaks this year!')
