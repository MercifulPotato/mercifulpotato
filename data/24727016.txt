Item(by='nybble41', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602219941, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24723090, text='&gt; When “doing crime”, I’m really not interested in committing the transaction to a permanent public ledger.<p>As the recipient of the funds you need everyone else to agree that the funds are actually under your control. That requires a public ledger associating unspent funds with access credentials. The payer needs the same thing so that the recipient will <i>accept</i> the payment. (&quot;Permanent&quot; goes without saying; even if old transactions can be pruned from the database there is nothing to prevent someone from keeping a copy of the full history.)<p>What you want to avoid is having your real-world <i>identity</i> associated with the funds, which is where privacy-focused coins like Monero come in.<p>Even if you handle payments offline with briefcases full of unmarked bills you&#x27;re still leaving a trace an investigator could follow, possibly even more easily than they could follow a trail of transactions through a suitably resilient cryptocurrency.')
