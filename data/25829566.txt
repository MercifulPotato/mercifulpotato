Governments hosting their own servers is still the norm if anything, the same is true in plenty of large companies. It&#x27;s not exactly black magic, especially with modern technology. Outside the HN bubble the cloud hasn&#x27;t really taken over.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think this could be feasible in most countries, maybe only in China and US.<p>Smaller countries are easier, there is far less scale to worry about and computers are powerful enough that most government services could just about be run on a single server (in practice you probably wouldn&#x27;t).')
