It has a lot of characteristics that make it appealing - fast compiler and execution speed, low resource usage... but I don&#x27;t see how pointers, a half-baked type system and a totally undesigned error system are good design for where Go is currently winning.<p>&gt; But considering Ruby dying and Perl don&#x27;t, is very weird.<p>Agreed for sure, I think Ruby and Perl probably have similar trajectories based on current trends in languages. Python&#x27;s staying power IMO is really only due to the data science&#x2F;ML trends and I frankly think it&#x27;s a pretty poor language and ecosystem if you can get away with using anything else. I think Python WOULD be losing ground if not for its popularity in these very large niches.')
