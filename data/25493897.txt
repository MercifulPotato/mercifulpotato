Most mental&#x2F;developmental conditions are nothing more than glorified personality quizzes created by PhDs. Unless you have the most boring personality in the world you&#x27;re guaranteed to meet the diagnostic criteria for a whole slew of stuff they came up with. The only escape hatch to maintain some kind of legitimacy is to add a criterion of maladaptiveness - if you&#x27;re doing well in every area of life you cannot be &quot;diagnosed&quot;. That and you only consider &quot;diagnoses&quot; made by &quot;professionals&quot; to be valid.<p>This way anybody proving how ridiculous these conditions are is wrong by default.')
