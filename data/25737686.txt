I don&#x27;t think westerners really understand China as cliched as that sounds. If you add up all the western countries together + their westernized protecterates&#x2F;allies, Japan, SK, Taiwan. You would only get half the population of China. Think of the scale of that, your internal market is literally twice the size of the entire western market. That goes for domestic products like soap bars or video sharing but also industrial policy like airplanes, high speed trains, etc.<p>China is basically another planet that also happens to be located on Earth. That&#x27;s a good analogy I think. The CCP is the current planetary govt. If you are the government of Mar&#x27;s you wouldn&#x27;t really care much about happens on Earth would you? (I.E. the rest of the world).<p>Relations in China are the ultimate expression of realism. Politics is power politics, authority resides in he who controls the guns. The branches of government that matter are intelligence, military and security. Because at the end of the day, the only force is coercive force. This isn&#x27;t particularly new or fascinating as it&#x27;s been true throughout Chinese history. The rules of international politics applies to domestic politics in China. I.E. the law of the jungle. It&#x27;s a very old political culture so I imagine a lot of methods were tried and ultimately centralized authority backed by a strong army came out as the most efficient way to unify and govern the land. The governing method of China has and always has been for the last 2000 years some variation of Legalism. Dress it up as communism or socialism with Chinese Characteristics or any other neologism but Legalism has always ruled the land in an unified China.<p>I don&#x27;t think the west is kowtowing to China, the western elites just recognize the balance of power has shifted in China&#x27;s favour and have started to accept the &quot;facts of the ground&quot; so to speak, but they have not communicated this in any coherent way to their domestic population which continue to cling onto the pretence of the economic and political superiority of the western bloc, hence the dissonance between what is preached and what is actioned.<p>As for the article I don&#x27;t put too much stock (no pun intended) in it, mostly because I follow BABA stock quite closely and while it has lost a lot of value recently, news like this should really cause big moves if it is true. I could be wrong and maybe in a month&#x27;s time we will all be nursing big losses from the rug being pulled from underneath us. But as it stands this has not been picked up any major newswire as far as I know (FT, WSJ, Bloomberg) so I am holding my positions, not shorting or placing puts. Money talks, bullshit walks.')
