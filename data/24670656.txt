If you have the time to spare though, The Millionaire Next Door is a interesting read on exactly this topic (how some people with high incomes don&#x27;t seem to be able to save a lot of money, while some others actually manage the inverse). Not saying that it&#x27;ll fix your situation, but it might provide an interesting perspective. Best of luck to you in any case, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll get through it.')
