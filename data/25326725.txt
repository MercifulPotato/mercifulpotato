It has the __WORST__ and most idiotic type system out there, it has no clue whether it wants to be oop or a functional language and there are outrageous amounts of inconsistencies everywhere you look. The argument for spaghetti C code is valid, but you&#x27;d find a lot more js spaghetti than C spaghetti, even if you adjust for the number of C code to match the amount of js code. And there are two reasons for it:<p>1. The horrid language that is javascript in it&#x27;s core.<p>2. Everyone and their dog is a developer these days, and in 99% of all cases js developers without any fundamental understanding of memory management, data structures or algorithms(basically cs 101). For C, you need some fundamental understanding of all of those things for anything beyond &quot;hello world&quot;. I&#x27;m willing to bet that if you ask 10000 js developers what the heap and stack are and how they work, 9998 of them would have never heard of those terms. And you&#x27;d probably have to add a few zeros before you get to someone who can answer that correctly.<p>As for the extensive usage - well yeah... All you need is a browser to interpret it. In the same way all you need to keep yourself warm in winter is to chop down a tree and set it on fire. That doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a wise idea to go out chopping trees in mass, does it? I lost the countless attempts to make a better language for the web and they were all killed off by the Stalinists at w3 and mozilla. As I said, react is a symptom of that stupidity, not the cause. I&#x27;ve said it before, I&#x27;ll say it again: a good engineer and a good community are defined by their ability to say &quot;OK, that was a stupid idea, let&#x27;s go back to the drawing board&quot;. The web is in it&#x27;s worst shape it has ever been. Coldfusion, flash and the ridiculous java applets were heaven compared to what we have now.')
