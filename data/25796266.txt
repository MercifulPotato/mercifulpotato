If this warehouse unionizes, I suspect it will quickly become their number one automation test site.  As the cost of labor goes up and the cost of automation goes down, they&#x27;ll have a higher incentive to do this quickly.<p>Just look at what they announced during re:invent this year.  The AWS Panorama was basically designed to replace people in Amazon warehouses.  The Amazon Go store was basically a test bed to ~~get rid of the already~~ prevent unionized labor at Whole Foods.<p>I wish the workers luck, but in the long term, they&#x27;re probably just hastening their replacement by increasing their own costs to the company.')
