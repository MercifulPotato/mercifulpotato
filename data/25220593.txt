Sudden snowfalls are pretty common and they can be very heavy.<p>But the main danger are temperature drops, sometimes temperature can go as low as -33 C, forming thick layers of ice on the roads.<p>We got stuck there a few times because either the car doors were completely frozen and would not open or it was too cold and the engine refused to start, not mentioning the suboptimal traction of our 2WD cars.<p>To solve the problem we put some money together and bought a used Fiat Panda 4x4 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.pinimg.com&#x2F;564x&#x2F;b4&#x2F;d6&#x2F;dd&#x2F;b4d6dd1544d24d3c8d73dadda8f95599.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.pinimg.com&#x2F;564x&#x2F;b4&#x2F;d6&#x2F;dd&#x2F;b4d6dd1544d24d3c8d73dadda...</a>), it&#x27;s an affordable 4WD with many features that rival with much more expensive cars (excluding of course the luxury stuff).<p>We never had a problem after.<p>The new model costs only ~16 thousand euros and it improves a lot over the old one which was admitedly quite spartan, but for me it was a feature not a bug.')
