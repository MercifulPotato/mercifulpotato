How can it not be?<p>This is a ancient document written to be taken as truth yet the writer decides instead of just writing everything out plainly decides to make everything cryptic and to be taken not literally.<p>The writer was so dumb that instead of writing 7*10^n days which he CLEARLY knew he instead wrote 7 days and fooled a bunch of people. It goes to show that even god isn&#x27;t perfect and probably accidentally picked someone who didn&#x27;t have much going on upstairs if you catch my drift.<p>My buddy told me that all of this stuff is just excuses people make to reconcile the science and reality with the fact that they&#x27;ve been worshipping an ancient misguided document for most of their lives. I told him he better wise up because that kind of thinking leads to getting burned in hell.<p>No guys it&#x27;s just that sometimes god chooses a vessel to convey his information and that vessel is sometimes not too bright. That&#x27;s all.')
