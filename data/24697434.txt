It&#x27;s not just that the breaking changes themselves are troublesome. It&#x27;s also that projects that are overly liberal about removing features tend to become overly liberal about adding features, too. So that, over the long run, they have a tendency to become bloated and clunky at a faster-than-average rate.')
