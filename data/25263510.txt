Why are melatonin, gabapentin, piracetam prescription only? Paracetamol will kill you in the right dosage, yet it&#x27;s OTC. Hell, you can overdose on vitamins and minerals&#x2F;metals, too.<p>It&#x27;s like a game for the industry, at the expense of a minority who have to suffer from only having access to bad doctors.')
