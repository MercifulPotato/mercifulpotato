Exactly for the reason you stated, being able to filter out implementation complexity without reducing the value to customers. In most organizations that I worked on this was done by the first line R&amp;D managers, but I do agree that in some cases people that spent long period of time in managerial role might miss the technical complexity areas. Thx for your comment.')
