They have a global refresh&#x2F;flash instead of one that&#x27;s rasterizing so it might not have the same effect and they don&#x27;t have the same phosphor fade of a CRT either.  I&#x27;m also curious about the LCD monitors that strobe the backlight to reduce apparent motion blur (basically they shut the backlight off during the time that each pixel is fading between colors in each frame).')
