I lived in Mountain View and really tried to soak in the difference...I didn&#x27;t even bother to get a vehicle. That proclamation alone will be cringy for some of you, but it&#x27;s unthinkable where I live now and where I&#x27;d lived every day prior.<p>At first I felt that I was seeing an environment that is truly &#x27;the future&#x27; of integrated multi-culturalism.  I just marveled at the fact that on my walk to the store, <i>maybe</i> half of the conversations I overheard were in English.  Authentic food and art and music from all over the planet was so accessible, my team was from all over the planet and it was really cool.<p>Then I realized that I didn&#x27;t really see any black folks.  Anywhere.  I mean infosec has some work to do with diversity to be sure, so I wasn&#x27;t particularly surprised that there was just one black guy on the team.  But then I started looking on my way to and from work, at the store, at restaurants, etc.  Nada.  That one blind spot really started uncovering quite a few more, particularly around the assumptions I was hearing folks make about people that I had direct experience with.  That kind of created a Truman Show-esque avalanche effect and after a while I decided that the juice wasn&#x27;t worth the squeeze. I quit and moved back home.<p>It&#x27;s not better here, but at least it&#x27;s not pretending to be.  I&#x27;m starting to look at relocating again, but it&#x27;s not going to be to the west coast.  There are some amazing folks out there that aren&#x27;t part of the echo chamber and the weather&#x2F;natural setting is beyond compare IMHO.  It&#x27;s just too volatile at the moment and I&#x27;m not in a position where it makes sense to basically &#x27;start over&#x27; financially for a location that is just overwhelmed with its own pious fantasy.')
