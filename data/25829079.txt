How many of the protests &#x2F; riots were started in response to a police shooting and then months later it is clearer that the use of force was justified?<p>I was 100% onboard with reformation of policing, increasing training, and the likes. When rioters attacked small business, used strong arm tactics to establish autonomous zones in us Cities, burned down police stations, attacked innocent bystanders.. etc.. you lost my empathy.<p>I&#x27;m 100% for equality, I&#x27;m 100% for people loving whome ever they want. You have my support. But when the demonization of anyone that doesn&#x27;t 100% toe the line becomes standard you lose me and a large portion of America.<p>Both sides are going crazy and until both sides acknowledge that, it&#x27;s only going to get worse. Media and big tech taking these actions will escalate not de-escalate.')
