I try to keep as open a mind as I can.<p>So, no, I don&#x27;t really recall any time stateside that I&#x27;ve been surprised that people were different from their media portrayal. But I will say this, as a European I often hear people say that Americans are ignorant gun toting maniacs, and it makes me sad. The US is vast, incredibly diverse, and while I certainly have met an ignorant person or two along the way I&#x27;d say the majority of people I&#x27;ve met are fine people just trying to go about their business – pretty much like it is everywhere else. Maybe it helps that I don&#x27;t follow the news very much.<p>We may speak different languages, eat different foods and watch different shows, but my firm belief is that at the end of the day if we&#x27;re all pretty similar after all.')
