(If I was going to rage quit on something, it would be the verbose, obtuse, repetitive Java sludge I’ve had to read the last decade and a half)<p>Typescript solves problems I don’t have.  The Jetbrains IDEs do autocomplete just fine on vanilla JS, and the documentation window automatically shows the initialization and any JSDoc for most every symbol the editor cursor touches.  I avoid writing code with thousands of global symbols.<p>OOP languages like Object Pascal and C++ are good for making lemonade from the lemon of manual memory management, but if you have efficient garbage collection, use functional programming techniques rather than OOP bloat, and many self inflicted problems go away.<p>I hope TS doesn’t turn JS into Enterprise Java, The Next Generation.<p>Nothing personal, most people seem to prefer that style.  Just understand, there is a reason some people run away from the C++ &#x2F; Java &#x2F; C# &#x2F; TS milieu.')
