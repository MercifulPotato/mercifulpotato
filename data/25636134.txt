For example, in the case of HK, journalists are prosecuted under Article 38 of the National Security law.   That&#x27;s the whole point of GP&#x27;s post - legality by itself has no prima facie moral weight, an observation that applies also to whatever US laws the fed gov. is charging Assange of violating.<p>Here&#x27;s the wording of the HK-specific law:\n&quot;The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the Central People&#x27;s Government, or theft of state secrets, to prohibit foreign political organisations or bodies from conducting political activities in the Region, and to prohibit political organisations or bodies of the Region from establishing ties with foreign political organisations or bodies.&quot;')
