My savings account has an actual interest rate that was cut from 0.50% to 0.01% this year, whereas 2020 excluded, inflation has been around 1% in my country. Many of my friends in similar situations have gotten involved in stocks under a similar background and a not insignificant number of them are operating under logic like &quot;90% in long term stocks, 10% for whatever crazy long bets&quot; (like which airlines are going to come out of this, whatever stock reddit is pumping at the moment, bitcoin or companies like AMD a few months ago which they&#x27;re like &quot;I use this stuff and so many insitutional investors are completely clueless on the market dynamics&quot;).<p>So you get people with &quot;stupid bets&quot; funds, and an idea that gets momentum (The shorts cannot not buy, let&#x27;s outwait them), and this is the result.')
