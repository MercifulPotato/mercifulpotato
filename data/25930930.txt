My configuration has two sets of nine &quot;tap&#x2F;hold&quot; keys (UIO JKL M,. and their mirrors) for modifier keys and custom layers. My hands hardly move, which for my particular physical health seems more important than their position on my desk, and more important than the QWERTY - Dvorak question.<p>My favorite mechanical keyboards had been the GergoPlex, ErgoDox EZ, Planck EZ, and a KBDFans DZ60. Then I purchased a Leopold FC660C and Hasu&#x27;s replacement QMK controller.<p>I like Topre switches so much more than any mechanical switch I&#x27;ve tried, that I can&#x27;t bring myself to use any other keyboard. Topre switches are the obsession killer. You can&#x27;t swap them, you can&#x27;t post pictures on Reddit of your gaudy new keycaps, all you can do is customize your QMK configuration.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like the shaving rabbit hole. What sticks, if one returns to expensive Gillette cartridges, is the brush and Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat Shaving Soap. No one returns to spray cans.')
