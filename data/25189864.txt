He has internet connectivity there but otherwise is off the grid.  So I thought okay, raspberry pi, arduino with an Ethernet shield and some extra electronics, and then use dataplicity to remote connect.  It&#x27;s not straightforward with his internet setup to initiate a connection from the outside world.  But he wasn&#x27;t crazy about controlling the thing with a command line and really wanted a web interface.  After some searching around I ended up using Home Assistant.  We are still putting it all together but it&#x27;s been very nice so far, like battery voltage graphs and sending&#x2F;receiving data via MQTT is really pretty easy.')
