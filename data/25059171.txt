Knobs, curves, programming (Max for Live), integration with external tools.<p>In other fields of software development instead we dumb everything down to the lowest denominator, and power users can&#x27;t be at their most productive because we&#x27;re scared of complexity and build around the casual, computer illiterate  user.<p>Imagine what Ableton would look like if they were only optimising for the user that wants to put a couple of pre-made loops together and call it a song.')
