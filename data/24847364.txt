For example I used to move hoppers with raw material from one area onto the machines when necessary. They could have easily installed silos to store it with vacuum tubes to move the material around. But ultimately you still have to load and unload semi trucks, so if you already have the forklifts, you already have employees trained to drive them why automate it (well it would have made our jobs a lot easier, but I don&#x27;t think that was a priority for them).<p>Are forklift jobs that dangerous to the operator that they should be automated? My impression was that the biggest risk involving a forklift was to nearby pedestrians. I do think the constant 360 view that those monitors provide probably helps; you also lose something in not having depth perception.<p>I&#x27;m very skeptical of the claim that more people would take forklift driving jobs if only they were from an office chair instead of actually on the forklift.<p>I think the best feature is your potential pool of workers is no longer limited to the immediate geographic area. The best case I can think of is a plant where the forklift only needs operated infrequently, so you have a pool of drivers that takes remote control of a set of forklifts only when needed, so their time is better utilized. But then it goes back to what are the other plant employees doing while the truck is being unloaded.\nI thinmk the b')
