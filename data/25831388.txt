I&#x27;ve had experience with pain lasting several years due to issues with my jaw. No matter how strong you are, it takes a heavy tool on your happiness.<p>I had a friend that was going through painful knee surgery, and he was very optimistic. &quot;Im good at enduring hard times&quot; he said. I warned him to prepare for the worst, to be ready to reach out to friends if depression hits. He shook it of. But just a few months later, there he was. For the first time in his life, he was depressed. He could endure terrible pain for several hours. But when the pain just never ever goes away, when you get zero time to recover, it grinds you down.<p>Never ever risk permanent pain. It is a worse hell than you can imagine, if you&#x27;ve never been there.')
