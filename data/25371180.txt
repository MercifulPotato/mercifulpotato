I used it for a couple of years (mainly for Spotify and Airplay) and I never had any problem with it. I need to create a PR to integrate my project Soundsync[1], it would add multi-room audio synchronization to this project. The last missing integration imo is a Chromecast receiver but this is blocked by the missing encryption keys. It would really be awesome if Google releases them.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;geekuillaume&#x2F;soundsync" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;geekuillaume&#x2F;soundsync</a>')
