It&#x27;s my understanding that by default they won&#x27;t boot anything not signed by Apple, but I&#x27;m hearing scattered reports that there may be some command line configuration tool options that can cause it to disable boot security and boot unsigned stuff.  It&#x27;s certainly the default configuration, and on all of their other arm64 platforms they&#x27;ve shipped so far (iPhone&#x2F;iPad&#x2F;ATV&#x2F;Watch), disabling the boot security is not a configurable option.<p>My fingers are crossed.  We&#x27;ll know soon.<p>EDIT: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keith.github.io&#x2F;xcode-man-pages&#x2F;bputil.1.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;keith.github.io&#x2F;xcode-man-pages&#x2F;bputil.1.html</a>')
