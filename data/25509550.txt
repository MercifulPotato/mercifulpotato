Think USSR and DDR.<p>However, I fell into a trap: every time someone uses the loaded words like &quot;capitalism&quot; and &quot;communism&quot;, it&#x27;s safe to assume you are being manipulated, since the phenomenon needs to be clarified: is it an economic model, a model of government, or anything else.')
