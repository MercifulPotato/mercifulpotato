Also in the last century governments have had records on almost everyone and for the majority they have not had atrocities. I think it&#x27;s a mistake to blame one for the other. Even with the holocaust although IBM record keeping may have made things more efficient, anti Jewish pogroms had gone on for centuries before.')
