As I recall, the training advises people with such concerns to raise the matter with their product counsel immediately.<p>ETA by the way, the training does not discourage people from making statements of fact in discoverable docs, it discourages people from drawing conclusions of law. If you emailed Bob down on the production line to mention that you had 42 failed gFrobs on Tuesday, and asked Bob how many he had, that&#x27;s not discouraged. If you were to instead mail Bob and said &quot;Those Panamanian safety regulators are gonna be pissed, LOL!&quot; <i>that</i> is discouraged.')
