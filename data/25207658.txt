Item(by='iagovar', descendants=None, kids=[25209181], score=None, time=1606299136, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25206025, text='That wikipedia article is very outdated. For example, the two most common offers in Spain are symmetric 100mbps and 600mbps FTTH.<p>The most important player indebted itself with ~50k million â‚¬ and it&#x27;s basically replacing all the copper coverage with FTTH.<p>Other HFC players are turning into FTTH too, as HFC won&#x27;t be able to compete with +600mbps FTTH offerings, and symmetry is more and more valued over time.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t have the figures at hand, but the coverage in Spain is extraordinary. FTTH is reaching places that barely had 3mbps ADSL, and it&#x27;s probably going to cover places that had nothing in the long run.<p>Public money is paying for capital costs in places that would be impossible to make a profit otherwise, but still the main obstacle are municipalities and nimbys.<p>I&#x27;ve seen some pretty stupid stuff, like blocking FTTH deployment in historical centers under aesthetic concerns, where they already have ugly copper wires in the facades. In reality what those municipalities expect is ISP to bury the cables and pay for the whole renovation of such streets, which no one in his right mind will. So this people will not have FTTH unless their municipalities change their mind, but they blame ISPs.')
