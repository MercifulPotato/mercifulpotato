Seems highly functional, and something I think I&#x27;m going to try and use.  But to answer your question, here is my one nitpick: \nOn the Mac app, why do some of the &quot;tabs&quot; at the top replace the contents of the current window, while others open up a whole new window.  For example, clicking on &quot;Decks&quot; shows a list of desks in the main Anki window.  Clicking on &quot;Stats&quot; opens up a second window, and leaves the main window unaffected.  What is the purpose of this inconsistency. I personally rarely want a second window in an App, as it is another window I have to manage.  But perhaps some people like having 3 Anki windows open at once, and being able to simultaneously see their Decks, Stats, and Browse content at once.  But if this is how the workflow is supposed to be, you shouldn&#x27;t make all the buttons look like tabs at the top.')
