Whether that&#x27;s because they&#x27;re only used to React, or because they don&#x27;t realise that web content comes with conventions that they&#x27;re not adhering to makes no difference. Any time you see broken behaviour, it&#x27;s because the web stack <i>made that easier than doing the right thing</i>. That&#x27;s on all of us.')
