We&#x27;ve had dancing puppets like Walt Disney&#x27;s Small World.<p>This is hugely understating just how difficult it is for a biped&#x2F;quadruped robot to move around in the world without continuously falling, getting stuck, etc. Like seriously, seriously underestimates it.<p>Watch this video to see spot walk over some terrain that even people struggle with: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=k7s1sr4JdlI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=k7s1sr4JdlI</a><p>Doing it without a tether for a reasonable timeframe (30+ minutes) is insane! Disney animatronics don&#x27;t even come close to the complexity of these robots (even though what Disney has done is for sure impressive).<p>&gt; robots still generally can&#x27;t interact with humans or the environment in an unstructured way.<p>I think this is pretty short sighted, and you&#x27;re going to have your mind changed quite rapidly in the next couple of years. This style of robot has definitely hit a threshold of price and usefulness, not unlike what happened for drones just ten years ago.<p>I could be wrong, but I hope I&#x27;m not! It really feels like things are moving at a crazy speed in the robotics field right now.')
