Just use regular ass taxes, raise them if they&#x27;re not high enough.<p>&gt; Companies like amazon should provide adequate housing and other perks where they can utilize economies of scale.<p>Sorry, but this is ridiculous. Why twist Amazon&#x27;s arm into providing random social benefits, when you can just, y&#x27;know, have the government do it? Because that kind of thing is their job?<p>Imagine if you were like, &quot;hmm, we don&#x27;t seem to have enough public parks and libraries...I know! We&#x27;ll force huge private corporations to provide them! I can&#x27;t wait to go to Jeff Bezos Park, sponsored by Prime Video!&quot; Would that really be an improvement over the local government doing it?')
