What the fucking else do you need?</i><p>Interesting condescending tone there.  I didn&#x27;t downvote but if I can try to answer the core part of your misunderstanding:  Many do _not_ want the build to fail when library png is missing.<p>Example projects using this type of build optionality are FFmpeg and Qt.<p>For example, ffmpeg lets you build with the optional Fraunhofer FDK AAC (libfdk_aac)[1] encoder but it is not GPL license compatible.  If everyone followed your <i>&quot;assume libfdk_aac is already installed&quot;</i> advice, many people would be stuck at the <i>&quot;very clear error message&quot;</i> and not be able to have a working GPL ffmpeg.<p>Same idea with Qt optional libraries.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trac.ffmpeg.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Encode&#x2F;AAC" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trac.ffmpeg.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Encode&#x2F;AAC</a>')
