Social media networks and their ad-driven models have hollowed out our democracies by sowing outrage and division at every opportunity. If one believes &quot;The Social Dilemma&quot;, these networks have a dial for tuning public opinion that can even steer election outcomes (if you subscribe to the &quot;Russia used bots to hack the 2016 election&quot; theory, then you must agree).<p>Maybe we should rethink the role of social media networks. Perhaps they monopolize too much communication to trust them to curate which voices are amplified and which are suppressed. The discourse around this issue has been really strange, with the usual critics of corporate power rallying to defend social media giants and their rights and qualifications to curate such an enormous portion of our collective speech. Perhaps we should consider these networks to be more &quot;dumb pipes&quot; rather than &quot;curators&quot;, and instead we should expect these networks to provide us with our own curation&#x2F;moderation mechanisms. If there really is no workable social media model--that is, if they really can&#x27;t deliver some net-positive social good (or at least some smaller net harm, like sex work, drugs&#x2F;alcohol, tobacco, etc), then maybe we should regulate them out of existence?')
