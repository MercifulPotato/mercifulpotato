Everything 240V rather than 110V, and to make things even more complicated our standard switch dimensions (and thus standard wall box dimensions) are different to both the US and EU. Meaning nothing physically fits either, unless you replaced every wall box with an imported wall box.<p>Lutrons stuff looks amazing, it just sucks that it’s completely not compatible with UK homes, or even UK culture. I think a lot of Brits would find Lutron’s designs very jarring.')
