Hibernate was similarly bad.<p>- &#x27;Normal&#x27; apps often didn&#x27;t work or worked poorly (Netflix, flash, Spotify, 1Password), things are a lot better on this front now.<p>- Monitor support was typically bad and caused problems, connecting to monitor, multiple monitors, resolution issues on wake, etc.<p>- WiFi was often a hassle and either wouldn&#x27;t work without hacks or would stop working for an unknown reason.<p>- Sound would stop working for unknown reasons.<p>- Bad anti-aliasing&#x2F;font support in general.<p>- Personally I thought the UI (mostly gnome, then unity) felt slow and UI elements&#x2F;chrome often took up a ton of visual space - in general things were uglier.<p>I think a lot of this stuff is better now, but I recently went to install ubuntu on an SSD in my desktop and had to spend a few hours trying to figure out why ubuntu refused to see the SSD in the installer. I eventually had to unplug the HDD to force it to recognize it.<p>The macOS vertical integration of hardware and software is really good. I think the touchbar is a mistake (and hopefully will go away like the butterfly keyboard did), but the OS works well, battery life is good, and the applications are nice.<p>I don&#x27;t think Linux can compete for personal use, for most people macOS or Windows with WSL is a better experience. This is definitely true on laptops. On desktops I think linux has fewer negatives, but I&#x27;d still miss macOS ecosystem stuff (imessage&#x2F;texting from laptop, things like that).')
