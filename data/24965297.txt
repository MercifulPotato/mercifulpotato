According to &quot;Defining Racism&quot; by Beverly Daniel Tatum, it isn&#x27;t. But in other interpretations of the word, it would be. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s far fetched to assume it might rightfully feel like a racist slur to the grand-parent.<p>Whether racism or not, it&#x27;s probably an -ism of some sort. Despite disagreeing with the GP, at least their painting of &quot;Karen&quot; as an -ism gave me pause and made me consider that usage again. In truth, it&#x27;s probably not a great and useful practice in discourse. e.g; do you believe calling someone a Karen will increase your chances of reconciling with them or coming to a favorable outcome with that person?')
