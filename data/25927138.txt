We still can&#x27;t get over it. Unfortunately my parents didn&#x27;t understand the importance of keeping the negatives around. Printed photos degrade over time, you can see the colors shift. But more importantly, we didn&#x27;t have multiple prints and all the albums were in one drawer in a bedroom. My brother decided to burn down all the photos in one of his fits of rage. But it could&#x27;ve happened in other ways, like the room burning down, an earthquake etc.<p>Btw, do you think there is a difference between 25GB single layer and 100GB M-Discs regarding the media robustness and safety of data?')
