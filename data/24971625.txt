This wasn&#x27;t always the case, but I understand it to be true particularly since the later half of the 20th century.  So for the most part biodiesel, not ethanol, is the relevant biofuel for powering large farm equipment.  Their larger trucks burn diesel too, though their pickup trucks and other small road vehicles are often gas&#x2F;ethanol burners.')
