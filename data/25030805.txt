Why do you think the DNC has “super delegates”? Exactly to prevent what Trump did.<p>Well, no, the superdelegates are principally (solely, now that post-2016 their first ballkt voting powers have been limited to situations where they don&#x27;t matter) to prevent an extended convention battle in the event of a failure of a clear majority.<p>The GOP tried to avoid the same problem without superdelegates by building a system that creates a strong artificial majority out of plurality support, to force a quick decision for the early leader (which Trump benefited from, because the establishment didn&#x27;t really have it&#x27;s act together to <i>effectively</i> push a clearly preferred candidate at the outset, and ended up chasing the early leaders tail the whole election with a succession of different favored alternatives.)<p>&gt; The establishment GOP hates Trump as much as anyone on “the left”.<p>The old GOP establishment might. The party-in-government (GOP members in elective office don&#x27;t), the evidence of which is them staying in the Party when Trump took it over. For dissatisfaction with a party for more mild than what the left has for Trump, officeholders leave and become independents or even flip to the other party; if establishment members of the GOP in government hated Trump even with 1&#x2F;10th the fury the Left has for Trump, or even that the center-right Democratic establishment does, they&#x27;d have all left, and either become independents, joined the Democrats or, given how many of them there would be if it really was the whole establishment, formed their own party.<p>Instead, they immediately dropped most of their pre-nomination complaints and jumped on board, because while he might not be their favorite, he&#x27;s a devil they have no real problem living and working with.')
