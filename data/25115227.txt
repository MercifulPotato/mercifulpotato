Item(by='generalizations', descendants=None, kids=[25115882], score=None, time=1605551502, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25115036, text='Quote:<p>&gt; [...] research published this week by The BMJ [...] finds that the government procured an antibody test that in real world tests falls well short of performance claims made by its manufacturers. Researchers from Public Health England and collaborating institutions sensibly pushed to publish their study findings before the government committed to buying a million of these tests but were blocked by the health department and the prime minister’s office. Why was it important to procure this product without due scrutiny? Prior publication of research on a preprint server or a government website is compatible with The BMJ’s publication policy. As if to prove a point, Public Health England then unsuccessfully attempted to block The BMJ’s press release about the research paper.')
