I assume you come from a different background?<p>Care to explain your second argument? Even when the density reaches a limit, the change in pressure over the shock does not, so you can pump in energy arbitrarily (of course your gas would dissociate at some point). The total pressure loss can be complete if your initial Mach number is high enough.')
