(or stop creating them in the first place)<p><i>Other</i> ways? All this mass surveillance has hardly helped so far. All you get is nice footage <i>after</i> someone blew something up.<p>By the way these surveillance cameras and systems are stupidly expensive. For most installations they&#x27;re so expensive you could pay for a police officer permanently stationed <i>for years</i> at each of those public spaces and subway stations you were going to surveil. That would <i>actually</i> help making them safer.<p>On top of that there&#x27;s many other ways to use that money to save lives where it matters.<p>For instance you could use the money you were going to use on surveilling public places to make them physically safer instead: less accident-prone, install public access defibrillators, etc. Statistically you&#x27;re going to save so many magnitudes more lives that way, it&#x27;s not even funny.<p>People seem to assume that heart attacks is something that happens to other people, while terrorism of all things is a personal threat to them.')
