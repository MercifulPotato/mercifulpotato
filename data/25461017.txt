The OPM hack a few years ago demonstrated this and the current SolarWinds crisis just reminds us of it.<p>You could liken the security issue to climate change – our entire global economy appears to depend on consumption, which appears to be accelerating climate change. But are we going to actually change anything significantly to address the problem? Uh no, not now, maybe later. Most people barely understand the problem and, even if they care, are powerless to change it. Furthermore, we are now completely reliant on the status-quo and seemingly incapable of imagining a different world. In the same manner, these software systems which now underlie every part of our day-to-day lives are taken as a given. They are now simply too convenient and ingrained in our lives to ever go away.<p>How do we overcome the inertia of change? Most likely, from what I can see, we will simply change our expectations – it is impossible to build a completely secure software system, so we should instead change how we use it&#x2F;what we expect it to do.<p>We also feel pressure to constantly modernize the infrastructure without having a parallel discussion about the security impact of these innovations. As we get further and further from the bare metal with newer and more convenient abstractions, our engineers understand less and less about the realities of the systems they are constructing. And, arguably, as software becomes easier for users to use, they too lose sight of what the system is actually doing and how something can go wrong.')
