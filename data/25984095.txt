None of these things are true in modern day deployments.<p>Three instances of Kafka, Two ZK instances, and you&#x27;re off and running. All of that will run in docker and the docker images will stand themselves up if you let them. You need even less for developemnt.<p>Postgres is a bit more complex given that you&#x27;ve got to manage machine sizes and database schemas.<p>But even with that being said, the article gets one thing right. For average data use, most any system will do and some startups are over-engineering their stacks.')
