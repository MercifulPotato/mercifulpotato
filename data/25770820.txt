The risk is that you assume your government will be able to provide you with a comfortable life even when you can no longer work. And when the time comes for your children to get higher education and retire themselves eventually you hope the government will also be there to step in.<p>It works, until it doesn&#x27;t. In America you can compensate yourself for this risk by simply getting a job where you are paid a higher salary than the average. Then you don&#x27;t really care what happens with the social safety net, you&#x27;ve already hedged against it by saving and investing for yourself, and possibly becoming very rich.<p>Personally I&#x27;d be stressed if I were in your position. Government welfare isn&#x27;t some liquid asset. If you decide you want to go live in some other country with a higher standard of living, such as the United States, is your government going to give you $100k or more to go start a life there at the same standard of living you&#x27;re used to? I doubt it. You&#x27;ll have to start from scratch, little to no savings, no real credit history, and paying much more for things that were a lot cheaper back in your home country. And if you were to retire in the US, I have a dim view of your future if you have no savings for retirement. If you are already close to retirement and haven&#x27;t saved anything, you simply will not be able to retire.<p>Basically you&#x27;re locked in to your home country, and have no realistic options for leaving unless you become richer. If the country goes to shit, so do you. This is not the case somewhere like America, where how well off you are is decoupled from how the country is doing as a whole. Government risk is eliminated, your cash flow and net worth is all that matters. That&#x27;s much easier to understand and helps you sleep at night.<p>Be careful.')
