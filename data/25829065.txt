Working in enterprise software is just awful in my experience. The author talks about all the cool complex problems to be solved and learning from PMs!<p>But what about the shitty PMs that work you to death and don&#x27;t get it? What about the annoying customers that want a certain design even though it isn&#x27;t the most effective? Working with developers? In enterprise? You mean the offshore team, right? Get ready for 12 AM meetings with people that can&#x27;t understand each other, many of whom are just warm bodies, taking 50 attempts for one working design.<p>Documentation? Really? No one reads that stuff. They want to see it working - this is UX. People want to see a physical product not read about it.<p>The consumer grade UX stuff is just BS in enterprise. People want to do their jobs easily. Period. New UX design for consumer grade is simple and doesn&#x27;t have to do things efficiently like at work. All the major players came out with their new UX and people hate it. It does everything slower than before. Almost every project I&#x27;ve been on people have said &quot;no let&#x27;s use the old stuff it&#x27;s simply faster&quot; and it almost always is.<p>Just my two cents after 5&#x2F;6 years in the industry.')
