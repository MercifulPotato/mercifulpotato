As for Taiwan, Russia&#x27;s official stance has always been that it&#x27;s part of the mainland China, so I doubt it will do anything beside raising pointless &quot;concerns&quot; in the event of its military occupation. If anything, from realpolitik point of view it will be beneficial for Russia, since a military conflict over Taiwan would significantly undermine either US&#x27;, or China&#x27;s geopolitical positions, or even both of them.')
