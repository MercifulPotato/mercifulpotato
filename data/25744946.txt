You can still throw an old computer in your basement and plug it into the internet and make your thoughts accessible to the entire world.<p>Domain name registrar or TLD banned you too?<p>Great, pick another registrar. Pick another TLD. Pick another country with different laws. You can do it all from the country you currently inhabit and the comfort of your office chair. You can make your site accessible via IP address or virtually unblockable via Tor.<p>Even if you&#x27;re violating the laws and norms of the country you inhabit, you can host this in a way that&#x27;s virtually untraceable back to you with little effort.<p>How exactly did one accomplish that in 1930? 1830? 1730? 1630?<p>What ability did a peasant in 830AD have to broadcast their thoughts across the entire world that we lack today?')
