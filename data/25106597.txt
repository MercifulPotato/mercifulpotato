What we see as &quot;natural balance&quot; is essentially a freeze-frame of nature. The equilibria we see aren&#x27;t stable - they&#x27;re just very slow to changing. Everything is evolving and in a constant war with each other at every level - from microscopic to macroscopic. Nature itself doesn&#x27;t care about the environment as we see it today[0].<p>The problem with humans boils down to what makes us truly special: intelligence and socializing enabled us to evolve a meta-organism of society at rates <i>many orders of magnitude</i> faster than biological evolution. Language and writing lets us propagate knowledge and technologies between generations, and intelligence lets us problem-solve and simulate in mind space - pruning the solution space quickly and in an efficient way, over evolution&#x27;s directed RNG.<p>Point being, no other organism can respond with the speed at which we evolve our societies and technologies. That&#x27;s why we disrupt the ecosystems and the climate. We&#x27;re too fast for nature.<p>--<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Oxidation_Event" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Oxidation_Event</a> is a good example. An evolutionary leap, leading to most life dying off, only for new and more complex forms to eventually take its place. But as it is with life, whatever comes after a mass die-off isn&#x27;t the same thing that was there before.')
