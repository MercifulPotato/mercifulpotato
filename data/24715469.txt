Any info you want or need is easily accessible in your first language. For example imagine you want to look up info to get some work done. Go back to 1990 and you&#x27;d have to ask your colleagues in the new language but for the last 20 or so years you&#x27;d just go online and check in your first language.<p>For the last 10 years, getting around you can just use google maps in your native language where was 15+ years ago you&#x27;d probably have to deal with native maps.<p>With streaming, even TV&#x2F;Movies can stay in your first language regardless of where you are in the world.<p>It&#x27;s also free to call almost anywhere in the world now so calling back to family and continuing to talk to friends in your original country is trivial. Go back to the 90s and the costs were high enough that you&#x27;d likely rarely do it.<p>I agree with others, the biggest problem is that as an adult you&#x27;re busy. You have responsibilities and a large set of family and&#x2F;or friends that you&#x27;ll generally need&#x2F;want to do in your first language.')
