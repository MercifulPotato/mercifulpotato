For example, if you aren&#x27;t careful in how you offshore your patents and file your patent lawsuits, you can be ineligible for &#x27;lost profits&#x27; as a measure of damages.<p>This is hugely impactful because the &#x27;lost profits&#x27; method can generate much greater payouts than the &#x27;reasonable royalty&#x27; method.<p>This isn&#x27;t motivated by the sentiment you express, but it nonetheless illustrates that companies that are aggressive on taxes can end up getting bitten in other arenas.')
