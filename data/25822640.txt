It&#x27;s an online visual editor for Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Bulma, and Material-UI.<p>The brand is new, but we created Shuffle by combining our four editors into one. That&#x27;s why, if you have an account in Tailwind Builder, Bootstrap Shuffle, Bulma Builder, or Material-UI Builder, you don&#x27;t need to create a new one (please use the same login details).<p>Shuffle includes all the content from old editors &amp; the new beautiful dark mode.<p>I encourage you to try the demo. Registration is not required!<p>Any feedback is welcome!<p>PS.<p>A few days ago, the CEO of Webflow published here a beautiful story to thank the community, and we have a similar tale &amp; reason to thank you.<p>Exactly two years ago, our first visual editor was featured on Hacker News&#x27;s homepage[1], and thanks to that spike in traffic, good reviews &amp; comments, I was sure to continue working on it! TRUE STORY!<p>Then, it was just me, a one-person &quot;company.&quot; Now, we&#x27;re a team of four :)<p>So thank you all!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18821854" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=18821854</a>')
