And the issue isn&#x27;t just the knowledge, it&#x27;s that you need a certain size before things actually start to meet the threshold of what the IRS and other foreign tax agencies consider legitimate.<p>One specific issue I remember running into was the strategy of offloading intellectual property to an offshore entity.<p>That entity needs to have staff and be at least doing something in regards to the business. I don&#x27;t think you could get by just having an employee less or even shared entity holding the intellectual property. Because just an empty shell company is going to be seen purely as a tax avoidance play with no other purpose.')
