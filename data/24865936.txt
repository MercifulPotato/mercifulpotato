When I tried googling, some of my replacement serial numbers are found on the web, some aren&#x27;t. This seems to suggest that they are not individualized -- at least for some product &amp; platform combinations.<p>My own theory about the motivation of the original giveaway is that they lost the ability to generate new licenses for those old versions, so they made it free. A comment[1] from 3 years ago:<p>How could they lose the ability to create licenses? I can think of many scenarios: The one server that ran the legacy license code crashed, and they had no backups. Or they lost the database of who had which product and serial number, so there was no way to verify anything when someone needed to reactivite an old product or move their license to a different system. Or there was a new bug or incompatibility in their license generator, perhaps due to a server upgrade, but the source code for the licensing software was lost so there was no way to rebuild it.[1]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15732354" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=15732354</a>')
