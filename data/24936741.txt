I don&#x27;t care which crunchy items you list on your resume so much as your ability to learn and integrate new technical information quickly (as well as a host of other skills, of course).<p>That said, learning a new thing does take a lot of time, so if I were asking a person to do that I would either commit to hiring them if they complete the learning challenge, or pay them for their time spent that week.')
