It&#x27;s possible they just have PDFs and not the full content. You&#x27;re also assuming Fox and NY Post have journalists on staff who know what DKIM is, let alone how to verify it&#x27;s genuine. They&#x27;re journalists, not CompSci majors.<p>The &quot;drip drip&quot; is an intentional strategy, of course. This smells like a setup to me. They leak the lukewarm email, get a denial from Biden, then leak a smoking gun that cannot be denied (speculation).')
