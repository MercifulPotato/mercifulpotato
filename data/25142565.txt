I once did some mandatory training at work (on avoiding discrimination, ironically) where some of the facts needed for a good score were only presented in the audio track and were thus inaccessible to deaf people. I&#x27;m partially deaf without my hearing aids so am sensitive to this issue.<p>Another place where I worked had the bays in its car park marked with a colour of brick that was the same as the main colour if you had a certain type of colour blindness. It&#x27;s actually how most of us found out that one of our colleagues was colour blind, when he got a complaint about his apparently inconsiderate parking (usually taking two spaces because he couldn&#x27;t see the markings).')
