Item(by='lapcatsoftware', descendants=None, kids=[25780779], score=None, time=1610632588, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25775077, text='&gt; doesn&#x27;t mean it was done as a quick and dirty implementation or that it&#x27;s hastily made feature done via cutting corners.<p>I wasn&#x27;t implying that. The ContentFilterExclusionList was already present in the first WWDC beta and could have been there internally for many months prior, who knows. I was using &quot;hack&quot; more in the sense of bypassing a security system. I said &quot;It never should have existed&quot;, which is not a comment on the quality of the design of the thing that did exist.<p>&gt; People forget this is not just a single feature, but part of a change to how network filtering is done (not through a third party kernel extension anymore), accompanied with new APIs.<p>I&#x27;m not &quot;people&quot;. I&#x27;m well aware and haven&#x27;t forgotten. I&#x27;ve been a professional Mac developer for 15 years. I&#x27;ve used the Network Extension API myself.
