He&#x27;s putting a lot of effort into it: professional-level sound engineering and lighting (his day job is a recording engineer&#x2F;producer and, pre-covid, stage lighting engineer), multiple camera shoots with dollys and booms and an experienced volunteer crew.<p>He of course is aware of Twitch&#x27;s trigger-happy approach to DMCA and so one of the requirements is that bands play only original music they own the copyright to.<p>So far so good, but I fear one day the algorithm is going to have a false positive, or someone busts out a spontaneous Happy Birthday, and then his channel suddenly goes dark, and all that hard work gets tanked.')
