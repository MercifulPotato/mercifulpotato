We wanted something that was clear, easily digestible, and provides me with context from past transactions.<p>Other apps weren’t particularly valuable and - they constantly disconnected from my banks, only group one month of transactions, and take a do-it-all approach which overwhelmed me. Crystal focuses on just budgeting and spend tracking - and does it well. We have up to 2 years of transactions and waaay more context and info for each transaction than other apps do.<p>We launched an MVP on Android in September. It’s free to try and we’d love your feedback! If you’re on iOS, check out this demo of the app here: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;crystalappdemo" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;crystalappdemo</a>. We really want to hear from you about your pain points on other apps and what you think about what we’re providing here.<p>PS: Up next we’re adding a social aspect where you can share your budget progress with friends. Let us know what you think and if you’d share yours with your friends to keep each other accountable!')
