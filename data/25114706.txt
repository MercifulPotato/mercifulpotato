So I wouldn&#x27;t ever personally use disappearing messages.<p>Literally the first rule of email is that if you wouldn&#x27;t want it on the front page of the NYT then you shouldn&#x27;t send it. The first national scandal involving email was Iran Contra in 1986. People should know by now not to put anything into an email that they wouldn&#x27;t be comfortable with the entire world knowing.  And while privacy is hugely important to individuals and essential for a healthy society, to me rotating DKIM keys feels like it&#x27;s incentivizing people to use email incorrectly.')
