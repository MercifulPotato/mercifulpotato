In many other aspects, rideshare companies control the work: declining rides can lower ratings or lead to being removed from the platform. As an outside observer, it largely appears the companies have control over which dimensions are flexible and which aren&#x27;t, and they can change at anytime. The state covers unemployment when these drivers lose their work: yet W2 employees have to pay in for such benefits.<p>A more &#x27;hands-off&#x27; approach would bolster ridesharing companies argument that a proper classification is contractor. But the picking and choosing has to stop for that to be the case.')
