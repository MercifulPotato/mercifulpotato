It&#x27;s not a quick detour, but something you need to plan your day around (plan to spend a while at a store near the charge, etc). And then you may get there and find out someone has beaten you to it. With just three people in line, each charging for 45m, that&#x27;s a &gt;2h wait! IMO you have to be <i>really</i> committed and highly value the fact that your car is electric, to put up with this.')
