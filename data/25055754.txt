People are praising Apple&#x27;s production value but I just see people awkwardly standing while talking because the director told them to make sure that their feet are exactly as apart as their shoulders. No one stands like in real life. The whole thing feels so extremely polished, scripted and manicured; I much prefer the candid style Steve Jobs did and may be they can take some questions from the crowd (although during the pandemic, its understandable). Genuine connection with people is what the high production studios do not understand. They create shiny pieces, not art. But shiny things sell, so all bets are off.')
