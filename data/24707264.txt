These things aren&#x27;t made to plug and play anywhere any everywhere like consumer appliances are and you&#x27;re gonna have to consider a bunch of little details in order to make them deliver good service.  If you don&#x27;t already know what that entails you&#x27;re probably out of your league and the ownership experience will likely be less satisfying than several $500 disposable consumer models of the same time period.<p>Also if you&#x27;re not gonna do all your own maintenance just forget about it and buy cheap disposable appliances.  Skilled labor is just too expensive these days to do anything else.  Also, many commercial operations that are small enough to not be able to do maintenance in house (hotel laundry is a good example) buy a fleet of consumer appliances with the extended warranty and buy more than they need to that when one or two are down at any one time it&#x27;s a non-issue because doing that is actually cheaper than maintaining commercial equipment.')
