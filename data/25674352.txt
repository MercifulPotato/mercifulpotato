Item(by='blendergeek', descendants=None, kids=[25674428], score=None, time=1610041309, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25670720, text='&gt; Asking to leave WhatsApp is like cancelling your contract with your ISP and going offline just because you don&#x27;t like the company.<p>If I choose to stop using my ISP, I have no need to &quot;go offline&quot;. I can simply switch ISPs and I still get the exact same internet. This is why we must not fall for this &quot;critical social infrastructure&quot; trap. No one company deserves our business. We can and should go elsewhere.<p>Messaging should be like the internet. If I don&#x27;t like my messaging provider, I should be able to switch and still message everybody. Ideally, I would be able to bring my identifier with me.  Luckily, SMS already provides this. I therefore recommend old-fashioned SMS&#x2F;MMS for messaging. If you want something more &quot;modern&quot;, I would recommend Matrix, as it is the only &quot;modern&quot; messaging system that wants to allow people to switch providers while still messaging the same people.')
