Aside from the risk of becoming the target of said mob, unfortunately, a large amount of public discourse and sometimes even official company or government announcements are only available through Twitter.<p>I&#x27;ve started using nitter.net for the unavoidable Twitter usage. It proides an alternative UI for reading Twitter which at least does away with some of the pressure to sign up to see tweets with replies&#x2F;search, offers RSS, and doesn&#x27;t require you to reload the page each time you click on a link because &quot;something went wrong&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not 100% sure their Tweet list is complete, and they&#x27;re only as good as Twitter (i.e. if Twitter censors something, they still can&#x27;t show it, the search for the banned hashtag is just as useless), but at least as a reader you&#x27;re subject to a lot less of their dark patterns and hostile UX.')
