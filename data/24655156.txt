The US position on that is correct, not contradictory.<p>Restriction on action which does not involve using violence against others <i>is</i> restricting freedom in any proper liberal model of the word. That goes for everything from prostitution to drug use, and it absolutely includes being able to research information about other people you&#x27;re going to work with.<p>It&#x27;s hilarious that a place like Norway, which eg thinks publishing open salaries is to be touted, is then magically closed on checking other information about a person. So which is it, open information or not culturally? It&#x27;s contradictory, arbitrary horseshit is what it is.<p>The position is philosophically identical to claiming that speech must be heavily restricted to be truly free (ie free of &quot;hate&quot; etc.). It&#x27;s nothing more than intellectual infantilism, part of the mental immaturing and weakening of the West. It&#x27;s Orwell-think, inverting everything; more restriction on personal action is freedom, more restriction on speech is free speech.')
