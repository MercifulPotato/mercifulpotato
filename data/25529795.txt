Depending on your use case this could either be useful or a problem, since it means that you have to be careful with the scaling of the input data to JzAzBz.<p>E.g, if you scale a color by some value before converting to JzAzBz, the predicted hue will be different than without scaling.<p>Oklab will predict the same hue regardless of scale (but could also mean it does worse for extreme colors). So it is a trade off, with oklab being designed to be less complex.')
