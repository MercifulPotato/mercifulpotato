Because people can easily find out it is fake. You can&#x27;t claim china is exterminating muslims when the muslim population has skyrocketed in china.<p>The ugyhur nonsense is exactly the same nonsense we had in the mid 2000s about the falun gong. The same exact debunked nonsense. I know because I believed it.<p>&gt; I am very curious what issues regarding China you do think are legitimate.<p>You know REAL issues? Trade deficit? Environmental protection? Peacefully reintegrating taiwan into china? North Korea? Not bullshit about &quot;stolen organs&quot;, this nonsense about genghis khan, etc.<p>The only thing missing is this go around are the fucking dams. In the mid 2000s, propagandists, similar to the ones working at bitterwinter, were telling everyone that china&#x27;s dams were about to collapse. Something about poor construction, corruption, incompetence. The whole of china was going to be flooded and china was going to collapse. Boy was I convinced and boy was I duped.<p>When congress is united on something, you know it&#x27;s wrong. When john oliver does a piece on it, you know there is something not right about it. That the first casualty of war is the truth and we are in a trade war means almost everything about china is probably a lie. And if you notice that this is just a rerun of what we going 20 years ago, then it all makes sense.')
