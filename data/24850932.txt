My goal has been to nudge players into being more prolific writers.<p>There&#x27;s little content aware changes to the environment based on what you write, and lots of little touches intended to spark ideas.<p>If you play it &quot;right&quot;, you&#x27;ll have a pile of art you created that&#x27;s yours, that you can export. It&#x27;s not opinionated on what you write, there will be some prompts you can take advantage of if you want, but players can type nonsense if their hearts and souls are truly, irredeemably empty.<p>I apologize for the shameless self promotion. My suspicion is that my target audience is rare and razor thin. I feel pressure to evangelize for a genre that to my knowledge doesn&#x27;t exist.
