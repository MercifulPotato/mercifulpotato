If they didn&#x27;t, the economy would literally cease to function. Oil rig workers, miners, lumber workers, fishermen, roofers, pilots, farmers, even truck drivers have significantly elevated mortality rates.<p>The reality is that there are many jobs that require a sacrifice in terms of health and safety. Until we&#x27;re living in a post-scarcity economy, they always will. We can do things like make those jobs as safe as practically possible. Or make sure workers are aware of the risks before they sign up.<p>But, it&#x27;s unrealistic utopian thinking to believe that no one will ever be asked to sacrifice their health or safety for their job.')
