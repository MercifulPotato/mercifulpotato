Literally every printer was suffering from constant paper jams and other mechanical malfunctions. In 2020 a top consumer or business printer will not jam on you.\nThe business printers in 2000 had slow processors and more ram. It was significantly bad that printing PDFs spent more time processing the file than putting toner on page.</i><p>All of that, including the interfacing are not related to patents.<p>It&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s some patent issue for using USB or wifi in your printer over whatever interface used in 2000 compared.<p>Or like there&#x27;s a patent on using faster processor or more RAM in your printer (two things you&#x27;ve mentioned also).')
