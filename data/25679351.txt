You&#x27;ve decided there is a widespread heretic problem and now any deviance found are an excuse to overstate the problem further, even if they can be rationally explained.<p>I urge you to do some self reflection as to why you think the election was stolen because the arguments you&#x27;re currently tangled up in are exactly what lead to the mess in the Capitol, an event  which only made it more untenable for more moderate republicans to continue supporting you.')
