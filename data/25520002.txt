The power supplies in some of our products occasionally run at 180C, without heat-sinking. But these aren&#x27;t designed to last as long as a motherboard VRM.<p>In general cooler is better. At high temps you&#x27;ll see temperature related aging accelerate (e.g. solder, PCB substrate, electromigration in the parts), but you&#x27;d probably be okay. The PC would become obsolete way before the VRM fails. The worst case I can imagine is the MOSFETs and inductors heat up, bringing the local temperature up to a point where the controller IC enters over-temperature shutdown, but it&#x27;s unlikely.<p>Personally, if the current heatsink is too big I would just find smaller ones and attach them. I don&#x27;t really have a good reason, I just like parts running cool :)')
