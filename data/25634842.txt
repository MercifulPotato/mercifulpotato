Item(by='bitbuilder', descendants=None, kids=[25635249], score=None, time=1609781670, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25634278, text='I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it&#x27;s actually a combination of a new feature being recently rolled out, along with the sudden spike in load this morning.<p>The holidays are actually the perfect time for Slack to roll out a risky deployment, as it has to be their lowest usage time. So it would make sense if something was pushed out last week or the week before. And everything probably seemed fine.<p>And then this morning they suddenly realize this new feature does not perform under load. And to make matters worse, the new feature has been out long enough to make any sort of rollback very tricky, if not impossible. Which means they&#x27;d need engineers to desperately hack out, test and deploy a code fix.<p>If this is the scenario, I do not envy them at all.')
