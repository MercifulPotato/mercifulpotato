It is one of the reason why i suspect the far-right and far-left seems to use similar wording and aggressive speech when describing the other side. The more extremely culturally aligned they are to either side, the less they see the violence for what it is. What is worse, I often also see rationalization of that violence by perpetrator that their own violence is justified if it challenge status quo, if it stands up for a principle, if the other side is perceived by them as being more violent, with little regard to if the violence was needed compared to a non violent response.')
