I don&#x27;t have the time to administer my own infrastructure so it looks like I&#x27;ll be using cloud-based PaaS&#x2F;SaaS. I came from a place where O365 was used and I loathed it. It was always slow and buggy. A friend uses Google Workspace and he seems happy with it, but when I asked him about data security&#x2F;trust, he dismissed it out of hand. Can I trust Google with my business data, receipts, spreadsheet info, notes, etc?')
