They&#x27;re all still kicking with nothing but AK-47s, pick-up trucks and improvised explosives because these big weapons you talk about are useless for dealing with them.<p>Guerilla warfare is a sharp reminder that the biggest weapon a soldier has is the one between his ears. Standing armies, like the story of david and goliath, &quot;deploy&quot; troops with the expectation that the other side will play by their rules. The result? David ain&#x27;t about that life and uses his head, sling and a rock. You can have all the weapons in the world, nothing can garuantee your victory.<p>So how do the politicians and top brass justify the dead sons and no real, tangible success? They order the army to kill civilians ofcourse. Can you imagine training soldiers for a million bucks a pop, then he gets killed by a homemade bomb in some wadhi?<p>In short, war is a mess. It&#x27;s not more guns needed, it&#x27;s diplomacy.')
