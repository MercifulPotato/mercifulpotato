So all the value produced goes to me, and you get very close to nothing.</i><p>I think this is the core of our disagreement. If someone makes a feature request, and I think it makes the project better overall and decide to implement it, I have benefited. I wrote the software because I wanted it to be good and useful, and they have helped me make it better and more useful.<p>If someone asks for a feature that only would benefit them, that&#x27;s different, but I&#x27;m also not likely to implement it. Similarly, if I were getting a large number of unpleasant entitled requests, I might get grumpy, but having those requests come with payments attached wouldn&#x27;t help my feelings much.  I do this for fun in my spare time; I don&#x27;t want it to be a job.<p><i>&gt; If they are profiting off of the response and all you get is the work of answering, then no.</i><p>I disagree there as well. I&#x27;ll answer if I feel like answering, and if they ask an interesting question then I&#x27;m happy to do that. It doesn&#x27;t matter to me whether or not they make a profit from my response.  I have several blog posts [1][2][3] where I would love it if someone would make a successful commercial product out of, since that would let more people use the tech, and if someone was working in this direction I would be happy to answer questions.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jefftk.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;footboard-v3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jefftk.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;footboard-v3</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jefftk.com&#x2F;bass-whistle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jefftk.com&#x2F;bass-whistle</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jefftk.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;bucket-brigade-singing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jefftk.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;bucket-brigade-singing</a>')
