Item(by='Rochus', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603668438, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24890739, text='&gt; It&#x27;s literally designed to download content from sites that don&#x27;t allow downloads<p>That&#x27;s not per se illegal. First there are countries where it is not illegal to download copyright protected content for personal use. Second even in countries where this was illegal (but where it is by no means clear what the difference between &quot;download in the browser&quot; and &quot;download in another tool&quot; should be) Youtube contains content which is CC-BY licensed (see e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;RochusKeller" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;user&#x2F;RochusKeller</a>) which can be legally downloaded and used.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t understand the RIAA bit.<p>RIAA is no copyright collective (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_copyright_collection_societies#United_States" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_copyright_collection_s...</a>), but just an industry organization. In order to be able to represent the rights of the IP owners in court or in actions like the present one, the organization needs appropriate powers of attorney. This must also be provided for in the statutes. This is not the same as lobbying. If I was a representative of the other party, the first thing I would doubt is that.')
