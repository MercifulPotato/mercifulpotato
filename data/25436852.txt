Item(by='panopticon', descendants=None, kids=[25436877], score=None, time=1608074947, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25436427, text='The weight savings are very, very nice when you&#x27;re doing long or technical hikes. The full-frame body and two lenses I hike with weigh almost 6lbs. That&#x27;s not even including the filters and sturdy tripod designed for holding a &quot;real&quot; camera. By comparison, a good phone tripod and mount clock in at about 1.5lbs.<p>That being said... I enjoy printing my landscape photography. It&#x27;s worth it to lug out my heavy gear because I can get nice, large prints out of it. But if you&#x27;re just posting on social media, your body will thank you later for leaving those 6lbs home.')
