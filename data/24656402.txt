Color contrast helps a <i>lot</i>. In that case the whole setup- the costumes, the lighting, etc, are all artificial <i>in the first place</i>, adding some fake color on top doesn&#x27;t seem like a historical sin.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qzc7vY9VTnk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=qzc7vY9VTnk</a><p>Personally, I don&#x27;t find frame interpolation to be as effective as colorization; the artifacts it causes are often more distracting than just leaving the framerate alone. It can create a sort of artificial floating feeling to the motion- a problem that people often complain about with <i>native</i> 60fps, and is <i>much</i> worse with interpolated 60fps. Algorithms keep improving though, eventually I might find them more satisfying.')
