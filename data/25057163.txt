Not only did physicists believe in the existence of Higgs boson, they built upon the premise that it existed for all those years.<p>Sometimes evidence is not always possible to present or just not practical. Also, there are various degrees of what kind of evidence is acceptable. The evidence required to publish a paper in a scientific journal is different from what is required to make a legal case or report in a magazine. So, with a premise of &quot;requiring evidence&quot;, you can be very flexible in terms of what you allow and don&#x27;t... which is what Twitter seems to be doing.')
