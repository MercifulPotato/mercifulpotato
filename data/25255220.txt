A better formula would be:<p><pre><code>  P(covid death or long term harm) &lt; 0.05%\n  vs.\n  P(vaccine long term harm) = ?\n</code></pre>\nsince my estimate is they&#x27;re about the same order of magnitude, I prefer to take the devil-I-know vs. the small-scale-tested vaccine.<p>I model the potential harm based on a similarly rushed vaccine of 1976 which caused a large increase in cases of Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome [0]. Longer trials and phase IV monitoring was instituted in response to this rushed vaccine.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1976_swine_flu_outbreak" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;1976_swine_flu_outbreak</a>')
