It lets you create multiple virtual card numbers, so every site I pay, I give a different card number. If any single site gets hacked, I can disable just that card. And each card can have a spending limit per transaction&#x2F;day&#x2F;month&#x2F;year. Or, you can make the card a &quot;burner&quot; card that automatically deactivates after the first transaction.<p>Edit: I suppose that doesn&#x27;t work as well for hotels specifically, at least in terms of giving a card for incidentals. Since it isn&#x27;t a physical card, not sure if the receptionist would be keen on entering a digital card like that? But I&#x27;ve definitely used it to pay for rooms online.')
