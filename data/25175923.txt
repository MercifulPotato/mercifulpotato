Unlike a pianist, a guitarist almost never shows up to a gig and plays someone else&#x27;s instrument.  So standardization is a lot less important.<p>The other thing guitarists have going for them is that no matter what scale length you play, the shape of the chords and scales changes as you go up the neck.  Guitarists are constantly training with differently-spaced frets just by moving up and down the fretboard.  This makes it trivial to switch scale lengths compared to keyboardists switching key widths.')
