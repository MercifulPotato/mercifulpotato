Each culture has their own marriage-related customs. When you want to get married in the USA, you basically need to go through it, because everyone has been perfectly conditioned to expect a certain ritual and setting. If you are male, you have to offer a diamond ring. (As a feminist you could ask: why not the opposite? Or: why don&#x27;t both offer diamonds?) If you are female, you have to put on a certain dress, and in general you are expected to dream about the wedding and everything related.<p>What is especially ridiculous is that people get away with calling it &quot;the happiest day of your life&quot;. Think about it: if it really is, then there is not much to expect after marriage. It&#x27;s time people start changing their attitude to this ritual and focus more on understanding the ways they could make each one happier in the long term.')
