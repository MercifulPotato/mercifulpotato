It&#x27;s true that (from the perspective of the people who built them), those advantages are the products of sunk costs, but the argument is about the ongoing value delivered, not the sunk cost involved in delivering it.<p>&gt; Not much about the actual language is appealing compared to modern languages.<p>Even if that was true, many of the actual languages competing with Python are <i>less</i> modern by any measure, and in any case so what? Does it matter when choosing a langauge if an advantage is produced by the abstract design of a language, it&#x27;s ecosystem, or the peculiarities of the available implementations? Advantages are advantages, value is value.<p>Sure, if you are considering how to promote a “modern” language against Python, it&#x27;s important to distinguish whether your current barrier is the design of your language or Python’s ecosystem to know how to direct your efforts, but if you aren&#x27;t a tool evangelist and instead are choosing a language for a project, I don&#x27;t see that it matters <i>why</i> Python is a net advantage, as long as it is.')
