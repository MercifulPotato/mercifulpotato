For instance, if I wanted to reply to your post - I would need to indicate my intent to reply, then after X minutes (at least 15, but ideally more) I would be able to respond.<p>The idea is to stop people posting the first thing that pops into their head: hopefully taking more time to formulate a response (or reconsidering if it was valuable to say anything at all).')
