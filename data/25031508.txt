That said, I do kind of feel like we&#x27;re operating from very different origins, not just in priorities and beliefs (which might not be all that different), but in understanding of the state of the world.  That said, in case you&#x27;re interested I&#x27;ll do my best to lay out how I see these things.<p>I can respect the position you laid out.  I agree that minimizing wars is a laudable goal. The Iraq war in particular was catastrophic, and Trump indeed didn&#x27;t start something like that.  He did do things that I felt made the world more dangerous, like the &#x27;little rocket man&#x27; taunts, and pulling out of the Iran deal, but I can understand the sentiment of supporting less foreign involvement.  That said, it just doesn&#x27;t seem like we&#x27;re sharing the same baseline worldview in terms of what constitutes corruption, or what behavior is excusable in a public figure.  I haven&#x27;t seen any evidence that Clinton or Biden is corrupt; Trump has said it a lot, but has he produced actual evidence?  On the other hand, there seems to be plenty of evidence of Trump profiting from the presidency, such as scheduling events at his properties.  Not to mention more serious offenses, like encouraging foreign leaders to investigate his opponents.<p>Much of what you call carnival barker behavior I see as divisive and immoral, from birtherism to calling into question the whole electoral system without apparent evidence. It basically seems like he&#x27;s willing to say literally anything if he thinks it will rile up support, even if it&#x27;s entirely made up, deeply insulting, or incredibly divisive.  To me the harms done by those actions and behaviors greatly outweigh the potential benefits, unless perhaps you believe that Clinton or Biden would have started another Iraq, which I don&#x27;t.  I guess we&#x27;ll see over the next few years. But we&#x27;ve already seen the harms, both domestically and abroad; I can tell you for instance that the US&#x27;s Canadian allies feel a lot less warmly toward not just Trump but the US as a whole after his attitude toward our country.<p>I actually wrote another couple paragraphs, but I really don&#x27;t want to be argumentative; I&#x27;m just trying to similarly lay out my point of view (if you&#x27;re even still checking this thread). I truly do want to understand the perspective of people who have a very different worldview than my own, especially when they seem reasonable and willing to engage. I realize my own guttural negative reaction toward Trump&#x27;s behaviour probably biases me against his actions and supporters as well, so I do try to guard against that.<p>Didn&#x27;t even get to climate change.  To be honest, that&#x27;s maybe the one issue where I would consider (although likely reject) supporting a Trump-like figure on the left, if they seemed likely to advance the goal, since the evidence I&#x27;ve seen really does suggest it&#x27;s a catastrophe in the making. I&#x27;m curious whether your belief that it won&#x27;t be that bad is more of a feeling based on past overreactions, or whether it&#x27;s based on evidence or expert opinion that I haven&#x27;t seen.  I&#x27;d certainly be happy to be convinced it indeed won&#x27;t be bad, but to be honest I can&#x27;t see how that could be, given what I see as pretty concrete evidence of both the fact and trajectory of climate change. We&#x27;re already seeing impacts on more frequent extreme weather events, and on shrinking habitat for polar and ocean wildlife, like polar bears and coral to name just a couple.<p>Anyway, I appreciate your reply, and conversations like this one do give me some hope for a less antagonistic future.')
