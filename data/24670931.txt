It&#x27;s also potentially easier to have your product in multiple supermarkets (assuming you don&#x27;t agree exclusivity), you just have to scale up your manufacturing - on an app store you need to produce a different version. That&#x27;s complicated by things like React Native and the fact that digital has no replication cost at all once written though. There are also more supermarkets vs 2 app stores, though they probably all do the same thing so I&#x27;m not sure how much that matters.')
