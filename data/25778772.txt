It’s not that you need to include a disclaimer on every comment, it’s that your participation is so narrowly focused on boosting cryptocurrencies that I can determine you’re invested in them at a glance. Participating more broadly would be more welcome, and would give more weight to your views here. (I am not a site admin, this is only the thoughts of someone else on HN.)')
