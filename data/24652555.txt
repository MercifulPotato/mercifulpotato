I love the article, and it made me aware of a lot of things I didn&#x27;t know.<p>However, my experience with USB-C is way better. I use the same charger for my laptop, pad and phone. I even use the same screen (with integrated docking station) for both my laptop and my phone (yay Samsung DeX), both at work and at home. This would have been impossible &#x2F; unimaginable half-a-decade ago. (Anyone remember the &quot;Lenovo-type&quot; docking station vs. the &quot;Dell-type&quot; docking station?)<p>I agree that USB-C still has challenges to overcome, but I find the direction so-far to be the right one.')
