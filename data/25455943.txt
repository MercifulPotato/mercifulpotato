Two people can look at a problem (build secure programs). The cs person sees static analysis, model checking, and other mathematically principled approaches as the solution. The engineer sees a suite of human approaches (code review, testing, fuzzing, audits, etc). I think the pure cs vision is narrow and limits our ability to choose the best method to solve a problem for the minimal price. Formal methods should be like unit tests, a component of the software engineering process. But it should also be acceptable to acknowledge its role and limits, just like how we donâ€™t rely exclusively on unit testing to deploy correct programs.')
