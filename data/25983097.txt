If I am the water company, and it’s in the water bottle interests, what stops the water company from simple saying “oh we have sewage issues” while the water bottle company rakes in the dough.<p>What I don’t get is why Robinhood didn’t outright explain this at first. It seems like it’s a good excuse and they announced it right after the media suggested this was the possibility.')
