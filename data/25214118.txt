The assumptions built in to reCaptcha just aren&#x27;t good. There are people that don&#x27;t accept cookies for anything, but who aren&#x27;t bots. There are real humans using text-only browsers. There are people who&#x27;s mouse and keyboard events fall far outside the expected range of normal human users, or who use aids such as macro keys that playback canned responses and confuse Google&#x27;s methods. So I can definitely imagine anyone who&#x27;s dealt with that shit for years being happy to have something different to try. Even if it&#x27;s just as annoying, at least it&#x27;s not the same damn thing!')
