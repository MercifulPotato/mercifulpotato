Indian people are moved by plight of poor farmers, which helps government subsidizes most of the inputs we require in farming. As most farms in India have pretty weak technology and automation, we are able to leverage subsidized inputs along with modern technology and produce yeilds as high as 20x the average yield.<p>Labor is cheap in India and it&#x27;s easily found specially when we pay more for slightly more safer and comfortable work.<p>Supporting farmers is a sentimental thing for people in India so we are able to produce very large profits to the tune of several millions yearly in profit.<p>Previously I was a software engineer for a western company based in India it was very stressful job as you need to be available for Oncall troubleshooting anytime.')
