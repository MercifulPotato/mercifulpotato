I worked on a project where CSV parsing was a significant bottleneck (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openaddresses.io&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;openaddresses.io&#x2F;</a>, it processes street addresses). Roughly 50% of the processing in the time is spent parsing CSV and decoding to Unicode. I dinked around a bit and tuned it to read at about 30 MB&#x2F;second and figured that was good enough. So this is a 100x speedup in reading (assuming all the stars align) which would cut that 50% down to nearly zero. Just as soon as it works transparently with a single Python import statement I&#x27;ll use it ;-)')
