Item(by='cloverich', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601821745, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24669030, text='&gt; mobx needs to walk all your store objects and check for changes, on top of what React does.<p>I don&#x27;t think that is quite correct. I think it keeps a mapping of observed properties and which React components rely on them. Then, changing any property becomes a lookup (not a walk) of who is observering, and a `forceRender` on the results. So if no components are observing the property, there&#x27;s no further computation. Its not &quot;on top of what React does&quot; because it short-circuits it (like useMemo) -- except you don&#x27;t have to hand-craft any useMemo comparators, it does that for you by tracking which properties you access.')
