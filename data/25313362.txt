You can&#x27;t limit yourself to comparing the amount released of both pollutants and not consider the scale of things. CO2 spreads all over the planet and remains in the atmosphere basically forever, until it is taken away, and particulate pollution is local and does not remain in the air for very long. Both should be addressed but they are not interchangeable.')
