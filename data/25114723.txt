The chess moves in it are apparently taken from Fischer and others, but it doesn&#x27;t credit Fischer in any other way.<p>Which is kind of weird considering the show did even the comparing the protagonist to Paul Morphy thing that also applied to Fischer.<p>The book also tackles themes like drug addiction and feminism, but I found the show&#x27;s take on these mostly pointless and superficial. Her drug addiction is never depicted as a struggle, she performs well drugged as well as sober, more of a comedic air to it than serious affliction.<p>It&#x27;s also slightly historically revisionist when claiming there were no female chess clubs in the US back then, when there actually were whole female national championships since the late 1930s. The show also claimed how in the USSR women would never play against men, completely ignoring the history of Nina Alexandrovna Bluket [1], who&#x27;s life would probably have made for a way more interesting and authentic story than a gender-swapped Bobby Fischer.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Queen%27s_Gambit_(novel)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_Queen%27s_Gambit_(novel)</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chess.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;Spektrowski&#x2F;pioneers-of-soviet-women-s-chess" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.chess.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;Spektrowski&#x2F;pioneers-of-soviet-wo...</a>')
