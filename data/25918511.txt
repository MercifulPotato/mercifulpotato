We believe the data protocol we have in place should address 95% of the use cases and, as we get more sophisticated use cases we will evolve the protocol (for example for more scale). Regarding the DX, we are continuously working on it to make it a breeze and ensure super high quality.<p>Answering your second question:\nFivetran functions are a nice escape hatch but none of the users we talked to mentioned those. They always mentioned building inhouse for missing connectors. My interpretation is that this is too much of a vendor lock-in for a cloud-based product.')
