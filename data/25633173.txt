Item(by='35fbe7d3d5b9', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609776649, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25632387, text='&gt; What&#x27;s the reason for allowing judges to remove jurors who admit their intent to acquit a guilty defendant?<p>Arguably, the same reason judges should be allowed to remove jurors who admit their intent to convict an innocent defendant: jurors must apply the law impartially.  The LII has a pretty decent primer on all this entails[1].<p>And almost all state laws require a jury to unanimously vote to convict, so empaneling a jury that has someone who will always acquit means that the jury&#x27;s decision has been set from the beginning.<p>Personally, I live in a state that requires a unanimous vote to convict or acquit, and prohibits the judge from &quot;poking at&quot; a deadlocked jury[2].  In the few times I&#x27;ve been selected for a jury I haven&#x27;t gone far enough to be asked if I would be impartial, and I&#x27;m glad because I&#x27;ve yet to decide where my personal ethics take me.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;constitution-conan&#x2F;amendment-6&#x2F;impartial-jury" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;constitution-conan&#x2F;amendment-6&#x2F;i...</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;wex&#x2F;allen_charge" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.law.cornell.edu&#x2F;wex&#x2F;allen_charge</a>')
