Besides which Firefox users are strongly opposed to &quot;nags&quot; in the browser as Mozilla have found. Even wikipedia, with it&#x27;s massive reach and yearly nags, &quot;only&quot; makes ~$120 million. Firefox could never hope to reach anything like that from donations alone and it needs many times that number to keep pace with Google Chrome&#x27;s practically unlimited funds.')
