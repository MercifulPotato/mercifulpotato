He has ready many such articles and has been microdosing on psilocybin mushrooms. He wanted my help to be with him as a sober person when he goes through the experience. I had to say no. I&#x27;ve two simple reasons.<p>1. Mushrooms are illegal in Australia. I don&#x27;t want him or I to be part of any illegal activity.<p>2. Even though he argued that the big pharma wouldn&#x27;t let this happen etc, modern medicine has saved so many lives that we at least should try to understand it better. I requested him to see a psychiatrist and go through therapy. Talk to the to professional and seek natural alternatives to prescription medicine, if available.<p>I could be wrong in my opinion. As a student of statistics, I&#x27;d love to read some study results on the effect of psilocybin before believing this.')
