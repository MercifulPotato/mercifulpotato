Abortion is not killing.<p>Our society defines it as okay. You apparently don&#x27;t agree with this but you are not the majority here.<p>No human aborts a fetus for fun.<p>My wife and i lost our &#x27;fetus&#x27; on the 3 month mark. There have been a lot of thoughts about this experience and lots of emotions. And i would probably abort a fetus with Down Syndrom.<p>No one is doing an abortion easy. It is never easy for whatever reason and its not your place to criticize it when its not your responsibility.<p>You have to understand one thing: People are able to seperate the wish of not having a kid with down syndrom from other human beings who have down syndrom.')
