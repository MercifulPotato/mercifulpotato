(&gt; 100k rows) The first (offset) was indeed on the order of 5x slower, but I suspect what the author saw with a 40ms to a 0.1ms time difference was that it wasn&#x27;t pre-warmed first run.<p>For me, with offset, the FIRST run was 25ms, but subsequet runs are around 2-3ms.  For `id &gt; 10000`, it was under 0.05ms.<p>It&#x27;s also very odd that they don&#x27;t do an `order by`. This seems important. Default ordering is semi-stable. It&#x27;ll tend not to change, but it can at any point. Benchmarking without that may be misleading.')
