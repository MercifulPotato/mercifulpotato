Nothing has been advertised for Spring, perhaps for Fall, but the administration is waiting on enrollment figures. Not holding my breath.<p>I expect more adjuncts, less non-tenure-track teaching faculty and the same amount of tenured faculty, even at teaching institutions where tenure-track faculty members are not expected to bring in external funding.
