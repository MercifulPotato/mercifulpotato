Western countries trying to their block access to that tech (eg the US govt trying to stop ASML from shipping chip machines to China), is going to speed that up, not slow it down, because it creates a giant internal market for such tech.<p>All the Chinese government has to do to accomplish this is sit back and wait. There&#x27;s plenty smart Chinese engineers and the market forces will do the rest.<p>(Source: I freelanced for a Chinese-owned lithography startup some years ago. It got run into the ground by bad management but that doesn&#x27;t change much about my observations about market forces and Chinese engineers)<p>I have a hard time taking the rest of your list all too seriously given that the one I know something about is, I think, mistaken.')
