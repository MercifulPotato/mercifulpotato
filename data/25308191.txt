There would be no academic debate on this topic as its been framed as woke and published by a militant activist, so any disagreement would be racist (see prior interactions between this researcher and other researchers [1]).<p>Thats why the standard process of publishing, peer reviewing, academic critique etc would not work.<p>Why would their researchers working on language models stay? when they can go to Facebook, OpenAI etc. Why would new researchers join?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;syncedreview.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;30&#x2F;yann-lecun-quits-twitter-amid-acrimonious-exchanges-on-ai-bias&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;syncedreview.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;06&#x2F;30&#x2F;yann-lecun-quits-twitter...</a>')
