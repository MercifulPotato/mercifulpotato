It&#x27;s a little challenging to do transparent proxying on a box that&#x27;s not the firewall. If the firewall and the proxy are on the same ethernet broadcast domain, you can forward the packets (i think for Linux you&#x27;d need to do policy routing on the port?, for ipfw there&#x27;s a forward action, i think pf would be route-to); and if they&#x27;re not, you&#x27;d need to tunnel the packets to the proxy.<p>NAT doesn&#x27;t really have much to do with it, other than you with NAT, you certainly have a device on your network that&#x27;s capable of being a transparent proxy, whereas without NAT, you could just have a unmanaged switch to share your upstream connection between multiple computers; assuming your provider is enlightened and provides ethernet or an ethernet bridge with nothing else in the way.')
