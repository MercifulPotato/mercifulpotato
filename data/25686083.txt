I am looking forward to how it plays out.  I think the first challenge will be getting adoption from MTA&#x27;s, smtp libraries and major email providers.  This can&#x27;t be done in a silo (server only) because smtp takes two to tango.  Both the sender and the receiver have to implement this concept to utilize it.  There will for sure be a handful of spammers that can&#x27;t get their malware updated right away so you would at least have a window of less spam.')
