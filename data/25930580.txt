Item(by='nuncid', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611766828, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25929975, text='The elevator pitch for the Culture (the society the books are based around) is that it&#x27;s a hyper advanced society governed&#x2F;managed by Culture Minds (equally hyper advanced AIs) that are powerful enough to pay individual attention to each and every citizen. Citizens are just being sentient enough that call themselves &quot;Culture citizens&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s no centralized power stricture, or even a clear definition of what counts as Culture or not. If a certain society within the Culture thinks their ideals drifted too much, they can just pack up and declare &quot;independence&quot;.<p>For individual citizens, they can pretty much do anything if they can convince someone (and only if they need resources). If they think it&#x27;s not really a utopia, they&#x27;re free to leave and join another society.<p>Most of the conflicts in the book happen because, in contrast to the Federation in Star Trek, the Culture actively tries to &quot;improve&quot; other civilizations they have a fundamental disagreement with, and how they try to not screw it up when there are equally powerful civilizations on the other side of the ideological divide.<p>So while you don&#x27;t get the story of how the Culture came to be, you do see it contrasted with a bunch of societies they try to improve.')
