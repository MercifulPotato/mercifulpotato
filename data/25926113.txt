So when someone like Josiah Zayner wanted to tackle a COVID vaccination trial on himself and other biohackers they already had the means and methods ready to go.<p>The problem is if you want to play by their (academia) rules you&#x27;re never going to making any inroads, you can&#x27;t publish and no one will give you a grant for your work, and you&#x27;re not going to be a chair of anything for your work even if it pans out: but, certain therapies are in development that started off as Biopunk&#x2F;Biohacker projects.<p>It&#x27;s super exciting and hard but also way more work than just BSing your way in academia into a professor role as its all too common occurrence. Professional students becoming mediocre professors was a far worse problem in the Sciences than I could have ever imagined, the one&#x27;s I really felt bad for were the post docs with actual meaningful research, often with severe social anxiety and poor speaking skills, but were forced to teach undergrad and simply just read the book aloud as &#x27;lecture.&#x27; My Organic Chem professor comes to mind, my inorganic professor (did his MSc at Cambridge!) was a rockstar to us undergrads and would do office hours during his lunch hour between lab research and the university made him protest before they&#x27;d release back pay during the cuts and layoffs.. it was pathetic and I felt so bad for him, my review was scathing of the University as I left and I&#x27;ve never really forgiven them for that.<p>Obviously with no VC model in Science to follow for anything but the most brazen outliers (theranos) it&#x27;s unlikely to happen. Personally I&#x27;d volunteer to help middle school or HS kids get involved in plant and Ag science and take some on in culinary if such an Industry still exists in the US after COVID and help them bypass the University track altogether. That is what I focused on after I left working in a lab, but there aren&#x27;t many avenues for this model to scale to take on massive projects due to a lack of funding. And the money and stability is abysmal, but the Science and fraternity of actual Scientists doing meaningful work is probably more than half of the reason most of us decided to study it in the first place.<p>Chamath needs to stop pretending to care about politics and solve real problems like funding Community Science wet-labs next to libraries to help the youth care about Science in a meaningful way instead of wasting their time on tik-tok or Instagram with his billions.')
