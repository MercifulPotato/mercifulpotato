That&#x27;s it. Work less hours. You need to solve the burn out issue.<p>Talk to your management and get a reduced number of hours every week. Do this for at least 3-6 months and see how you feel. Then go from there. You already know that 10M+ is fk you money. So you technically don&#x27;t need to work at all but I know that people like you cannot just sit on their butt. So &quot;compromise&quot; with your inner calling and don&#x27;t do 14+ hour days anymore :).')
