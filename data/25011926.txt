Item(by='btilly', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604703413, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25011372, text='That is indeed conventional wisdom.<p>But as <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxnews.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;musk-4-year-timeline-mars-mission" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foxnews.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;musk-4-year-timeline-mars-mi...</a> reports, in mid-October Elon Musk was claiming a fighting chance of launching a rocket there by 2024.  With that being a type of rocket that he intends to be making in volume for uses near Earth.<p>Given his past over-optimism, I&#x27;d take good odds against him in 2024, but would take an even money bet that he makes it for the 2026 window.  And given that he&#x27;s already gearing up for mass production, he&#x27;ll be able to send a bunch at the following 2029 window.  If he misses 2026, shift those dates to 2029 and 2031 instead.  (The windows come every 26 months, see <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;clowder.net&#x2F;hop&#x2F;railroad&#x2F;EMa.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;clowder.net&#x2F;hop&#x2F;railroad&#x2F;EMa.htm</a> for a list of dates.)<p>Either way, SpaceX is apparently on track to launch a fleet of ships to Mars in a decade or so.  With plans that the first launch will get there and explore, the second will be a bunch of ships that land and set up a base, and the third will hopefully be able to make a return trip using fuel produced on Mars.  From there, he&#x27;s aiming for serious colonization.<p>You may call him delusional.  I certainly did in 2008 when he was trying to get a rocket program off the ground using his private fortune.  But I would suggest not underestimating his ability to achieve on his vision (if not on the timeline that he pushes for).')
