The AMP feature allowed me to get around this, so instead of going to politico.com (which I blocked), I would instead, go to Google, type Politico, then read the stories via AMP.<p>So what I ended up doing, was to switch to DuckDuckGo as my phone&#x27;s primary search engine, and then I blocked google.com from my phone.  It seems drastic, but I am a big advocate of taking control of how you use your phone with the parental features, pointed at yourself.<p>I constantly notice that reading news on my phone makes me feel bad, but I have a hard time stopping.  This addiction to the news, is very correlated with times where I am tired or depressed.  It reminds me of drinking or smoking cigarettes in that respect.<p>I keep the PIN in 1Password, but I try to use it rarely and try to &quot;forget&quot; it.  So there&#x27;s an extra step to seeing the sites, looking up the PIN.  It&#x27;s helpful for me, perhaps it seems elaborate.<p>Because of all this, however, I am glad to see the AMP pages will be going away from Google&#x27;s search results, although I have found in the interim, that DuckDuckGo actually works pretty well for me.')
