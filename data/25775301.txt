There are 13 software jobs to the dozen, you don&#x27;t need any paperwork to work there, and â‚¬4k per month would be considered &quot;bad&quot; there. If I was in Latvia and spoke english I&#x27;d do it in a heartbeat. Even if I couldn&#x27;t physically move, I&#x27;d definitely try to get a remote job from there even if it meant a slighly lower pay than an on-site one.<p>Obviously, you&#x27;d have much higher living costs and the weather would be slighty worse, but lets face it no one lives in Latvia for the weather either!')
