The purpose is web search that&#x27;s ad-free, prioritizes content over SEO, and loads results quickly.<p>It starts with the Bing API, categorizes the query, then adds results from individual (subjectively) high-quality resources. Through a mix of automatic and manual adjustments, it arranges results in a way that prioritizes content and relevance over SEO.<p>Overall: Google states it discourages abusing its ranking; in practice, I&#x27;m not satisfied. Bing results are too mixed with ads. Duckduckgo is nice, but I&#x27;m not always satisfied with the results, especially for technical questions, and it doesn&#x27;t tackle SEO misuse directly.<p>This is a WIP - I&#x27;d value any suggestions, critique, visual&#x2F;technical&#x2F;approach problems, etc. I hope I haven&#x27;t over-fit this to my own habits.')
