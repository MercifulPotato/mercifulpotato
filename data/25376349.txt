Feynman had a lot to say about light in his book (QED <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;QED-Strange-Theory-Light-Matter&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0691024170" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;QED-Strange-Theory-Light-Matter&#x2F;dp&#x2F;06...</a>) and never framed it this way. At one point he remarked that the explanations in the book were related to diffraction, and the explanation there was very different from the Fourier transform.')
