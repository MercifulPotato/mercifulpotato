I guess Balmer deserves some credit at least for hiring him?<p><i>MS under Ballmer lost couple of generations of programmers</i><p>A lot of younger programmers may not realize this, but in the 90’s, all roads led to Microsoft. If you were a programmer and you didn’t know at least some of the MS acronym soup of Win32&#x2F;VB&#x2F;ATL&#x2F;MFC&#x2F;etc&#x2F;etc, you weren’t getting paid. Microsoft and Windows completely dominated commercial software development. And then what happened?<p>Balmer tried stupidly to kill the web. He redeployed the IE team and assumed that the web would stagnate without his attention. He’d killed Netscape and the threat had passed. In the meantime, Mozilla and Apple and Google were forming the whatwg and architecting the next generation of the web. And MS was not only not a part of it, but had lost all credibility in the eyes of web and browser devs.<p>And then of course he also got caught flat-footed by the iPhone. Balmer was a serial failure as a CEO. Maybe he deserves some credit, a little bit at least for Azure? But he’ll always be remembered for all of those stupid quips he made about how Apple wasn’t going to be able to make headway in the smartphone biz.')
