Your only justification so far seems to be a combination of &quot;both sides are the same&quot; and &quot;well some people don&#x27;t object to <i>all violence</i>&quot;.<p>My argument is that, well no, both sides aren&#x27;t the same, as shown by the fact that <i>only one set of protestors was openly advocating for and planning to attack people</i>. The burden of proof is on you to show that they both sides are in fact the same. I obviously can&#x27;t prove a negative, and so far you haven&#x27;t provided anything concrete.')
