Since the OpenCL implementation on question is built on ROCm, it may be that other ROCm-related stuff works as well.<p>My impression from the various comments left by devs on Phoronix and elsewhere is that they&#x27;ve just managed to right the boat on the GPU side of things and are getting enough from their enterprise&#x2F;HPC offerings (which they were solely focused on, to the detriment of all us consumers) to have some bandwidth to start tackling consumer compute support. I really hope they do so, because all the ROCm ecosystem could use some major TLC. Who knows, maybe this time next year you&#x27;ll be able to install PyTorch with AMD GPU support OOTB.')
