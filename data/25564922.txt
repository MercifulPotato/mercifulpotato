The current view is to build all the intelligence into the cars, but as we&#x27;ve seen from Tesla, this effort is hard and there are an unlimited number of variables the vehicle needs to adapt to.<p>However, if the cars were able to communicate and get information from the road itself (speed limit, turns, traffic control etc) then the car doesn&#x27;t need to be able to figure this out. Yes, it&#x27;d take awhile to retrofit roads.<p>Car to Car communication could be used to let vehicles know how the traffic is flowing without needing to use radar&#x2F;lidar to determine when traffic is slowing ahead.<p>These are very basic thoughts on the subjects.')
