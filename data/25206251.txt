Now pivoting to serving SMBs and startups with hiring as I am burned out on helping retail...<p>For some reason, folks (individual job seekers) think they can do it on their own and there is an incredible amount of price sensitivity there. In my own career spanning 25 years and then running this business for 5 years, I remain shocked at how little calculation people do on the ROI of doing it themselves vs. re: hiring a specialist and the doors it could open. I venture at least a 10x return on the latter based on experience.<p>The only pleasure I have found is working with senior people who understand the value of the service and will pay whatever it takes (~500-1000 USD), to be maximally competitive.  It&#x27;s like the old story, you would not do brain surgery on yourself. I am not saying resumes, etc. are extraordinarily difficult.  But most people don&#x27;t know the best practices, can&#x27;t write well in English, and don&#x27;t have the proper time to create. Hence, they fail.<p>Lastly, it is really hard getting public testimonials even when clients succeed since there is this ridiculous falsehood that everyone carries around. Job seekers must appear to have done it all themselves or the employer will pull offers.  Silly but true.')
