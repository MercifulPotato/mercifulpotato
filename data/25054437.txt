We&#x27;re not about trying to stay just below the line here. There&#x27;s no nefarious Man holding us down. We just want a certain level of civil discourse. I try not to say anything here that I wouldn&#x27;t say in person, or wouldn&#x27;t want tied to my real identity. I can be obnoxious at times, here and in person, and I appreciate being called out for it. HN is now the only place I interact with random Internet people, because the civility level is so high.')
