Item(by='scarmig', descendants=None, kids=[25204173], score=None, time=1606258807, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25203963, text='The fact that dating and matching patterns actually did change indicates that this isn&#x27;t about attraction but UX choices that encourage thoughtless biases. Yes, of course Asian men would still have worse outcomes, but those outcomes would be those determined by actual patterns of attraction and not exacerbated by app design. And if someone has to swipe left an extra 10% of the time because they absolutely can&#x27;t stand Asian guys... I mean, so be it. No one&#x27;s entitled access to a particular filter.<p>For point of comparison, most heterosexual dating apps steadfastly refuse to add weight filters, despite them being the most demanded filters (aside from height). Why? Usually there are excuses about how it&#x27;s impossible to implement or that the people who want weight filters are confused about what they want, but somehow LGBT dating apps all are able to add weight filters without any difficulty or controversy. Why weight filters are considered an undesirable feature in heterosexual dating apps is left as an exercise to the reader.<p>And dating apps could, in principle, tell the people who want race filters to pound sand just as much as they tell the people who want weight filters to pound sand. The fact that they don&#x27;t is a political choice.')
