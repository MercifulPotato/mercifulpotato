That&#x27;s why sony implemented a streaming library for older games instead.<p>Emulation alone wouldn&#x27;t have worked because some folks more knowledgeable than I am have said that the PS3 chip was more powerful than even some modern CPUs. Streaming is really the only relatively universal and financially viable solution for that older library of games.<p>&gt; VAN DER LEEUW: Even desktop chips nowadays, the fastest Intel stuff you can buy is not by far as powerful as the Cell CPU, but itâ€™s very difficult to get power out of the Cell. I think it was ahead of its age, because it was a little bit more like how GPUs work nowadays, but it was maybe not balanced nicely and it was too hard to use. It overshot a little bit in power and undershot in usability, but it was definitely visionary.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gameinformer.com&#x2F;feature&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;03&#x2F;the-first-25-years" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gameinformer.com&#x2F;feature&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;03&#x2F;the-first-25...</a>')
