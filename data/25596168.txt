Because you don&#x27;t have time to deal with the mess that C++ has become, and the amount of please-repeat-yourself-a-million-times crap you have to deal with (cmake files, header files, they give us a goddamn spaceship operator but not basic necessities like string split&#x2F;join methods)<p>1. There are many use cases where faster execution time is nice to have, e.g. when results can be cached for a long time, or if it&#x27;s a one-off data analysis script, but human time is far more expensive. If it costs $1000 more in engineer hours to write C++ instead of Python for that script that&#x27;s only going to be run 10 times, that isn&#x27;t a worthwhile tradeoff. Hell you could buy a new GPU for that money.<p>2. Because the same exact file can be deployed on arm32, arm64, and x86<p>3. Because CPU-intensive stuff is largely already optimized by numpy, numba, tensorflow, pytorch, etc.')
