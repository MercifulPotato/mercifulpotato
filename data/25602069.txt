Is the banking ststem really that broken in Indonesia?<p>My experience is that bank fees vary greatly.<p>My (limited) experience with US banks is that they have huge hidden fees and you get really bad currency exchange rates. I&#x27;m talking about 8% of funds miraculously disappearing during currency exchange. I don&#x27;t understand why anybody would bother going via USD.<p>My Austrian bank on the other hand has much better rates and low fees. I think it was less than 1% for transfers of a few thousand USD last time I checked.<p>And finally, there are services like Transferwise; I just checked and they show rates of 1.5 - 2% for converting IDR to RUB.')
