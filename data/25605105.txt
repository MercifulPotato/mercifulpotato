Which meant that my cost per hour of entertainment was less than $1.<p>I remember when one could buy a game for $50 and play it for 250-400 hours (unlocking hidden things, playing with multiple friends with just my purchase). Roughly a dime for entertainment. In some cases, it was sub a penny USD.<p>You have some expensive hobbies my friend.')
