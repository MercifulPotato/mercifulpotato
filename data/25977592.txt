And if I could choose only one of the two, I would much prefer it as a societal norm rather than a government policy, precisely because government is downstreams from societal norms. Ie. societal norms eventually become government policy.<p>In my view then, freedom of speech is much more a social phenomena than a governmental phenomena. Are you able to speak about the things that matter to you, without prosecution from any entity, governmental or not? The reason why freedom of speech is important, is because we want ideas that are counter to mainstream narratives to be able to set root in society. History tells us that societies need to adapt and change over time for various reasons. And freedom of speech is the engine of that change and adaptation.')
