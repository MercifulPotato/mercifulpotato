I mean the pebble time had 128kb ram (this only has 64k ram), an color epaper display, 150mAh battery (over a week battery life), heart rate sensors, etc. Heck its even being supported by the open source community AFTER it was discontinued.<p>Maybe Fitbit can be petitioned to make the Pebble&#x27;s hardware fully open source too.')
