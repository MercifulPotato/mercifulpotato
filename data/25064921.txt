Item(by='dqv', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605141914, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25045571, text='With put_assoc, at least for me, I expected it to work the same way when creating a record vs editing a record, but that isn&#x27;t the case. While put_assoc is additive when you are first creating the record, the same is not true when modifying a record. You have to provide <i>all</i> the original data in addition to the new record when modifying it.<p>Comments for that reason aren&#x27;t a good use case for put_assoc, because generally you add a comment one at a time. It makes more sense to just create a new comment with the associated post ID.<p>Also the string keys in structs weirded me out - I don&#x27;t think that works in Elixir.')
