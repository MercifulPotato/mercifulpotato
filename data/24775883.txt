Item(by='danaris', descendants=None, kids=[24779428, 24776013], score=None, time=1602679598, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24774889, text='Babylon 5 is actually a great example of what happens when you mess with cancellations.<p>During the production of season 4, JMS (the creator) was given to understand that season 5 was unlikely to happen. So he had to cram most of the rest of his plot into that season.<p>Having such a powerful, story-packed season 4 meant it did really well. So they put season 5 back on.<p>But he&#x27;d already used up (most of) the story he wanted to tell, because they told him he wasn&#x27;t getting a season 5. So the season 5 we got ended up being a bit weak and wandering, with only the last few episodes (which were part of what would have been the ending of season 4, if he hadn&#x27;t found out in time that there would be a season 5) having the same strength and memorability as the season 4 episodes.<p>It also meant (IIRC) that they lost some important actors, like Claudia Christian, for season 5. If Ivanova had been able to stay on to be B5&#x27;s captain after Sheridan became President, the final season would have been much stronger.')
