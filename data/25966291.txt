I love my remote work lifestyle, especially since I have kids at home. But it works for me partly because I have a strong network that I built earlier in my career in face-to-face settings. There are lots of people I can call outside of my immediate group to learn about different areas, hear the actual gossip in some sub-industry, or get a recommendation for folks to hire. I&#x27;ve found it much harder to make new connections like that while remote, and I think this lends itself to professionally productive but not personally close relationships.')
