Do you put it (or keep it) in a bank-account? That is an investment choice you have. If you have more money than you need for living then you are already investing it in some way, maybe a bank-account. And you make this investment decision following some algorithm in your head. So if you algorithm was so great wouldn&#x27;t it make sense to use it rather than put money into a low-interest bank-account?<p>My point is when it comes to investing, inaction IS action too. Therefore an investment algorithm does not need to beat the market. It just needs to beat doing nothing.<p>Consider that if you have earnings you can put money into an IRA account and then trade with it almost for free.')
