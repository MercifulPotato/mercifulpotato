Of course it can.<p>Buy any leaded petrol lately? Aerosols with CFCs? Landmines?<p>Why? Because nobody wants those things. The companies that made them liked them because they were more profitable than the alternatives (see also: labour laws, etc), but people just wanted transportation and deodorant.<p>&gt; Cheaper energy always means cheaper production costs.\nAbsolutely, and a capitalist system will force companies to that cheaper energy to compete. That&#x27;s not a criticism, that&#x27;s a statement of fact.<p>So how do you fix that? \nMake renewables cheaper through government investment and make fossil fuels more expensive through taxes, etc.<p>It&#x27;s not rocket science.<p>That isn&#x27;t to say it&#x27;s easy. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s probably the single greatest challenge humanity has faced.<p>But we cannot simply pray to the invisible hand to save us. It really doesn&#x27;t care.')
