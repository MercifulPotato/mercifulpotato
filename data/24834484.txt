(Plus, creating hundreds of TCP&#x2F;IP + JSON overhead for single bit events.)<p>I&#x27;ve used the following pattern in the past:\n- generally only send batched data in as large an interval as possible\n- if somebody looks at a device, immediately (well, might take some seconds) query the batched data and switch device to a &quot;live&quot; mode that provides live data instead of &quot;wait and batch&quot;.<p>This will be a bad idea for scenarios where there&#x27;s a reasonable expectation of surges of people needing &quot;live&quot; access, but for our use cases of industrial data, it works very well. We only watch our own devices, which are in the lower tens of thousands, but I don&#x27;t see why this should not scale to more, under the restrictions mentioned above.')
