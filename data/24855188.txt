Item(by='Taniwha', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603344771, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24855089, text='heh, probably - the hard part is the code that&#x27;s hacking the stack pointer and return address on the stack out from underneath you when they do a context switch (rather than V7&#x27;s C-standard setjmp()&#x2F;longjmp() semantics). That part needs diagrams.<p>The easier part I was trying to explain was the meaning of the SSWAP and the return(1) which effectively bring you back somewhere different returning a 1 where another routine returns a 0 (a bit like setjmp&#x2F;longjmp) - this routine when called to do a context switch usually doesn&#x27;t return anything')
