Item(by='jorams', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611974078, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25964561, text='I agree &quot;the new IE6&quot; is a tad much, but this...<p>&gt; there are a growing number of areas where Chrome and Firefox have nearly identical behavior and Safari is the odd one out.<p>...is definitely true for me when developing relatively simple sites. I develop in Firefox and it&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve had to change any CSS to make it work in Chrome. Meanwhile Safari has had broken default SVG sizing for years now (unless they fixed it recently), ignores padding on &lt;select&gt; (so you need to set the height) and other things like that.<p>It&#x27;s all minor, but it&#x27;s annoying to deal with. Especially considering you need Apple hardware to test with.<p>But I can&#x27;t complain too much, since I also still need to support IE11.')
