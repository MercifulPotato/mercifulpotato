If you wanted to know that your code was bug free, how could you do it? Set a team of experts to each independently scour for bugs. But when do you stop? The quick answer is that you should keep going until every bug you&#x27;ve found, has been found at least twice. I think of this as being that you &quot;just barely&quot; found a bug if only one person identified it, so there are probably still bugs you have &quot;just barely&quot; not found remaining.')
