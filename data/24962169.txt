I can essentially opt in to opening a data channel to a peer because its core to the technology and feature set. I don&#x27;t expect opening a link to a video exposes me to another random person or computer watching the same video.<p>Another fundamental difference is that video conferences are temporary. Hosted videos are persistent. I can just have a machine hang out watching a video on loop and sniff peers coming in, quite reliably if the video is popular.<p>Another point I&#x27;d bring up is that video conferencing apps&#x27; threat model is essentially around unauthorized access. It&#x27;s dealt with by obscuring the video stream&#x27;s link, making it temporary, and securing it behind an authorization protocol (on Zoom you have login, password, and manual admitting by the host, for example). That doesn&#x27;t really fit if you&#x27;re hosting videos to be persistent.')
