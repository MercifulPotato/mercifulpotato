I was at the playground and my kids started playing with this hippie mom&#x27;s kids.  We started talking about what a weird time it is to be a kid.  We ended up making a playdate for the kids and she mentioned she does not wear masks because of some spiritual reasons.   I was surprised because I thought that anti maskers were all right leaning.  I told her no mask is fine we can just do our playdate outside somewheres.  I am a conservative atheist hunter and think it is good for my kids to be able to play with spiritual hippie vegan kids.<p>Anyway I guess my point is life is better if you judge people on their individual merits rather than group membership.')
