For that reason, if you want to run benchmarks, you should generally wait until it&#x27;s done with that (e.g. an hour or probably less with these speedybois). It might be that the people running the Pro benchmarks didn&#x27;t wait for that, in their rush to publish the first benchmark. This would be consistent with what we&#x27;re seeing - the Pro has faster single core performance, but slightly lower multicore, because some of its &quot;background&quot; cores were busy creating the index, while the Air was done with that task.')
