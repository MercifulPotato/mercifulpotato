Or a true statement that follows from the axioms?<p>2) On formulas, this example is shown (there-is a (= (next 0) a)). It is not clear whether this is a necessarily true statement or some symbols relating a and 0.<p>3) He says that proofs are a sequence of formulas but colloquially they are sequence of &quot;implications&quot;. That &quot;implication&quot; is introduced later on and it is shown that this &quot;implication&quot; symbol also needs to be proved (successor). Didn&#x27;t he use the fact that one thing implies another multiple times previously?<p>I need the distinction amongst &quot;statement&quot;, &quot;formula&quot; and &quot;axioms&quot;.<p>Apologies if the above looks like a vegetable soup but I&#x27;d love some explanation for this.')
