A 256-bit seed is enough to generate all the random bytes you&#x27;ll ever want: just use Chacha20 with fast key erasure, and you&#x27;re done. <i>(Fast key erasure crash course: start with an encryption key and a stream cipher. Encrypt 512 bytes worth of zeroes. The first 32 bytes of the ciphertext are your new key. The rest can feed &#x2F;dev&#x2F;urandom. Once a byte is served, erase it. Once you run out of bytes, generate 512 more bytes. New generators can be forked off by simply requesting 32 random bytes.)</i><p>From <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cr.yp.to&#x2F;20140205-entropy.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.cr.yp.to&#x2F;20140205-entropy.html</a><p><pre><code>  how can anyone simultaneously believe that:\n  - we can&#x27;t figure out how to deterministically expand one\n    256-bit secret into an endless stream of unpredictable\n    keys (this is what we need from urandom), but\n  - we _can_ figure out how to use a single key to safely\n    encrypt many messages (this is what we need from SSL,\n    PGP, etc.)? \n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t.
