Item(by='NiceWayToDoIT', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1608808599, title='Ask HN: Does anyone measures accountability of ads?', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='During this year I have watched a considerable number of youtube videos (give me a slack it is pandemic), and during the same period thousands of times, repeatedly, Youtube&#x2F;Google posted 3 - 5 same adverts.\nSome lame phone video game (and I play games over the phone once in a blue moon), some Israeli social advert (I do not even know the language), Master class and rarely some Chinese tool-making company...\nI am not interested in any of those, at first, I was interested in Master class, but now I can firmly say that I will never not in a million years buy any of their products. When media tries forcing some adverts on me that repels me even more. The strange thing is that I am logged in all the time, so Google knows to whom they were serving those adverts.<p>So, my questions are:\nIs their advert algorithm broken? \nIs there some kind of tracking mechanism where google can justify the quality of their advert campaigns? \nDo those companies paying for those adverts care at all about them being repeatedly shown to the same users?\nWhen I asked does anyone measures, I mean outside of Google?<p>Google is advert money-making machine so I cannot believe that they use a technique known as &quot;throwing flyers into the bin and claiming job is done&quot;...<p>At the end is it just me or it is wide spread?')
