He effectively flushed it all down the toilet for a punt on Windows Mobile, which was already looking like an &quot;also-ran&quot; by that point. When it (predictably) didn&#x27;t work out, MS took the brand and some of the company, then ran it into the ground.<p>A sad end to what had been a huge success story.<p>(I&#x27;m not challenging the idea that nokia was on a downward slope by the point he came along, but he just accelerated it, see e.g. the burning platforms memo)')
