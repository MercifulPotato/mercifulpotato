I&#x27;m not saying this from a perspective that they are wrong, but that I honestly don&#x27;t get it, please help me understand it. My response is about ambition related stress.<p>I&#x27;ve had experiences in war torn countries and seen those that are drastically less fortunate than the author. For the author to say that they have terror and flashbacks that will hunt them.... is this just a perspective thing? The author mentions twice he had been in a war related country.<p>Is it a self imposed stress to do well that is greater than the stress that those in poverty and war stricken countries deal with? Is it all relative? I feel like there is real stress involved with ambition from reading this.<p>I mean this honestly, I read this post and feel this is a first world problem post. What am I missing?')
