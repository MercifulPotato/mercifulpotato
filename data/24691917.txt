You know roughly when you will get tired from driving: plan around that. Technology won&#x27;t save you from poor judgement.<p>I do agree, power-naps are amazing to help you regain focus. One time I was driving and it was almost dawn, and I was desperately trying to force myself to reach the next town so I could get a room. I realized I probably wouldn&#x27;t even make it that far and pulled over at the next rest stop and slept for 30 minutes.
