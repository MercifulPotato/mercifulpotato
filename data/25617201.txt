I&#x27;d be very surprised if military aircraft designers did not do something similar.<p>In any case it&#x27;s also good military thinking. Sun Tzu already said that the pinnacle of warfare is to gain victory without fighting, and one of the ways to do so is to look so menacing that your opponent does not want to engage. Sleek, powerful looking military hardware has that effect much more than bloated and clunky stuff.')
