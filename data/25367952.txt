The package will include a list of files which it installs\n2. The package manager will not overwrite existing files <i>which were installed by dpkg</i> without an explicit diversion\n3. When uninstalling, the package manager will remove any of those files, and the directories created for them (unless they are not empty or are also crated by another package)\n4. It won&#x27;t run as non-root (unless you&#x27;ve made some major changes to your system), and as such won&#x27;t prompt you for, or try to take advantage of, sudo access.<p>Sure, that doesn&#x27;t stop out-of-the-norm behaviour; the Oracle Java packages are a great example of this; the packages contain only a shell script which downloads, unpacks, copies, and symlinks the actual Oracle Java tarball from Oracle&#x27;s website, and then (ideally) removes those packages if you&#x27;re uninstalling. Still, it&#x27;s far more of guarantees than curl|bash provides.')
