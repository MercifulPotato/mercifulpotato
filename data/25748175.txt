First, you have your fleet&#x27;s main channel where most of the membership is going to be.  So far so good.<p>At the top of the list are leadership channels. These guys can talk to and hear their own fleet but with can also instantly page other people in leadership (corp leadership and also other fleet commanders).<p>Then at the bottom of the list are specific group sub-channels. For example, your scouts and your logistics players need a good amount of coordination with each other, so they will have a lil room where they can talk at each other without tying up comms for the main fleet or distracting leadership with stuff that isn&#x27;t actionable to them.<p>Then you can add in a whole extra layer of complexity if you are part of an alliance with multiple corps in it.<p>You basically can&#x27;t do that in discord unless you want to have to switch between different channels the entire time. It might sound overkill but if you have 90+ players in your fleet you cannot get away with &#x27;just put everyone in a big room&#x27;.')
