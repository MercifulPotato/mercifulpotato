You gotta trawl through tutorials and connect a bunch of libraries just to get a simple CRUD app with user auth set up. In a couple years, hopefully we&#x27;ll have a mature default library for most usecases and they&#x27;ll play nice with each other.<p>For instance, there&#x27;s exactly one JWT library. To get a simple auth setup going, I&#x27;d need to connect this JWT library to my password setup, which I&#x27;m gonna need to design too, since I&#x27;m using a barebones password hashing lib. Now I need to write the token exchange and validation logic. Then manually put the token in the header&#x2F;response, etc.<p>Compare that to Rails where I can install devise_token_auth and just have tokens out of the box. No fuss.')
