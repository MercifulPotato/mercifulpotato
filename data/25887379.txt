I have the Pi set up to make a reverse SSH tunnel back to my house.  I can then tunnel VNC &#x2F; RDP and help debug any issues they are having with their own home computers.<p>One Pi is used to wake up my remote file server with a Wake On LAN packet.  The Pi idles at under 2W while the file server uses about 80W when on.  I run my backups and then put the file server back to sleep.')
