As a friendly vegetarian myself (I don’t ever try to convince anyone or inconvenience anyone - just avoid products myself), I sometimes get “attacked” along the lines of “oh, so you&#x27;re vegetarian? But you know animals have no awareness&#x2F;intelligence&#x2F;sentience&#x2F;soul&#x2F;etc right?<p>Also, some languages use the same word for “meat” and “flesh”, maybe that’s the same in the alien language? After all, they don’t seem to have any fresh anywhere.')
