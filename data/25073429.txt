If the source data isn&#x27;t 100% clean and compatible with the destination, it is such a pain to get it working.<p>I eventually got it set up, but for the amount of effort involved, I could have just wrote my own custom ETL solution in less time.<p>The scheduling jobs and triggers is nice once set up.
