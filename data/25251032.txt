Item(by='h3rald', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606714655, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25227181, text='I agree 100%, but more than anything for me was <i></i>control<i></i>: I had been using nanoc (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nanoc.ws" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nanoc.ws</a>) for years and don&#x27;t get me wrong, that&#x27;s an excellent piece of software... but then I &quot;left it&quot; for a few months also because I stopped coding in Ruby for a while (and stopped blogging) .When I came back to it, I discovered that a new major version was out and I had to upgrade, potentially breaking quite a bit of things because I didn&#x27;t keep the pace with the new changes.<p>While this is true for nearly all software, I missed being in control of <i>when</i> to upgrade, and I also missed a few little features here and there. The result? I shopped around for it a bit and then decided to roll out my own: HastySite (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hastysite.h3rald.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hastysite.h3rald.com</a>) which now powers a bunch of sites of mine like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;h3rald.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;h3rald.com</a> and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;min-lang.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;min-lang.org</a><p>Actually I ended up writing my own markdown processor and my own programming language before doing that (which also needed a Readline&#x2F;line noise replacement, and wrappers for a regexp and compression library) but... hey, that&#x27;s part of the fun isn&#x27;t it? That&#x27;s the very reason why I love being a programmer: it&#x27;s not about the final result, it&#x27;s about how you get there and what you learn along the way.<p>So kudos to you sir, I wish you all the best and that you build more things yourself.')
