You will be labeled instantly as &quot;provider&quot;, not as a &quot;lover&quot;.<p>Most women that have &quot;providers&quot; also have &quot;lovers&quot; and usually it is not the same person.<p>That is a lesson that I learned long time ago, when I met a very successful with women man, that actually treated them very badly. He had the mentality that it were women the ones  that should prove their value to him.<p>Over the years I met other people with the same mindset, and even started applying it somewhat myself. I am physically attractive and educated, but I also was for some time too much polite with women, putting them on a pedestal for being successful with them.<p>The most attractive thing for women is character strength. Also things like being a world traveler helps a lot. You can be penniless, if you have those two things, attracting all the women you want is no problem.')
