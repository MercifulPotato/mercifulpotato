I don&#x27;t think the Americans that occupied Iraq in 2003 were as friendly with the company that stood behind Saddam&#x27;s chemical attacks against the Kurds in the 1980s.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hans_Speidel" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Hans_Speidel</a>')
