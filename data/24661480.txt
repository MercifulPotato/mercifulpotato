Most black Americans are descended from enslaved Africans. Their forebears suffered through the segregation and racial terror of the Jim Crow era. The majority of black people in the United Kingdom, by contrast, are immigrants or the children of immigrants. Though many of them have certainly had harrowing experiences with injustice or discrimination, they do not have the same history of racist disadvantage.</i><p>This is a key bit here that also applies to the Netherlands. Most, if not all, black (and Moroccan, Turkish etc) Dutch people are either immigrants or children of immigrants.<p>This sheds a whole different light on statistics, imho. If you move a big chunck of Dutch people to Turkey it would not be weird if their kids wouldn&#x27;t be CEO&#x27;s, high level politicians or so. That&#x27;s just not how that works, especially when your parents were lower educated, and in many cases can&#x27;t (couldn&#x27;t) read any Latin based language.<p>Yet the debate here around racism &quot;borrows&quot; arguments form the US, where black people have been living for 400 years sometimes and STILL aren&#x27;t even close to representation in the &#x27;top&#x27; layer of society.<p>Just like in the UK, Dutch media is bloody obsessed with the US.')
