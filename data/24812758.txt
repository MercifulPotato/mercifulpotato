It&#x27;s the reason we have more gun deaths than other countries and it will be the reason we will always lead in pandemic deaths if they somehow reach our shores.<p>You will never get 20 million Americans per week to line up for testing unless it&#x27;s the same 20 million over and over. You will never get Americans to sign up for voluntary contact tracing or vaccines. You can barely get half of us to wear masks all the time.<p>Furthermore, the federal government is limited in what it can enforce. It is up to the states individually to enforce these rules. The populace in many places have no desire to continue a locked-down, mask-mandated existence, regardless of the cost.<p>If COVID-19 had the same symptoms as Ebola all these things would change dramatically.<p>I say all this because the Election is marked on this timeline as if it&#x27;s going to have a major impact on the pandemic in the U.S. I don&#x27;t believe it will. We may see an impact but I think it will just be a result of having the pandemic fizzling out due to herd immunity etc.')
