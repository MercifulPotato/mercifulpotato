Why do you think we had Occupy Wall Street, and why are populists on the left <i>and</i> right, like Sanders and Trump, gaining in popularity? Why did Andrew Yang and Bernie Sanders poll highest among Trump voters? It&#x27;s because the <i>real</i> middle class of blue- and white-collar work at a stable career has been vanishing. Much of this is due to bad trade and jobs policy, some is due to automation.<p>The number skills that are useful today are also less than they used to be. The need for actually skilled manual labor has been outsourced to China, Taiwan, and increasingly India.<p>And don&#x27;t forget the swindle of universities â€” 18 year olds signing themselves away to lifelong debt to party, drink, and learn at an institution that couldn&#x27;t care less about their future prospects. People who leave college with degrees in anything but highly desirable fields are learning they&#x27;ve been lied to about the importance of a degree.')
