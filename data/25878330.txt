And I know about all the different targets from all the different car makers. They actually have public plans of how many EV they will build (and very often they actually fall short of their own plans).<p>More importantly I know about global battery capacity and how new capacity gets added and how much. I also know how much lithium, cobalt and nickel is mined and how much needs to be mined for the global industry.<p>You still believe that Tesla is some small player that is gone get crushed by the larger competition. Tesla has a higher market cap, easier time to raise cash, is the largest consumer of Li-Ion, has the largest long term supply contracts for materials, is close partner to all major battery producers (LG,CATL,Panasonic) and they are by far the most vertically integrated and they will soon add their own batteries to mix. In a 3-4 years Tesla will be one of the bigger battery producers in the world themselves.<p>We also know have a good idea how long it takes car makers to produce new vehicles and secure the supply chain. Look at &#x27;all in on EV&#x27; GM, they are building a massive battery factory that by 2025 will be smaller then Giga Nevada is right now. In that same time Tesla plans to build another factory that will more then double or triple output of current Nevada and Giga Nevada will continue to grow as well.<p>Ford has no supply chain at all in North America and relies on LG in Poland. We know about how much output is planned from there and most of that is not for Ford. Ford has already realized that their idea of just &#x27;buying what in the market&#x27; will limited them a huge amount.<p>Batteries can not be magically created, nor can lithium mines. We already know about all the battery factories that will go online and we know where they will send most of their supply. Nobody will catch up to Tesla in the next couple years.')
