It is indeed native arm, which is why virtualization suffices. To run x64 windows you would need to emulate.<p>The virtualization is needed because you are running the guest OS on top of the host OS. The same situation as if you were running x64 windows on an intel mac (e.g. via Virtualbox, vmware, or Parallels): in both cases you need kernel-level support in the host OS so that it can act as a hypervisor, and hardware support from the processor (in Intel it&#x27;s done via vt-x) to support things like nested paging, ring -1, etc.')
