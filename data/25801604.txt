Rust is a language in the C++ tradition and, like C++, is one of the most complicated programming languages in the history of software, while Zig is probably among the simplest. Some people like elaborate languages and find the design, which mixes C++ and ML appealing. Zig is unlike anything else.<p>I would say that the biggest philosophical difference is this. While Zig and C++&#x2F;Rust are all low-level languages and so suffer from low abstraction (it comes with the territory) -- i.e. implementation details are hard to hide, and changing them requires changing in the APIs clients -- C++&#x2F;Rust invest a lot of complexity in trying to make the code, once written, <i>look as if</i> the language has good abstraction. The code is still as hard to change, but it <i>looks</i> like a high-level language on the page. Some people may like that, but Zig completely rejects that.')
