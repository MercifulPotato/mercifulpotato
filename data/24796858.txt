Can laser sintering produce a bolt or pin that can withstand the same forces as other manufacturing techniques? Or will there be weaknesses in it. There are some parts that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem, but many others where serious study is going to be required to verify that the aircraft won&#x27;t break in a catastrophic way while in flight.<p>As a non-3d printing example: A drone aircraft used a COTS product as its drive shaft. The same part was bought for years, no problem. Suddenly the drones started literally falling from the sky. Turned out the COTS product had changed manufacturing source and the quality of the steel was inferior, leading to frequent failures.<p>3d printed parts need to be reliable enough to replace things like that, or we need to tone down our enthusiasm and realize most of the 3d printed parts are going to be door handles and similar non-stressed or non-critical parts.')
