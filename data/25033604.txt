In the past your books and your music on LP or CD and your movies on DVD or VHS were part of the decor, usually on prominent display in the living room, the room of the house where guests were entertained. Even your games carts for your console would be in that display. Seeing what was in your host&#x27;s collection was a part of getting to know them better, and of course, they might choose to curate their collection knowing it would be perused by visitors. That doesn&#x27;t happen so much any more, for some people, it has never been a part of their experience. I wonder what has replaced it.')
