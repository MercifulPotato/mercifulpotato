Letting those fanatics have nukes would be a mistake. But lets put that aside.<p>How did the &#x27;engage economically to change the regime&#x27; policy work with China and Russia? For that matter, did Cuba change at all after Obama&#x27;s attempt? These policies were a complete failure - the regimes got stronger, yet the drivers of conflict remained.  Eventually the same old frosty relations returned.<p>Engagement fails when it is not reciprocal. The economics did not encourage the regimes to get more moderate - rather the reverse. In order for true change in relations to happen, the other side has to commit themselves to some change too. Unfortunately, the Iranian regime is ideologically committed to its current policies, and refusing to discuss any matters except maybe nuclear. They are definitely not willing to apologize or let things go. I see no real prospects for engagement until this changes.')
