Item(by='input_sh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608190914, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25452754, text='AINAL, but pardons prior to convictions are a grey area. President Ford pardoned Nixon before convictions, but no court contested that, so it can&#x27;t really be used as a legal precedent.<p>In general, presidents usually pardon someone who&#x27;s already serving a sentence under a federal law. Snowden and Assange are not. Reality Winner is, and so was Chelsea Manning (pardoned by Obama).<p>Of course, it&#x27;s Trump we&#x27;re talking about, so I don&#x27;t think any sort of prior legal precedents really matters.')
