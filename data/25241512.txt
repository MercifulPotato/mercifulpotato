Item(by='tyu2', descendants=None, kids=[25241837], score=None, time=1606606506, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25240654, text='The reason you see a blank page is because the website wraps content into a &lt;noscript&gt; tag and by &quot;disabling javascript&quot; it wants you to render &lt;noscript&gt; content, not actually disable javascript. But it&#x27;s a bad idea in practice. Most websites work better out of the box if you disable javascript, but not render &lt;noscript&gt;, and also disable CSS, and inject some custom style to fix size of embedded icons. I&#x27;m not sure if there is a public extension that does that though.')
