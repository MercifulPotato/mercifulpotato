Item(by='not2b', descendants=None, kids=[24937299], score=None, time=1604011346, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24917679, text='I think it would be better to think in terms of information theory, rather than the hypothetical color of bits.  If I have a legally obtained copy of a copyrighted song (that is not permissively licensed), then I am restricted in my right to share copies.  Certainly I can create a one-time pad and communicate that to someone, and I can XOR the bits of the song recording with that one-time pad, and the author would argue that I now have colorless bits.  But I send it to you along with instructions for how to decrypt it, I&#x27;m using a mechanism to communicate a perfect copy.  It isn&#x27;t that the ciphertext is now &quot;colored&quot;, it&#x27;s that the net effect of my mechanism is that I&#x27;ve communicated the original song, with perfect fidelity.  That&#x27;s what matters: the net effect of the system as a whole.  I will have created a communication channel (perfectly legal), and used that channel to share a copyrighted work without the creator&#x27;s permission (not legal, depending on the details).')
