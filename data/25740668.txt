Or 2) let Trump keep the megaphone (MAGAphone?) and hope that in the next 10 days he didn&#x27;t say anything that would inflame some of the pro-Trump types into thinking that they had to violently try to reverse the result of the &quot;stolen&quot; election.<p>Note that there is no option that doesn&#x27;t leave a segment of the pro-Trump crowd inflamed, angry, and perhaps looking for trouble.<p>Let cooler heads prevail is good advice.  Except in this situation, cooler heads already were not prevailing.')
