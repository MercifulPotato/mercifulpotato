I’m not saying inappropriate speed should not be enforced against but i strongly believe more effort should be applied to avoid the more common cause of major road traffic incidents - inattention.<p>You can’t easily measure inattention but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try.<p>The solution doesn’t only have to be in penalties, it could be in making it harder to be inattentive to begin with.<p>That said, this is all low priority stuff in the UK. In the UK today there are basically zero road traffic police, you are exceedingly unlikely to come across any. Their numbers have been cut relentlessly as miles driven have increased. And yet... road deaths are down over the same 20 years and mobility is up.<p>Road traffic enforcement isn’t even in the top 1000 issues facing the UK today.')
