I have a medical condition that flares up in the heat.  There are good temperate places in the USA pacific northwest, but cost of living there was so high that there&#x27;s no way I could have done it on Salt Lake City based wages.  Even just the higher CoL in Alaska was pretty painful.<p>&gt; - <i>also w3m.</i><p>Hadn&#x27;t seen this, will check it out :-)<p>&gt; - <i>why don&#x27;t you git clone everything to your laptop when you have a chance? then keeping it up to date won&#x27;t be expensive.</i><p>I definitely did, but we had a ton of services with new ones springing up all the time, so even though I would grab what I could when I could, there was still frequent needs for more.  Also git wasn&#x27;t the worst part, the worst part was downloading docker images (base images and prod images).  Since they change regularly, sometimes daily, there was no real way around it.')
