Opera was promoting the Apache license to everyone, as a default, and urged me too to chose that when I submitted by extension. After some research online, I figured it was because an Apache license made it easier for them to re-use and integrate the code with any of their proprietary (or otherwise) product and permission for such use was implicit in the license. GPL v3 was more restrictive due to its viral nature.<p>I ultimately chose the GPL v3 license, so that if anyone wanted to use my code commercially in a proprietary product, they would have to consult with me to work out a suitable arrangement (like dual licensing and granting them the right to use the code with a more permissive license - this would be easy in this case, as I was the sole developer with all rights). This was not done with any monetary consideration in mind but as a young developer I just wanted to be made aware when someone wanted to use my code commercially, to mention the same in my resume.<p>The second reason was that GPL v3 better protects the ideal of open source that I subscribe to - the USER should have access to the source code and be able to modify and use it for their own purposes. Other more permissive open source license don&#x27;t protect this right.<p>This is where AGPL comes in too.<p>With &quot;cloud computing&quot; and &quot;software as a service&quot; becoming popular, many tech corporates that had avoided GPL softwares, now started using the software on servers and offering it as an online hosted service. GPL requires you to share the source code, along with any modifications, when someone asks for it, when you distribute a software using GPL code. But with online hosted services, corporates claimed that since they weren&#x27;t distributing the software and the user was not running it on his computer, they didn&#x27;t need to share the source code or any modification made to it with anyone.<p>AGPL was created to prevent this and further protect the USERS right, as it forced anyone who chose to use AGPL software and offer it as a service, to share their source code.<p>I still believe GPL &#x2F; AGPL is the BEST open-source license. All developers are also USERS of their application. Thus, GPL&#x27;s focus to protect the USERS right at all cost, works to protect your rights as a developer too as your source code, in any form, will always be open and available.<p>For commercial open source projects, dual license (partially or fully closed + GPL) is the way to go. MySQL &#x2F; MariaDB is a good example.')
