Yes, constantly<p>Well, in my experience: no. In Sweden where I reside and I&#x27;m sure in many other countries as well there have been regular surges of ads peddling a crypto-currency scam using fake interviews with well known celebrities as the hook (&quot;I scored millions&quot; etc). In 2019 I reported well over 70 of these ads and Facebook diligently reported that they investigated two (2) of these and found no reason to take action.<p>Now, the excuse I heard regarding these was that the scammers used some sort of dynamic links that detected and redirected depending on if the clicker was an fb employee or a sucker. But give. Me. a. Break.')
