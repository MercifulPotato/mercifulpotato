You may ask where they get their money from go continue the protest? Basically from the existing network of exporters of fruits, vegetables, grains etc... These farmering group head ask for bribes and favours and then sell government subsidized produce to select companies who rendered those favours.<p>Can you please address the issues highlighted by the farmers instead of speculating on where they obtain funding from?
