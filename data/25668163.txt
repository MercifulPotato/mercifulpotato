The democrats have been vicious, mean, nasty and deceitful. Big Tech and Big Media practically covered up the entire Hunter Biden situation claiming it wasn&#x27;t true; and now it&#x27;s clear he was under FBI investigation.<p>You don&#x27;t get to shit on 50% of the country, tell them they&#x27;re all racist Nazis for supporting Trump, and then tell them, &quot;We should unify.&quot; No state has gotten their day in court. The federal judges are all cowards. People have nothing else. Had the 7th Circuit at least heard testimony before ruling or the Supreme Court given more than a three line bullshit statement on standing, people would at least believe somebody was listening.<p>No body is listening.<p>People are losing faith in the system.<p>I have lost faith in the system, and I have never been a democrat or a republican.
