Item(by='wazoox', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602084103, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24709126, text='In a similar discussion yesterday (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24697860" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24697860</a>) many seem to pass easily over the basic fact that monopolies are wrong, whatever your political&#x2F;economic leaning is. I commented:<p>In economic theory, a well-functioning market is a market where no single actor can manipulate prices all by itself. That&#x27;s why monopolies (oligopolies - monopsonies) are fundamentally bad.<p>In some situations where a monopoly makes sense (there is no sense in having 2 autonomous rail systems for instance), typically for infrastructures, there are strong provisions to be applied to keep the monopoly in control. Historically, these monopolies were often simply managed by a publicly-owned company (USPS, or interstate highways, for instance).<p>As I said in another comment, there is no rational way to defend or explain away monopolies. If you&#x27;re a free-market capitalist, then you want a functioning free market, thus no monopolies. If you&#x27;re a socialist, you want them publicly-owned and democratically controlled.<p>Large powerful monopolies are a tremendous menace to democracy, simple as that. It&#x27;s not a question of their CEOs being nice people or not, it&#x27;s deeply ingrained in the logic of being a monopoly.')
