To also mention the result: Installation worked, alsa plugin worked and the filter does work. Nice, thanks again.<p>With extreme sounds (vacuum) in the background the voice gets a bit more distorted than ideal, but something like a keyboard gets filtered nicely to be less noisy. I assumed that&#x27;s just how RNNoise behaves, I&#x27;m just mentioning it because of the sound quality discussion above. Maybe also to that: Just activating the alsa_rnnoise filter does not significantly lower recording quality, at least not that I can notice.')
