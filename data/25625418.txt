This really long ago though - around 2007. As a programmer moving into quants needing to process huge amounts of data python&#x2F;matplotlib seemed a much better fit for me. It also enabled me to run multiprocess number crunching on my 8-core desktop at home. Octave would be able to use just 1 core, I could code the python scripts to use all 8.<p>Octave was really good to prototype and enabled me to get somethings done really quick. But once I got to know the python libraries better it just seemed easier. I could do all my data processing and quants in a single language.<p>I&#x27;m sure much has changed and was actually quite sad when the original author of Octave (John Eaton) mentioned in 2017 that he was unable to maintain it.<p>I&#x27;ve lost touch on Octave over the years and genuinely pleased to see that it is still being actively maintained. I think its time for me to see what I&#x27;ve missed in the past 13 years.')
