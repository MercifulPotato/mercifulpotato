It&#x27;s simply not viable for small businesses who are unable to move to the cloud.<p>For example, if my employer (for whom the use of cloud hosted service is simply not possible) wanted to keep using Atlassian products, moving to datacenter would cost us many thousands of dollars more per year in maintenance while wasting literally hundreds of unnecessary seats we&#x27;d be forced to pay for.<p>This announcement has ruined my day. Not only will we have to abandon a number of projects to implement new Atlassian products, we&#x27;ll have to start planning to migrate all of our existing instances to other products and re-build all the work flow and customisations in those. At least they&#x27;ve given a few years window for changeover, but this is going to generate a lot of work and our confluence power-users are going to be very upset at having to move to Sharepoint or some other horror.')
