Yes, it&#x27;s possible to do it with reflection, interfaces and interface{}, but it&#x27;s not typesafe, it&#x27;s not fast, and it&#x27;s prone to code bloat.<p>I&#x27;m a fairly late-comer to generics, I never programmed seriously in C++, I avoided generics in Java initially, and I wrote a lot of code in less statically-typed languages.  Ever since the first serious talk of generics in Go 2.0 I&#x27;ve endeavored to educate myself and I now am very strongly in favor of them.')
