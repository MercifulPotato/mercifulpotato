Item(by='bArray', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606584986, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25238175, text='&gt; Torvalds, of course, can already have an ARM based Linux<p>&gt; laptop if he wants oneâ€”for example, the Pinebook Pro. The<p>&gt; unspoken part here is that he&#x27;d like a high-performance<p>&gt; ARM based laptop, rather than a budget-friendly but<p>&gt; extremely performance constrained design such as one finds<p>&gt; in the Pinebook Pro, the Raspberry Pi, or a legion of<p>&gt; other inexpensive gadgets.<p>I believe he currently uses an AMD threadripper setup - there would be nothing stopping him using something like the PineBook Pro as a &quot;dumb terminal&quot; and having his builds done off-machine. It would mean that he is dependent on an internet connection, but it wouldn&#x27;t have to be a fast one as he would only need to send deltas to the build process. (This would be on top of other mechanisms like CI.)<p>The PineBook Pro has quite a reasonable keyboard, is quite light and gets decent battery. He could reasonably use it all day without issue. Re-flashing it can be as simple as throwing a new SD card into it, which could also help in terms of security whilst traveling (re-flash it when you get to your location).<p>I would very much tell him and other people to seriously consider such a machine.')
