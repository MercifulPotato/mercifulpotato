It&#x27;s basically impossible to compose notebooks in any meaningful way.<p>I think you could make the idea work (or at least work better) with a purely functional language, say Haskell, instead of Python. Purely functional semantics are more amenable to natural interpretations closer to the Notebook format than an OOP.')
