In general, you kind of have to assume that anything you write online could eventually be tied back to your public identity.<p>That being said, I tend to assume that if you said something your employer might disapprove of, it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem unless what you said somehow gathered <i>a lot</i> of attention online. For that you&#x27;d have to be famous, or stir some serious shit on twitter. Even if the identities of everyone on HN were outed, I&#x27;m guessing mostly nobody would care, except if they found out Jeff Bezos was secretly posting hateful messages.')
