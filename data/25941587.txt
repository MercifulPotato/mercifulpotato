Check my notes for some nice sources dating back to the 60s.<p>(Not in my notes but just yesterday I stumbled upon the original 1990 memo by adobe co-founder John Warnock for the PDF project, Camelot. Great read)<p>You are absolutely right that there’s so much more in boxes somewhere and in the mind of the people who were there, but as a starting point online archives are great. We can only encourage more digitization of more archives (it’s a lot or works, organizing and sorting even before scanning)')
