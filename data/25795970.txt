We could have some GUI for doing all those things but it would end up being a massive mess of buttons EVERYWHERE and endless menus.<p>I didn&#x27;t cite the commandline itself as the problem. PowerShell does a significantly better job at making sense than typical core-utils do, but you hear people used to core-utils bad mouth it all the time because it isn&#x27;t exactly the same as core-utils.<p>And I submit that your lack of ability to conceptualize a GUI for doing the same thing does not mean one can&#x27;t exist, but that is beside the point, because I don&#x27;t think knowing how to use those tools is a necessary and fundamental part of programming anyway.<p>Someone who is just getting started in a new programming environment shouldn&#x27;t need to know the ins and outs of a dozen different tools, especially when those tools are used to solve problems that user has not even conceptualized the existence of yet.<p>Again, this all comes down to one thing: why is it so damned complicated just to get enough of a programming environment running that the user can write a goddamned program? Not write it well, not write it efficiently, just f&#x27;ing write it in the first place?')
