It’s designed to bring balance to a media industry that skews heavily left by offering the countervailing view on issues. (I do agree it’s gone downhill since Ailes left. Megyn Kelly has said as much.)<p>To put it differently: you cannot understand what’s going on in the world just reading the NYT and watching CNN, especially in the Trump era.
