Its a shit job that nobody wants and anyone with a modicum of ability seems to get out of asap in my experience. They don&#x27;t seem to know who their client is, what technology is or who you need to be but they can just about play snap (although they may struggle with java and javascript) and get someone to a job interview.<p>The whole point is that impressing these people is _pointless_ because they&#x27;d be impressed by a snow globe and mostly know nothing about tech. They&#x27;re just a roadblock between you and the other technical people that you have to go round.')
