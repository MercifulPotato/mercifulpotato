In order to do that, you need to know the basics of reading and writing, the basics of math, and the basic theory of knowledge. That last one is sorely missing, but that&#x27;s another story.<p>You then want a superficial survey of everything humans know. Of course it cannot be anything but superficial, there isn&#x27;t time after you know how to read, write essays, and solve some differential equations. In the end you&#x27;re going to focus on the same old things that everyone thinks are important: a bit world&#x2F;national history&#x2F;lit, a bit of the headline sciences (phys&#x2F;chem&#x2F;bio), and a bit of foreign language and culture.<p>At best you will end up mentioning the following in passing: economics, psychology, cooking, citizenship, health, the law, and so on.<p>But yeah someone ought to mention that there are worthwhile fields of study that you&#x27;ll have to learn on your own.')
