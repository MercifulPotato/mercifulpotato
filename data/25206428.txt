If your message to every girl is “what’s up”, then you are doing the resume equivalent of creating a single resume and sending to every job on LinkedIn.  The more your resume matches the job, the better your chances of getting called.  The more your first response to a woman on the dating site shows you’ve read their profile and have interest in their interests, the more responses you will get back.<p>It’s better to pick 1-2 people every day you are truly interested in (more than just looks) and put some time into a real message.  Not just “what’s up” to 30 girls.<p>Oh i always kept sending messages to new people no matter how I was doing with someone else on the site.  These things would fizzle out suddenly after a few weeks for all sorts of reasons and you could miss out on some great people.')
