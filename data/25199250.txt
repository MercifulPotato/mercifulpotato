You don&#x27;t seem to be plugged in - what were the CEO&#x27;s goals?  How did his exec team manage towards them, what orders were passed down, and how did you execute on them?  If you don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s because you weren&#x27;t plugged in - for all you know, you _were_ irrelevant.<p>(2) How to get visibility? You need to set meetings: project kickoffs, 30-day SteerCos, quarterly updates, AND end-of-project readouts. Out of sight, out of mind. You need to get in front of people who matter, and explain the value of what you do in a way that they can claim credit to their boss.<p>(3) When you get in front of $important_people, you need to speak their language. Show them the money (your exec summary is always the same: I [made, saved] $X M in the past Y months, which is Z% of total revenue). Mark progress against a roadmap. Make pretty presentations they can forward to their boss. And talk slowly (not so they can understand, but so _you_ can avoid looking silly).<p>When you&#x27;re a freelancer, the above is _more_ important, not less.  I&#x27;m sorry you got screwed (if engineers have to be good at business management crap, WTF are business managers for?) but these are, I think, the skills you&#x27;re looking for here.<p>A good book to read on this is The First 90 Days by Michael Watkins, if you&#x27;re curious.')
