The workers at the business only interact in person with other workers. Members of the general public are not present.<p>2. The business conducts frequent testing, which should include tests that give a rapid answer.<p>3. The workers agree to take steps outside of work to limit their risk, such as not going places where they can&#x27;t maintain social distancing or where mask wearing is not near universal.<p>You could probably even open that up a little, relaxing #1 to:<p>1&#x27;. There are only a small number of members of the general public present throughout the day, only one or two at a time.<p>This relaxed rule would allow for things like dentists offices, barbers, salons, and similar as long as they kept the number of simultaneous customers down.')
