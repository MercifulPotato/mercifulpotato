Am I spending a lot of time on things I don&#x27;t value? Am I enjoying what I&#x27;m doing?<p>At this stage in my career&#x2F;life, I actually want to put a limit on my employed hours. Side projects, family life, exercise, hedonism are the things I want to balance with that paid work -- I&#x27;ve done the burnout thing and am simply not interested in doing it again.
