I know of plenty of people who work or would like to work for Tesla. Another group of companies that haven&#x27;t received as much attention in the recent &quot;SF exodus&quot; narrative are Google and FB. Google has been opening large offices outside of SF for years and is slowly contributing to the growing of tech hubs around the country. Google&#x27;s Boulder office comes to mind as a good example.<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any large FB spokes, but FB remote work allowance might end up having a similar effect. Not to mention the many startups that have realized that the distributed model works fairly well if you know how to do it, and opens up a large talent pool. I currently work for such a startup and we don&#x27;t plan on going to back to a central SF office model post pandemic.')
