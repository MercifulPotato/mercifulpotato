The app developers should just pick a different name to create an easier life for themselves.<p>The app name is problematic if you&#x27;re a bit puritanical about naming or saying certain things that are edgy, which infects most US megacorps such as Twitter, Facebook et al. I&#x27;ve been on the end of this because they force their puritanical cultural US standards across the world. For example, in a pub, in Scotland, I can quite comfortably tell someone to &quot;go fuck themselves&quot;, or &quot;don&#x27;t be a cunt&quot;. The way <i>we</i> use language and profanity is not the same, intent-wise, as whatever internal guidelines Jack, Mark and friends arrived at from a US interpretation. Using language such as this as a Scot on Twitter, between Scots, will get you a suspension.<p>Personally I think it&#x27;s a daft name, and couldn&#x27;t recommend anyway. Not because I&#x27;m puritanical, but because it&#x27;s just trying to be provocative. It&#x27;s up there with GIMP which is a challenge to talk about in any human company without people sniggering.<p>It&#x27;s Apple&#x27;s store, you bought into it, you play by their Puritan corporate rules.<p>And sure I could stop using Twitter, FB et al, but I don&#x27;t have a livelihood to protect by needing to being on these things.')
