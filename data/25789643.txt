Fine, use it. Prefer Emacs? Looks good. You really like nano? Perfect! But for god sake don&#x27;t expect that someone will ever take you seriously if you say you are experienced and don&#x27;t know how to use a cli. How can you even work with computers not knowing what $PATH (yes, this exists on windows too fyi) is? This is just dumb. I&#x27;d also add: stop using javascript, don&#x27;t, just don&#x27;t (or, better, use vanilla-js).')
