Content creators needs to be paid, but they should not be in control of what the public can do with their shows. We need a standard price to pay for a standard license.<p>Heck let them set their own price, but any special deal should be considered a breach of the monopoly they have been granted - no more favoring one streaming service over another. No more region or geolock.<p>Since they are so happy about tell us that we have brought a CD, not its contents I should be allowed to get that content however I want and pay a standard fee in a standard way.')
