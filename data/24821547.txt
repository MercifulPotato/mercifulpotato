We tend to think of distant galaxy’s as if we are viewing them via some FTL means with a single consistent now.  NASA for example tracks distant Mars probes like that rather than marking timing based on when the signal was received.<p>Alternatively, you can think of everything that could impact you as something of a now light cone.  The second view has the universe  existing as a 3D surface in 4D space time which means objects have a temporal width for each observer.  That can be a really useful mathematical model.<p>PS: Edited the above several times for clarity.')
