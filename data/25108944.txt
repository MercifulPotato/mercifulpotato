Item(by='tptacek', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605510155, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25108225, text='Rayiner is one of the best commenters on the site. He routinely takes the time to write paragraphs of background to support his views, which are well-informed --- he&#x27;s an appellate court litigator with an engineering background --- and interesting enough that they&#x27;re routinely downvoted. I&#x27;ve never seen him complain about that, or about HN moderation. We need 100 more of him (ideally in a variety of ideological flavors).<p>I have no idea who &#x27;s9w is, but I&#x27;ve never seen Rayiner post the three word comment &quot;that&#x27;s a lie&quot;, so I object to the comparison.')
