There is nothing fundamentally random about this evolution. We still use random numbers (wave function collapse) to approximate observations, because in many cases quantum calculations for macroscopic objects would be intractable, and because they give the same answer to any precision we can hope to measure.<p>Every experiment that demonstrates quantum entanglement is essentially just showing that quantum mechanics still applies on systems that were previously thought to behave classically. And none of these experiments have demonstrated a mechanism for wave function collapse beyond what we already understand from decoherence.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quantum_decoherence" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Quantum_decoherence</a>')
