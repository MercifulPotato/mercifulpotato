I tried hard to read to the end without laughing out loud, in particular this about candidates:<p>&gt; 1. they give a shit about Scale<p>Most companies I interview for, I, shall we say, don&#x27;t give a shit about at application and interview stage. Sure, they may seem like a good fit (tech and remuneration), and I try to fit if it kinda feels good after a couple of interviews. Yes I try and understand their business, methodologies, treatment of staff (am I on call?, what&#x27;s that worth?) etc<p>But to expect me to arrive at a series of interviews with total commitment and &quot;giving a shit&quot; (which I read as hand-my-life-and-all-my-free-time-to-you). Nah, fuck off.<p>You&#x27;re just another company, it&#x27;s up to you to <i>make me</i> give a shit wanting to work for you.<p>Annecdote: Been employed at what I thought would be a nice company to work for ~five months, it&#x27;s turned out well, <i>now I give a shit</i>. It doesn&#x27;t work the other way around, otherwise you seem like a cult.<p>And whilst at this new company I really do &quot;give a shit&quot;, I don&#x27;t allow it to trap me and will happily tell them at which point I don&#x27;t &quot;give a shit&quot; any more and the reasons why.')
