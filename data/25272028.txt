This is a full stack team, ultimately driven to ship user-facing products, like Pinterest Lens, Visual Shopping, and Pinterest AR. We do this by building state of the art computer vision signals, such as large scale multi-task embeddings, high-throughput detection models, generative adversarial models for image composition, and many others. These models and computer vision features power product experiences on Pinterest for hundreds of millions of users.<p>Pinterest Visual Search team runs on PyTorch, C++, and lots of Python, among with many other technologies. We encourage publication of all of our work (CVPR, KDD, etc.), and have a highly collaborative and flexible work environment. We’re looking for roles right now: interns with an interest in shipping computer vision products, and contractor roles for more experienced engineers to help us build better ML data tooling and visualizations.<p>Interns: If you’re passionate about product or computer vision infrastructure, such as building label-to-deployed-model toolchains via active learning, or if you’ve had experience with interesting CV challenges, or you are just looking for a highly applied ML work, reach out to our team! You can contact me directly by pinging dkislyuk@pinterest.com with the tag [VISUAL SEARCH HN] in the title. Please highlight a CV project or an interesting product you&#x27;ve worked on to help our team figure out what role to consider you for. Any ML infra or tools that you are interested in are a big plus.<p>Contractors: If you have experience with data workflows for ML projects, or building dataset visualization front-ends, or have some other expertise that you think is relevant to the problems above, send me a message (same deal, please add the tag [VISUAL SEARCH HN]). The position would be fully remote.')
