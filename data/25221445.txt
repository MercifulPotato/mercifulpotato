Item(by='huhtenberg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606408945, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25220880, text='I tend to browse <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;shownew" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;shownew</a> at least a couple of times a week and it&#x27;s <i>always</i> full of spam. Some comes from green-colored accounts (newly created), some - from accounts created few weeks ago, but with no activity, some just keep posting the same thing over and over again and also without any other comments or posts. Lots and lots of it. I&#x27;d say at least 50% of non-dead posts are that way.<p>Just a pinch of reality. It&#x27;s really quite discouraging.')
