Item(by='tsimionescu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610336697, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25720382, text='&gt; If you don&#x27;t mind me asking: what do you do in tech, and why are you on YC if you are so averse to it?<p>I am not averse to tech, I just don&#x27;t think that it currently has a place in (or instead of) politics.<p>I work for a company on network testing software (packet generators), as a principal software engineer on the middleware of one such product. Nothing world-changing, B2B, far away from any kind of societal shaping effects like ads or social networks.<p>I am mostly on YC because of my interest in tech itself, and because I am interested in the political and social views of the tech community, not because I think we tech people have some special insight, but simply because I am part of this community.<p>For the rest of your post, I will reiterate my position: we can&#x27;t outsource governance or politics (what ought to be) to technology, until we have something close to AGI. We don&#x27;t have the required knowledge to create software that can arbitrate social or economical truths, we would need a working formal mathematical model of society or the economy before we could even start to write software for that. Any attempts would probably end up more like &#x27;predictive policing&#x27; (racism with a technical veneer) than any positive outcomes.<p>Bitcoin is a failed experiment at creating a digital currency, it is just a speculative asset with some appeal to black and gray markets.')
