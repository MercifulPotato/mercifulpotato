As an consultant involved in cloud migrations and CI&#x2F;CD I do see the value of a common language for build&#x2F;test&#x2F;deploy, it’s a mess in the enterprises nowadays. I’m curious to learn what is Hashicorp’s opinion about CNAB (which somehow tries to solve the same problem). As Waypoint is complementary to CI tools, do you see this also complementary for the GitOps tooling which is gaining traction in the Kubernetes world?')
