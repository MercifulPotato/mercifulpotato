Item(by='antiframe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602539242, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24756248, text='&gt; This doesn&#x27;t work for rural and suburban America. What are you going to do, drive half an hour to pick up your other car? And spend another half hour waiting? That&#x27;s incredibly inconvenient and costly.<p>Maybe. Maybe not. The point is to do the exercise for your use case. If it costs you 1.5 hours and rental fees to get a minivan and you need it once a year, that&#x27;s one side of the scale. On the other side you have purchase, insurance, maintenance, depreciation, storage and fuel costs.<p>The point is to be honest with both sides of the scale and to actually do the comparison rather than taking an automatic answer &quot;I need to drive extra kids to camp sometimes, so I must own a minivan.&quot; Maybe. Maybe not. Just be conscious about the choice, not automatic.')
