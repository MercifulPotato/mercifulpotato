This makes a lot of sense.<p>A carrier signal is generated (as high as 10^27) [1] - modulated by some observable - and then recorded and analyzed. The highest resolution event that will be visible in the waveform will be 1&#x2F;(2f) where f is the frequency of the carrier signal. The 1&#x2F;2 factor is due to the sampling theorem [2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampli...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;What-was-the-highest-frequency-that-man-has-ever-created" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;What-was-the-highest-frequency-that-ma...</a>')
