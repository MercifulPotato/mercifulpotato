They are simply private services, private property. In the same way you can legally remove people from your home that you don&#x27;t want in there, they can bar you from their service. They also didn&#x27;t always exist. At what point in their existence would you argue that being banned from being able to use them was depriving you of some right? Can they have a monopoly over all of the &quot;conduits of free speech&quot; if all the old methods of communication still exist? If those alternatives exist, could they really be called a monopoly? (Although for things like Twitter, they&#x27;re definitely not a monopoly, but if we&#x27;re talking about govt backed ISPs, which can be a monopoly, then that is indeed a different story, but I would argue that ISPs should be divorced from any government regulation&#x2F;subsidies).')
