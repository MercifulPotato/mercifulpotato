A fly-by-night business launched under my trademark, bought Google search ads against my domain searches, copied verbatim content from my website including my terms of service which has my address and company name in it, and then also sent me a cease an desist on my own trademark to top it off. Despite such egregious infractions it&#x27;s incredibly difficult to stop them because their costs for doing this is near nothing. Their risks for doing this are also near nothing (since there&#x27;s not really any criminal liability). Unfortunately the US legal system doesn&#x27;t really work that well for small players. If anything platforms are probably in a better position to enforce things better than the government, but they aren&#x27;t really doing so. Amazon is also turning a blind eye to scams since at the end of the day all money still flows to them.')
