Likewise any contributions I made would be welcome (Qt Company are now closing patch contributions)<p>They&#x27;re already doing the work of cherry picking and testing LTS. They&#x27;re saving themselves a git merge and a git push because they falsely believe this will drive further sales.<p>Maybe it will, but they&#x27;re still throwing the FOSS community using Qt 5 under the bus.<p>It would have been better to go back to GPL, and had just had timely FOSS releases, since a small business license for the library is only $500&#x2F;year.')
