Intercepting votes like that on a large scale would be indeed hard.<p>But what people do get caught doing quite regularly and not just in the USA are things like:<p>1. Going door to door and giving people blank ballots, pressuring people to fill them in, right in front of them. As a &#x27;helpful service&#x27;.<p>2. Dominant members of the families taking the ballots from family members and filling them all in themselves. This gets reported a lot in various ethnic minority areas in the UK, for example, where the father is traditionally dominant.<p>3. Ballots being destroyed or not delivered in swing areas where certain sub-regions are known to be strongly pro one candidate or another.<p>It&#x27;s good to hear that some places let you check if your ballot was received, but almost by definition, for that to work you need a lot of people to do that kind of check and then publicly broadcast their findings. In an environment where social media is suppressing discussion of the possibility of voter fraud and the media is polarised, it&#x27;s not so clear how people would do that reliably, even if enough checked in the first place. And a lot of places you can&#x27;t easily check - I know I can&#x27;t in my elections!<p>As for Trump accusing others of cheating, conservatives in multiple countries have been talking about the  problems of postal vote fraud for a long time. This is not new, they care because when it is uncovered it always seems to be tipping the vote for the left. Trump in particular shouldn&#x27;t be under suspicion here because he has been strongly encouraging his supporters to vote in person, where fraud is much harder to pull off: it&#x27;s his opponents that strongly encouraged postal voting despite knowing that postal voting is less confidence-inspiring than the ballot box.')
