Systems dev is actually a fairly niche role in the industry, M1 will be a boon to them but for the vast majority of devs who either aren&#x27;t interested in that kind of work or not trained in it, M1 is a huge monkey wrench.<p>I buy a new MPB every two years, and you bet your ass my next one will be an M1. But that&#x27;ll be in 2022, I&#x27;ll be quite happy to stay on my x86 machine until then :)')
