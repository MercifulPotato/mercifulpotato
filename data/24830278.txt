If we&#x27;re living in a simulation, have the beings running it accounted for the development of interplanetary probes, people landing on the Moon, moon rocks being studied in the labs on Earth, full spectrum imagery from space telescopes? Or is every piece of data we&#x27;re getting off-world is an equivalent of peeking into an out-of-bounds area in a game world? And if they have accounted for it, how fast was the insane pace of early Space Race compared to the estimations of outside observers?')
