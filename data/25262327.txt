For me, both are equally adversarial so one party saying &quot;look. China bad&quot; does not say well about their state of mind and arguments.<p>This software has an MIT license. There are no &quot;secrets&quot; for Chinese or someone else to &quot;steal&quot;. This is a wide open software with the least prohibitive license. This FUD is what makes us non Americans and non Chinese think &quot;this is nonsens&quot; when ideas like huawei backdoors is used across the world. Absolutely no evidence and yet &quot;don&#x27;t use china sponsored company but USA sponsored company is fine&quot;<p>Interestingly, CIA was recently outed to have hands in Swiss crypto software for like 50 years. For 50 years they sold software and hardware to States for secrets and they had access. No one is calling them out or making them pay but because China is not playing by their rules, the propaganda must work.\nCiao')
