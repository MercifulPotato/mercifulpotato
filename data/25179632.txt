Item(by='rndgermandude', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606069468, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25176943, text='No.<p>The NYU gives a clear statement on why they want this data (to track ads) and what data they collect, this is informed consent.<p>CA on the other hand obfuscated the purpose and what they collect as much as possible, pretending it was a personality&#x2F;IQ quiz (something fun and benign) when in fact they harvested the data in order to create models for targeted advertising which they then used in political campaigns. This isn&#x27;t informed consent.<p>That&#x27;s a very different starting point already.<p>Your argument seems to be &quot;well, if that doctor with the curious name of &#x27;NYU&#x27; and working for a reputable facility asks you for informed consent to do a surgery to remove a cancerous mole, this doctor can in theory just be lying and cut off your leg!!!1!&quot;. CA in this context would be the back alley quack who pretends to provide you with a free non-invasive exam for skin cancer, but then steals your kidneys and sells them on the black market.<p>The NYU also tries to be as transparent as possible beyond the initial value proposition, including open sourcing the collection software (browser extension), again the opposite of what CA did.<p>Is there still a possibility of abuse by NYU? Sure, and that&#x27;s why it is entirely fine to keep an eye on them, and keep holding them accountable, but for things they actually do or don&#x27;t do.<p>However, I think trying to hold the NYU to an unachievable standard (&quot;we need to audit everything they do independently&quot;) while at the same time not even remotely applying that same standard to FB, their FAANG buddies, and everybody else really, that&#x27;s just... wat<p>Tell me again how you think there <i>may be</i> a vague security and privacy concern with the NYU voluntary ad data collection for the willing participants when Target starts selling your daughter pregnancy products (because they knew before her herself that she is pregnant), facebook detecting your face in other people&#x27;s image shares and adding public tags with your name automatically, google telling you &quot;you have visited this place 2 times in the last 10 years&quot;, or famous twitter users (or rather the new owners of their accounts) pushing bitcoin scams because twitter had their systems compromised.')
