Get CNN or Breitbart to report on Apple child labor, expose wall street, or expose the impact of consumer products on the environment and then I&#x27;ll listen.<p>political news is a waste of time and probably a net negative for an individual. That&#x27;s MY truth which you won&#x27;t find on CNN or breitbart&#x27;s twitter feed.<p>I actively avoid political news (it sucks it is showing up here on HN).')
