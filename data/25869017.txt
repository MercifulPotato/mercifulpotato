I<p>I&#x27;ll spare you the time and money with my best guess of the conclusion of said study:<p><i>In conclusion, Government tasks outweigh the potential output of Government employee expectations, therefore we the researchers recommend ever greater budget allotments and grants to further study why the adage &#x27;more money&#x27; doesn&#x27;t translate into more &#x27;productive&#x27; outcomes in the Public Sector.</i><p>The very essence of the State as a bureaucratic system ensures that things move as slow as possible, which often illicit the occasional Kill-dozer [0] event, even if you have someone motivated to &#x27;change it from within&#x27; they inevitably get burned out due to the amount of red-tape and general sense of apathy. I highly recommend you watch the Wire and maybe even Treme (same producer) as it outlines anything I say way better than I could ever articulate in a 10,000 page essay on the matter.<p>We really need to move past the nation-state model and limit its scope to as little as possible as that could at least allow for more viable solutions. I just heard you can print car tags at kiosks in grocery stores in CA, which is an example of simple and elegant solutions that were only made possible because the pandemic shut down so many government offices and thus allowed for these services to allotted to more sensible methods--they were not going to let such a massive amount of tax money slip through their hands so they moved fast before people simply disregarded it just as they did lock-down or stay at home orders, and sadly even mask wearing in certain cases.<p>I waited nearly 5 months for my tags prior to this for my motorcycle in CA, only to see this outcome, which normally would have driven me up the wall but at least produced a reasonable over all solution. No one needs to be paid to hand out something you can automate, it makes no sense. Put those people to more sensible tasks like addressing liens or title transfers that are more nuanced and require actual Human intelligence (and I use the word loosely) or zoning approvals, or solar tie in approvals etc... to solve as there is a massive back log of those right now that can&#x27;t move forward until some bureaucrat signs off on it.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;allthatsinteresting.com&#x2F;marvin-heemeyer-killdozer" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;allthatsinteresting.com&#x2F;marvin-heemeyer-killdozer</a>')
