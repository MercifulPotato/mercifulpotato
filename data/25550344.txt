Did Picard really need to be stabbed in the heart, just to learn his lesson? (And, his &#x27;unremarkable career&#x27; seemed to be a bigger criticism of Starfleet&#x2F;the Federation than we normally see - what&#x27;s wrong with an ordinary life?)<p>I would be happy to remove the trauma that I experienced in my past. I&#x27;d take the risk of being a different person - with different good qualities.')
