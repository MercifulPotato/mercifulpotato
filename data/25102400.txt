Item(by='snapetom', descendants=None, kids=[25106840, 25102481], score=None, time=1605458027, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25099615, text='I have a similar set up using AeoTech Z-Stick on a Raspberry Pi running HomeAssistant with Jasco light switches.  I&#x27;m ready to toss the whole setup, too.<p>First off, HomeAssistant is not as easy as people claim.  They love to release breaking changes.  You <i>have</i> to read the release notes or else a routine pip update will foobar your whole system.  In the four years, I&#x27;ve run it, they have 1) Introduced and then retired a recommended install method.  2) Completely redone the web architecture.  3) Completely redone the Z-Wave architecture.  4) Routinely release UI features that are just placeholders and useless. It&#x27;s completely maddening.<p>The problems are exasperated by the Z-Wave devices themselves.  The light switches may be branded GE or Honeywell, but they are all made by Jasco.  The first generation has been complete garbage. I&#x27;ve had a 40% failure rate over these five years for them.  They will randomly die, or fry during a power failure.  Knock on wood, so far no failures with the 2nd Gen so far.<p>HomeAssistant has tried to be more end-user friendly and have the UI be able to handle all aspects, but this is limited by the cooperation of the devices themselves.  It&#x27;s like herding cats. &quot;Heal Network&quot; never actually does anything.  Try actually deleting a dead node through the UI.  You can&#x27;t.  It never actually works.  You have to ssh into the box, delete the entry from a JSON file, systemctl restart.<p>How a non-linux user can manage a HomeAssistant setup is beyond me.')
