It has a first class compiler to JavaScript (though, I admit, I don&#x27;t know how tuneable it is, so I think it just compiles down to ES5, it&#x27;d be nice to do a differential build where it would compile down to ES5 and&#x2F;or ES2015&#x2F;ES2016 at the users discretion)<p>Only thing it needs now is a compile to CSS solution and you would never have to leave the language. Its a very thurough language in that regard.<p>It also needs a strong GUI framework for desktop and mobile apps, as well, but still, its very fully featured! My hunch in this area is that you could just compile to Electron&#x2F;NativeScript&#x2F;React Native as a relatively &#x27;quick&#x27; solution to these problems.<p>I&#x27;m excited to see where this language goes. I&#x27;m pretty tempted to use it in production to replace Python for some things and may find it more expansive due to its flexibility of compile targets.<p>My only gripe (and its relatively small) is I don&#x27;t like its  compiler directive syntax using the `{.directive.}` style, its a little ugly and noisy to me, I&#x27;d prefer something like rust&#x27;s `#[]` (I think this is actually how you use a Rust macro, but its a nice syntax regardless)<p>Not enough to stop me from thinking the language has some real upside and potential, though.')
