If I (pre covid) sent them a PR and walked over to their desk, told them it was super urgent and a tiny change just needed a rubber stamp, one of them would do it (and I would likely do the same for them). Failing that I can name a handful of developers that wouldn&#x27;t be familiar with the system but will review my change because I did the same for them a few months ago (and they&#x27;ll comment on stylistic&#x2F;clarity issues, rather than the work being done). Even if you think this is rare, it likely isn&#x27;t and likely happens at every company to some degree.')
