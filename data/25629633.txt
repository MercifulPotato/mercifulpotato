Then when a shock to the system is introduced, and orders spike, the players struggle to meet demand and the system becomes chaotic.<p>This seems to happen even when players have played the game before.  The lesson seems to be that you can&#x27;t easily do JIT without very good lines of communication or buffer inventory which is expensive.<p>As I remember it the cute, old metaphor I was taught was that inventory was like water in a river.  We aim to lower the water until you just expose the rocks but no more. Then you remove the rocks one by one.  If you deplete your inventory too soon you&#x27;re exposing too many rocks and you&#x27;ll ground your boat.<p>1. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.mit.edu&#x2F;jsterman&#x2F;www&#x2F;SDG&#x2F;beergame.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.mit.edu&#x2F;jsterman&#x2F;www&#x2F;SDG&#x2F;beergame.html</a>')
