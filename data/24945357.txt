People simply choose to save money and go with cheaper items, or they can&#x27;t afford ones that come with a 10 year warranty.  Or maybe they don&#x27;t exist.  I know miele products exist, but not everyone wants to spring for Miele or Speed Queen washers or other higher quality builds that offer longer warranties.<p>I know I&#x27;d rather save $1,000 or more, invest it, and take my chances with an appliance from Costco since I can get it with a 4 year warranty anyway.  If it breaks after 4 years, I&#x27;ll get a new one.  Over the past 10 years, I haven&#x27;t experienced any appliances breaking.')
