The highly symmetric and redundant nature of IsoTruss structures provides an attractive, efficient, and damage tolerant design.<p>The three-dimensional, yet relatively simple geometry of the IsoTruss grid structure provides substantial resistance to local and global column buckling, while lending itself to cost effective fabrication using automated continuous manufacturing.&quot;<p>Related video on YouTube:<p>&quot;How Strong is Super Material Isotruss?
