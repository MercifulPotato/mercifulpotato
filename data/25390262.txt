Including auto suspend on lid close and resume on open. Same experience on a few newer Dell laptops I was gifted ( will look up the types in the morning if anyone cares; I do not like the keyboards vs the x220 so I do not use them much ). I run the latest Ubuntu with i3 and my own scripts (which I have been tweaking over the years) to fix battery life etc. What machines did you try?')
