Brands paying for eye-level placement is the same as &#x27;sponsored products&#x27; on Amazon. <i>Any</i> Amazon Seller has a right to do this and Amazon has the right to sell this access. Just like <i>any</i> brand has the right to meet eye-level requirements.<p>Yes, supermarkets have a store brand. Yes, they may also place store brand items at eye-level at no cost. But! I think there are two key differences:<p>1) In most cases, supermarkets buy from the <i>existing product manufacturer</i> at wholesale in order to be able to slap their brand on the product and use other cost saving measures (ie: bland, cheaper packaging, etc) to sell the <i>same product</i> at a lower price. In cases where they don&#x27;t buy from the manufacturer, the copy of the product is likely not covered by a patent or is different enough as to not infringe on the patent&#x2F;trademark.<p>2) Many Amazon Sellers are small independent companies, just look at their success stories page [1] to see the extent to which they market to small business owners. These businesses likely can&#x27;t afford to patent their products and when Amazon decides to copy their product (based off the data they collected [2]), they can&#x27;t defend themselves and their product effectively.<p>Not all Amazon brand products are a problem. The biggest issue is the exploitation of companies in a certain &#x27;sweet spot&#x27; on its platform. These small businesses have taken on risk to provide a good product that sells well, but aren&#x27;t big enough to patent the product or hire lawyers.<p>Maybe Amazon is just a symptom caused by the imbalance of power in the economy right now. Either way, it&#x27;s unfair and should be fixed. I think separating Amazon &quot;the marketplace&quot; and Amazon &quot;the competing store brand&quot; would help (as long as Amazon &quot;marketplace&quot; sells store data to Amazon &quot;brand name&quot; at the same price it offers everyone else).<p>A law requiring store brand items to be made from an existing manufacturer in it&#x27;s &quot;marketplace&quot; would also help. Supermarkets would be mostly unaffected, Amazon would need to a) buy the product from it&#x27;s Sellers at wholesale volume (like a supermarket) and b) compete based on other merits like faster shipping, customer service, etc.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;b?node=13496283011" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;b?node=13496283011</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its...</a>')
