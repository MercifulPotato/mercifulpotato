After all, its a database query language trying to create a giant cache of its results.<p>For example, we have what roughly amounts to an &lt;Include&gt; component. It uses some contextual information to include language-specific code. That include component pulls in a markdown file from disk based on 1) the includePath you set, and 2) the language selected. In order to make this function, we have to pull in _all_ possible includes within the static query, and then filter it down to the ones we need. There is literally no better way we could do this, because static queries are exactly that - static. There is no fixing this problem because the design of this data layer is broken by default.')
