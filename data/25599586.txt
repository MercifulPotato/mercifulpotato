The primary purpose of banking regulations is population control, it has nothing to do with currency perservation<p>Know your Customer laws, book keeping regulations, etc are all about control and intelligence.  If they can get this intel and allow BTC to operate as is they will leave it alone,  if however they can not get the intel they need on how money is moving well you can bet your life they will crack down hard<p>Governments, all governments even yours, are about Power, Control, and Authority not what people seem to naively think that the government is there to &quot;help&quot; or &quot;protect&quot; or any other just altruistic goals.')
