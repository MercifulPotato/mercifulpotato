But I&#x27;m also saying that based on idle searches for components. I bought most of my PC parts in April 2019, and my (mid-range $300) GPU in spring 2020, with no issues with availability.<p>But it seems like motherboards are 25-100% more expensive now, and we are still waiting on $200-300 graphic cards from this generation.<p>I do think, though, that comparing a relatively single-purpose item like a gaming console to a general purpose desktop computer is also going to have pros and cons on both sides.<p>I&#x27;d much rather be shopping for mid-range (or last generation but still quite performant) computer parts than trying to get one of the consoles right now.')
