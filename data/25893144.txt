They can only refute an absolute statement.<p>But when it comes to actual numbers and breakdowns (which would put a general observation into perspective or prove it wrong) the article is lacking, aside from the 93% which is already large.<p>Also homogenous is not just race, it&#x27;s also about culture, language, and so on, and Japan is homogeneous to a whole other level as a national culture. Those Korean-Japanese are no less Japanese culturally and operate entirely within the Japanese system&#x2F;life.<p>Not like some large communities create their own enclaves, ghettos with different languages, cultures, etc, as seen in some countries.')
