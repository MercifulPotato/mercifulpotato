What exciting times it was!<p>Apple released a killer low end SOC in the M1. It contains the highest performance single core processor in the world along with high end multi core performance. But it’s limited to 16Gb and two USB4&#x2F;Thunderbolt ports, so it’s targeted at the low end.<p>When the M2 is released mid next year, it will be even faster, support four USB4&#x2F;Thunderbolt ports and will also come in 32Gb and 64Gb versions.<p>Greatness takes a small wait sometimes.')
