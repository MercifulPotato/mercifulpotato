If a lawyer tells you something is “probably ok”, but doesn’t cage that “probable” in enough legalese, then they can potentially be held liable in court. This is why you’ll rarely see a good attorney saying things like you suggested.<p>Ultimately though, there is an important thing that GP’s friend missed out on. Lawyers do not <i>tell you what to do</i>, rather instead <i>they advise you of risk</i> on what your options are. It’s <i>your</i> responsibility to decide how much risk you are willing to bear.')
