Facts are still important to those seeking truth. Sure, there are a <i>lot</i> of people seeking reassurance ahead of truth, but there are also simply <i>a lot</i> of people. Given that people now have more ability to make their opinions widely known, I suspect that truth and facts are just as relevant as ever, but that loud noises will be made by those who won&#x27;t be doing anything relevant about it either way.<p>Our ability to judge the relative value of messages is proportional to our ability to reason about the sheer number of people with things to say. I think that wrapping one&#x27;s mind around the enormity of 330 million people may be valuable towards honing in on not only what messages are important, but what movements simply aren&#x27;t.')
