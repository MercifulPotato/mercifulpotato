They&#x27;re just reading messages from the local device. This isn&#x27;t news. This isn&#x27;t a remote attack, nor an attack on the protocol, nor anything like that.<p>This is pure marketing BS. &quot;Decrypting Signal messages and attachments was not an easy task. It required extensive research on many different fronts to create new capabilities from scratch.&quot; is marketing speak for &quot;we read some open source code and reimplemented it, and we want it to sound hard and difficult so you will pay us more money.&quot;<p>Cellebrite&#x27;s stuff is based on 0-day vulnerabilities in phone OSes and hardware in order to extract the data. Once you have the data, the rest of it is parsing and formatting fluff to package up the data in an easily digestible form for law enforcement to use. This is about the latter. There is no vulnerability in Signal being cracked here. It&#x27;s just doing the same thing Signal does to show you your own messages.')
