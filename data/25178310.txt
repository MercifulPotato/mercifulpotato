From my experience, it&#x27;s way easier – from a technical perspective – to think in terms of list items (or &quot;blocks&quot; in general) where each one is some kind of mini-editor. It&#x27;s much easier to link to a block instead of an arbitrary section of your document. Also, it&#x27;s much easier to render a document consisting of blocks without thinking too much about performance.')
