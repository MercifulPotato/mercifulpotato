If I were playing devil&#x27;s advocate, this could be seen as representative democracy incentivizing short-term political thinking leading to this outcome. E.g., it&#x27;s easier to get elected on promises that benefit voters while ignoring harsh realities of how those promises will be paid for.<p>On the other hand, the decisions that led directly to the water crises were made by emergency managers appointed by the governor. This means non-elected officials overruled elected officials. Playing devil&#x27;s advocate here can lead one to believe the displacement of elected officials is an indictment of the functionality of the system to truly be able to select those who govern the constituency.')
