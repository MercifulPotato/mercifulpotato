I used to work out constantly in high school until it got worse in college and I could no longer tax my joints that way.<p>I live with it by trying to do as many healthy habits as I can and reducing stress as much as possible. Healthy diet, good sleep, meditation (&lt;- massively helpful to me), physical therapy (the gentlest exercises I can do without causing pain to any of my joints). I also just try to be a bit kinder to myself. When I was younger and unaffected, I was certainly more arrogant about life and pushed myself to the limit in a variety of facets and took it hard when I didn&#x27;t achieve something. Now, I try to live the healthiest and happiest life possible and not get angry at myself when I cannot focus or am tired.<p>I live with pain in my joints everyday, but I still consider my condition mild compared to many who have autoimmune arthritis.<p>I just try to live the healthiest life I can and remain hopeful for a better treatment in the future. It&#x27;s being working well so far :)')
