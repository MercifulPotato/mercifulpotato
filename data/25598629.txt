Sure - The Wirecutter appears in the first page of Google search for &quot;best dishwasher&quot; but you could also simply start on The Wirecutter page. Same for the humidifier.<p>The Wirecutter <i>is</i> great, and as the article points out, not just because of the review, but because of all the detail about what went into it, and the meta-information (eg: dishwashers need to be cleaned! Who knew? You can pre-clean your dishes <i>too much</i> for the dishwasher to work right? Humidifiers can <i>over</i> humidify!?)<p>For a specific subset of The Stuff in the article, starting at The Wirecutter would be a fine thing as it would be very difficult to find that info and metainfo through Google!<p>It is also worth noting and <i>well</i> worth the purchase price (or often free online through your local library) to look at Consumer Reports. The OG consumer product reviews, and, unlike The Wirecutter, funded entirely by subscriptions, versus referrals. Depending on the specific product, The Wirecutter or Consumer Reports much be more up to date, have better coverage, a different take, or coverage at all.<p>One small difference between CR and The Wirecutter? CR has created a formal standard, and is trying to actively review for, and push for additional security and privacy in consumer devices: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.consumerreports.org&#x2F;privacy&#x2F;consumer-reports-to-begin-evaluating-products-services-for-privacy-and-data-security&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.consumerreports.org&#x2F;privacy&#x2F;consumer-reports-to-...</a>')
