Can&#x27;t help but feel had these been captured we&#x27;d have found simple explanations for each, and people&#x27;s memories of them would be less malleable.<p>Re the naval sightings, the article you&#x27;ve linked to says &quot;experts emphasize that earthly explanations can generally be found for such incidents&quot;.<p>Most interestingly, the captioned video:<p>&quot;That footage, published previously but with little context, shows an object tilting like a spinning top moving against the wind. A pilot refers to a fleet of objects, but no imagery of a fleet was released.&quot;<p>A kernel of truth + some imagination.')
