This is such a weird moment in America history. In one side you have  a rag-tag group of: classical conservatives, flyover working class white people,cuban-americans, evangelicals and in the other you have hollywood, the media, the tech companies, their employees, and the colleges. This is  not a right&#x2F;left split, not even a liberal&#x2F;conservative split, this is a power split (on which the regular people are just cannon-fodder soldiers) between old money and new money.')
