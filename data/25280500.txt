As such, it is a fork not attractive enough to evoke a compiler code-generator fork, or an FPGA implementation variant, or to attract users. That&#x27;s fine for your on-off product, but does me no good.<p>To get all the benefits we expect from the open ISA design, we need enough network effects to amortize the work of maintaining it.<p>It is a fine point to choose how far to go in the fork. Too close, and it&#x27;s not worth doing. Too far, and work on RISC-V doesn&#x27;t help it too.<p>For example, a close-enough fork can be verified by demonstrating that each delta is exactly as correct as the corresponding RISC-V feature, by simple mapping.')
