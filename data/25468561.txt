Item(by='Aeolos', descendants=None, kids=[25468978], score=None, time=1608308609, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25467820, text='On one hand, I totally agree with you: your suggestions would make for a far more mechanically and morally interesting game, and it&#x27;s a shame that the promise set out during the first two hours of the game doesn&#x27;t really pan out in the end.<p>On the other hand, I still have not felt this immersed in a game world and character stories since... well, since maybe The Witcher 3, and before that Planescape: Torment and Terranigma.<p>Other games have done specific aspects better (e.g. original Deus Ex in terms of level design; Horizon: Zero Dawn in terms of action; RDR2 &amp; GTAV in terms of open-world sandbox; TW3 in terms of sheer story-telling quality.) However, I still find myself <i>role playing</i> my character in a way that I didn&#x27;t do with any of those games. I have turned off my minimap and most HUDs to increase my immersion. I drive 99% of the time, instead of using the fast-travel system, because driving and listening to the radio is so damn immersive that I want to stay in that world. I actually <i>care</i> about what is happening to the various characters, even if there is little mechanical pay-off for following a particular path. The first-person camera helps create that illusion of being part of that world. There are bugs, yes, but even a t-posing NPC or a floating item is not sufficient to break that immersion.<p>As far Johnny... my character dislikes him. I oppose him on every turn. However, he still manages to get into my head, and convince me to do things that my character would not have otherwise done. There is no mechanical impact - yet he still changes my&#x2F;my character&#x27;s behaviour.<p>Is this a perfect game? No, far from it, even with all the inevitable bug fixes.  However, no other game has created such an immersive experience for me in recent memory, if ever.<p>For that element alone, I am thankful for not buying into the negativity and giving this a try.<p>(Playing on Geforce NOW at Ultra&#x2F;Psycho settings averaging ~40fps. No crashes so far. Input latency is fine - this is an RPG and the combat is on the easy side, so it doesn&#x27;t really make any difference.)')
