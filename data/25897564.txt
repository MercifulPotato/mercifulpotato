Item(by='eue6e6ey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611533470, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25893546, text='Beans were just one example to emphasize the cost point, though given the rates of obesity in south east asia I&#x27;d point out that even if they can make you fat that it&#x27;s more a matter of not eating too much than the items actually being unhealthy. Speaking to cost again though, at a latino market I can get pork for a bit over $2 a pound for example and chicken is only a few cents more where I am. Beans are by no means the only way to get cheap protein and fats. And if I get tired of rice I can go go to an asian market and get fresh noodles to keep in the fridge for not much more than rice.<p>I&#x27;ll give you that lunch is more of a struggle if you&#x27;re short on time and don&#x27;t want to meal prep but you could still just buy a value menu taco or burger from a fast food joint and be fine (the ultra calorie monster items are not in the value menu). Sure, it&#x27;ll come with transfats and some of the other non-christian food ingredients but one Breakfast Jack, Value Cheeseburger, Potato Taco, etc. per day aren&#x27;t going to be what makes you fat. Which winds back around to my point that the issue isn&#x27;t really one of access for most Americans, it&#x27;s one of preference and excess.')
