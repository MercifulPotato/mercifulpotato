The learning curve is steep, but once you get over it, you can hop into nearly any Rails application and immediately be able to contribute. I prefer Rails for most things work related for that very reason.<p>Having worked a couple places where Python or Go microservices were hyped up, but every installation, DB schema, and folder structure seemed to be built with a different idea in mind, and or debated, I have a strong appreciation for right standards around convention. Especially when I don’t have to get into debates like whether DB table names should be plural or singular.<p>On the side I really do enjoy working with Go though, and wouldn’t hesitate to use it if it seemed like the right tool for the moment.')
