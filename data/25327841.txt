Item(by='jrochkind1', descendants=None, kids=[25330912], score=None, time=1607298829, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25325917, text='This is I think generally (although not exclusively) used for &quot;buying&quot; an apartment (ie a &quot;flat&quot; in the UK), rather than a free-standing house -- what in the U.S. would be a condominium. Such as it would be in the case of Grenfell Tower.<p>Condominium ownership required specific legal authorization in the U.S., which only happened mid 20th century. Before that there was no way to have different people owning different units in a larger building. The closest thing to it was a cooperative, in which you also don&#x27;t <i>really</i> own your unit as real estate, although it isn&#x27;t quite the same thing as a UK leasehold, it overlaps.<p>So, the UK didn&#x27;t even pass similar legislation to legalize a condoninium-like ownership structure (&quot;commonhold&quot;) until the 21st century. And it&#x27;s still not quite the same. And for whatever reasons hasn&#x27;t taken off much, maybe because the leasehold system was already so developed at that point. Switching over ownership structures in existing properties is of course a big hassle (why are there so many more cooperatives than condominiums in NYC, even decades after condos were legally authorized? that&#x27;s part of it)<p>So, people do it, because that&#x27;s what evolved from the particular historical and political context to allow &quot;ownership&quot; of an apartment in a building. There&#x27;s noting &quot;natural&quot; about condominiums, they needed specific legislation to make them possible in the USA too.<p>In the context of council estates specifically, well there&#x27;s a bunch more historical and political context. Land ownership and tenure is a social and political construct, it isn&#x27;t &quot;naturally&quot; any particular way, it turns out.')
