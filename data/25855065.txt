When I was learning Python, I was using PHP, which has $ interpolation for double quoted strings but not single quotes. I didn’t understand how PHP worked at all and it really confused me. In retrospect, I don’t know why it was so hard to wrap my head around, but it was. Learning Python was liberating because I knew exactly when and how interpolation would take place. The decision not to follow the lead of Perl and Bash and auto-interpolate was made deliberately by Guido many years ago. It would be a shame to go back on that decision now.')
