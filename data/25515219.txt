If I remember correctly back then the main selling point was that it used succinct data structure and it was only the compression algo that was not open source - everything else was.<p>But now when I look at the new repo and the online doc there is no mention of succinct data struct anywhere.<p>Also, the benchmarks back then claimed 10x or more faster than RocksDB. Now the performance claim is much more modest.<p>Does that mean TerarkDB no longer uses succinct data struct? Or are you just open sourcing a lower-end version of the software without the secret sauce?<p>Can you talk about what makes TerarkDB faster than RocksDB?')
