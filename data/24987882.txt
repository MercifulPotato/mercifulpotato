So Scala is no longer new and exciting. But it&#x27;s still the best at what it does.<p>I mean, if Rust had higher-kinded types, and the established library ecosystem, and the IDE support that Scala does, then I&#x27;d move to Rust too. But it doesn&#x27;t. When you have a large codebase and need to manage cross-cutting concerns, the only thing that can do that as well as Scala does except Haskell (or more obscure options like Idris), and the state of Haskell tooling is miles behind Scala. I&#x27;m not attached to Scala for Scala&#x27;s sake, but it&#x27;s still my first choice.')
