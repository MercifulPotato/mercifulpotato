I do not believe API design of a math library is in any way the same level, having designed hundreds of APIs and several SDKs myself.”<p>I have designed hundreds of APIs and SDKs myself as well and I could not disagree with you more.<p>API design is about deliberately and creatively considering the domain model of your user (whether that domain is Int or Float for a user who is a low level system programmer or the domain is CheckingAccount and SavingsAccount for a user who is a banking application developer, or anything in between or beyond). You creatively set up APIs so that composition of the API primitives allows direct expression of solutions in the user’s domain.<p>This is exactly like arranging recipes in a recipe book, to organize sections for different styles, meals or amount of prep time, holiday themes, etc. That is exactly software API design to a tee.<p>This article highlights it for me:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.keras.io&#x2F;user-experience-design-for-apis.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.keras.io&#x2F;user-experience-design-for-apis.html</a>')
