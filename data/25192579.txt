What started as “bad headaches” once a week has, over the last six months, graduated into serious migraines where she can’t leave a pitch black room for most of the day. They seem to cycle intensity where they are much worse 2 weeks out of 4.<p>She’s on nortriptyline daily with sumatriptan taken during episodes, but which is only partially effective after the 2nd or 3rd dose and about 5 days a month basically totally ineffective.<p>It’s fucked up that the human body is capable of causing itself so much pain over an ailment we can’t even identify in any test or scan. It’s completely debilitating.<p>If it was for myself I would absolutely experiment with psilocybin or mushrooms in search of a treatment, but her personal history just isn’t conducive to anything remotely hallucinogenic without a very highly experienced guide in the best of circumstances.')
