(The kinds of issues I&#x27;m talking about are like... it was really roundabout and difficult to get a single port with both VLAN tagged as well as untagged traffic flowing through it.)<p>I&#x27;m honestly always surprised their equipment isn&#x27;t more well-known and popular in the tech crowd. While they&#x27;ve got some turnkey stuff, they also sell (or at least sold) devices that were pretty simply a handful of ethernet ports, a switch chip + CPU, and a mini-pcie port that you could add kinda whatever you wanted in to (they sell modules for 802.11, 3G&#x2F;LTE, LoRA, etc). For a lot of models they&#x27;ll also just sell you a bare board. Basically everything comes with a full software license (only real limit is max 200 vpn tunnels, max 200 hotspot users). They sell replacement parts down to bare boards to replace PSUs and things. Basically everything is powerable over PoE, most stuff has a SFP port, etc. Some of the models have had GPIO pins, and on basically all of them all the LEDs can be reprogrammed and are user-controllable. They&#x27;ve got equipment as cheap as $40. A lot of it is actually supported by OpenWRT.<p>Without having used it, if you just want something with wifi and more similar to a consumer router, looks like their hAP AC3 for $99 or something is probably decent. You&#x27;re not losing anything buying the home gear, it&#x27;s still licensed to the same level as all the other gear. Otherwise if you just need a router you can basically just start at the cheap end of their routers and look through the test results for something with acceptable performance for you.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve been using a RB2011 for almost a decade as either a router or core switch and it&#x27;s been great. Though the highest my connection speed&#x27;s been throughout is probably 100mbps. These day&#x27;s it&#x27;s relegated to switching, and handles my setup where I&#x27;ve got all my PoE IP cams on one VLAN, main network on another, trunk running to my server where I&#x27;ve got the DVR and all my other stuff running, etc, etc. Hasn&#x27;t had a single hiccup.')
