GraphQL is too prone to N+1s and other inefficiencies because its in direct opposition of the way data is stored. Its much harder to make an efficient resolver than it is making an efficient REST endpoint.<p>Errors are harder, because HTTP codes are not used and monitoring is a lot more complicated. I see value in GraphQL - but I think it brings a lot of cost to the table.')
