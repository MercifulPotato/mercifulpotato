First of all that computer was maybe $5,000 in today&#x27;s money. (Yes, there were some limited alternatives like the Sinclair and Commodore 64 that were cheaper.) Long distance telephone calls were expensive as were the big BBS systems like Compuserve. Any software you purchased was costly. A C compiler was hundreds of dollars. (Turbo Pascal at $50 was an innovation.)<p>Perhaps more to the point, most people didn&#x27;t just <i>have</i> a computational device of any sort. So the fact that, if you had one, you could use it for a lot of different purposes is sort of irrelevant.')
