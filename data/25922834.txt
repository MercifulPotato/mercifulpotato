What&#x27;s preventing using Language B for the complexity rewrite and getting 0.1 * (1 - 0.7) = 3%?<p>Rewrites do bring the chance to Royally Screw it Upâ„¢ so it&#x27;s certainly not simply a product of &quot;it is now written in &lt;Language X&gt; therefore safe&quot; but as it said not only have projects shown the security didn&#x27;t fall apart but they have shown the opposite.<p>I agree you don&#x27;t get there by a bunch of yolo rewrites to whatever is hip though, it has to be a planned effort that isn&#x27;t rushed. Much in the same way quickly writing a small replacement utility does not inherently make it more secure or reliable than an existing significantly more complex utility. Even just trying to shave some functionality off the existing code is rife with &quot;but how does removing this piece affect the app remaining logic&quot; and takes time and effort to do right.<p>Both methods do have to be done right and both do greatly help security but there is nothing about picking a memory safe language or making a significantly narrower focused utility that preclude each other.')
