One thing worth checking out is TI&#x27;s &quot;Hercules&quot; processor family, which is a low-cost, entry level, but very well implemented &quot;safety processor.&quot; If uses a combination of ECC (not just on caches and main memories, but on peripheral FIFOs) and lockstep computation (running the same instruction through two separate cores in parallel, using them to cross-check each other) to convert malfunction (undefined, arbitrarily complex behavior in the case of a fault) to loss of function. At the system level, two such parts can be used in a failover model, for example, without needing complex voting logic -- anyone who&#x27;s sending you valid messages must be functional.<p>There&#x27;s other lockstep parts out there, and alternatives to lockstep -- for example, triplex redundancy converts (single) malfunction to correct function. But Hercules is well-documented, with interesting white papers, and definitely worth understanding as a starting point.')
