The Colosseum killed what, order 1k ppl&#x2F;yr?  Peak slave trade through Genoa and Venice each seems to be mid-to-low order 1k ppl&#x2F;yr?[1]  And that&#x27;s with women and children being common.  Even Venice had a population an order of magnitude down from peak Rome - they&#x27;d all fit in the Circus Maximus.  And its total slave population was two orders down, at a few thousand, majority women.  So I don&#x27;t quite see those cities individually being able to even afford the dead, let alone the rest of it. There looks a gap of maybe one or two orders of magnitude?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;academiccommons.columbia.edu&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.7916&#x2F;D8610XH4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;academiccommons.columbia.edu&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.7916&#x2F;D8610XH4</a> &#x2F;The Black Sea Slave Population&#x2F;')
