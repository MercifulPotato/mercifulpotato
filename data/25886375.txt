If your argument is that things need to be perfect than my god you must never leave your home! I&#x27;d trust a machine to drive more accurately than most people I see on the highway.<p>Humans aren&#x27;t special, in fact more often than not we&#x27;re sloppy, subject to fatigue, and a whole bunch of other negative things.<p>That considered, I had a pretty strict qualifier in my above post which means the machine must perform better than the average human in the respective task and therefore I&#x27;d be more likely to die driving my own car than a machine meeting my prerequisites.')
