As is uttering insane and unintelligible thoughts in public.<p>If speech is used to further a crime or directly causes civil harm that result in damages (ex. assault or nuisance), there are existing applicable criminal and civil laws to either punish or provide a remedy.<p>If for example, the police were to execute a lawful warrant to search your property, it would not nullify or burden your fourth amendment protection from unreasonable searches and seizures.<p>Similarly, civil remedies (i.e. tort law) allowing for compensation for damages due to negligence - say from getting trampled in a crowd that was spooked by someone yelling &quot;fire&quot; or &quot;shooter&quot; - would not place limitations on your protected right of freedom to assemble.<p>The biggest problem with the campaign to justify censorship or moderation of misinformation&#x2F;disinformation under the guise that it causes harm, is that it removes the measurable injury element of tort law and replaces it with vague and abstract notions of either mass ethereal or psychic harm (which the Supreme Court has expressing found against).')
