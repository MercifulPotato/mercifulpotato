There are communities where their fuel station isn&#x27;t commercially viable but it&#x27;s propped up because without it the community dies. They own their fuel station (often built by a chain or local owner which went out of business because it doesn&#x27;t make commercial sense), a local is paid to run it, they buy fuel from a smaller supplier that doesn&#x27;t have its own chain and then they retail it at either a modest loss or zero profit - because without fuel some residents would leave and having left they won&#x27;t be replaced. I can see some of those communities deciding we&#x27;ll go electric and divert the funding that keeps the fuel station alive to other things that help our community and have a future.')
