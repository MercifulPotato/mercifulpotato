The type system failed to check (but again, different inference algorithms might be able to get around this)<p>No, they exist to change behaviour, that&#x27;s the whole point of that terminology. The example they give is passing a sequence to a vararg method: if you have a generic method that takes a vararg (generic) parameter, then calling that method with multiple parameters from a sequence, or a single parameter that is a sequence, are both valid but have different behaviours.')
