We know nothing and have literally no way to know (only speculate) about anything 10k years ago.<p>I think you&#x27;re missing the mark here. Advances in archaeogenetics and newly found well preserved specimens have added an enormous amount of detail and color into the origins of anatomically modern humans, even in the past decade or two. I mean, the stone age itself began 2.6 million years ago, and we found that out through archaeological evidence.')
