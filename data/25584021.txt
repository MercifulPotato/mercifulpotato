It was incredibly helpful when I was making my decision to buy. Unfortunately now it&#x27;s biased a bit more towards home ownership compared to reality. It doesn&#x27;t incorporate changes in tax law like the $10k SALT cap, mortgage interest cap, income tax brackets shifting, etc. I keep hoping that the NYT will update it someday. Maybe after a few more years of wishing I&#x27;ll just make my own calculator.')
