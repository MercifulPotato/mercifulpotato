We couldn&#x27;t be happier. It&#x27;s one thing to have a single tool with 70% of the functionality you need, it&#x27;s another to have 90%+. That 20% makes such a huge gulf it&#x27;s not even funny. We were able to ditch several thousands of lines of cobbled together glue that moved us 10% forward but added overhead for any new project which set us back a week or more.')
