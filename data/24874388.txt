It&#x27;s been extremely disappointing. I have tried switching to Youtube Music but the interface sucks. I&#x27;m tempted to switch over to the iPhone since I&#x27;m already unhappy with Google in other areas (showing news articles repeatedly for health issues that I searched for one time, not allowing me to turn off gmail for a Google account on Pixel, etc). Google has become extremely user-hostile of late.')
