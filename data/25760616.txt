He is an internet troll who calls for violent action to overthrow the elected government. You can&#x27;t be tolerant of that kind of intolerance, or your democracy will not survive it.<p>In general though, I feel like deplatforming someone is something you should be able to challenge in front of a judge, just like being refused entry to a public business is something you can challenge in front of a judge. For healthy online debate, you need to have the ability to remove trolls from a platform, but the standard of who is or is not a troll cannot be set by the platform itself.')
