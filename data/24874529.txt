I am not in the United States,  I am no expert. But the over-representation of some groups may be what is wrong with that data. It could be that those people that were missed by the survey feel more exploited?<p>Across the pond in the UK it is not drivers welfare that is driving me to think they should be employees, but tax.  In the UK being employed means your boss pays national insurance (a kind of tax). Secondly VAT (sales tax) is only charged by entities with sales over Â£85k ie not one driver on their own (making them much cheaper). However if they were employees the sales would be by Uber and subject to 20%VAT. HMRC finally got around to demanding this from Uber this week.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goodlawproject.org&#x2F;update&#x2F;hmrc-to-collect-1-5bn-uber&#x2F;?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=uber&amp;utm_medium=social%20media" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goodlawproject.org&#x2F;update&#x2F;hmrc-to-collect-1-5bn-uber...</a>')
