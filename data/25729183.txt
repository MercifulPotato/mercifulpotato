Instead we use it for deep frying - a task for which it&#x27;s better suited than any-other our other vessels.<p>We do our stir-frying on a regular 14 in carbon steel wok, nothing fancy.  It does take a bit more oomph than most American gas stoves provide, but we&#x27;ve had good results by ponying up for a Bluestar range [0] which outputs 25K BTU&#x2F;h ... well short of what you see in Chinese restaurants, but on par with Western commercial stoves.<p>Actual Asian households don&#x27;t generally cook on fancy restaurant stoves, and yet somehow manage to stir-fry satisfactorily.  The trick is they use propane, which has about twice the energy density of natural gas.  So it&#x27;s a lot more effective (and cost-effective) to use a turkey fryer&#x2F;crab boil burner to do your stir-frying, if you can swing it.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bluestarcooking.com&#x2F;cooking&#x2F;rangetops&#x2F;36-platinum-rangetop&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bluestarcooking.com&#x2F;cooking&#x2F;rangetops&#x2F;36-platinu...</a>')
