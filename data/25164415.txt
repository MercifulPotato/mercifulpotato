Item(by='unixsheikh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605903139, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25164104, text='&gt; Why? Why not use a single protocol that&#x27;s widely tested and trusted by security experts? I mean, we didn&#x27;t come up with a brand new encryption strategy for FTP, we made FTPS.<p>&gt; Why on earth would we want to use 5 different encryption protocols in the browser? That&#x27;s just pointlessly adding attack surface. What&#x27;s wrong with HTTPS that means it&#x27;s a bad fit for encrypting a DNS query? A DNS query is essentially at its core an HTTP request to a remote server, and HTTPS is already very good at encrypting HTTP requests. There&#x27;s no need to reinvent the wheel here.<p>This <i></i>is<i></i> where you&#x27;re wrong. A DNS request is far from the same as a HTTP request!<p>You don&#x27;t seem to understand how the technology really works in the underlying protocol.<p>HTTPS is designed to encrypt HTTP traffic, it was never designed to be stuffed by other kinds of traffic. When you stuff DNS into HTTPS you not only get a destination IP in clear text, something you cannot get if you use DoT e.g.<p>Furthermore, DoH also completely ruins analysis and monitoring of DNS traffic for security purposes. Already DoH has been used in a worm to mask connections to its command-and-control server.<p>If you want to solve the obvious problems with DNS, you don&#x27;t keep doing the same mistake over and over again by patching with the same half-baked solution.<p>DoH does not solve ANY of the issues it is set out to do! I have worked for a long time in the ISP industry, users gets tracked by source IP and destination IP mainly, and figuring out what particular website they have visited, even when the hosting provider has multiple websites running on the same IP, is so easy just by looking at a hash of the payload that it is ridiculous.<p>DoH is &quot;fake privacy&quot;. Period.')
