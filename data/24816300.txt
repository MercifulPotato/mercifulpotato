I personally find the &#x2F;etc&#x2F;host mapping a likelier hypothesis but even that can&#x27;t explain how different credentials failed to prevent this. Without more details coming from a proper investigation, we are just piling assumptions on top of assumptions. We are making bricks, without enough clay, as Holmes would say.')
