I know that I personally don’t have enough knowledge and experience to know what’s right for all people at all times. Life can be complicated. Let’s have some compassion folks.<p>As an EU citizen, I feel this is pretty much a no-brainer. Politics based on compromises between parties, rather than single-party majorities, slows the political process down and it definitely opens the door for a whole lot of different issues, but it kinda works. Switching from extreme to extreme every 4&#x2F;8 years feels like it&#x27;s just going to increase political polarization until societal cohesion breaks and something bad happens.<p>Yes, we Europeans whine a lot about the EU and there&#x27;s a shitload of things that need to be improved about it, but the last few years&#x27; circus on the other side of the Pond has convinced me that the alternative isn&#x27;t that much better.')
