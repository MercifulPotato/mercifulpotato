Item(by='6gvONxR4sf7o', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611173765, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25849902, text='&gt; Loeb is right about one thing: the notion of &quot;extraordinary evidence&quot; is very destructive. Evidence is evidence.<p>I agree with pretty much everything you&#x27;re saying except this. Though I still do agree with this a bit. It seems like a shorthand for &quot;be bayesian&quot; that&#x27;s unfortunately taken too far too frequently. But if I have a strong prior one way or another, I will need stronger evidence to turn me around.<p>+1 on your main point though. Why can&#x27;t more people be more comfortable in a state of uncertainty ;_;')
