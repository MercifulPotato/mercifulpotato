Item(by='snoshy', descendants=None, kids=[25796331], score=None, time=1610737308, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25794366, text='&gt; You think we donâ€™t have enough traditional options to level London on a Tuesday afternoon?<p>I actually don&#x27;t think there are any that are feasible.  Leveling a city the size of London is no small feat, and amassing the troops and weaponry required to carry it out seems like a complicated enough exercise that it would take longer than &quot;Tuesday afternoon&quot;.<p>Not that I don&#x27;t think it can be done, but just that moving a large traditional military apparatus, or even mustering enough conventional missiles to flatten an area that large seems like it would take far longer than that.<p>The &quot;shock and awe&quot; campaign waged on Baghdad might be similar in scale within about an order of magnitude, and it certainly took a heck of a lot longer than an afternoon, although the goal was never to level the city in its entirety.')
