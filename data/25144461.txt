It&#x27;s become very anti-user in the past few years under the new maintainers. Even the original maintainer has said publicly that he doesn&#x27;t like the direction the new maintainers took homebrew. All the changes the current maintainers of homebrew have made have been in the direction of &quot;make maintaining homebrew easier so we get less questions&quot; without any thought to the user experience those changes cause.')
