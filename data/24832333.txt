For me part of it was luck (lucky that someone took a chance on me and I grew into it from there), but looking back I think putting yourself into a position where you get to practice doing something you&#x27;re actually passionate about will end up bleeding through into a natural progression&#x2F;networking. For example, if programming is your hobby before it&#x27;s your job, by the time you&#x27;re wanting to interview for a job you will probably already be in some kind of club&#x2F;group, local makerspace, have friends online who are into game mods, etc. to help get your foot in the door and that&#x27;s all before you&#x27;re even college-aged.')
