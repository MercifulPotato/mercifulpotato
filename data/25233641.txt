It expanded. That condensed heat is still there just thinned out. Empty space has a temperature. That&#x27;s what I think of when I hear about cosmic microwave background radiation.<p>When I hear parity violation, I think of spin and beta decay. Even if the beta decay is the same, the way the nucleus is spinning means something completely different.<p>And by spin, we mean a model of angular momentum of a quantum point:<p>Heat transfers through conductive surfaces, convective mediums, and electromagnetic radiation. What&#x27;s EM? Nature transferring heat by speeding up and slowing down clocks. It&#x27;s easier for nature to slow down the watch, run a mile, and speed up the watch again, than it&#x27;s just to keep the watch steady. Nature has no mind. It takes the easiest route like a pressure vessel pushes on all seals. You can say EM is heat transfer using time frequency as it&#x27;s medium. White hot means relative clock ticks fast. Gravitational dark means relative clock ticks slow.<p>Since something needs to charge up a little before EM&#x27;ing brighter, you have a finite start and end, you have a particle. That&#x27;s the photon. The photon hits the entire surface at once, so frequency matters not intensity, and the internal voltage of the conductive object increases, that&#x27;s the electron. So angular momentum and spin here means something completely counter-intuitive. It&#x27;s a model, a mental shortcut, but plenty of room to hide applications in translation.<p>When I hear polarization, I think of interference. This heat transfer through EM travels through a medium. That medium provides loss and transfers the EM into internal heat.<p>How soon before we are looking at our own shadows on this? Side effects of lenses focusing across great distances?<p>Cars going the same speed on the highway see a de-acceleration when they measure the speed against the road vs. the speed against another car. That&#x27;s theory of gravity enough for me. Just replace those cars with what we know about electromagnetism.')
