The last time I was out of work my wife was asking why I wasn&#x27;t pounding the pavement sending out tons of cover letters and resumes and the like. I told her that in the 21 years I&#x27;ve been working, I&#x27;ve not gotten a single job via that route. It&#x27;s always been networking. At some point about 10-15 years ago I just stopped even bothering with a resume at all. If I can&#x27;t get in front of a decision maker, I don&#x27;t consider it a viable opportunity. In contrast, About 75% of the time I&#x27;ve been able to speak directly to a department head, manager, or C-suite executive I&#x27;ve been hired on the back of a 30-45 minute conversation. I&#x27;ll take a 3 out of 4 hit rate on a pair of conversations over sending out dozens of customized cover letters and resumes any day of the week.')
