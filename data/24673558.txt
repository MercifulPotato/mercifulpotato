And their pollution is high because of their choice of fuel, not anything inherent to cruising. Specifically, the use of bunker fuel vs other alternatives drives SOx and NOx emissions extremely high, but carbon emissions are actually pretty low. Per person, a weeklong cruise has carbon emissions about equivalent to a 12 hour flight in economy class.<p>So if you want lower pollution, maybe just target the use of   bunker fuel, and force them into low sulfur fuels like the shipping industry has already done. And if carbon emissions are still a problem, ban private jets and first class flights.')
