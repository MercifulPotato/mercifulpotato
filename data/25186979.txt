We ultimately felt (and this is above my paygrade) that it was outside the scope of what we were asked to explore&#x2F;recommend. So we avoided suggesting taxes that drastically change corporate incentives and behavior around private data. Instead we focused on more equitably distributing the value that&#x27;s currently generated from data.<p>We did discuss this and felt that a very deep dive would be needed. (A) It&#x27;s not an objective no-brainer exactly what behavior you want to disincentivize. (B) The economic impacts&#x2F;consequences could be huge, so the tradeoff needs to be carefully considered.<p>One example is Google Maps. Right now it has privacy drawbacks, but it also generates a lot of utility for a lot of people and is relatively freely accessible for individuals. You&#x27;d want to be careful about screwing that up. For example, incentivizing Google to switch to a paid access model.<p>I guess part of what this EFF article is saying is: these decisions are better treated as part of privacy law &#x2F; human rights, rather than economics...I&#x27;d be interested to hear your thoughts!')
