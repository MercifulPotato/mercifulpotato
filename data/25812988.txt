We can&#x27;t get away from USB-A because all of the devices that MATTER use it and its variations.  Even today no one that I&#x27;ve seen makes a USB-C to USB-Micro (or USB-Mini - yes, I still have multiple products that use that) cable.  I have no interest in having to chain multiple adaptors off all my computers for everything I do.  Keyboards, mice, printers, cameras, microphones, audio adapters, gaming controllers, smartwatches, sensors, Arduino boards -- none of these things need any more speed or any more power.  They don&#x27;t want a new connector and they don&#x27;t want to pay royalty fees for use of a new connector.  The only things that might benefit from USB 4 are monitors (and how often to people replace monitors anyway?  I ran my U2410s for a decade and only replaced them because I wanted a higher refresh rate) and storage devices (and to be honest I don&#x27;t use external storage that often since online storage is so simple these days).')
