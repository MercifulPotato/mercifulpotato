Even if the search terms are esoteric and not targeted by anyone other advertisers, google would rather show nothing than show your ad.<p>So I am afraid this dream of a niche product showing a highly targeted ad to a handful of searchers each day is <i>actively thwarted by google</i>.<p>Frankly it&#x27;s no longer an issue for us - the venn diagram of &quot;people smart enough to use rsync.net&quot; and &quot;people not using an adblocker&quot; contains zero people.')
