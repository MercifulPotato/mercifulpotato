Internet allowed you to speak your mind and find people who thought like you and escape status quo. With few extreme exceptions, you could discuss things no matter how controversial. But that is apparently no more the case...<p>For me, it noticeably started with Youtube and Reddit. Extreme censorship in the name of copyright or &#x27;toxicity&#x27;.<p>Companies used to do press release if they would ban something off their platform justifying with proof. But now, say a word that may make any advertiser unhappy and get deplatformed in an instant (cue: twitch). Infact, have some figurative association with someone unpopular and get banned, for no fault of your own.<p>So much for &quot;I Will Defend to the Death Your Right to Say It.&quot;<p>And very much of the following situation...<p>First they came for ...Then they came for meâ€”and there was no one left to speak for me.<p>For all the &#x27;future&#x27; talk YC does, build the future you want to be in, YC companies are sure normalizing censorship.
