If every single employee including owners already pay income tax, and IVA&#x2F;GST&#x2F;purchase taxes, property taxes, xyz additional personal taxes levied by respective governments, why then on top of all that make companies pay tax, doesn&#x27;t that just detract from people wanting to start companies and&#x2F;or seek countries with the least taxes&#x2F;best loopholes?<p>Disclaimer: I own no companies. I don&#x27;t even own stocks at the moment.')
