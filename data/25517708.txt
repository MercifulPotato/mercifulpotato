It&#x27;s demand-side, not supply-side.<p>If a CEO causes 1000 employees to be 1% more efficient, that creates the same value as 1000 employees each being 1% more efficient. Ergo, if I&#x27;m an investor, if I believe a CEO will be slightly better than another CEO, it makes sense to pay a lot more.<p>If I have a market of 7 billion people in the world, and my software saves everyone a dollar, I&#x27;ve created $7E9 of value in the world, and probably monetized $7E7-$7E8 of value for myself. 40 years ago, my market was the US -- roughly 300 million people. With globalization, it&#x27;s 7 billion.<p>If I&#x27;m making a search engine or webmail client, it&#x27;s winner-takes-all. If I can hire two engineers, and I believe (statistically, per my lousy interview process) that one is 1% better than the other, I&#x27;ll drop a shit-ton of money to hire them. See Mythical Man Month for why hiring an extra person with the &quot;saved&quot; money doesn&#x27;t have the same effect.<p>And so on...<p>Economies of scale, winner-takes-all-markets, and zero marginal cost goods like IP fundamentally push salaries at the top up, even with small differences in performance, measured with noisy tools. I&#x27;ve worked with many CEOs. Someone who makes $10M isn&#x27;t necessarily brighter than someone who makes $100k, but the demand-side economics still work out that way. The $10M salary often comes down to signalling; they&#x27;ve managed a big organization before, they have a nice elite university brand stamp, or they felt better the day of the interview. It STILL makes sense. My expected returns are STILL higher.<p>Where things break down a little bit is corruption and misaligned incentives -- lots of places, if you pay more, you get less -- but I think that&#x27;s under-acknowledged. Things also break down is Simpson&#x27;s Paradox. Globalization means income inequality WITHIN countries is getting worse, but worldwide, is getting better.')
