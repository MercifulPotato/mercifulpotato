I think that&#x27;s a great idea. I&#x27;ve been exploring doing that with Goodreads. Re: escaping ideological bubbles, I do agree, though I think that curiosity and gentle exposure can expand peoples&#x27; bubbles in a small enough way that it doesn&#x27;t evoke ideological dissonance (especially in the realm of politics. Maybe there&#x27;s a way that I can make it a gentler exposure to new ideas.')
