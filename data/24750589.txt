Also It was running at 1920x1200, going to a 4:3 lcd with smaller display seemed wrong.<p>Funny, I bought first 24inch LCD, a dell, color matched, and they gave me a free pc. Put a nvidia 8800GT in and gamed for quiet a while, it came with a pentium D 820, after a few years put a 960 in it. Think I got 5+ years of gaming on it.<p>Still using the LCD as my 2nd monitor net to my 27 inch 1440p wide screen gsync gaming monitor.')
