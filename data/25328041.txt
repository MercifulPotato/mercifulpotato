The Network is a meme, knowing what it is has the effect of creating it.<p>The last time it could have been possible, with tremendous effort, to divert things such that the Internet didn&#x27;t become the Network and something else did, would have been around 1990.<p>That&#x27;s the point where JIPS happens. Up until then, the US has a lot of IP networking, but some other rich industrialised countries have the ITU&#x27;s X.25 networking. The ITU in some sense are a logical place to look for the beginning of this Network because they oversaw technological development for its predecessor, the Public Switched Telephone Network.<p>Anyway in the UK they have some X.25 but people are interested in this American IP stuff, so they agree to offer establishments with X.25 access to IP as well starting January 1991, in a programme called JIPS (the JaNET IP Service). JIPS is an enormous success, everybody loves IP and soon it is apparent that the future is IP not X.25. Game over, the Internet becomes inevitable at that point.<p>Now, I care also about the last mile, &quot;phase I delivery of the Network&quot; meaning that ordinary citizens in most of the world have access to the Network. No iterations of the Network have been truly <i>universally</i> accessible. Even for the oldest (the global postal network agreed in Bern in 1874) you need at least literacy, a taught skill not truly accessible to every person. But we can get very close, and it took several more years for the Internet to do that.')
