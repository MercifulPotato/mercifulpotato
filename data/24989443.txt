We just take for granted that public space in cities needs to be uncomfortably loud because most people haven&#x27;t had it otherwise in living memory. It could be so different and everyone would prefer it if it were. Most loud noises on streets are loud because of all the cars on the street, and  also the fact that people in the cars can&#x27;t hear as well as people outside of cars (necessitating louder horns, sirens, etc.)')
