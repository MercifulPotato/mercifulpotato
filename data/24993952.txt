Many of them are good, but some are bad, and by being in the constitution, are now nearly impossible to change.<p>This law was basically written by Google and Facebook, so it is a combination of regulatory capture and their hidden agenda.  We already have a strong privacy law passed by the legislature a few years ago.  Any changes should have gone through the legislature, but the reason they didn&#x27;t do that was because the stuff in this law were too radical even for the California legislature, so they took it straight to the people.<p>Interestingly, it passed in all of the liberal strongholds of the state, except San Francisco county.')
