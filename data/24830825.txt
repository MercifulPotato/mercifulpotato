But let me explain:<p>Basically, on sites like Reddit, if a community gets controversial, it almost certainly will get media attention, and potentially get banned or censored because of that. Similarly, if someone says something controversial on Twitter, that could mean losing their job or what not too.<p>That can&#x27;t happen as easily on Discord, since you need the invite link to join, and can more easily keep out snooping journalists, moral guardians, etc.')
