I don’t know why he’s so confident that existing algorithms for credit-card scoring, parole consultation, shopping and media recommendations, etc., are unbiased and not capable of outside improvement. I respect his concern about political involvement in these processes—but the existing algorithms are human products and are already the result of political processes. Again, his concern that “progressives will blithely assign prejudices even to algorithms that transparently can’t have any,” is missing the point that the structure and inputs of these algorithms are the result of existing human choices.&quot;')
