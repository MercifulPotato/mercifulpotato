Today in video calls, tomorrow will be in ever realistic virtual reality. Maybe at some point we will be so good at mimicking reality and also so good at creating new scenarios where it is not possible in reality. But after this experiencing this pandemic, staying home for more than half of the year, interacting people remotely, at least for me, I can&#x27;t wait for the time to finally able to meet people face to face. Even though a lot of companies have offered forever working from home, I don&#x27;t think I will take that offer. Its just feels so much better to talk to people, see people in person. Whether its the body language, people&#x27;s emotions, or physical interactions, and the in the moment and immediateness of everything. I don&#x27;t think computers, VR and AR will ever going to replace that experience.<p>For zoom though, I think that they will continue to find ways to extract more revenue per users. I think what will increase in the future is more and more economy will be digital economy, and people will be more willing to pay for and do commerce in a virtual platform. And companies will find ever more commerce opportunities with digital technologies. So I think they will continue to increase their revenue.')
