IPv4 is never, ever going away because of this.<p>The only people who couldn&#x27;t see this coming were from Bell System backgrounds where you could use centralized schemes like &quot;Ma Bell says tomorrow is the Flag Day, flip the switch&quot;.  In a decentralized system people don&#x27;t stop using the old system until you give them a new system that is backwards compatible.  Then you  drop the backwards compatibility in a <i>second, separate</i> upgrade much later, on a timetable dictated by adoption, not flag days.')
