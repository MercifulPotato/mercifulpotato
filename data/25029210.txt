Assuming many people only listen to a couple hundred songs per months, at Spotify&#x27;s per stream rate of .3-.5Â¢, they would pay a lot less if they only paid for the music they were listening to.<p>I think the &quot;user centric&quot; model has potential for problems because artists would feel cheated that they don&#x27;t get paid proportional to how many listens they drive. And why shouldn&#x27;t they feel cheated? If someone is listening to an artist for hours a day, everyday, then that person is getting a lot more value out of the artist than a measly 7 bucks(&#x2F;euros) per month. So it&#x27;s natural for the artist to demand to be paid more. The issue is basically that the <i>more</i> money comes not from the person who&#x27;s driving <i>more</i> listens, but instead from other users who are using the service far less.<p>The pro-rata approach basically exists to hides this unfairness, since paying for a streaming subscription feels like paying a fixed cost for a fixed service (access to a massive library). But there&#x27;s potential for disruption, I think, via a service that exposes this unfairness through a-la-carte rates.')
