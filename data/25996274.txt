It’s a Google MVP, it doesn’t have to be truly viable, only viable to google middle management looking for a promotion.<p>That’s what people are lamenting, you can’t role out a <i>competitive</i> gaming platform with such a small catalog of titles.<p>&gt;I bought an Xbox to play Red Dead Redemption 2 . . . lots of people falling into the “who this is for” camp<p>Those people appear to be “casual&#x2F;occasional gamers”? I am very doubtful that this group will really turn into \na cash cow. $10.00&#x2F;month is enough that few are going to keep a subscription after they are done playing. If you amortize a console over a lifetime of 4 years it would be considerably cheaper than paying for stadia if you consider the current $75 upfront cost.<p>So the way I see it, for stadia to be viable there would have to be a steady stream of AAA titles(because otherwise the need for cloud compute is questionable) produced by 3rd party studios...this just doesn’t exist, titles like RDR2 &amp; CP2077 are an exception. We only saw a handful of titles that demanding and hyped come from a non-Microsoft, non-Sony published studio in the last decade. I’m not in the game dev world, but producing these types of titles seems to be exceptionally difficult, and the trend seems to be less and less AAA titles per year as the complexity compounds.<p>Combined with stadia’s limited selection, Google’s history of product abandonment, and that you often have to <i>purchase</i> stadia specific versions of titles to play them on the platform. It’s a difficult pill to swallow. \n Nvidia’s product, GeForce Now, where titles are portable   seems like a much more viable product to me.')
