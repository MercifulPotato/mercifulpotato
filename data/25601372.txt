Item(by='kstenerud', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609483041, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25600600, text='Sites with &quot;high quality&quot; content are only high quality in very specific areas, and are not devoid of noise. HN is good for getting quality information from insiders and experts in various elite fields (particularly technology related). Reddit is good for DIY stuff and special interest groups for personal things (finance, healthy living, repairs, building things, etc).<p>But of course the content of each site tends to go far outside its areas of competence, which is where moderation is needed (otherwise they turn into 4chan or youtube). You get a feel for the bullshit after being on the site awhile, and once you&#x27;re well tuned to it you see it everywhere (the &quot;this site has gone downhill&quot; effect).')
