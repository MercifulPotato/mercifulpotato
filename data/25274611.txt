This approach ensures I never have access to user’s data - it stays completely within the Apple ecosystem.<p>I have also taken a mobile-first approach, I think that focus reduced some of the installation and maintenance barriers for users. With the iOS app there’s no deployment or setup cost for users. Personal interactions (chat) and data (contacts, calendars) are already managed through our phones, so the iOS app also seems to be a natural fit for other reasons.<p>I hope to see more products&#x2F;projects where the users data, monetization, and developer incentives align. It’s great to see an open source PRM project that matches those incentives.')
