It’s almost always due to decreased demand. E.g. the price of taxicab medallions in New York did not fall because the government increased the number of medallions; it was because Uber and Lyft decreased the demand. People sometimes reply, “but that’s the same thing!” I don’t think it is though. Obviously if the number of available medallions went up, we might see a similar effect, but that’s not what actually happened: the political situation restricting the supply never went away.')
