They feel amazing, they actually seem to <i>fix</i> my back pain, and I&#x27;m just downright strong in them(compared to my maxes in nearly every other exercise).<p>Now, I also have to say that as a 45 year old who has now gone through shoulder surgery, and gave up anything beyond farmers carries( * ) when it comes to weightlifting, that most people should just stick to cardio.  I feel <i>so</i> <i>much</i> <i>better</i> now that I&#x27;m doing crazy hikes again and not carrying around a bunch of useless muscle.  I&#x27;m better in bed, I feel less pain, I have more energy, and I&#x27;m not spending all day worrying about protein targets.  To each their own.  Weightlifting was fun and being big is kinda satisfying, but it&#x27;s not something I will recommend anymore.<p>* - I&#x27;ll probably get a bar and some plates to resume lower weight(275 or less), higher rep DLs once I move out of the bay area and have the space.')
