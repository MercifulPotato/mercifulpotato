Let&#x27;s say you have $10M USD in deposits. You can print $20M in USDT as long as you&#x27;re reasonably sure that on average, people don&#x27;t withdraw 50% of their deposits. This gets tricky though because USDT is used by multiple exchanges, so I&#x27;m not sure what exactly would happen if everyone withdraws their deposits not in USD, but in USDT to another exchange. They&#x27;d all need to be in on the conspiracy with some sort of settlement system to transfer money between them.')
