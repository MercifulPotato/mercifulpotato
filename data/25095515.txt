One day I randomly googled for some of its features and found a post of a guy who claimed (and I believe him) that Invoicely is a blatant screen-by-screen clone of their own SaaS.<p>I felt really bad for that guy, and after some time I thought that it&#x27;s a good idea to switch to them. The problem: their website name is so difficult to remember, I never got around to actually opening an account there.<p>Some shifty guys literally copied an existing service up to their Javascript and CSS, and improved it dramatically just by giving it a name I can remember.')
