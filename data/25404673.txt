The website is about the changing visual representation of Africa as expressed through the medium of the photobook. By showcasing book spreads the books become partly accessible to a wider public and function as a platform for students, collectors and experts to talk about the content of the books. People can engage with each other through a Facebook page as well.<p>&gt; Africa in the Photobook is looking for books made by African artists or books printed in African countries, but also focusses on books made outside the continent by non-African photographers and writers. This is especially the case for books produced during the colonial era.<p>&gt;By showing books, the website doesnâ€™t want to suggest to agree with the content, since many books tend to be highly propagandistic and sometimes blatant paternalistic and&#x2F;or even racist.<p>&gt; The research and writing process for the first publication titled Africa in the Photobook; Colonial Africa 1880s-1950s is made possible by the Mondriaan Fund.')
