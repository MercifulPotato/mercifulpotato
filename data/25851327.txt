I can&#x27;t speak for Disney and Star Wars because Star Wars was never my thing.<p>These creative endeavours have a soul, or an essence, for want of a better term. You can replicate a game or a movie and it will feel utterly soulless compared to the original, even if you can&#x27;t visibly notice a difference.<p>You could reproduce Minecraft but even the most infinitesimal divergence from the original will make it feel fake. Maybe the controls have a different &#x27;feel&#x27;, or the way the scene is rendered feels a bit off. It&#x27;s just not Minecraft any more. There are just so many quirks and details that will be lost in the translation, or even patched over if they&#x27;re seen as bugs.<p>It&#x27;s no different if you ported a game from Unity to Unreal and then to CryEngine. I&#x27;m sure that with a blind comparison you would be able to &#x27;feel&#x27; the difference.<p>And the same for films. The way these things were created has a lot of influence over the end result.<p>On the other hand, it&#x27;s exactly what can make a remake or remaster so successful. The Resident Evil 2 and 3 remakes that followed Resi 7 were phenomenal! Not totally faithful to the originals, didn&#x27;t try to be...they just took an older game and gave it a new life.')
