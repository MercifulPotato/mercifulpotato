Look at micro four thirds. At the high end they don’t get lighter except for really long wide lenses. That’s because they got heavier when autofocus was added.  The original manual focus Nikon 500mm f4 “only” weighs 3kg. It’s lighter than the current $12k model which shed about 2.4kg since the first autofocus version.<p>Plastic is easiest way to make a lens lighter and high end buyers are adverse to plastic. People buy lenses by the kilogram so to speak.')
