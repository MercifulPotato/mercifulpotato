I have not had any reliability issues, but you do not want to be hasty with version upgrades unless you need it to fix a bug. Read release notes.<p>I have an Edgemax ER-Lite router and a UAC-AP-Pro access point, and a security camera for testing.<p>If you can, it&#x27;s best to stick with one lineup of products. Unifi is one line, edgemax is another, amplifi is another, and so on - having one management plane is optimal. I have thought about getting a Unifi router so everything is done through one control center, but I don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to.<p>tl;dr - I think they are great for the money. You can do advanced stuff with the routers as well, like VPN gateways and BGP if needed, but not always easily in the GUI.')
