And - speculating - I’d guess that there’s quite a lot of code in Electron apps that isn’t AOTed by Rosetta, and that it would have more performance implications there than a native x86 Mac App would just because it has a lot of ongoing transpilation to do. With this change they can cut out Rosetta 2, and run direct on ARM.')
