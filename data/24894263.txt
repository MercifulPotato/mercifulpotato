It is faster&#x2F;more efficient as I read faster than I listen and type faster than I talk. It is easier (and faster) to later read what was agreed in details (the MoMs always seem to lack details and then later it&#x27;s a &#x27;i did not say that&#x27; mess), it&#x27;s easy to create docs &#x2F; emails from the content and if it was technical, nothing is lost and can be copy&#x2F;pasted to terminals etc. And it&#x27;s async; the &#x27;think on your feet&#x27; can be nice, but I notice not so many people are good at it.<p>I have ran companies like this for 25+ years, sometimes with people (as co-founders) I have never even spoke to (and never saw); works fine; I don&#x27;t notice the difference (besides that I find this way of working more efficient).')
