It has it&#x27;s pros (running Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04 workers side-by-side and ease of pushing out an update) but it&#x27;s fragile and confusing.  Things can get really hacky when you need to start sharing volumes or injecting additional configuration.<p>I&#x27;m much more confident with packer now though.  Next time I do any major work on our Jenkins infrastructure I&#x27;m ripping out docker-in-docker for the workers and replacing it with packer built images.')
