With a bit of luck (and yes, work), I extracted myself from this group. I&#x27;m not rich, but I have zero debt. I own a house, multiple vehicles, and an 4 season expedition camper - free and clear. I have a rewarding and unusual career.<p>By contrast, the entirety of my close and extended family lives in poverty. Bankruptcy, car repos, eviction, and mortgage default are almost a game. MY father died at the age of 40. My grandfather: 36. My brother died at 42 (after a lethal encounter with police after speeding).<p>I&#x27;m 56 (The oldest of any male in two generations). I have multiple retirement accounts. First class healthcare. I take care of my Mom. I can&#x27;t predict the future, but I suspect my economic success will allow me a longer, more fulfilling life.<p>I&#x27;m convinced that access to healthcare, decent work, and basic housing would have allowed my short lived male family members to live longer with a better quality of life.')
