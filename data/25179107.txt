Item(by='kazinator', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606065570, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25176213, text='&gt; <i>this is what my search history looked like</i><p>&gt; <i>gimp resize image</i><p>Image -&gt; Scale Image<p>Very bizarre, indeed! Scaling the image is a &quot;Scale Image&quot; command in an &quot;Image&quot; menu.<p>&gt; <i>gimp rotate layer</i><p>Layer -&gt; Transform -&gt; Rotate { 90° Clockwise, 90° Counter-Clockwise, Arbitrary Rotation ...}<p>Totally undiscoverable. Rotating a layer is buried in the completely unrelated Layer menu and obfuscated by terminology. The user has to be a propeller-head who knows bizarre jargon, such as that a rotation is a kind of &quot;transform&quot; and might be hiding under a menu item labeled that way.<p>To add insult to injury, this menu item has not moved in at least 15 years to a more obvious place. Gimp clearly likes existing users better than new ones.<p>&gt; <i>gimp rescale interactive</i><p>In the latest stable Gimp (2.10.22) which I just installed last night, there is a surprise: I can&#x27;t find the Rotate tool button. Aha, there is an &quot;all in one&quot; transformation tool. The Gimp version I previously used still had separate toolbar buttons for different transforms.<p>I see that we can right click on the all-in-one transformation button, and then pick a specific kind of transform. We want Scale, which is also available as the familiar Shift-S hotkey.<p>The Tool Options dialog comes up for the tool. I see that the very first item is a bunch of icon-labeled buttons next to a Transform: label. They all have tooltips: &quot;layer&quot;, &quot;selection&quot;, &quot;path&quot; and &quot;image&quot;. Aha: Transform -&gt; &quot;image&quot; must be what we want. We click on that.<p>Now we proceed to interactively rotate the image, and apply that change using the Scale button on the rotate dialog.<p>In summary: Shift-S to scale, pick &quot;image&quot;, do the interactive scale, and click &quot;Scale&quot; to make it stick.<p>For your other queries, you just have to know how to work with transparent layers in Gimp. Gimp is not a carbon copy of Photoshop.<p>You were not born knowing how to erase pixels transparently in Photoshop.')
