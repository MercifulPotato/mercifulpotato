They have multiple other options.<p>What&#x27;s the point in picking your favorite party if the outcome would be worse? If I think that being an astronaut will bring me the most happiness in life, I went down that career path, and end up failing (because the odds of actually being an astronaut is slim), then arguably that would be a waste of time (ignoring any additional happiness you get along the way). I&#x27;d be much better off with a career path that provides less happiness, but is more achievable.<p>&gt;As has been pointed out by plenty of people: If you subscribe to the &quot;vote was wasted&quot; mentality, at least be consistent. Your vote is wasted any time you don&#x27;t live in a swing state. I&#x27;ve lived in extreme blue and extreme red states, and who I voted for really had no consequence at all.<p>I never made the claim that voting for third party in a swing state is bad. But yes, if the state is sufficiently &quot;safe&quot;, the disadvantage of voting third party is marginal.')
