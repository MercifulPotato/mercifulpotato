Walking the dog in the middle of the countryside is very peaceful and regenerative, it grounds you. &quot;Getting away from something&quot; makes it sound like the something is the modus operandi when it never was. It&#x27;s almost like it adds more nuance to a man&#x27;s story, you know, the fast living 21st century tech man who has an epiphany. Perhaps the 80-hour a week tech worker&#x27;s walk into nature means something more than other people&#x27;s... or not really.')
