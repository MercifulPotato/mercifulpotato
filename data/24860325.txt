Usually, they&#x27;re chasing 1% improvements. Often, those people ultimately give up Anki as “too difficult”, which is often a synonym for “I got nervous I wasn&#x27;t using it perfectly”. This is a pity. As discussed earlier, Anki offers something like a 20-fold improvement over (say) ordinary flashcards. And so they&#x27;re giving up a 2,000% improvement because they were worried they were missing a few final 5%, 1% and (in many cases) 0.1% improvements. This kind of rabbit hole seems to be especially attractive to programmers.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;augmentingcognition.com&#x2F;ltm.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;augmentingcognition.com&#x2F;ltm.html</a>')
