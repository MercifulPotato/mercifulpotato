You can essentially use two logs, one for technical purposes (under legitimate interests you should be fine logging as long as those logs are only used for technical&#x2F;debugging&#x2F;abuse prevention purposes and the data is not kept for longer than necessary) and one for marketing&#x2F;analytics purposes. You only log to the second one if consent has been given, and you only ever do your analytics on that second log and not the first one.')
