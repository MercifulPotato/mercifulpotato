An extra game mechanic in a special circumstance that allows you to do something that the basic rules don&#x27;t. Or just a mechanic that stops something un-fun from happening (getting stuck, or it being too easy to trick an enemy).<p>But clean code always follows the rules, and makes it harder to introduce special cases.<p>I&#x27;m not saying software engineering has no place in a game, nor that rust would be bad it it. Just that it&#x27;s less clear how software engineering will help a game, or if the game will be nudged toward a different style by the language somehow.')
