My criticism of a non-literal use of the word still stands - by your usage, anything that isn&#x27;t proven yet is labeled conspiracy theory, which is also automatically crazytalk.<p>Government surveilance, and even COVID-19 (as mentioned elsewhere on the thread) were both by your definition crazyperson conspiracy theories until someone went out and proved it.<p>To me, it&#x27;s unintellectual. New theories are dismissed out of hand, since they lack evidence and are considered tantamount to flat-earth theory; any investigation is therefore unwarrented.<p>Edit: in your example, you&#x27;re confusing &#x27;belief that something could have happened&#x27; with &#x27;belief that something did happen&#x27;.  Is that all you&#x27;re trying to say?')
