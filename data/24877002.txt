A more modern non-cryptographic hash function like FNV or MurmurHash can produce more output bits (up to 1024 and 128 respectively), reducing random collision probability to a comparable level.<p>In addition, CRCs are actually quite good at detecting common errors in data transfer (not just single bit flips but burst errors as well). In fact you can prove that certain kinds of errors will always be detected by an n-bit CRC -- which is something you can&#x27;t prove with modern cryptographic hash functions. Yeah they&#x27;re useless against attackers but that&#x27;s not the threat model if you&#x27;re &quot;not using MD5 for security&quot;.')
