Yes, that pile of rocks isn&#x27;t too big of a deal for young and agile people, but try to imagine the 10th percentile of people walking over that. Older, not as fit. That rock pile would be a struggle.<p>I don&#x27;t disagree that it&#x27;s still far away from a human in good shape, but there are certainly a significant percentage of people who wouldn&#x27;t be able to walk over that, or would slip a few times while doing it.<p>That sort of terrain is also no joke if you have to traverse it for large stretches, even for athletic people. It&#x27;s very similar to mildly rough mountaineering areas and that will wear you down quickly!')
