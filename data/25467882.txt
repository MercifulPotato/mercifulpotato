My job prior to these two was with a software consultancy firm. While I loved the people at that company, I got burnt out from the constant stress of overlapping projects, bending over backwards for clients, and needing to stay billable.<p>For the last 6-7 years, I work at a much more relaxed pace, am respected and appreciated for the work I do, and am able to separate home&#x2F;work life. I don&#x27;t get to work with the latest technologies and there isn&#x27;t as much opportunity to move up the ladder, but ultimately, the joy for me comes from solving problems and making fellow employees&#x27; lives easier in their daily jobs.<p>I think another factor in all of this, is that I live in flyover country and the mindset seems much different here than on the coasts.')
