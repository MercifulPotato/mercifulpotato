Like wearing ankle-length skirts in the 1950s in the US. In Bangladesh, where I’m from, it went from pretty much non-existent to being very common, as the export of middle eastern culture happens throughout the Islamic world. Nobody will send you to jail for not wearing it, but there is a lot of cultural pressure. I don’t like it, because I’d rather see Bangladesh lean into its Anglo heritage than its Islamic one, but that doesn’t justify making it illegal in a developed country. Even among conservatives in the US, the vast majority oppose banning hijab.')
