If someone else has to modify it later, I&#x27;m not particularly worried they&#x27;ll mess it up.<p>The second one -- it took me about 4x longer to understand what it does. It works too, but it doesn&#x27;t match how my brain naturally thinks about it, so it leaves me with the uneasy feeling &quot;what if there&#x27;s a bug?&quot; and I&#x27;d be more worried someone else would introduce a bug if they had to modify it later.<p>I don&#x27;t want &quot;elegance&quot; or &quot;good taste&quot; in code. Unless it has a good reason to be hand-tuned for performance, I want code that is written the way you&#x27;d expect an average programmer to write it. Nothing clever, just a straightforward translation of requirements into code. Not &quot;transforming&quot; them into something more &quot;elegant&quot;.')
