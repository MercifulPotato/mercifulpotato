Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611140919, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25844230, text='&gt; The only way I can read your argument is if I were in the spirit of &quot;the big guy is always wrong&quot;.<p>How about “the guy burning the person they are currently in a business relationship with without getting all the facts is wrong”. Or “a wrong by party A against party B does not justify a wrong by B against C.”<p>&gt; It&#x27;s absolutely incredible how much Google has not spoken out to defend itself against the lies upon lies upon inconsistencies that Timnit has thrown out. And now another case pops up?<p>Er, nothing in Google’s story, even taken as gospel truth, indicates that either Gebru’s fact claims in this case were lies or that her speculations were unreasonable or inconsitent in her position given the observable facts. So, your characterization seems...misplaced, at best, even if your characterization of her past actions was accurate. (And in the cases where Google has presented contrary stories to Gebru on other points, Google’s own stories have been outright self-contradictory whereas Gebru’s were at least internally consistent, so I can either trust Gebru or neither.)')
