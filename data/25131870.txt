Found the research that about 5% of dem leaning and 10% of gop leaning poll respondents basically lie that they are undecided. I took the average of polls from 538 and allocated undecided voters in accordance with numbers above.<p>The result was very well aligned with actual results and prediction markets. Adjusted numbers predicted that FL, NC, GA, AZ would go to Trump and Biden margins in WI, MI, and PA would be much thinner than predicted by 538.<p>Outside of GA and AZ that turned out to be on point and even in GA and AZ Biden margins were razor thin. Personally I think that Biden has to thank Stacey Abrams for Georgia, and I am not sure what happened in AZ, maybe people are more outspoken there than elsewhere.<p>Now, there are also opinions that there is no such thing as shy Trump voter and my calculation could be just dumb luck.')
