It isn&#x27;t anymore.<p>I spend a <i>lot</i> of time staring at photos from tons of different cameras. I pull in unprocessed raw and JPEG photos from DSLR and flagship phone reviews to verify that metadata extraction and raw image data gets decoded properly by PhotoStructure.<p>There is <i>surprisingly</i> little difference in image quality from, say, the OG Google Pixel to the pixel 2 and 3.<p>The difference between well-lit scenes at the same zoom on an iphone 8, X, and 11 is minimal.<p>If you show someone photos from a current flagship versus a 3-4 year old flagship, composition will matter (much) more than the hardware as to which is seen as the better image.')
