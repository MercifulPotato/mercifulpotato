I live with my Mom, who has Parkinson&#x27;s, to help her.<p>I do not judge him remotely and find him incredibly attractive regardless. The only person who is ashamed is him! The logistics are the only issue, but we make enough that I don&#x27;t mind renting out AirBnBs etc...<p>He is being financially responsible, and I am taking care of the woman who sacrificed her life for me to achieve my dreams and is now unwell.<p>Be proud, and screw those women with double standards who fail to look a little deeper. It&#x27;s sexism. A lot of women unfortunately hold this stigma, but there are women like us out there who don&#x27;t. Keep looking.')
