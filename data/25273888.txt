As a kid I built my own PHP forum system and have great memories from early internet forums. Bringing that to workspace is a really interesting idea. One of my fundamental problems with Slack and any new method of communication is, if you already use email daily do you really want another feed that you have to check? So, combining the workspace forum as a Subreddit or a Discord server, services which people perhaps already use, is a perfect solution! We may try this for Emailio&#x27;s employees down the line by making a private subreddit. Thanks for the idea!')
