With some of the other big ticket items, since it is universal, you have a lot of people working on it.<p>MMS seems to be a big issue in the USA and France (and maybe  couple of others? I have just noted those two so far). On top of it, it is a very complex issue. I spend as much time getting it to work as I do to try to fight misconceptions about it to try and motivate folks to want to help.<p>Thankfully now it is more of an integration issue than it is a &quot;does it even function&quot; issue. But the integration issue is not trivial either.')
