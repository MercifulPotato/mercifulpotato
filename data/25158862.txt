Item(by='skissane', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605865200, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25158039, text='VirtualBox is an acquired product. Originally developed by the German company Innotek, who were bought by Sun, and in turn bought by Oracle. It is useful enough to Oracle for them to keep it alive, but I&#x27;m not sure if Oracle would have ever started a project like VirtualBox themselves.<p>The internals of VirtualBox are very x86-specific. It was not written with the idea of supporting non-x86 CPU architectures. I think trying to add ARM support would be a lot of work and redesign. VirtualBox used to support software-based virtualisation, which has something in common with CPU emulation â€“ it is kind of emulating x86 on x86, and even uses some of QEMU&#x27;s code for dynamic recompilation. But, that software-based virtualisation was only ever 32bit, it exploited obscure features of the x86 architecture (execution in ring 1), and in the latest release of VirtualBox has been removed entirely.<p>(I worked for Oracle for almost ten years. Never at the level at which decisions like this were made. But still, I feel like I do have some feel for what kinds of decisions Oracle&#x27;s leadership are likely to make. They could always surprise me, though.)')
