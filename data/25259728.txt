Our partial knowledge obtained from such techniques is what it is, partial. We need new metrology that increase the observability accuracy and completeness OR better deterministic models from sequences.<p>&quot;We can&#x27;t know&#x2F;solve anything beyond our best knowledge, that&#x27;s tautological.&quot; yes it is indeed tautological if you assume that experimental methods can&#x27;t get better then guess what? It follows that they can&#x27;t get better!<p>&quot;what are you basing this on?&quot; on nothing solid, that&#x27;s why I say it <i>would</i> be interesting.\n99% is a non negligible error rate given that proteins have generally a not very high atom count and they the protein will be produced an enormous amount of time, then the 1% error progagate and can a priori easily break the system.\nBut this guess is not solid as I&#x27;m not an expert.\n99% accuracy for simple (low atom count) proteins is a sensitive error and could be negligible for very high atom count proteins.')
