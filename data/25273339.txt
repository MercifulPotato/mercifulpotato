Every time I&#x27;m alone with someone, my brain goes to overdrive and I ask myself questions like &quot;what can we talk about&quot; , &quot;what common interests do we have&quot;, &quot;how can I make him&#x2F;her laugh&quot;, &quot;what about this person that I don&#x27;t know yet that I can ask&quot; just to &#x27;develop&#x27; the relationship.<p>But after a while of doing this, and observing myself doing this, I get burnt out and go &#x27;f it, who cares&#x27;. If I cared about this person, it wouldn&#x27;t feel such a grind to create&#x2F;maintain this relationship.')
