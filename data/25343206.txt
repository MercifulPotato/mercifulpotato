While you obviously can&#x27;t trace everyone, California has 10,000 contact tracing staff [1] and has spent most of the pandemic with less than 5,000 confirmed cases per day [2]. These individuals are working every day to collect data, so I am sure it exists.<p>If you get a positive test, contact tracers may ask you where you went and who you interacted with. They then call those people and ask them to get a covid test. IF the contact tests positive, then rinse and repeat. [3]<p>If I live alone and only leave my house to grocery shop, it is pretty clear where I got covid. Similarly, if Bob had covid, I had dinner with Bob, and now I have covid, it is pretty safe to assume I got at dinner.<p>Anecdotally, I had a friend who tested positive and the contact tracer told them that they had likely contracted while it shopping at a big 5 several days earlier.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coronavirus.jhu.edu&#x2F;contact-tracing&#x2F;state-survey-results" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coronavirus.jhu.edu&#x2F;contact-tracing&#x2F;state-survey-res...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;91-divoc.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;covid-visualization&#x2F;states.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;91-divoc.com&#x2F;pages&#x2F;covid-visualization&#x2F;states.html</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;covid19.ca.gov&#x2F;contact-tracing&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;covid19.ca.gov&#x2F;contact-tracing&#x2F;</a>')
