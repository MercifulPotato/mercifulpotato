That initial resolution was overblown as well.<p>&gt; However, the resolution makes a fundamental misunderstanding: encryption is an absolute. Data is either encrypted or it isn’t; users have privacy, or they don’t.<p>Well, but as always, it isn&#x27;t. Or are they encrypting all customer data with the same key?<p>Are provisions in the US good enough? But then you have the NSA, etc.<p>Privacy is a right on the legal sense. Should anything be unaccesible to law? (in the legal and in the technological sense, but they&#x27;re two separate issues). This is more of an ethical question than a legal&#x2F;technological one.<p>But back to the initial statement: no phone or system is 100% secure.<p>A &quot;backdoor&quot; implies a secret (to both user and provider) extraction of the data. Now, a judicially authorized&#x2F;vetted extraction of data of a specific customer&#x2F;timeframe is a different thing (even better, make it forward&#x2F;backward secret). Sure, it is alarming and certainly ethically debatable. But it is not &quot;a backdoor&quot;')
