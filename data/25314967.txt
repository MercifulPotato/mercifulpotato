There&#x27;s no grey area for debate as the echo-chambers polarise discussion.\nHence the real issue- how to persuade people to see news etc outside their usual fare.

On the web, twitter retweets are a loose example in that people retreat what they find useful, building trust between users over repeated retweets.<p>I don&#x27;t know the answer to this btw but the current institutions don&#x27;t appear to be enough, from potentially influenced elections and referenda, to trying to silence whistleblowers (Assange, Whitehouse leaks etc)<p>Isolating the issue though ie. Being able to verify optionally signed posts goes some way towards building better Web.
