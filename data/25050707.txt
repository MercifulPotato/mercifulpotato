RAM is definitely the biggest weakness of these new Macs.<p>On iOS they can get away with less RAM than the rest of the market by killing apps, relaunching them fast, and having severely restricted background processes. On Mac they won&#x27;t have that luxury. At least they have fast SSDs to help with big pagefiles.<p>With the heterogeneous memory, your 8GB computer doesn&#x27;t even have its whole 8GB of main system memory.<p>When the touchbar MBP launched in 2016 people were already complaining that it couldn&#x27;t spec up to 32GB like the competition. Four years later, and it&#x27;s still capped at 16GB.<p>Hopefully they can grow this for next year&#x27;s models.')
