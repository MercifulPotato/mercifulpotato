Item(by='alkonaut', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608030326, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25428724, text='&gt; As a European citizen, I&#x27;m tired of having to close hundreds of popups a day which purposefully use dark patterns to make it harder to unselect everything and just close and make it easy to accept everything in one click.<p>The popups is the tiny, visible part of the GDPR. The rest of the iceberg that is the GDPR is that those sites already had to think about how they handle your data.<p>I hope the popups thing will be resolved by clarification and some stiff example-making fines. Hopefully those examples make it clear that no kind of &quot;optional&quot; tracking can be included via a prominent &quot;Accept and continue&quot; button and that all such default actions must lead to zero tracking&#x2F;third party ad cookies being used. Once sites realize that almost no one will make an effort and actively <i>enable</i> tracking, these things will disapppear (as will a lot of the sites that can&#x27;t find alternative revenue - this is a good thing)')
