How do they pick up a new instrument in 2-3 months? Or be able to balance on a skateboard after just a little while? Or get kills better than me with only 200 CS GO hours clocked?<p>The answer is always that they spent a lot of focused time earlier in life, or that they spend a lot of time that I wasn&#x27;t aware of -- like I find out that they have 2500 hours in CS:S on another account... yeah that makes a lot more sense.<p>I don&#x27;t believe innate talent exists. Other than that some people are mentally quicker, or have faster reflexes, or are physically more capable -- &quot;general&quot; things. But talent exists only from both hard work and time, which for many things can start at age 2 or 3.')
