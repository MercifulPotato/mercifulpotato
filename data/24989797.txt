The CA legislature passed AB5, which changed who ruleset 2 to applied to in a very arbitrary way. Prop 22 said, &quot;oh, add this subgroup to 1, permanently, regardless of what the legislature does with anything else&quot;. Per my orginal comment, that&#x27;s not an improvement, even you believe as you do.')
