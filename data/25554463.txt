Did this one? I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s normal for an RV. If it was like a lot of vehicles and only had it on the front corner of the dash, it might be hard to find among that many pieces over that large an area. And that&#x27;s not even counting the possibility that the perpetrator deliberately removed it.')
