Like many papers, it has some powerful results, but I think it overclaims on correlation vs causation.<p>What is true is teachers overrate girl&#x27;s performance earlier in school compared to boys, then girls catch up and overtake, often approaching their teacher&#x27;s predictions. This might well be a case of matching expectations. Another, to me reasonable, explanation for the results is that teacher&#x27;s grading includes potential, based on their experience. It&#x27;s hard to know, and would be very hard to ethically test.<p>This area deserves more research, and less sgouty arguments, but there isn&#x27;t a clear cut answer.')
