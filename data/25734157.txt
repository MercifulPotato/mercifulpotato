I think this MAY be because those dealers are mostly all-in on whichever brand they carry. The shop I bought my Specialized Roubaix from in 2014, for example, HAS a very small number of non-Specialized bikes (maybe 4-6 AllCity plus a couple Moots), but the rest of the shop is ALL SPECIALIZED. You know what folks say about egg&#x2F;basket redundancy.<p>The shop I mentioned that was clever and has done well as a result isn&#x27;t a dealer for either. They carry BMC, Cervelo, Santa Cruz, Salsa, and some others, and they&#x27;ve managed to stay busy and stocked all year.')
