Teams as an electron app has made my Linux Laptop (with everyone in lockdown) our prime machine, everybody has an account, all with their own Teams account set up. Soon we will have Office365 in Electron. Then Adobe tools. And then we can do all the things Windows can do (with a grain of salt) and more.<p>Sure, this will receive a lot of hate (Electron eat ram mmkay). In the mean time I&#x27;m having MS Office on Linux. Real and official. What a time to be alive.')
