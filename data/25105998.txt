Twitter is simply horrible.  You can make a completely innocuous comment on a current conversation, and someone will barge in, exhort in a hyperbolic and frenzied manner, and make you regret signing back into Twitter.<p>This isn&#x27;t a quality control problem.  People, and sadly specifically those with advanced education, tend to be easily triggered by random things.  They say, often, terrible things.  They bully.  They argue over minutiae.  They blast those with ever so slightly differing opinions.<p>Imagine what they do to people with significantly different opinions.  They must be destroyed.<p>So those folks leave.  And go somewhere more friendly to the free exchange of views, without the automatic pile on shutdowns, and cancellations we see with FB&#x2F;Twit.<p>Its tiring to me as an infrequent twit-er. Its tiring on FB as I use it for family communications and dad jokes.<p>Apparently, it is in vogue to call these companies out for their complicity ... their participation in the actual undermining of democracy (should be read in a tone dripping in sarcasm).  It is considered bad form to say you use them.  It goes against goodthink.<p>I&#x27;m really tired of this.  Social media has very low value to begin with.  This toxic behavior, this is what should be canceled.  This is what should be deplatformed.<p>Not the viewpoints that have people with different ones running to the exits.')
