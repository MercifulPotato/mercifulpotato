(Electric kettles work just fine on 110&#x2F;120; they just haven&#x27;t been a thing in the US. They&#x27;ve been ubiquitous in Canada, although they&#x27;ve been pushed aside somewhat by drip coffee makers. You just need a lower-resistance heating element than would be practical with 220&#x2F;240.)')
