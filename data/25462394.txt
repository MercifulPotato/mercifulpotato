Item(by='beaner', descendants=None, kids=[25485138], score=None, time=1608251764, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25462349, text='Coinbase actually owns Xapo&#x27;s custody business, they bought it in August 2019 [0].<p>An amount like $5b would likely pay less than 10 bips (0.1%) per year in custody fees, or $5m&#x2F;year. Coinbase Pro&#x27;s volume has recently been doing up to a few million dollars in revenue per day - and that&#x27;s not even counting the higher brokerage fees that apply on top of some of that volume.<p>Custody is certainly an important part of the business. But I think brokerage currently accounts for a much larger % of revenue. Custody will become bigger as the price of crypto grows.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coindesk.com&#x2F;crypto-exchange-coinbase-acquires-xapos-institutional-custody-business" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.coindesk.com&#x2F;crypto-exchange-coinbase-acquires-x...</a>')
