Because it is quite unique thing to see.<p>Just like when I was in South Korea and my wife was asked to pose in a picture of young Korean girl.<p>Similar thing happened 50 years ago, when my mother-in-law asked a black fellow to pose in a picture with her.<p>But that is expected when someone is unique, intriguing.<p>When I was young I lived in the south of Poland where we had a Roma minority. And I as a kid was afraid of them, because they were different from me and most of the time I saw them begging on streets. But same thing happened when I saw non-Romas begging on streets, just because they were dressed in old, torn and smelly cloths.<p>I have personally not met any Jews that I know of, because here you don&#x27;t have any visual clues, it just like meeting an Orthodox Catholic, one would need to introduce him&#x2F;herself like one to be recognized. And that maybe would result in interesting conversation, but thats it.<p>There is another negative issue here with large south city in Poland and Jews - Cracow. There is a district there that was mostly Jewish before the WW II, and now there are a lot of visitors from Israel schools that come there to look at the old buildings and synagogues. And because those are children in a difficult age and look quite unsupervised (besides the bodyguards that act very aggressively towards Poles) and leave quite a mess in hotels where they stay.<p>And there are also Brits :), you can recognize them because most of them walk in T-shirts during winter and are quite loud and like to have stag parties in Cracow, and also leave quite a mess in pubs&#x2F;restaurants&#x2F;hotels.')
