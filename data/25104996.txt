If your backend doesn’t do anything, every change to your database will break your client unless they are updated simultaneously every time (impossible for mobile apps) or your client is aware of every backend change (very complex). Not to mention there is some data you simply don’t want to expose to a client in most situations, like user emails or hashed passwords.')
