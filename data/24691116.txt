Making the browser window smaller often makes the text even smaller, instead of the useless empty spaces. Make some room for my other windows, please! We&#x27;re not in the 90&#x27;s anymore where monitors were only large enough for one window.<p>There&#x27;s this trend of very wide and ultra wide monitors. I sincerely hope people don&#x27;t use their browsers full-screen on 3440x1440 monitors.<p>Unless those empty spaces are supposed to be filled with ads that my ad blocker blocks for me. But that too is another rant.')
