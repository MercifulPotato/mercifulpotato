While Elasticsearch was previously released under the Apache 2.0 license, it was still &quot;owned&quot; by Elastic.<p>Lucene on the other hand, is &quot;owned&quot; by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). While companies can build products based on Lucene, which they release under their own choice of License, they cannot change the Lucene license itself. Only the ASF can do that.<p>Another example of this is Kafka. It was developed at LinkedIn, who transferred control to the ASF. When the LinkedIn employees who originally created Kafka, left to form Confluent, they had no control over the licensing of Kafka. They could only decide on the License for the Kafka add-ons that they provide. Eventually (about a year ago) they forked Kafka to create &quot;Confluent Server&quot;, which is released under their proprietary license. Kafka itself however remains open source under Apache 2.0 license, still controlled by the ASF.')
