US policy people over-focus on monetary policy because it is one of the things governments can control. But it has little effect on what gets emphasized in the economy.<p>Where have you been in 2020? There was a massive government stimulus for equities. Even before that the way QE is set up it primarily benefits holders of stock, which is basically the opposite of what you want when your goal is to increase consumer inflation. Clearly the government is emphasizing wealthy parts of the economy over the average Joe and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s causing the economy to be so lopsided.<p>&gt;The US has shied away from industrial policy. China and all the &quot;Asian tigers&quot; got to where they are through industrial policy, emphasizing specific sectors of the economy. Britain tried that, though, and ended up with &quot;lemon socialism&quot; - the government was operating all the losers - coal, railroads, etc.<p>Adding more supply in an already demand starved economy is just adding even more fuel to the fire.')
