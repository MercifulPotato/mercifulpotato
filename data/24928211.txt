By whom? If you want to speak at this conference, you have to play by their rules or you won&#x27;t get invited. Even if you do get invited, and you&#x27;re not nice, you&#x27;ll get humiliated and driven to tears. If there&#x27;s going to be a rebellion, it&#x27;s by would-be speakers at the conference, but that would be against their own interest: they like to speak at conferences, so they won&#x27;t. So anyone who wants to speak at this conference will be turning a blind eye to this. Would-be attendees also won&#x27;t be making a fuss, conferences with interesting speakers tend to attract large crowds. A handful of would-be rebels won&#x27;t make any difference.')
