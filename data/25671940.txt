I&#x27;ve heard officers refusing to be involved in psychiatric calls due to changes in use of force laws which could hold them personally accountable. Instead of working to find a legal solution, their attitude seems to be one of revenge and their actions a punitive measure on the electorate and government which chose to enact those laws.<p>There is a culture of us vs. them that is being focused towards politicians and reformists. I hope it&#x27;s not a pervasive one.')
