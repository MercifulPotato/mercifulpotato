Our entire company was offline for a day when our central storage server quit accepting writes despite having over 50% free space. That&#x27;s when I learned the hard way about the data&#x2F;metadata split (something I was aware of but wasn&#x27;t exactly top of mind) and BTRFS balance. You can certainly say it was my fault for not reading ALL the documentation before using BTRFS, and I&#x27;d find it hard to disagree, but any other filesystem wouldn&#x27;t have had this problem.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to if there are other foot-guns waiting around or how common problems like this are because we migrated back to FreeBSD and ZFS shortly after that experience. I do know they have since updated BTRFS to make that scenario less likely (but still not impossible).')
