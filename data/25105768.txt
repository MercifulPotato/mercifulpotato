Item(by='eesmith', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605480876, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25104098, text='&gt; as immigrants, we always get ‘where are you from originally’.<p>That question in the US usually means either 1) your accent is noticeably not American, or 2) you or your ancestors didn&#x27;t come to the US from Europe or via the African diaspora.<p>Native Americans get asked that question. Fourth-generation Chinese-Americans get asked that question. Puerto Ricans are asked that question. But a white friend of mine, born in the US to English parents, with no noticeable non-US accent, doesn&#x27;t get asked that question.<p>So &quot;where are you from originally&quot; comes across not about &quot;immigrant&quot; but about being &quot;different&quot; and even with an implication of being a second-class citizen. See for example the opinions given at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edition.cnn.com&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2017&#x2F;08&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;where-im-really-from&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;edition.cnn.com&#x2F;interactive&#x2F;2017&#x2F;08&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;where-im...</a> . Quoting Samantha Geovjian Clarke, born in the US, raised in Portland, Oregon:<p>&gt;  Sometimes I think they feel like it&#x27;s more polite to ask ambiguously &quot;where are you from?&quot; or &quot;what are you?&quot; because they&#x27;re afraid to say race, ethnicity, heritage or nationality – lots of white people don&#x27;t even know the difference. But they end up being hurtful and displaying deep-seated biases about race by implying I&#x27;m not really from America if I&#x27;m brown, even though I was born here, or worse, implying that I&#x27;m not human because I&#x27;m brown (with the &quot;what are you?&quot; question).<p>If the question &quot;where are you from originally&quot; and variants are interpreted by many as a sign of intolerance, and not simply one of curiosity - which it surely is for some! - then perhaps it&#x27;s not a particularly effective counter-example?<p>If you want to dig down deeper to get to the root of this specific issue, here are some resources which talk about it: &quot;Everyday Racism: ‘Where Are You Really From?’&quot; at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theglobepost.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;08" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theglobepost.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;08</a> , &#x2F;10&#x2F;everyday-racism&#x2F; ;  &quot;Is It Racist to Ask People Where They&#x27;re From?&quot; at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;international&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2014&#x2F;07&#x2F;question-where-are-you-from-racist&#x2F;373818&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;international&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2014&#x2F;07&#x2F;qu...</a> ; and an essay more focused on examples of when that question is asked with racist overtones, &quot;“Where Are You From?” Racial Microaggressions&quot; at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;othersociologist.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;07&#x2F;15&#x2F;where-are-you-from-racial-microaggressions&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;othersociologist.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;07&#x2F;15&#x2F;where-are-you-from-r...</a> .')
