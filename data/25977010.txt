However, I could easily spend $200k&#x2F;year and have a great lifestyle, without reducing my wealth, inflation-wise. Some people say I could even spend as high as 4% of my wealth annually [0] - which I personally don&#x27;t agree with.<p>Vice versa, if I had negative $200k wealth (student debt, etc), and an income of, say, $100k&#x2F;year while living in the Bay area, I would probably remain &quot;poor&quot; and be constrained to a thrifty lifestyle for a long, long time.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.schwab.com&#x2F;resource-center&#x2F;insights&#x2F;content&#x2F;beyond-4-rule-how-much-can-you-safely-spend-retirement" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.schwab.com&#x2F;resource-center&#x2F;insights&#x2F;content&#x2F;beyo...</a>')
