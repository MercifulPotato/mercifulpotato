They are optimizing for “engagement”, and for keeping people on the site so they can serve more ads to them.<p>Just because they are highly effective at this does not mean they serve what we really would like to see.<p>This is why I stopped browsing Facebook a long time ago. The only reason I have an account still is for people that talk to me on Messenger, and for occasionally checking on upcoming events. Now in the Corona pandemic I haven’t even had a reason to check on upcoming events so I haven’t almost gone onto Facebook at all.<p>Instagram, which is also owned by Facebook, is doing a better job however, at providing me with content that I am interested in. So even though I dislike Facebook as a company I am actively using Instagram almost daily still.')
