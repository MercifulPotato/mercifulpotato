Your argument is as simple as saying &quot;don&#x27;t have information, voila, no information to steal. Simple!&quot;<p>In real life, blocking has costs, blocks have leaks and openings.<p>An excellent example is you write &quot;block sound&#x2F;vibration&quot; as if that&#x27;s a simple on&#x2F;off process.<p>In real life, there are degrees of vibration, degrees of cost, hindrances and benefits to each possible continuum of solutions, etc.<p>A really funny example of this is your claim &quot;Faraday cage, bye bye RF. Etc.&quot; when this group you mock has papers showing how to escape a Faraday cage. And no Faraday cage is perfect. And it&#x27;s insanely impractical to put all data in the world in Faraday cages.<p>And note this: <i>all</i> Faraday cages leak. It&#x27;s simple physics. Thus it&#x27;s good to know design parameters for the various modes of possible signals to design the best Faraday cage for a given situation.<p>If they ever get to using gravitational signals, good luck with shielding :)<p>&gt;Indeed, if advanced modulation and processing were used, that would be useful research<p>Then you&#x27;d simply say well &quot;that&#x27;s simply modulation! Where is the real research?&quot;<p>I think you are vastly oversimplifying the real world and how threats are dealt with in practice.<p>The DoD doesn&#x27;t simply spend billions on security research such when they could have simply wrapped themselved in foil and padding to solve security leaking.<p>&gt;They do not contribute to the state of the art in any way.<p>I think we have different ideas of what state of the art contribution means. This team has thousands of citations from researchers that I think disagree with you. Someone is citing their work.')
