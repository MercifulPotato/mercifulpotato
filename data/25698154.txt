Item(by='6510', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610175543, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25683402, text='Anything goes on wikipedia as long as it are established long term so called contributors doing it - there are no rules.<p>It gets spectacularly hilarious where the best way to become a long term contributor is by deleting a lot of contributions. The more people you run off the wiki the more praise from others doing the same.<p>You have to ask the right questions like: &quot;Why are you not writing articles?&quot; The logs are all there. I&#x27;m not making stuff up. Its a honest question to ask if someone is deleting well researched properly sourced contributions day and night the year round.<p>It gets quite hilariously silly where it is argued that peoples identity can not be verified. It is amazingly easy for someone [old] with a life time worth of experience in a field to write down some completely obvious things - but not as easy as pressing a delete button in anonymity. You should ask about this and enjoy the absurd answers.')
