It is very likely beyond our current engineering capabilities.  But in principle it is a technology that we could try to develop.<p>For example at low temperature you assemble a wire that has a high thermal coefficient of expansion down the center of the wire.  Then the superconductor around that in a ring.  Then a carbon nanotube sheathe around that which traps things.  Then when it warms up the core squeezes the superconductor against the sheathe and you get the pressure.')
