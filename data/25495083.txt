You think you already know. You think you&#x27;ve read all the literature. You actually think you&#x27;re well-informed.<p>What you want is for people to shut the fuck up and agree with, because you don&#x27;t want your worldview challenged.<p>&gt; Claiming that all woman are or are not X (for any X) shows that your view of woman is simple enough to almost be a caricature.<p>You talk about being a caricature, then immediately go for a statement like this, which is a combination of the worst kind of pedantry and high-functional mental disability...<p>Here&#x27;s one for you. Fact: Men are stronger than women. When a biologist says this, they don&#x27;t mean <i>every</i> man is stronger than <i>every</i> woman. They mean almost all men are stronger than almost all women.<p>This is one, of <i>many</i> papers in the field: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.sagepub.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1177&#x2F;0265407513487638" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.sagepub.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1177&#x2F;0265407513487638</a>')
