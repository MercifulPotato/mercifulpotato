One thing I would love is an API that enables download of key stats like watts, times, etc.<p>I value raw data over slick apps. I have my own data sources for heart rate, glucose and a few other things. It would be great to integrate this into my home brew system.<p>Dexcom has a decent API for instance \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.dexcom.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.dexcom.com</a><p>Or start a line of exercise&#x2F;health equipment that features integrations with fitness watches, indoor air quality monitors(VOC&#x27;s), blood pressure, glucose, blood oxygen, weather(smog, pollen) etc etc.<p>It should help answer questions like Does my blood pressure&#x2F;glucose behave different when: \n* row for 10 minutes and generate _x_ watts\n* pollen is high, smog is dense\n* use a standing desk vs sitting<p>So far it seems that busting out 10 minutes on a rower seems to have positive effects for at least 24hrs unlike moderate running. I would love to get the actual data on a chart.')
