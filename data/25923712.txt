It&#x27;s painful and embarrassing.<p>I&#x27;d use GitHub if my team were willing to do non-technical project management with it as well. I wish GitHub would add features for non-technical users on projects. It would be a huge win.<p>Literally just spend some time on some docs features and provide a view of projects that isn&#x27;t centered on code for those users that aren&#x27;t involved in the code.<p>For a reasonably technical user, you can make it work, except that the views just aren&#x27;t built for them, so it&#x27;s a lot of visual clutter that isn&#x27;t necessary and holds the product back.<p>Been looking at Clickup since, like Jira+Confluence, you can integrate wiki&#x2F;web documents with your project management tooling. I&#x27;ve found that this is a pretty critical feature. I&#x27;ve tried repeatedly to get folks to rally around Google Drive or a folder of Office documents, and it&#x27;s just not the same as working in a single, integrated web experience.')
