While there was definitely unacceptable activity that slipped through Facebook&#x27;s moderation, they were making attempts to stop it.<p>IIRC, a lot of the organization activity on Facebook acted as a funnel to places like Parler.  E.g. a protest event on Facebook, calculated to comply with its policies, which linked to Parler or Gab where more illicit planning could take place.')
