The intent is not that you are nominating a faceless member of a party to the office, but an individual that you hold personally accountable for their political actions.<p>Removing districts means that you are moving to statewide elections, and then it becomes a statewide office rather than a local office, which is not the intent.<p>The better solution is to make the scarce resource less so; limit districts to 60k people (i.e. pre-Reapportionment Act levels) and expand the house of representatives correspondingly.  Then this problem mostly becomes moot.<p>The other problem, of having ~5000 people in the house of representatives, presents additional challenges, naturally, but the house has the power to set its rules so it can put more work on committees (which can have additional specialization levels) and less work on floors.')
