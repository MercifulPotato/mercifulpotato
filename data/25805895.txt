You could have a library that has a function call for each matrix instruction, but that&#x27;s not worth the penalty of a function call. If your game, graphics software, physics simulation, render farm, video encoder etc can get a boost from these commands, it should be permitted, not just the software that Apple makes. Not sure why people are hostile to this.')
