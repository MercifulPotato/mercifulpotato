So when someone says &quot;I don&#x27;t regret working hard&quot; in the context of a village, where hard work is essencial, It could mean something else completely to someone who grew up with absent parents, who devoted their lives to work and didn&#x27;t pay attention their children. And theses discrepancies permeates the entirety of the discourse.<p>To rescue the value of elderly advice I suggest more context is needed, at least more than a 4 minutes video could possibly convey.')
