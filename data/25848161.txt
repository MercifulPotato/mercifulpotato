If you&#x27;re serious, please tell me what product you&#x27;ve butchered so I can avoid it like the plague.<p>Clear error messages only confuse people who shouldn&#x27;t be using the product in the first place. More importantly: a clear error message at the cost of a few confused users is far more important than an unclear error message that costs even more users hours or days of trouble.<p>I would far rather have a message that tells me that the software broke because the desktop manager found a crash loop and point me to the crash loop logs even if some other poor unfortunate soul has no idea what a crash log is or can&#x27;t figure out how to access or understand the crash log.')
