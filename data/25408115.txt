As I dig in I see a lot of vendors covering almost every aspect&#x2F;attack vector. But the losses from cyber attacks keep mounting. Where is the disconnect? Do business&#x2F;individuals care about security at all ? or is it that the vendors offerings falling short. Could the knowledgeable friends offer some insights.<p>Thanks in advance.\nShyam')
