Given that this is an entirely new vaccine technology that has never been used before, there was probably quite a bit of confidential manufacturing content supplied as supplemental material to satisfy regulators.<p>You are correct that the regulators are generally concerned with safety and efficacy of the final product, not the sausage making. But if the sausage making is super complex and&#x2F;or novel that could potentially have an impact on safety and efficacy. So the company may have been asked to give some amount of detail there. For example: given this vaccine requires cold temperatures or it breaks down, how are they guaranteeing the cold chain in the manufacturing process? (I&#x27;m just using this as an illustration of the flavor of question someone on the committee might have)<p>Given how new this vaccine tech is, there are probably quite a few manufacturing-related efficiencies and techniques that Pfizer does not want competitors getting access to. Not because they&#x27;re going to copy this specific vaccine, but because it allows them accelerate efforts in this area for other vaccines.')
