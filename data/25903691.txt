We&#x27;re in our third lockdown and they keep extending it (it was supposed to be two weeks...I can&#x27;t keep track of how many times its been extended).<p>I was sitting in the park in a riverbank the other day, cops patrolled and asked people where they lived. Whoever you&#x27;re with must live in the same household as you, and you may not be more than a km from home. I didn&#x27;t see anyone get fined (although I believe they have the discretion to do so) but I saw some groups of friends be dispersed by the police.')
