I then came across Dumpling, a sort-of Instacart competitor where you connect with an individual who does the shopping&#x2F;delivery for you, but they aren&#x27;t limited to &quot;officially supported&quot; stores.  I have no problem with this, and neither should Trader Joe&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s simply an individual buying food from them and dropping it off somewhere.<p>Overriding the restaurant&#x27;s contact info is sketchy.  The food may not travel well, but some restaurants refuse to do takeout (either entirely or for certain dishes).  But the basic act of paying a service to pick up something on your behalf isn&#x27;t problematic to me.  The restaurant shouldn&#x27;t care if I pick up my order, or my wife picks up my order, or GrubHub picks up my order.')
