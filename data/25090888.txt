Most start with good relational intentions over a small domain, but eventually get bogged down arguing how semantic angels might dance on ontological pins. The parts that work become ossified and impossible to change. The system starts to fragment into multiple federated datastores or unstructured file dumps (“big data!”) where you have to build your own integration every time you want to use the data. Someone comes along and proposes a unifying model (“everything is an event!”) and rebuilds the whole thing but with an extra layer of complexity. Someone suggests buying an industry data model instead - surely the data experts will have solved all these problems for us? A skunkworks project spins up and starts implementing the bought model with good relational intentions over a small domain...<p>I don’t think personal data warehouses are immune to any of these forces.')
