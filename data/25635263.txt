I started in Notion, making several relational databases. However, after experiencing some down time, I decided to switch to Obsidian (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obsidian.md&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obsidian.md&#x2F;</a>) it&#x27;s a much, much better program, does not have slowdown issues on my mac, is fully cross platform (Mac, Windows, Linux) and has a sync system that works pretty seamlessly. Not to mention that the files are all plain markdown and stored locally.')
