I just ignore them now and wait for their inevitable death (node.js I&#x27;m looking at you)<p>Edit: was just thinking the defining characteristic of these sorts of technologies is they are advocated as replacements for things that already exist, and the people advocating them are not experts in the things they are trying to replace. So they don&#x27;t understand the reasons behind why things are done - NoSQL was obvious for any database person - no transactions, no normalisation. Node.js - tries to replace server coding with something vastly inferior, and it sort of works until you need a proper server.<p>Edit2: lol, time will tell')
