They can take it as soon as the insider doctors flag that it&#x27;s ok, likely many weeks before any public announcement, and certainly before any governmental validation.<p>The value of said vaccines are considerable, there&#x27;s massive money involved, I wonder if the R&amp;D institutions themselves may have been able to find a loophole to allow for it.<p>With the sheer number of doctors and patients involved in the trial, and vials worth possibly $100-500K on the black market ... it&#x27;s bound to get out.<p>And frankly, who cares? A couple thousand early vaccines is basically meaningless from a public health standpoint. It might even be moral to have publicly auctioned off the first mini batch and put the money into production. It&#x27;s rational because the &#x27;willingness to pay&#x27; of some billionaires for the almost arbitrary early access to a vaccine which will soon be cheap and plentiful ... works well as a &#x27;win win&#x27; both for the buyer, and society.')
