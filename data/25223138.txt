If you notice that Rust chain starts at g++ - can g++ be built from the basic assembler you listed?<p>Not yet, but gcc can be built starting from Mes and a few bootstrap binaries (xz, bash, tar, etc): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bootstrappable.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;mes.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;bootstrappable.org&#x2F;projects&#x2F;mes.html</a> - and that initial version of gcc is 2.95.3, which does have C++ support.<p>...and there&#x27;s work being done towards building Mes with M2-Planet (another C compiler by the same author as stage0): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;software&#x2F;mes&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;software&#x2F;mes&#x2F;</a><p>(Although I think the Guix project has shifted to an approach that starts with Scheme instead these days; they have a Scheme implementation of most of those bootstrap binaries now in the form of Gash and Gash Core Utils: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guix.gnu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;guix-further-reduces-bootstrap-seed-to-25&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;guix.gnu.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;guix-further-reduces-boots...</a>.)<p>In any case, if you can connect the two, and it feels like that&#x27;s very close at this point, you&#x27;ve got a bootstrap path from that basic assembler to gcc, and from there to... well, the rest of the distro.<p>&gt;Beyond that, as you can tell from your graph there’s an enormous amount of code that’s part of a build from a large amount of projects. Explode that by a factor of 100000x to get the number of lines of code. So even once you’ve proven the source matches the binary, you are still trusting that the source code is of a trustworthy nature in the first place. You can move the trust required around and in some cases reduce it, but ultimately you’re trusting a lot of people and code (heck you’re trusting the good will of general OSS to validate the source itself isn’t malicious).<p>Of course, yes, this is a problem. At least once you&#x27;re able to bootstrap entirely from source you can be pretty confident that the source code you&#x27;re looking at is what&#x27;s in the binaries on disk. But yes, that doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of having a ton of code to review if you need to review it.<p>But what&#x27;s the alternative?')
