The diagram in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Level-set_method" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Level-set_method</a> might help explain how such a representation can &quot;uniformly&quot; handle topology changes.<p>I&#x27;ll excerpt:<p>&gt; The advantage of the level-set model is that one can perform numerical computations involving curves and surfaces on a fixed Cartesian grid without having to parameterize these objects (this is called the Eulerian approach).[1] Also, the level-set method makes it very easy to follow shapes that change topology, for example, when a shape splits in two, develops holes, or the reverse of these operations. All these make the level-set method a great tool for modeling time-varying objects, like inflation of an airbag, or a drop of oil floating in water.<p>It is unclear to me what you mean by &quot;implementation detail&quot;. In order for a SDF to be used in vector graphics, it must be represented symbolically (the alternative is to rasterize them, as what is implied by &quot;level-set method&quot;, which means you must commit to a spatial resolution).\nBut I suspect you then have the same problem on your lap: how to take derivatives with respect to structural changes in your symbolic SDF?<p>This question reminds me a bit of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19871207" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=19871207</a> discussing &quot;Why are 2D vector graphics so much harder than 3D?&quot;')
