The protocol supports TLS, Kerberos, GSSAPI. It is just that quite a few clients (including major web browsers) and servers don&#x27;t implement those extensions, or even when they are implemented people don&#x27;t know about them and don&#x27;t use them. A lot of people are under the false impression that the only way to secure FTP is to move to SFTP.')
