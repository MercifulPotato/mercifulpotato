I consider it obscure, but all I can say from looking it up is that at least according to Google Ngram, it&#x27;s about 1&#x2F;10 as common as &quot;patriotism&quot;, which is saying something as that&#x27;s been a declining word for a century. It&#x27;s less common than &quot;chauvinism&quot;, &quot;sectarianism&quot; and &quot;xenophobia&quot;. In fact, tripling the popularity of &quot;jingoism&quot; still wouldn&#x27;t make it as popular as any of those. It also peaked in the early 1900s and has since been on a low plateu, which again, <i>I consider</i> a marker of obscurity.')
