The &#x27;public health&#x27; issue is secondary, there are just enough people who&#x27;d consider that to be &#x27;anti Constitutional&#x27; that it&#x27;d be a serious problem.<p>Politicians everywhere are testing the limits of what they can get away with, this is not a joke.<p>There are protests all over the Western world not being covered by the press because everyone is afraid the populism could get out of hand.<p>Case and point: Christmas.
