Good if you are camping without shore power as they don&#x27;t use much propane&#x2F;electricity to function. They do require that you be pretty level to work well. Many newer RV&#x27;s are coming with traditional 12v compressor refrigerators\nwhich are very efficient too. If you have a decent battery on board with solar, they can run for quite a while.')
