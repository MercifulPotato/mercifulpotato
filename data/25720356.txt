The best part is, thanks to the courses exceptional guidance and streamlining, it only takes about half a day or so to get it to that point.<p>After that you can follow the rest of the course to making a compiler, etc. Or you could move to an NES emulator as you mentioned. The nand2tetris halfway mark would also be a good jumping point for the principles, compiler, and RISC equipment mentioned in the OP&#x27;s course.')
