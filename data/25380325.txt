I create apps and software for niche markets. 100% a one person gig.<p>All of my products have started as something I wanted for myself, but also realizing that others would likely pay for them too. My first iOS app is now 9 years old but it existed on the Pocket PC and the Palm Pilot years before that.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;TinyOctopus.net" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;TinyOctopus.net</a><p>edit: forgot to add, I do make the majority of my income from these apps. It is possible for small players to make real money on apps - 5 figures for me. A key for me has been to not undercharge. Despite my apps being priced much higher than others, I rarely get complaints about pricing.')
