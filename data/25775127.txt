In India, the highly successful people tend to simply be children of the industry&#x27;s market leader. Because nepotism is so blatant, you can easily pinpoint people like Arjun Kapoor and Rahul Gandhi who so clearly betray your claim.<p>I believe the same is true of the American Mega-rich. They have simply gotten a lot better at hiding it. Use donations and legacy backdoors to get degrees. Be promoted to the &#x27;board of directors&#x27; and claim credit for any growth the company sees, even if you&#x27;re not involved in an active capacity. Be a varsity player in obscure sport with no competition, benchwarmer or not. Promote &#x27;initiatives&#x27; that help &lt;insert group that needs help&gt;.<p>They know how to build resumes. In India, there is no pretense. These folks know how to socialize with the mega-rich and curry favor with them. But spend that long with anyone and even a dog would learn how to get treats.<p>Then there are memes. Those who kept their bitcoins in 2012 despite not knowing what they were and those who decided to invest big in drug development right before 2020.

Memes by definition, did not get successful due to their intellect.')
