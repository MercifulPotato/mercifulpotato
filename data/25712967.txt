As a portal, siasky will have the ability to ratelimit and block abusers.<p>If you &quot;abuse&quot; the network using your own node, you will have to pay for everything you upload and download, which means the people storing it won&#x27;t really think of it as abuse, you&#x27;re just another paying customer.')
