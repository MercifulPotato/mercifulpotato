Pop it out, pop it in, on your way.  The charging station would need to verify the condition of each module, but charging time would be less critical.  How to augment gas stations for this?  Build a portal ramp system that drivers pull up onto, robot arm swaps modules, manual method fallback in case of robot failure.  I bet Elon could even make a station that does not require a robot, just design the battery so that as you drive over, one module is swapped at a time.  The swapping station itself could be modular, much like Elon&#x27;s tesla factories.  Disadvantage, gas station needs to rent or buy this portable station.  Advantages, anyone can rent or buy one.  You could have a <i>gas station</i> anywhere there is electricity.  Not technically being a gas station might change zoning requirements.  Also as battery tech evolves, you car automatically benefits.  Thoughts?')
