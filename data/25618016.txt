I ended up getting a Gigabyte Z490 Vision D motherboard specifically because it was the only one of the new Z490s that had an onboard Thunderbolt 3 controller AND a DP1.2 input (which negated the need for the titan ridge controller).<p>So I just run a short DP1.2 cable from the Nvidia card output to the DP1.2 input on the motherboard, then plug my LG monitor into the Thunderbolt 3 output on the motherboard, and it all works like magic.<p>I&#x27;m assuming it would work exactly the same way on the Pro Display XDR.  The only caveat is that I <i>think</i> this setup is limited to 4K.  I didn&#x27;t dig too deeply since there&#x27;s not enough of a difference between 4K and 5K IMHO to make the effort worthwhile.  6K might be worth figuring it out though :)')
