All the profits from the cows is reinvested into more land until you have enough to get 100 acres of crop land. Then it is farm nights and weekends while working your day job.  If all goes well (it doesn&#x27;t always go well) about the time you are 45 you have enough land that you can retire from the town job to work the farm.<p>Note that even though the farm is worth millions, what you can income in the above plan is never more than $50,000&#x2F;year.')
