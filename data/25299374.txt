However, with all the low-code and other tools which make it easier to write software and deploy it (crappy software, but &quot;it works&quot;) soon we&#x27;ll see &quot;software engineers&quot; turn into &quot;software assemblers&quot; or something like that. Sure, there will be a handful of programmers who will need to code those tools, or specialize in algorithms or writing code on constrained environments (embedded), but those will be the surgeons who make all the money, and the rest of us are the closers (whatever they call the surgeons who just sew things shut and finish up the procedure).')
