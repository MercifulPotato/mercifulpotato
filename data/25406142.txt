At the moment it&#x27;s a bit tricky as some books we might classify as for children are more broadly enjoyed (e.g. The Little Prince). One way, I suppose, would be to use a dozen very explicitly children&#x27;s books as &quot;anchors&quot; and assume other books that intersect a lot with those anchors must therefore be children&#x27;s books as well. Then I can create a filter. Shall investigate :)')
