They killed it, and it wasn&#x27;t great (NiCad batteries, weird design, etc.) but it predates anybody else&#x27;s serious efforts, apart from some stuff in the 70s oil crisis that was built around lead acid batteries.<p>But basically GM started producing EVs as soon as lithium ion battery manufacturing chains made it possible. Thank Bob Lutz.<p>But I never said GM wasn&#x27;t .. basically evil :-) Of course they&#x27;re riding&#x2F;pushing the ICE &amp; petroleum wave, and pushing hard on it, that&#x27;s what makes them money. Because for the last 100 years that&#x27;s all that was practical, and it&#x27;s what made them as a company. Boxes that burn dinosaur juice to move. But there was no battery tech until LiOn that could make EV feasible as any kind of alternative.<p>However GM&#x27;s evil is subsidiary to the petroleum company&#x27;s evil. Whatever bad GM has done, oil companies have done x 100.')
