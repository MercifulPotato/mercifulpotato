Around 35,000 die of flu per year in the U.S. And by estimate it&#x27;ll be 400K COVID-19 deaths by February. That&#x27;s 10x in terms of deaths alone. That doesn&#x27;t account for the economic impact.<p>The sheer willful ignorance required to propose that the economic impact is due to policy rather than self-interested reaction to the virus is magnificent. As if restaurants and bars are at partial capacity or closed only because of laws? It&#x27;s ridiculous.<p>Laws or not, any business model that depended on close social gatherings, were doomed the moment the virus appeared. And the reality is that quite a lot of business models depend in part on people being closer than 6 feet apart, and they were going to feel an economic impact, no matter what. If that weren&#x27;t true, we wouldn&#x27;t see the commensurate drop in the common cold and flu.<p>It&#x27;s like some people just want to be simplistic and shift the blame, just because they don&#x27;t want to accept the unfairness of this virus. And also don&#x27;t want to confront its disproportionate unfairness either, because that would mean having to at least consider making it more equitable in a distinctly ME ME ME! culture.')
