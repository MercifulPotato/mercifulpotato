Some part of CD Projekt Red knew the game was broken on older consoles.<p>It feels like the only real solution to this is to have legal QA documents, signed off on by QA (as factual) and executive leadership (as read and understood).<p>If there&#x27;s a magically missing set of older console tests, someone in leadership goes to jail. If leadership publicly misrepresents the stability of the game despite knowing about substantial defects from QA reports, someone goes to jail.<p>Who cares about video games, but this is indicative of a broader social problem allowing executives to feign ignorance and create systems that deflect blame downward. Either you&#x27;re running the company or not. And if you are... then the legal ramifications should ultimately land at your feet.')
