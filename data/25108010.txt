However a lot of it is driven by long-time ecosystem contributors and they generally work somewhat behind the scenes, presenting on the progress ~annually at conferences like ICFP. Here&#x27;s the latest progress report, in case you&#x27;re interested: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=E8T_4zqWmq8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=E8T_4zqWmq8</a><p>Now this is not the same language&#x2F;community improvement system that many popular projects nowadays use, but OCaml has been stewarded in its way for a few years now, and it&#x27;s something the contributors feel is sustainable given the size of the project and the resources available.<p>About Unicode specifically, there is of course support at the library level as you mentioned (the most well-known library is Camomile), but to try to justify not including it in the language distribution itself, to a certain extent many applications just don&#x27;t need it. Those that do can of course use libraries, but many (say, backend servers) don&#x27;t really need to process Unicode strings, they just need to shovel bytes from point A to point B and not actually touch the contents.')
