That&#x27;s probably not much less than a full school day of actually sitting down and learning.<p>I have taught my oldest son programming via Scratch, Python, a Raspberry Pi robot and bits of Khan Academy and Code.org. He started about 7 I think, but I&#x27;ve always been <i>really</i> careful to ensure that the interest in it is coming from him and not from me. He asks me to teach him and I do.<p>I think with all things like this, you have to ask what the opportunity cost is. What is he <i>not</i> learning because he&#x27;s spending the time doing this?')
