I remember when I was hired after getting a manhole question; the genx managers (i was probably 19) used it as an inside joke, &quot;gotcha&quot; just to see how candidates responded. I always thought it was gross.<p>So I don&#x27;t ask those questions to people that I interview, because I remember how stupid they made me feel and how unrelated to the job they are.<p>It&#x27;s the genx&#x27;ers that were asking me that, probably asked by boomers. I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;d continue to repeat those biased systems.<p>Genx isn&#x27;t exactly well known for standing up for itself as opposed to continuing to normalize trash systems, that&#x27;s the entire problem.<p>Be better than those before you, that&#x27;s it. Make things better for those coming up or going out. There&#x27;s no reason work should suck.')
