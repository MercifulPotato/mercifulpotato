Primarily it&#x27;s to serve up an image scaled to the right (single) size and occasionally I&#x27;ll tweak the URL to add an effect, a tint, or something. This convenience is worth the money so far considering $200&#x2F;mo is a rounding error in our monthly expenses but I could probably write a script to achieve similar ends in a few hours and upload to S3 instead..')
