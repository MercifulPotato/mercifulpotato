Item(by='synnejye', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604431461, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24979698, text='&gt; Inflation literally is money printing. Price increases is not inflation. Price increases can be caused by inflation. Prices can remain nominally the same while money supply has increased.<p>Well, in today&#x27;s world it is. Yes, not according to your &#x27;old-school&#x27; definition of it. But if anyone says &quot;inflation&quot; today - it means price increases. Nothing more, nothing less.<p>&gt; The prices while having not risen nominally are still artificially inflated.\nCare to explain?<p>&gt;  It is just the economy. If you are referring to a recession, printing money during a recession arguably may not cause prices to rise nominally, but it artificially inflates them.<p>Yes, I meant a recession. Please, once again, elaborate what you mean by &quot;artificially inflated prices&quot;?<p>&gt; During a recession prices typically go down due to falling demand. This is a good thing. It allows people who are suffering to enjoy lower prices.<p>Ehh, ok. So what happens to those people when companies start making less money?<p>&gt; Recessions are a healing process for a previous period of misallocation of resources.<p>Care to explain how resources are &quot;misallocated&quot;?<p>&gt; Money printing only serves to exacerbate and extend the misallocation.<p>Lol, no it doesn&#x27;t. Sounds like a neoclassical fairytale.\nIn a recession, you are arguing that one shouldn&#x27;t print money, because it only &quot;extends misallocation&quot;.\nPlease explain me a proper allocation and a misallocation.\nMakes no sense. Newly printed money would add demand - as it should. It would create jobs and have nothing to do with &quot;misallocation&quot;, That &quot;misallocation&quot; sounds like a conservative argument. No one can explain or prove it, or even make sense of it, but if you keep repeating it, then people will believe it.<p>&gt; We left the gold standard because we were afraid to deal with the recession from the spending of &#x27;60s \nNo, America left it because it was a shit system. Capitalism is inherently monetary. Having a currency pegged hinders growth and only serves to avoid inflation for the rich. Rentier capitalism doesn&#x27;t like inflation.')
