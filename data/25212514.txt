The field requires rather incredible breadth just for an entry level position.  It&#x27;s a very demanding program.<p>These are people dealing with the possibility of life and death mistakes constantly without immediate supervision so a licensure is totally appropriate.<p>I&#x27;m frankly bewildered at your question.  It suggests extreme unfamiliarity with the required nursing skill-set.<p>I was a paramedic, which took me 3 full-time semesters and also required a licensure to practice.  And while we had to do a few things outside of the nursing scope, we probably only really covered maybe 1&#x2F;3 of the skills and knowledge that nurses need to cover in 4 semesters.')
