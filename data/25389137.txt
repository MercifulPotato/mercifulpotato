Windows also constantly wakes up whenever it don&#x27;t want it to. A lot more often than 20%.<p>It&#x27;s incredibly annoying. Sometimes I put a PC to sleep, and it will wake up a minute later. Sometimes it wakes up in the middle of the night to spin up its fans. Laptops I put to sleep without being hooked up to power will have their battery drained next time I want to use them. I can&#x27;t imagine any OS being worse at sleeping than Windows.')
