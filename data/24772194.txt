For everything else? Multiplexing streams, multihoming, reliable datagrams, out of order delivery, in order delivery of datagrams, resistance to SYN floods, etc. It&#x27;s basically a swiss-army knife transport protocol. By far the biggest drawback of SCTP is lack of widespread support. Linux and the BSDs have it implemented in the kernel but Windows and macOS only have third party implementations. It can be implemented in userspace, but now you have to tunnel all of it over UDP instead of just native SCTP and now you need to worry about separate userspace implementations conflicting by trying to use the same UDP port if you want to host it as a server.')
