Even known true statements can&#x27;t be proved all the way down --- at some point they have to rest on axioms that are assumed (or taken on faith).<p>We could take it a step further and discuss what establishes objective moral values and duties, but that plants us firmly in a discussion centering around worldviews and their truth&#x2F;falsehood.<p>All to say, I believe there is an objectively true worldview upon which objective moral values and duties rest, upon which an objective jurisprudence can rest, upon which good (though inescapably subjective) judicial opinions can be issued. Maybe I&#x27;m being overly pedantic, but I&#x27;m frustrated with what seems an intentional departure from objectivity (and an originalist jurisprudence to boot) as the goal in certain circles.')
