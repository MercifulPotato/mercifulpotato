But, once you hit that wall of wanting to select subsets of data because the total dataset got larger than your CPU cache (or some other step-wise NUMA constraint)... It&#x27;s time for a little bit more structure. I would have just gone with SQLite to start. If I am not serializing a singleton out to disk, I reach for SQLite by default.')
