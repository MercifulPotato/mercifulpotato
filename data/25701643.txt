For example:<p>&gt; When a US Army reservist found herself at the center of a conspiracy about the coronavirus earlier this year, her life was upended.<p>&gt; Hoax peddlers on the internet falsely claimed that Maatje Benassi was somehow the world&#x27;s COVID-19 patient zero. Over time, conspiracy theorists posted at least 70 videos across multiple YouTube channels claiming that Benassi had brought the virus into the world. Along with those videos came death threats, which Benassi and her husband, Matt, took seriously.<p>&gt; But at first, the couple did not know how to respond. Trolls hiding behind aliases on the internet were almost impossible to find, and the Benassis could not sue YouTube for allowing the content to be posted because of a now-controversial law known as Section 230.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;section-230-60-minutes-2021-01-03&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cbsnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;section-230-60-minutes-2021-01-...</a>')
