Moving our company from France to here is a nightmare. (Although most of the troubles, but not all, are related to France)\n  - There is political risk if things become unstable whenever we want to move elsewhere\n  - Not much of a crypto&#x2F;ML scene\n  - Personally, I don&#x27;t feel very good here, regular headaches. Don&#x27;t know that is the cause (this we couldn&#x27;t have known before)\n  - A bit polluted (not horrible, but not amazing either)\n</code></pre>\nWe also got bad luck with Covid, restrictions (most businesses closed &amp; curfew) started 4 days after we moved here. But we could have anticipated this, seeing that Hungary has high covid rates.')
