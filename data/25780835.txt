Item(by='dwoot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610651714, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25779112, text='&gt; Designing new syntax\nAs in a DSL?<p>&gt; It felt like each library had its own idioms and syntax rules\nThis sounds like the way software should be. No? Domain-driven design? Or are you saying that they don&#x27;t follow industry nomenclature?<p>&gt; It was hard to have consistent architectural patterns across a team\nIs this a symptom of everyone being new the language on the team or the language itself? Elixir is a very simple language compared to Python and Ruby in my experience. There are certainly way more people that have done the latter two. What&#x27;s comfortable isn&#x27;t always better.<p>I&#x27;m wondering how aware of the trade-offs you are in using an imperative language as compared to one that&#x27;s functional. If the nitpick&#x2F;gripe you&#x27;re having is around readability and syntax, I&#x27;m sure there are enough counters in other languages that you&#x27;ve worked with where the code was just spaghetti and hardly testable<p>Have you considered that productivity comes more with time? I get the sense that you&#x27;ve worked in a team with very few experienced developers that have either worked with Elixir&#x2F;Erlang or functional languages. My experience has been that those with extensive experience in OO or imperative languages w&#x2F;o ever treading into FP have had a much harder time adopting Elixir and it has resulted in slower development early on, but those willing to learn, march much faster after ramp-up.<p>But if you value correctness, less bugs, and easily testable code, it&#x27;s hard to beat functional languages in this area, and I&#x27;m not even talking about just Elixir<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve seen an elixir&#x2F;phoenix backend rewritten completely in python&#x2F;django and it was a big improvement in developer productivity.\nIs this really a better idea? If you&#x27;re mentioning &quot;consistency enforcement&quot;, why not use Golang? Elixir also has a formatter built into its toolchain.<p>Take my responses with a grain of salt -- because if you&#x27;re just doing a CRUD app and not buying into what the BEAM gives you from an operational perspective, it&#x27;s probably not that worthwhile?')
