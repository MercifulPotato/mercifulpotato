They&#x27;re pretty cheap (â‚¬10 each) and it makes a lot of difference. I never feel cold. A good jacket is also essential. Downfeather Jackets are my favourite.<p>Other than that it&#x27;s just a hoodie between shirt and jacket, scarfs and &quot;hand-shoes&quot;. The Coronavirus mask also helps during windy days.')
