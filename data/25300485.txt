And the imaginary trend-change there doesn&#x27;t even fit - it is too early. The paper talks about  &quot;announcement effect&quot;.<p>Fact is that other places with real outbreaks (&gt;10 times more cases than Jena) never saw any trend-change from masks. It is even very likely that the effect is going in the other direction.<p>Even if you look hard, nowhere is it getting better - but there are quite a lot of places with massive trend-breaks in the wrong direction.<p>Reasons:\n- Lures old people together without proper protection\n- good way to transmit even without being infected\n- breathing through contaminated masks is not good.\n- contaminating mask is easy<p>Honestly, would anybody want doctors to walk around the city with their contaminated masks from hospital?\nThat&#x27;s what you get from general mask use - Healthy people - exhaling virus. In some regions the trend-changes from mask mandates look like someone turned on the turbo.')
