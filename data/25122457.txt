Then, you can take part in party activities, like internal elections.<p>In the US, you register as a supporter of a particular party with the state. Then, everyone registered can take part in (some) party activities, like primaries.<p>It&#x27;s a weird system, and i don&#x27;t know how it started, but because Americans don&#x27;t realise it&#x27;s weird, there isn&#x27;t much written about it!')
