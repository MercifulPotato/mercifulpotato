The space station is ruled by a tatalitary regime on the grounds of safety of the inhabitants as the plannet they originally went to settle truned out to be uninhabitable.<p>As a results the space station inhabitants live in cramped conditions in rooms with glass walls with no privacy and a computer system analyses their every word for signs of dissent. If some digression is detected, the system automatically lowers social score of the ofeending person.<p>Lower score means less priviledges and a shitty job and the lowest score means forced labor in dangerous mines on the planet surface &quot;for the good of all&quot;. Sometimes people survive that and come back though.<p>So what have ortinary citizens devised to combat this opressive nightmare ? Steganographic peoetry! It even has its own page on the Wikipedia:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Koalang" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Koalang</a><p>Due to the shear amount of material the spzing is done bz computers, so people speak a combonation of metaphors and poetry in a way that can convey meaning to the other party but not to the machine listening in. Its not that easy though, as the spy system is self learning, so one has to continually adjust and not repeate the same methapors ot the computer might get the meaning.<p>Still the question is - why are they doing this ? Its almost as if the opressive regime ruling the station was not telling the truth and was working hard to cover something very fundametal up about the Paradise station...<p>We had this book on our highschool reading list and it left quite an impression.')
