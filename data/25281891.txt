Fine enough, human body fever temps to freezing, and then maybe a few atm to vacuum.<p>Then the really hard part comes in: you have to specify the reagents. Water, saline, air, ok. But the carcinogens really come in on all the ways the human body mixes with everything. You got <i>all</i> the enzymes, the buffers, the solutions, the biles and secretions, the hyper complex bio-chem that is a single pancreatic cell, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t think such a matrix would be possible to report out without having a <i>complete</i> understanding of every human&#x27;s biology in all it&#x27;s strange wonderful forms.')
