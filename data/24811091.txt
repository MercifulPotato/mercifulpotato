I understand it as Complexity Science thinking, as espoused by the Santa Fe Institute. It&#x27;s always struck me as the style of thinking that biomimicry is but a small subset of.<p>It feels like a way of thinking that elevates analogy between domains up to the level of partial knowledge. And I understand it as being more about generalized properties of networks -- seeing networks that &quot;rhyme&quot;, even in totally different domains and strata.<p>Operating within these frameworks feels like looking at one of those 3D Magic Eye images. &quot;Oh, if I cross my eyes a bit, I can see that death is simply a repeatedly discovered pattern that emerged in virtually all living networks, and death is just a process of collapsing&#x2F;compressing a complex network agent into a lower dimensional representation that will be referential to other agents. And so how does this repeatedly successful pattern bear on how I should build a government? Or my organization? etc etc&quot;<p>EDIT: I also find myself curious whether this truth is why we have this predisposition to see beauty in allegory and metaphor and poetics. Maybe our deep history and evolution knows that these things constitute a fuzzy sort of real knowledge. Maybe our biology knows better than us that networks share structure at various levels, and connecting them through linguistic bridges has always served us and made our collective will more powerful.')
