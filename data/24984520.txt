Most common commercially available DJI drones fall if single motor or propeller fails, though in future they may gain such functionality, which would be great for safety.<p>A nice example of a different approach is a variable angle of attack propellers which are driven by a single motor [1]. See after 0:52 and 7:13. In case battery is dead since all the propellers are synchronized they auto-rotate and stabilize the drone (near the earth the pilot activates the motor just to land softly, but likely similar effect can be reached by properly adjusting the angle of propellers in proper time, like in case of auto-rotation landing for helicopters).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;TnGhEInTXYc?t=52" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;TnGhEInTXYc?t=52</a> (this video was posted below  by @jcims)')
