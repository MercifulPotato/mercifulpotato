Discord kind of won in being the only one offering that type of product.<p>IRC, TeamSpeak, Mumble, Ventrilo and Skype are operating in a very different space. Mumble is a small open source project. Ventrilo and TeamSpeak are old school desktop apps, I believe both are a one man project. IRC is an open source communication protocol. Skype was just a VOIP app.<p>The truer competitors to discord would have been the Twitch App, and maybe Steam itself and Microsoft Xbox on PC. But still, I&#x27;ll just contend Discord is a social media platform tailored to gamers with an emphasis on voice chat. And that was just a unique product that had not been done before. It appeared at the right time, since technology, broadband, and gamers owning good quality mics and competitive online gaming growing all made it possible.<p>I feel the article should have focused more on how Discord succeeded, and less on how it won, since I don&#x27;t really see who it competes with.<p>If you try to have it compete against Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, Instagam it definitely didn&#x27;t win. If you try to have it compete against Slack, Teams, RocketChat, Chanty, Mattermort, it also didn&#x27;t win, since it has no paid footing in the enterprise world.')
