Of course different parents have different styles - it is entirely possible to close off your child from social contact. But most homeschoolers I know have their kids doing all kinds of things throughout the day. Sports, group lessons in topics where the parent&#x27;s knowledge is lacking, and overall more free time to visit friends&#x27; houses and do things that are actually interesting. The real trade off of homeschooling is with respect to the effort required by the parents.')
