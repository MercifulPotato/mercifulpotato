Both had the largest communites of relevant developers making the best tools. And VSCode has the best TS plugins and the latest cool stuff.<p>Plus with VSCode I can use VIM mode, which does enough of the job (you know than 90%, minus the 10% which will never be the same).<p>But I still use Vim for everything else (RoR, JS, Elixir, Haskell, etc).
