Governments are not going to shut down all methods of ever sending <i>text</i> information to everyone permanently.<p>&gt; let you Google for examples.<p>There are no examples of governments having absolute authoritarian perfect control over the internet, for any extended lengths of time.<p>In every example of countries that have internet restrictions, there are many people who are still able to get information into and out of the country, through numerous methods.<p>The original statement was &quot;What&#x27;s nearly impossible to stop?&quot;.  And I maintained that it absolutely is nearly impossible for a government to enact perfect authoritarian control over every single person in a country.  That is just obviously false.<p>So no, governments cannot &quot;simply shut down the internet to stop Bitcoin&quot;.  Because no government in existence today, has enacted perfect authoritarian control, over the internet, or shut down their internet permanently and stopped every single VPN, satellite phone, ect.<p>&gt; it&#x27;s not worth the effort for governments to shut down Bitcoin<p>It will never be worth it for governments to permanently shut down all of the internet now and forever, as well as stop all of the vpns, satellite phone, ect.<p>This kind of a permanent shutdown is something that no government has ever done.  Every single example of governments trying to control the internet, still has many ways of getting information in and out of the country.')
