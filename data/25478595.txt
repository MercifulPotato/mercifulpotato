It was such an innovative company back in the 60s and 70s, but unlike IBM weren&#x27;t able to reinvent themselves in first the new 80s world of PCs and then later internet. Classic case of innovators dilemma.<p>AltaVista itself largely died, because in a misguided attempt to manage the innovators dilemma they just tried to rebrand everything network oriented they had as AltaVista.<p>People only remember the search engine now and for good reason. But we had AltaVista firewalls, gigabit routers, network cards, mail server (both SMTP and X400 (!!!) and a bunch of other junk without a coherent strategy. Everything that had anything to do with networking got the AltaVista logo on it.<p>The focus became on selling their existing junk using the now hip AltaVista brand, but the AltaVista search itself was not given priority.<p>I learnt a lot from my experience there, grew to be extremely skeptical, learnt to love Dilbert and also learnt how cool the DEC Hardware and Digital Unix was compared to the Sun Sparc and Solaris stuff I had to work on afterwards.')
