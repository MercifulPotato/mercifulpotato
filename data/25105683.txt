There&#x27;s also plenty of opportunity for companies to diversify their supply chain, so that any one point of failure doesn&#x27;t jeopardize the rest of the chain.<p>Who is currently trying to build solutions in this space?<p>Do you have a startup that you&#x27;re working on here? What are the challenges you&#x27;re facing? What makes your solution better?<p>If you&#x27;re at a larger company, what industry trends are you noticing with respect to this? What solutions do you seek&#x2F;are you presenting in-house?')
