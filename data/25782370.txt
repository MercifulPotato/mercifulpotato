Fascists accuse liberalism of de-spiritualizing human beings and transforming them into materialistic beings whose highest ideal is moneymaking.[261] In particular, fascism opposes liberalism for its materialism, rationalism, individualism and utilitarianism.[262] Fascists believe that the liberal emphasis on individual freedom produces national divisiveness.[261] Mussolini criticized classical liberalism for its individualistic nature, writing: &quot;Against individualism, the Fascist conception is for the State; ... It is opposed to classical Liberalism ... Liberalism denied the State in the interests of the particular individual; Fascism reaffirms the State as the true reality of the individual.&quot;[263] However, Fascists and Nazis support a type of hierarchical individualism in the form of Social Darwinism because they believe it promotes &quot;superior individuals&quot; and weeds out &quot;the weak&quot;.[264] They also accuse both Marxism and democracy, with their emphasis on equality, of destroying individuality in favor of the &quot;dead weight&quot; of the masses.[265]<p>...<p>Fascists saw contemporary politics as a life or death struggle of their nations against Marxism, and they believed that liberalism weakened their nations in this struggle and left them defenseless.[268] While the socialist left was seen by the fascists as their main enemy, liberals were seen as the enemy&#x27;s accomplices, &quot;incompetent guardians of the nation against the class warfare waged by the socialists.&quot;[268]<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fascism_and_ideology#Liberalism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fascism_and_ideology#Liberalis...</a><p>I think an issue we&#x27;re seeing is American schools don&#x27;t really teach anything about the Fascists outside of the context of WW2 itself and the Holocaust, and it means regular people don&#x27;t recognize it in the Republican&#x27;s rhetoric.')
