But I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s entirely in good faith. It spends a lot of time expounding on the DRC&#x27;s sordid history (Whatever you want to blame Apple for, they had nothing to do with King Leopold). It cites extensively from Amnesty&#x27;s 2016 report on conditions in Cobalt mining [2], but entirely fails to mention Amnesty&#x27;s 2017 followup report [3] that credits many of the defendants (especially Apple) of having taken significant steps in the right direction since 2016. And the complaint appears to dismiss any positive measures taken by the defendants merely as evidence that their prior bad conduct was knowing.<p>Of course, a company improving their conduct does not mean they cannot be found liable for their earlier conduct, but I would not take this complaint as an objective assessment of the defendants&#x27; current cobalt sourcing practices.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;iradvocates.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;iradvocates.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;stamped%20-Complaint.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;iradvocates.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;iradvocates.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;stamped%2...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amnesty.org&#x2F;download&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;AFR6231832016ENGLISH.PDF" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amnesty.org&#x2F;download&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;AFR6231832016ENGL...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amnesty.org&#x2F;download&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;AFR6273952017ENGLISH.PDF" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amnesty.org&#x2F;download&#x2F;Documents&#x2F;AFR6273952017ENGL...</a>')
