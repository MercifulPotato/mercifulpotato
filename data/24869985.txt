I could go on and on about how people make obviously bad decisions.<p>Take college major choice. Why do so many people get worthless degrees? They can do a simple google search to see how much people with X major make as salaries. It&#x27;s not hidden or even a remote mystery. I won&#x27;t get in to how people finance their education (not even reading the terms of their loans which are invariably awful).<p>As for career, I lived for a year in Minnesota and was amazed at how many people were incredibly underpaid (like 80K a year for a senior software engineer) and simply did not try to change jobs. Similarly many also refused to even consider moving to a costal city with better pay. I&#x27;ve also had co-workers that stuck around at obviously failing companies (and then were upset when their options were worthless).<p>And with investments, I&#x27;ve an aunt who inherited 50K about 20 years ago and just kept the money in the bank. Everyone knows you should be investing that money in the stock market or an appreciating asset, yet she is hardly unusual in just not investing the money. My mom invested it and made at least 4x on the money.<p>There are tons of these kinds of things - which are all simple and obvious, but literally most people don&#x27;t do them for reasons that are just beyond me. I had a friend who was a semester away from graduating at UCSD and dropped out to take music lessons at community college. I tried to explain to him that was an awful decision, but he was just dead set on it. I&#x27;ve seen this stuff happen over and over.<p>Obviously, you can say that people don&#x27;t have this kind literacy because they were poor, ignorant, ect. It doesn&#x27;t change the fact that mostly getting by and moving up in the world is not rocket science or for special people, it&#x27;s a matter of just making mostly reasonable decisions: choosing a reasonable career, saving money, showing up for work, taking good opportunities when given to you.')
