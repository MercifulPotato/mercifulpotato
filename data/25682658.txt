The cost greatly depends on the oldest person in the family, not on the health status. I&#x27;m 46 and the premiums are nearly $3,000&#x2F;mo for my family, but, glory to God, we almost never have major issues, but I&#x27;m sure there are young people who drain the insurance more with risky lifestyles and unhealthy behaviors. How is this fair? Also, isn&#x27;t age a protected class to penalize based on it in pricing? Meanwhile, I can&#x27;t recall seeing a senior citizen discount in many years. I know long ago they removed &quot;free entry&quot; and other benefits for which only women were eligible for. I was finally offered a high deductible plan with HSA so I don&#x27;t lose all the money when I don&#x27;t use it.')
