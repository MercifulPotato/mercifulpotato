Tue goal was to have something at the same time like a healtcheck (is it still working), like a performance test (does it answer in a timely manner) and like a validation test (does it answer the right result - the endpoints we wanted to test do &quot;complex calculations&quot;).\nOur best answer so far was to wrap K6 in an infinite loop, but I wonder if there could be something smarter.')
