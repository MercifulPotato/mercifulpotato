Even the very highest density cities like Hong Kong have extraordinarily high rents.<p>The reality is that the demand for housing is inelastic. We as a society don&#x27;t want people to move out from city to city constantly, so we strongly inelastic demand.<p>Empirically, rent increases 6-7% every year on average. According to the statistics in the article, to counteract this, supply would have to increase 60%&#x2F;year on top of the current rate, every year. This is impossible. Thus, market solutions are not enough.<p>This bears out in the real world, where all big cities that are affordable have a combination of sane zoning, rent control, and public housing, whereas simply increasing supply does not work, with HK as an example.')
