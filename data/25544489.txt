I started re-learning some basic math for fun and now I find it helpful now to visualize mathematical models of some basic runtime characteristics of my programs. A simple example is that I will visualize X number of users firing Y number of requests, and I&#x27;ll actually imagine this as a live system with various statistical properties (% of errors and the like). It&#x27;s not typically strictly mathematical—I don&#x27;t write down many (if any) numbers or symbols—but I&#x27;m creating a quantitative model in my mind to think through the behavior of my program when actually in use as opposed to a sequence of logical commands like I usually do.')
