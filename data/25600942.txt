I purchased it and took a look at the &quot;web apps list&quot;. I was a bit disappointed -- it looks like this is just a scrape of product hunt? There isn&#x27;t much metadata associated, just the information product hunt shows.<p>It would have been great if you actually rated the execution of each site, i.e. your own personal opinion of 1 to 5. As well as potential market size or that company&#x27;s current MRR (as is popular on IndieHackers).<p>Is it fair to say &quot;validated&quot; just means &quot;submitted to product hunt&quot;? If so, I think it would be better to state that up front.')
