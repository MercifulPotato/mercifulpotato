At the middle and high school I went to in the US, there were several mandatory computing courses to teach some basic computing skills. One of the main things they worked on was touch typing, which did work out to a good chunk of your grade. They had some typing tutor software which would report results to the teacher&#x27;s database. For tests, they would drape a cloth over your hands and keyboard. Intentionally pulling the towel away was considered academic dishonesty and followed the same kind of rules as cheating.<p>The school I went to did have an elementary school associated with it. From what I understand they also made a point to teach typing proficiency as a focus on computer classes.<p>Some schools do teach it, but I do agree it appears it is sometimes overlooked. I have many, many peers who despite having a job behind a keyboard every day have poor typing form, cannot touch type, and have some incredibly low WPM. Even some basic training on typing could potentially make them much faster typists. But its just not a priority in their lives.')
