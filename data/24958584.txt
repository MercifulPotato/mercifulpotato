There is amount for which above tax authorities have to be notified and there is a gift tax. So if investigation goes about searching for crime related gains it should go around connections of the crime boss. If they have house, they have to have at least contract to prove it is theirs. If you were not earning any money for entire life (because you were a mistress of a kinpin) and now you have a house that is at least suspicious. So if you don&#x27;t disclose your income source then around 80% tax comes in for income without source.<p>In Poland government introduced extended seizure so, mothers, sisters, wife&#x27;s are under scrutiny for any possessions that were acquired by those people in relation to crimes with a lot of money involved. Such crimes are above $50k and are taking into account all possessions that are within last 5 years before court verdict.<p>That means just as in tax case all those people have to prove they legally acquired their possessions. They probably have to have invoices, contracts and prove they had such amount of money. To remind as well, for tax purposes you have to prove you are not guilty, because you have house&#x2F;car&#x2F;money which makes you guilty until proven otherwise.')
