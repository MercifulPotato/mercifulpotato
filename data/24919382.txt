I don&#x27;t consider picking a random external source something I would do in a professional context.<p>But if we open up the choice of library versions from &quot;non-standard&quot; versions, the problem becomes a transient one. Team A in location B needs at least version X, but not version Y, team C in location D won&#x27;t do with version Z.<p>To give that kind of flexibility, people went for build from source instead (Go, Java,...)<p>And in every shop I have worked until now, &quot;your package manager&quot; meant usually having to support at least one linux distribution in two versions, Windows and Mac, which do not have a native package manager.')
