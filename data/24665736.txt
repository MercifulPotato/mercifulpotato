Item(by='MaxikCZ', descendants=None, kids=[24668099], score=None, time=1601664462, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24665363, text='Cant share my enthusiasm for LG TVs.\nWe have one not yet smart model from around 2015.\nOver few software updates it got itself to state where the TV is totally unresponsive to any remote input for up to 1 minute after starting, including volume buttons. If you happen to turn the TV off with high volume from a quiet film, you gonna stand there listening to loud ads next time you run it, and hate every second of it.<p>The EPG button starts a process that takes about 10 secons everytime to get to actual EPG (screen black and sound stops, epg loading pic, loading finished animation, epg core lines, epg loading data, epg filling up the data, epg resumes playback in a small window inside the epg). Every single time. It shows you 6 channels, and if you keep pressing down you get stuck on a down arrow. Pressing down on a down arrow wont show you next 6 channels, you gotta press down button on remote to get to down arrow in menu, and then press center to actuate the down arrow in the menu. Horrendous.<p>The only sane way to sort channels is to make a backup of settings on USB, edit the textfile on your PC, and load it back. This I only found out by chance and desperation, even LG support denied any other option than to manually press &quot;move up&#x2F;down&quot; button on a each channel you want to move for 30+ times to get it where you want.<p>Factory reset doesnt help, support doesnt help, nothing helps. I will never buy LG TV again.')
