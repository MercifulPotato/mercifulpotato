I don&#x27;t like Trump as President or even as a human being. I think Trump is a sore loser who should&#x27;ve accepted the election results and I think it&#x27;s despicable that he incited his followers to insurrect and take the Capitol. I also think he&#x27;s desperate because either he exiles to a country without extradition with the USA or he&#x27;s going to prison (I believe he&#x27;ll exile).<p>I can even understand Twitter and Facebook banning him until the 20th to avoid another violent incident.<p>On the other hand, I never used Parler, but I think Amazon and other providers should not deny service to Parler, as I understand Parler is just a Platform that allows free speech. They&#x27;re just killing the messenger. I don&#x27;t agree with those MAGA or QAnon or Antivaxxers, but they should be allowed to discuss freely. I&#x27;m an atheist, what if someone decided atheists have dangerous ideas and they shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to have a platform to discuss? If the internet existed a few centuries ago that would&#x27;ve definitely happened.<p>Also Trump had a personal crusade against Jeff Bezos, so I believe Bezos is just trying to claim some payback.')
