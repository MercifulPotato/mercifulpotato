I&#x27;ve actually started to come to love using the lowest spec computer capable of reasonably doing the job I need it too.<p>Right now I&#x27;m on a quest to actually break out of the computing models I&quot;m used to (generally glorified ETL) and to break into other models of computation and process modelling.
