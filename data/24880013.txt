We think of these as quality products because people are willing to pay large amounts for them. Their customers like the product enough to part with their hard earned cash.<p>However, If you agree with the agile manifesto, then &quot;working software is the primary measure of progress&quot;, I think that gives the &quot;zen-like sentence&quot; you&#x27;re talking about.<p>To help make it easier to understand, you can break down &quot;working software&quot; into two parts:<p>1. Objective, from a craftsmanship perspective, you can measure code coverage, performance and bugs.<p>2. Subjective, from a customer perspective, Does it meet their expectations? Is it useful, and secure? What are they comparing it to?<p>Hopefully you&#x27;ll find this is easier to use than another pyramid.')
