Nobody expects any other companies to do this. It&#x27;s bizzare to me how distorted a moral framework can be that people blame a company for obeying bad laws, as if breaking laws and criminalising employees was an acceptable and moral way to run a business.<p>Sure a company can fight governments in court, if that option is available, but if it isn&#x27;t or if that approach runs out, that&#x27;s the end of the line. At the end of the day it&#x27;s the governments and laws that need to change.')
