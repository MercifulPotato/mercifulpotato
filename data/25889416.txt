Check out this recent survey: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livecareer.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;careers&#x2F;planning&#x2F;is-remote-work-here-to-stay" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.livecareer.com&#x2F;resources&#x2F;careers&#x2F;planning&#x2F;is-rem...</a><p>In particular, scroll 3&#x2F;4ths of the way down to the &quot;Remote Work Prospects and Employees&#x27; Expectations&quot; section. 61% of now-remote workers say they want to stay remote. 29% say they&#x27;ll quit their jobs it they&#x27;re forced to go back. And few want to go back 5 days per week.<p>A year ago, I would have agreed with your analysis. Few would have chosen to go remote. But now inertia works the other way. After a year or more of not commuting, what&#x27;s normal is staying home. Managers have gotten used to managing remotely. To switch back, managers will have to get 100% of a team to return to the office, which is going to be very challenging. People will quit. People will have specific needs where a manager will have a hard time saying no. And if one person on a team is remote, it&#x27;ll be very hard to hold the line at one.<p>I think people will solve the rest of it on their own. Some will renovate or move, setting up better for working from home. There will be a rise in third places like cafes and coworking spaces, so people can leave the house but not have to do a full commute.<p>So my guess is that we&#x27;ll see a permanent spread. Remote working will continue to be much more popular than before the pandemic. Many companies, including major ones, will drop the expected days&#x2F;week in the office below 5. Those who go down to 1-2 will downsize office space, shift to desk hoteling, and treat offices more as places for meetings than work. Some companies will try to return to the old paradigm, but many workers will complain bitterly, and they&#x27;ll have ongoing trouble with recruiting and retention.')
