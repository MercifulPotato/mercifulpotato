(1 Week ago) Intrigued at the novel way it addressed the shortcomings of Forth which limited its use... I tracked down STOICAL. It really got me motivated, and I decided to download it and dive in.<p>At that moment, I had almost zero of the specific bits of knowledge required to make it work. I only used Linux sporadically.  I never programmed in Linux.  I actively avoided C for the last 40 years. Yet, I dug in.<p>Last night I got it compiled enough that it now starts up, and then hangs.  This is a vast improvement from 2 days ago.\nI now have WSL installed, with gcc, automake, and all manner of stuff required to make it go.  I still use Notepad++ and windows to edit the source (as the &#x2F;home&#x2F;mike folder is visible as a network share)   I&#x27;ve even got git&#x2F;github going.<p>I know I&#x27;ll get it up and running in short order.  Then I&#x27;ll start banging away at it until it matches my ideas of how it should work. My goal is to produce a Forth-ish compiler that doesn&#x27;t get people intrigued but then run out of steam.<p>STOIC checks all the boxes, it&#x27;s Imperative, Structured, Object Oriented, Functional, Concatenative and HomoIconic.<p>And right now.... it doesn&#x27;t even boot... but it will!\nThat&#x27;s programming!')
