I get to spend my 20&#x27;s debt free and mega rich (by young adult standards), and I&#x27;ve been able to save most of my considerable income. I think the average doctor&#x27;s net worth might surpass mine in their late 30&#x27;s, and would certainly accelerate beyond what I could ever keep up with. But so what? I get to spend an entire life never stressing about money once, while they have to stress over student debt for 15-20 years.<p>My &quot;prospects after 10 years of development&quot; are going to be &quot;figuring out what to do now that my house is paid off and I don&#x27;t need to make half as much as I do anymore&quot;. Compare those to a doctor&#x27;s prospects after 10 years of college: &quot;Time to start making money for the first time!&quot;')
