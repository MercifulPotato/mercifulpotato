Its tolerance is controlled by a hyper-parameter so it will comprise to find the best fit within the set parameter. So it is a &#x27;best solution&#x27; with a condition. However there are many variations of implementations from different solvers to handle it.<p>Example:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;towardsdatascience.com&#x2F;support-vector-machine-simply-explained-fee28eba5496" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;towardsdatascience.com&#x2F;support-vector-machine-simply...</a>')
