Item(by='PeterisP', descendants=None, kids=[25956497], score=None, time=1611922073, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25956231, text='&quot;There is no way everyone can get out at the top&quot; - this is the big issue here - as far as I understand, the position of WallStreetBets is that there are (were?) so many shorts of GME compared to the shares on market that they <i>would</i> be required to buy <i>all</i> that stock and everyone can get out at the top. I don&#x27;t feel certain about this (especially since if any of the funds actually go bankrupt, they would default on their obligations, not actually buy the shorted stock at all and just owe some not-fully-collectable money), but that seems to be the whole reason for this situation.')
