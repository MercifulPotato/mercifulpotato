Which requires you cannot leave your apartment for 14 days. Period no exceptions. And they only give you 4 hours to do it. Even several people moving one person&#x27;s stuff in 4 hours is absurd.<p>It&#x27;s like these bureaucrats don&#x27;t know human psychology. Youre essentially shaming people to a leper colony for a short time just to save face. It wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if they just told you stay put. But the administration doesn&#x27;t want to risk seeming incompetent so they heard the sheep in the way that&#x27;s easiest for them.')
