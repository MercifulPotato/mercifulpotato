Plenty of Bad Stuff happens to people (and all manner of beings, drones, Minds, etc.), but that generally does happen in fiction. I can only think of one Culture novel that kind of has a &quot;revenge plot&quot; (Surface Detail, and it&#x27;s probably not the main theme of the novel).<p>&gt; it&#x27;s like he couldn&#x27;t quite come up with much to write about that was within the Culture per se<p>I think it&#x27;s possible that Banks thought writing purely about a utopia would be boring. Personally I would have read anything Banks wrote in the setting, even if it was just a story about everyday life.<p>If you haven&#x27;t read it, his text (short story? Fictional article?) &quot;A Few Notes On The Culture&quot; is quite interesting and devoid of Bad Things Happening:\n<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vavatch.co.uk&#x2F;books&#x2F;banks&#x2F;cultnote.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vavatch.co.uk&#x2F;books&#x2F;banks&#x2F;cultnote.htm</a>')
