Shift changes were always stressful...lots of commotion, doing the introductions, getting the entering staff up to speed, making sure that issues&#x2F;incidents during the previous shift were communicated, etc. etc.  I personally think 12 hours is the sweet spot as long as there aren&#x27;t too many in a row.  Even if the error rates are slightly higher, I personally would not be surprised to see better patient outcomes overall than with shorter shifts.')
