Generally, you want to start out with your strongest statement.<p>In this case, the strong argument is very easily legally defensible. It was very clear in context why Rudy was not pleading fraud because it wasn&#x27;t the point he was making at that time. That&#x27;s the strongest argument?<p>So I wonder what exactly is the point of this lawsuit? I&#x27;m going to guess given:<p><pre><code>  * 1.3 billion\n  * Spicy, as you said\n</code></pre>\nThis is designed for news.<p>When Rudy asks for discovery, it will either be provided or not. I suspect Dominion does not want to take it that far because any good lawyer can make a case for whatever they want given what discovery they get. The fact of the matter is that a Dominion(? not sure if actually Dominion) machine in Michigan was found (in court) to basically make up numbers, had logs erased for 2020 but not 2016 and a whole whack of stuff that was suspect.<p>A good lawyer should be able to make a case that it is reasonable to assume the machines were defective if not outright fraudulent in that case.')
