A strict reading would imply a single one, and would mean that only TPB would be infringing because they’re the ones “linking” to the content (they don’t host it). But it could easily be construed to mean a link to TPB is also infringing.<p>The problem with the DMCA is that it’s so broadly worded with not enough words defined. What is the definition of “linking”? After a quick skim, I couldn’t find it. Are only hyperlinks (&lt;a&gt; tags) counted? Or are magnet “links” counted (despite not taking you to the content, but telling you the hashes of the content)? There’s no clear answer.<p>So to answer your question: we don’t know.')
