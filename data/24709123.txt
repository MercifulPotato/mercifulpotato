It currently takes ~16 hours to fly from SF to Singapore depending on weather. Any longer, and you&#x27;re going to see a lot of that travel disappear.</i><p>It takes that long because it&#x27;s more efficient to do it in a single flight. Taking off and landing are a massive waste of time and fuel. If we only had short range planes people would change their destinations in some cases or they&#x27;d plan layovers as part of the trip. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d see <i>that</i> many people just stop travelling abroad.')
