It appears that the examples themselves are talking of changes over long periods of time, that the programming community benefits from.<p>Are there examples where this applies to shorter time periods?<p>e.g. the discussion on the evolution of C++ language is fantastic, but it took place over.... years? A decade?<p>If I&#x27;m this person in my org trying to write better software for my project, does it really help to not be more disciplined? Before the invention of reference counting, wouldn&#x27;t the developers who did know how the thing really worked be more productive?<p>I think this is important to call out, and not go to the other extreme. Discipline is definitely not scalable, but neither is ... the lack of it? Inertia is very strong in production software systems.')
