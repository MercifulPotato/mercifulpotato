It never did have hence why we had to come up with other parasitic models to make money out of it. One way was to stick a wall around it but because it’s so easy to get content elsewhere without that wall it’s a dead end.<p>For me, if I was to write content it’d be open, free and be used for marketing my skills which you can’t copy easily.<p>Value comes from scarcity, consumer apathy, skill and trade off gains.
