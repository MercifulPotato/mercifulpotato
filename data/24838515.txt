But I see your point.<p>Having experienced healthcare in a few European countries (including the NHS), and having several doctor relatives, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good deal.\nThe cost of healthcare is really high, you pay a lot of taxes, the hospitals are subpar quality, you have to queue &#x2F; wait for hours &#x2F; days &#x2F; weeks &#x2F; months and the service provided is rationed. The government decide which tests you get to do according to their playbook. \nBasically if you want something done quickly you need to pay - but you&#x27;re already paying for public health in taxes.\nMy doctor relatives are often skeptical of the the government provided guidelines on how to treat people, but they still follow them because if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;ll be liable for whatever happens.<p>The most recent and incredible case is the use of corticosteroids for covid patients. My doctor relative and colleagues wanted to use them in some cases but they were told not to and to follow the guidelines. Now that corticosteroids are being recommended, they&#x27;ve been told to don&#x27;t talk to the newspapers, because they fear people thinking it was a state sanctioned mass murder.<p>Some more examples of how public health care sucks in everyday life:<p>- I had an unbearable stomach pain and after self diagnosing myself a range of potential issues (some of which needed tests to be proven) I went to the hospital. At the time I was switching jobs so I didn&#x27;t have private insurance setup.\nAfter waiting for 4hrs the doctor told me that because I was under 40 I wouldn&#x27;t get any tests done and she told me to go and buy some stomach medicines. \nThe pain was unbearable, so I setup my private insurance, did some test and I ended up having a stomach ulcer which needed surgical treatment. So much for public health care, I could have died.<p>- My wife replaced teeth fillings via NHS (it&#x27;s &quot;free&quot; for new moms), we thought it was something simple enough that we wouldn&#x27;t have problems. So we waited for months for an appointment and got it done. After a couple of weeks the filling fell off - and the same thing repeated three times. Eventually we went back to our usual dentist and she didn&#x27;t have problems with her new filling.')
