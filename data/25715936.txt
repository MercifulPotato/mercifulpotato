If you&#x27;re happy with ejabberd, that&#x27;s fine by me! It used to be a real pain to set up and maintain (one reason we started Prosody), but both ejabberd and Erlang have made progress in that area recently.<p>Prosody has a strong community and one of our priorities is keeping stable, lightweight, and easy to extend and experiment with.<p>We are aware that some useful&#x2F;popular modules are still in the community repository. We polish and merge new ones with every major release. As detailed in the blog post we are adding a simple way to fetch and install community modules to a Prosody installation.<p>Contrary to popular belief, XMPP is always evolving and adding new features, so this is our way of ensuring you can always keep up with new stuff even if it&#x27;s not in a release yet.<p>We have a chat, feel free to hang out and ask questions: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;prosody.im&#x2F;discuss" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;prosody.im&#x2F;discuss</a>')
