There is no good reason Linux didn&#x27;t gain higher percentage market share besides no one being upset enough about MS monopoly and concentrating the effort against MS market power.<p>Now AMD and Intel have strong motivation to invest more in the Linux ecosystem. Windows can be beaten and it will be.<p>And investing in adoption doesn&#x27;t only mean improving the stack and etc. It means putting some effort into making desktop Linux available as pre-installed on computers consumers can easily buy when they need a new PC.')
