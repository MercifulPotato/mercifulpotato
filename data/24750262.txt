With this very limited capacity, and typical grid storage batteries being warranties for around 15 years, our current production supports a global deployment of 4.5TWh of storage. We are at 9 hours of global storage, and we haven&#x27;t even really started scaling battery production.<p>I know you didn&#x27;t put a label on these numbers, as being big or small, but we are on track to solve this problem with battery storage, it seems!')
