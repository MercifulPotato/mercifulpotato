I find the steam community doesn&#x27;t look particularly favourably on microtransaction&#x2F;loot box gambling heavy games (at least ones where the microtransactions make you more powerful, as opposed to just being extra single player content a la expansion packs or whatever.) So generally you end up with some good recommendations.<p>Setting the minimum user review score higher or lower tends to filter out&#x2F;let in lower budget&#x2F;more niche indie titles depending on your preferences.<p>Also just avoiding the major AAA publishers is a good strategy - EA and Activision are by far the worst. I don&#x27;t really want to say to stay away from Ubisoft because they put out some great games (check out the Anno series) and <i>almost</i> always don&#x27;t employ the same tactics as EA and Activision, just be aware that some of the most recent Assassins Creed games do have some weird microtransaction stuff, although you can completely ignore it and still see all the content.')
