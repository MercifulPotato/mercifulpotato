We&#x27;re all obsessed with getting our delicate stacks of tools to work together that we fail to realize we&#x27;re building at entirely the wrong abstraction level.<p>The solution to slow SPAs is higher level frameworks and tools that compile away the slow runtime. Svelte is a step in the right direction. We have many more to go.<p>Honestly, I believe the role SPA front-end developer is overvalued at the moment, not because the job is easy, but because the tools are so poor. Once we see platforms that properly balance ease of use with expressiveness and composability, I believe there will be huge opportunity for development agencies to undercut the market.')
