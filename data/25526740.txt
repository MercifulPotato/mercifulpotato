The digital transcription process must have been flawed as there were many spelling mistakes and other oddities (incidentally, not the only time I&#x27;ve found this with Kindle editions). But it was one of the only novels (maybe &quot;books&quot; is a better word) where this actually contributed to the atmosphere. I feel like he would have approved, or at least appreciated it, and all the more amusing given the last part of the interview:<p>&gt; INTERVIEWER<p>&gt; Now, that old chestnut: Do you have any advice for young writers?<p>&gt; BALLARD<p>&gt; A lifetime’s experience urges me to utter a warning cry: do anything else, take someone’s golden retriever for a walk, run away with a saxophone player. Perhaps what’s wrong with being a writer is that one can’t even say “good luck”—luck plays no part in the writing of a novel. No happy accidents as with the paint pot or chisel.<p>Little did he know that decades later a flawed optical to digital process (I assume?) to sell his work to a global megacorporation, which is destroying the high street and employs thousands in drab warehouses and vans, so that I could consume content wirelessly without leaving my home, would lead to a happy accident.
