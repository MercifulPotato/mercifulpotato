Poor and tall? - redistribution helps especially you because if the economic factors are equal you enjoy your inherent biological advantage on otherwise equal field.<p>If you&#x27;re poor and short then you can hope to outcompete at least some tall people by doing better economically (working more, being smarter etc.). If the redistribution is very heavy then even if you manage to do that your now earned  advantage is going to be taken away and redistributed leaving you with your biological disadvantage and no hope to outcompete those more privileged.<p>All this means that redistribution won&#x27;t really help disadvantaged people (short, minority, less attractive) much. What would help are measure to curtail ways you benefit from those factors unjustly.')
