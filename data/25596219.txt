What does this grand theory say about those?<p>Throwing around broad terms with shifting meanings, and then changing those meanings around to fit each set of facts about the world, is a crazy way to deal with the world.<p>&gt; Do the math on the world economy continuing to double every &lt;20 years.<p>Easy enough, what&#x27;s the problem. What sort of resource constraint are you thinking we hit? What defines a &quot;dollar&quot; or &quot;doubling&quot;? Based on your descriptions, there&#x27;s zero chance I will bother to read the book you recommend, because it sounds like it has negative information content.<p>I mean, come on, what sort of BS statement is &quot;capitalism demands deregulation&quot;?? Capitalism <i>demands</i> regulation through policing. What sort of possible definition of &quot;deregulation&quot; can you ever provide that fits both these situations? The best reflection on your source is that there is some sort of very technical definition where this statement makes sense. But repurposing common words to narrow meanings such that they become jargon, then attempting to use jargon <i>without explaining that there&#x27;s a difference with the commonly accepted meanings of those words</i> is just a completely unproductive way to communicate to the world.')
