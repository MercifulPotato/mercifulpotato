Personally, I&#x27;ve always had a preference to how fonts are rendered on, for example, Ubuntu compared to Windows 10, especially with 2x scaling on high-DPI displays, but I acknowledge everyone&#x27;s different.<p>&gt; But the most important thing is that I am just tired of tinkering. Nowadays I just want to open my computer and get on my programming job and have everything just work.<p>Not disagreeing with you on this point. However, when it comes to &quot;tinkering&quot;, I find all the cloud-connected nonsense and &quot;extras&quot; that Windows comes with turned on and thrown in your face by default after an install a much bigger annoyance, and I often have to go digging through all kinds of settings windows to get a good deal of that turned off, and even then it&#x27;s not always possible (see telemetry, for example). A new Windows 10 install is a lot more effort in &quot;tinkering&quot; with all the settings into some sane configuration than any Linux distro where you&#x27;re not compiling your own kernel and&#x2F;or packages (and maybe even then).')
