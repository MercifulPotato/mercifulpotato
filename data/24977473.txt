We do not act in a world with perfect information to predict the supply and demand curve. There are only 65,000 H1B in a year of which 20,000 are prioritized for people with a masters degree in US. Given the economy of size of US and the kind of roles being filled by H1B, it is doubtful that they have any meaningful impact on wages. There are bad actors who take advantage of H1B to get people to work for lower pay, but that lower pay is not at minimum wages.<p>It has just become a talking point to take  a few instances and beat a dead horse. The big stink from the Disney instance that employees were asked to train their replacement. It is a insensitive move by Disney and the contractors and they deserve to be called out. But if a job requires minimal skill and there are substitutes available, isn&#x27;t it just what capitalism is all about?<p>I do not see the same talk about H2 (agricultural workers) coming in to work in US and people arguing that they are making the farm wages depressed. How about TN1? At the end of the day, it is the kind of job that defines the value and pay for the job, not the visa.<p>Just to note, outsourcing does play a big role in bringing a substitute product and hence making jobs redundant, but that is a different argument.<p>Edit - spelling mistake')
