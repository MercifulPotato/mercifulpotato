Item(by='RegW', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607105090, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25301990, text='In the case of the ZX Spectrum +3 there wasn&#x27;t enough disk or memory to hold the uncompressed word list, nevermind some form of tree structure.<p>The search method involved uncompressing each word (one at a time) until either the word was found or one that should follow it.<p>However, I did intend to use a binary search of the word list on the floppy.  I arranged it so any zeroes in the list indicated the start of a word from which decompression could start.  Under maximum compression there would be only 26 zero bytes in the list, but by selecting short words at regular intervals I could spinkle zeros throughout the list (approx 1 per block). A binary search could scan for the zeros, decompress the associated word and find the section that should contain the target word.<p>Tasman didn&#x27;t go for this.  They sorted all the words to be checked in memory, then opened the file and did a complete scan.')
