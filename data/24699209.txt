It&#x27;s full of the usual anti-Tesla cherrypicking, sarcastic one-liners, fumbling for clickbait headlines that zombie gawker Jalopnik has to use every day to eke out any engagement possible.<p>The comments section is full of astroturfers that also post on a half-dozen other sites with the exact same anti-Tesla comments.<p>There is a lot of exciting technology in Tesla, a sea change  in the very industry jalopnik purported covers, obviously a lot of debate and nuance in self-driving. Jalopnik doesn&#x27;t bother with any of that.<p>If I worked for Tesla I would have stopped replying 5 years ago to Jalopnik.<p>Elon Musk isn&#x27;t Jesus, he isn&#x27;t a saint, but you&#x27;d think he had perpetrated genocide reading Jalopnik and its commenters.')
