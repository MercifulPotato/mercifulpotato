For one, it&#x27;s a fairly inaccessible hobby.  Not a lot of people have the money or space to purchase, maintain, and store more than 1 vintage car.  As daily drivers, vintage cars lack modern safety features.  Many are gas guzzlers, which is not only hard on the wallet, but bad for the environment.  As for restoration, that takes a lot of specialized skills and equipment, which adds to both the cost and inaccessibility.<p>There are definitely reasons why you don&#x27;t hear about a lot of people collecting vintage cars.')
