By mass that&#x27;s around 1tsp of salt per 6.3 cups of water, and soup recipes for example will often call for that much extra salt on top of whatever is already in the other ingredients you&#x27;re using.<p>Edit: Individual recipes are probably the wrong way to look at that. It&#x27;s recommended to eat under 1tsp of salt (actual usage is higher in the USA) and drink over 10 cups of water each day, so whatever combination of food&#x2F;beverages you&#x27;re taking in you still wouldn&#x27;t quite hit that crude 1&#x2F;250 threshold.')
