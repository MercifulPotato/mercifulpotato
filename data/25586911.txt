I was involved in a manufacturing business that did great as long as we stayed b2c - but when we started doing b2b sales, even in small local shops, we got swamped rather quickly because we didn&#x27;t have enough capacity.<p>It&#x27;s not much use finding a quality product if you can&#x27;t buy it.')
