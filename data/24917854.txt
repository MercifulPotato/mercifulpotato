It&#x27;s not that. It&#x27;s a different job.<p>It is certainly a different job, but the reality of today&#x27;s corporations is that outside of a few niches, it certainly is the the next logical step. It is also easier to move down to IC than the opposite (by changing jobs), and getting back in management if you have a good resume.<p>Yes, some companies have technical tracks where you can grow your career well, but the reality is those are few, and moreover, even when you have them, growing in technical track is actually much harder than the management track. And technical track involves a lot of meetings&#x2F;discussions as well. E.g. there was recently a post on HN about principal engineer, and their job overlaps with what I do as EM quite a bit.<p>I have met many engineers who are around 50 years old, did not want to go into management, and they are fairly miserable. If you&#x27;re a kernel hacker, sure, you will likely be able to get paid working on enjoying it until you retire. But otherwise... It ends up being consulting, &#x27;architects&#x27;, and other jobs that are not that much more challenging technically speaking than engineering management. They get paid much less, and have fewer opportunities.<p>Also, honestly, the whole thing about &quot;management is a role, not a rank&#x2F;title&quot; feels like another trick by companies to low ball salaries.')
