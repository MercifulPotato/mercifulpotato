I would then propose to use a compiler-based implementation like SBCL, since the compiler gives a lot of feedback. That can help in batch programming -&gt; write code, compile it, run it -&gt; with the added error messages from the compiler or the runtime.<p>Some people program Lisp with very primitive editors, but they better use the Read Eval Print Loop for interactive programming, too.  That would be different from the usual C, C++, ... Java programming. You would need to understand interactive programming. That&#x27;s a level one needs to master - especially in many situations (and where one does not use SBCL) the dynamic typing of much of Lisp requires interactive exploration&#x2F;debugging.')
