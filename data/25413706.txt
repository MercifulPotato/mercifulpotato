Why?<p>Most likely due to some physical (not legal) issue that would make it mechanically unsafe to operate the vehicle above that speed even in an otherwise appropriate location. (Or perhaps it&#x27;s due to some obscure state law, or the manufacturer is just out to spoil your fun, or ... who knows?)<p>More generally, I agree with the point you make here about the responsibility to configure things correctly. However, it seems to me that Microsoft is also on the hook for failing to include the necessary context when an MFA request is sent. It&#x27;s a bit like selling a car with seat belts that superficially appear to work but fail at the slightest provocation, no?')
