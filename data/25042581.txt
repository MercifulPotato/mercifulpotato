To compare to something modern, I&#x27;m sure enough street protestors would be able to disable an APC and kill the soldiers inside at least some of the time, but the soldiers in the APC could likely win the 40:9000 battle cited in the article. Remember that knights had the height of military technology, this was an age where any iron tool was still extremely valuable.<p>The only thing that would hamper modern soldiers is that from everything I have read medieval knights weren&#x27;t possessed with any qualms about killing; life in general was much more violent than we experience now.<p>For more reading about this mindset, acoup.blog [0] has an excellent review of Bertrand de Born&#x27;s work. What struck me is just how casual violence is treated, and that war is a treated as the expected normal condition. The peasantry definitely did not hold these views, but given that the nobility had a vast armament advantage and copious experience in killing I doubt many modern soldiers would be quite so callous. The only modern exception I can think of is child soldiers; but they have been subjected to abuse specifically to train them to be able to commit horrific acts. Maybe I am wrong, but I don&#x27;t think most soldiers in modern militaries would easily be able to slaughter their countrymen with quite the same abandon. This is speculation, but I suspect that the nobles were able to do this because they viewed the peasantry as semi-subhuman; see the American antebellum south for the types of atrocities that that mindset enables.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;acoup.blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;16&#x2F;collections-a-trip-through-bertran-de-born-martial-values-in-the-12th-century-occitan-nobility&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;acoup.blog&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;16&#x2F;collections-a-trip-through-ber...</a>')
