The people that work a lot do so because they&#x27;re some of the most passionate in the industry and enjoy working a lot as a result. On average, I would speculate FAANG is less stressful and more reasonable than other companies. The reason you may think that is not the case is that negative stories stick to the same &quot;brand&quot; (i.e. &quot;FAANG&quot;) that employees hundreds of thousands of people whereas a story about a random mom&#x27;n&#x27;pop shop doesn&#x27;t register on your radar because there are many of them.')
