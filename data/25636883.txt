Corel Corp – there is no independent copyright in the photo since there is no originality involved (selection of camera angles etc), and mere &quot;sweat of the brow&quot; is not enough for a copyright to exist. It appears – although not completely settled – that UK law, by contrast, has a weaker threshold of originality, such that mere &quot;sweat of the brow&quot; is enough. This was the crux of the dispute between the UK National Portrait Gallery and Wikipedia. Since it never went to court, we can&#x27;t know for sure what the UK law actually is on this topic<p>* UK law provides special protection to specific works. For example, even though Peter Pan is out of copyright, there is special legislation requiring commercial productions based on certain Peter Pan works to pay royalties. Likewise, there used to be an &quot;eternal copyright&quot; on the King James Bible and Book of Common Prayer – that &quot;eternal copyright&quot; has been abolished, but still applies by a grandfather clause until the late 2030s. By contrast, the idea of specific works being legislated special IP protection is rather unheard of in the US (outside of trademark law, wherein the US does it too)<p>There&#x27;s a lot more fiddly little differences. The Berne Convention, WIPO, TRIPS, etc only mandate the broad outlines of IP law, the fine details are up to each country and different countries do different things. Every country has its own statute law and case law and differences inevitably emerge')
