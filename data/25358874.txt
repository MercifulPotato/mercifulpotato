When I set my pool up, I chose raidz1 because compared to mirroring, I still have 37.5% more space, which is huge if the budget is constrained. But if you feel paranoid and the raidz3 begin to sound good, that 12.5% extra space doesn&#x27;t seem to worth the extra complexity over a much straightforward mirror.')
