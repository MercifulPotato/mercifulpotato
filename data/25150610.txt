However, this is the sort of foundational service change that you simply don&#x27;t do ten years into a lucrative partner program without a good reason. &quot;It&#x27;s 2020 and our investors are hungry for growth&quot; is not a good enough reason, IMO. Any good business needs to keep it&#x27;s goals aligned with it&#x27;s customers or it will stop being a good business and people will want to leave. &quot;Changing the deal&quot; in a very big way like this makes your customers - the people giving you video content with no up-front expectation of payment - very, very mad.<p>I have a feeling you&#x27;re going to start to see certain creators deliberately put advertiser unfriendly content in their videos just to get out of monetization now. Certain videos are already deliberately not monetized because they either are viewer-funded channels (which YouTube very much missed the boat on) or are promotional videos. YouTube should grandfather those channels and videos in as monetization-exempt, because that was &quot;the deal&quot; that people signed on to. Hell, if that&#x27;s already financially untenable, you should at least still allow YouTube Partners - i.e. the people whose financial incentives are most aligned with monetization anyway - deliberately demonetize their own videos. Because, again, they are your customers and that was the deal they signed on to.')
