It&#x27;s about who owns the means of production.<p>Yes, and dictating the rules of ownership that others must follow is a feature of central planning.<p>&gt; but you can&#x27;t do socialism within a capitalist country. The entire system&#x27;s function is dictated by capitalism - a co-op, for example, is still competing with all the other capitalist companies and has to follow the rules set up for them or perish.<p>Yes, they can&#x27;t compete on a purely material basis. Thats why you don&#x27;t see them.<p>&gt; Depends on what that stuff is. Private property is distinguished from personal property in a socialist view.<p>yes that&#x27;s it. Your willingness to disregard my opinions about what constitutes my property on a dogmatic basis is the source of conflict here.<p>&gt; If socialists weren&#x27;t socialist this wouldn&#x27;t happen? This doesn&#x27;t make any sense and it doesn&#x27;t address the point.<p>The point being that insofar as expropriation is synonymous with socialism, socialism is a crime.<p>&gt; So the story goes. The expropriation of value from the Global South has something to say about that, though.<p>colonialism and neocolonialism are special cases of a command economy.')
