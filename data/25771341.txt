But you have to realize that it&#x27;s moving the goalposts from your original one, which was that anything short of free speech absolutism is &quot;censorship&quot;.<p>Discussions like this are frustrating, because one side frames it as though they&#x27;re defending free speech from the insidious censors — except it&#x27;s painfully obvious that if you push them enough, they&#x27;ll admit that yes, there <i>is</i> some speech they&#x27;re fine getting rid of. It takes a ton of effort to get back to that baseline, and the actual conversation about acceptable speech never happens.<p>Because if you don&#x27;t support literal free speech absolutism — with child porn, spam, et al. — then <i>you have to draw a line somewhere</i>. By definition. And we can debate where that line should be drawn, but the debate is still between people who agree on the principle that some speech is unacceptable. Not between Team Freedom and Team Censorship.')
