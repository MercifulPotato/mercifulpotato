Then, after knowing those views, people get to weigh in during election seasons. In this very recent election, of course, the public weighed in and likely delivered divided government, so we can expect some changes but nothing transformative.<p>I don&#x27;t think show hearings are necessarily bad. They can serve a valuable purpose, so long as they aren&#x27;t the only thing being done.')
