Indicating records visually in the overviews makes it easier to grasp the work distribution over longer periods of time. Additionally, if I mess up the month&#x2F;year of a record (which I frequently do ;-) ) I have no chance to find it again except that I scroll through every day and look for it. So maybe assigning a separate color to each tag and display them in the big grey fields next to the time line would work...\n(edit: formatting)')
