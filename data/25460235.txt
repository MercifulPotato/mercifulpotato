Of course that&#x27;s should be a warning sign for other parts of their operations too. There&#x27;s plenty of other options though. As for trusting them, I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;re on the hook for the $$ they owe you even if their wallet gets stolen. If someone hacked their brokerage accounts and stole your 1000 shares of Apple, they&#x27;d still owe you 1000 shares.<p>Of course this could also be where Coinbase&#x27;s niche ends up: providing the backend infrastructure for traditional wealth management companies to handle the crypto plumbing for them. If I were Wells Fargo or similar and wanted to offer crypto services to my wealth management customers, I&#x27;d much prefer using Coinbase as a turn-key solution for it than try to roll my own setup. Or simply buy Coinbase itself and have a huge strategic advantage over competitors.<p>Of if I were in a position to make such decisions, I&#x27;d be too busy swimming through my piles of money, lighting cigars with $100 bills, and sipping single malts older than my great grandfather to bother posting here from my armchair where I have not a single horse in the game.')
