Why is it so important to you that two particular implementations of two programming languages are badly implemented and thus (which doesn&#x27;t actually automatically follow, but nevermind that) slow? Are you being forced to use them against your will? Have you developed a trauma?<p>My advice would be to change a job and stop caring. It would be healthier in the long run...<p>As for the subject matter: yes, Python and Ruby are somewhat slow, which is absolutely fine for a lot of projects and in a lot of contexts. Where the slowness is problematic, they simply shouldn&#x27;t be used, and if they are, it&#x27;s an engineering or organizational failure. Don&#x27;t blame poor decision making on the language implementation!')
