And both are conspicuously accurate far more often than not.<p>&quot;An adjustment to suffering that requires powerful people to loose some power&quot; means exactly the same thing as &quot;an adjustment to suffering that requires a powerful class to loose some power.&quot;<p>Often attempted adjustments are categorized as blind ideology and, by implication, chaos. For the erudite it&#x27;s called &quot;abstract ideology&quot;, for the less so it&#x27;s simply labeled &quot;communism&quot;. The effect is the same: portray reform as destruction and create comfort for the beneficiaries of society in the status quo.<p>Conversely, both laissez faire-ism and Ayn Rand&#x27;s thesis are both very much ideologies but they are not called that by those who approve of them. I know of no possible definition of &quot;ideology&quot; that does not also apply to the both the American and French revolution as well as the motivation of every soldier in every army and indeed to the ethics driving every action that is not self absorbed.<p>Blindly following some policy like &quot;burn all X&quot; or &quot;policy Y always results in maximum wealth&quot; is disastrous. But I&#x27;d say that that differs significantly from an ideology like &quot;all human beings are entitled to X&quot;.')
