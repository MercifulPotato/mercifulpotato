Active noise cancelling is important. It doesn&#x27;t matter how great the fidelity the headphones are if there&#x27;s a ton of external noise and closed cans can only attenuate so much. In a perfect something like the Senheiser HD880 would be the best headphones ever but in a noisy office&#x2F;plane&#x2F;train&#x2F;home environment the noise cancelling with lower fidelity drivers would give better total fidelity.<p>That being said people are probably better off spending hundreds of dollars less for something like a Sony WH-1000X or Bose QC than the AirPoxMax.')
