If we criticize Neal Stephenson for building great worlds and telling an interesting story but not being able to consistently stick the landing then I think Doctorow builds the world but can never really get a good story going.  They are all better writers than I, but overall Doctorow to me seems a bit over-hyped for someone who under-delivers on the possibilities of his world-building.')
