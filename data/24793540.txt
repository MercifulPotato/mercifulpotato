It solves real problems for them like password management, bot detection, astroturfing, sockpuppetry, stolen accounts, and so on.<p>For these purposes, an actual Real Verified Name is overkill, and a unique identity number would be enough. But Facebook offers that service for Free(TM) so there&#x27;s not much incentive to the site operator to aim for something more minimal. And with GPT-3 and other systems inching closer to passing the Turing test, this only makes alternatives more challenging for them.<p>Those are problems in the Wild West that would need solutions if we were to reclaim the net from Facebook and Google.')
