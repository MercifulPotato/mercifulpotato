Have decent UI on the web, well produced shows and a mandate that both sides are allocated equal time.(PBS does this but is not very well produced, it needs more money)<p>#2 - Have &quot;Bias&quot; flags mandated on each article(or visual bubbles on TV), reflecting the authors political persuasion. This would be similar to responsible business reporting where the author states whether he has a position(shares) in the company or industry he reports on.<p>#3 - Require that whenever a article is posting a position, a opposite view point is required to be tagged next to said article.')
