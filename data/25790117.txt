Very popular Mi Band 1 up to Mi Band 5 are very much on-par in terms of hardware. The software just has to catch up and that&#x27;s probably coming.<p>If the project is successful, a PineTime 2 with some minor HW upgrades would be doable. Then it would take much less time because now there&#x27;s a community and software out there that can be reused.')
