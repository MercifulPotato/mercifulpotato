You don&#x27;t see much influenza during the Australian summer, so it was notable. Her test came up negative for influenza, but also negative for SARS-CoV-2 when she was later tested.<p>This doesn&#x27;t let China off the hook for it&#x27;s poor reporting, and something would appear to have occurred in Wuhan that caused the virus to become more virulent if it was in fact circulating earlier.')
