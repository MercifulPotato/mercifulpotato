Oracle is implying that the structure (heirarchy) is also a signifier of the API.  You can&#x27;t actually get around that if you&#x27;re trying to mirror an API but do a white room implementation of the underlying code. It would still be considered illegal if the SCOTUS decides for Oracle. You would still have to license or hope you didn&#x27;t get found out.')
