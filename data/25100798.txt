I&#x27;ve personally missed a flight due to a sudden downpour.<p>With reliable and massive inventory of ride sharing NOW available where i live, I am  comfortable living without a car. In my hometown where my parents live (a smaller city which also has a transit system but poor cab service), I still would not do that.')
