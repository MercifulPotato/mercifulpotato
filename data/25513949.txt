I have a 2 wired APs and 2 mesh APs in my home network. I would prefer to have them all on channel 11 2.4Ghz Wifi (since I have a zwave system as well, which overlaps with the lower part of the wifi spectrum), but I&#x27;ve been wondering if I should have them all broadcast on a single channel, or if they should be staggered - or spread out. Do you have any advice? Or how can I learn more about this? I think my latency is higher than it should be.<p>Thanks regardless!')
