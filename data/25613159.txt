The company I work for has (after being acquired by Accenture) implemented &quot;Endpoint Management&quot; for all machines (read monitoring and spyware).<p>EPM prohibits us from creating virtual machines, but WSL2 is possible. So a lot of devs at our shop (at least the 5% or so who are using WIN) use this setup.<p>Personally - I do this on my private machine - I switched, because with the EPM software I wanted to separate my work machine from my private efforts, as I just do not like Accenture to be able to read all mails, read all files and install arbitrary software on a machine that I have private data on. Before we got acquired my employer allowed private use, we were admins on the machines and there was no spyware installed - so only using one machine for work and private stuff was feasible.')
