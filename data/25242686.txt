We never see links to professional trade publications or to coherent advocacy groups on either side of the debate.  They might actually know and be able to contribute something.<p>That said, erring on the side of supporting public servants serving the public seems like common sense.<p>No mention of the military to police career track in the article.  There are many good things about those who served in the military moving into a local policing function...discipline, valor, sacrifice, loyalty, the basic martial values.<p>But the military trains for a “we” v. “they” mentality deeply drilled into the minds of those who serve.  When “they” are actively trying to kill you, that’s a very wise thing to do.<p>Undrilling that into a “we” vs. offending “we” mindset that local police must internalize takes some time and effort, but must pay dividends in the long run...')
