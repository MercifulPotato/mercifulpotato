The only sources I can find boil down to just don&#x27;t do that but I can&#x27;t find a chart showing what happens to performance&#x2F;frame loss.<p>It depends on your system. If you&#x27;re running old school shared medium Ethernet (with hubs, not switches, for cat5), or even just half-duplex mode, if your run length is too long, the big issue is that you&#x27;ve lost guarantees about collision detection; in that case, receivers may see collisions that senders don&#x27;t, and you&#x27;re left with transport layer resends (if any) instead of Ethernet layer resends. This is because of transmission speed, minimum packet lengths, and the length of the cable mean that one sender could finish transmission before seeing the second sender&#x27;s preamble.<p>If you&#x27;re running full-duplex dedicated medium, collision detection is a non-issue, there are no collisions. GigE transmits and receives on all four pairs simultaneously and uses echo cancellation to remove the echo&#x27;d send that comes back from the far end, the extra distance will make the echo come back later than expected, and that might be outside the ability of the network cards&#x27; signal processing to adjust.<p>Assuming that&#x27;s not a problem, you would have more resistance, and probably more? capacitance, which may make signal recovery more challenging. 100BaseTx would probably be more likely to work than GigE, in my opinion, but I&#x27;d certainly try both. Ethernet autonegotiation runs on a single pair at 1Mbps, so it&#x27;s quite possible that the cards will negotiate to 1G, and then not be able to actually communicate at that speed because of the wiring parameters.<p>One important thing to consider is that Ethernet wiring specifications are such that minimum standard wiring will work at a very low error rate at maximum length when in a bundle with many other ethernet cables&#x2F;other low voltage signaling cables. If you don&#x27;t have a lot of bundled cables, you have a bit more wiggle room. Of course, if you run the wires parallel and close to AC wires, you have a lot less wiggle room.')
