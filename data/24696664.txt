Just because it gives you the feeling that you are under the dotNET umbrella?<p>LINQ? Clojure and Scala can offer you much more than LINQ. Java is on par.<p>dotNET Core libraries? I don&#x27;t know, I have never heard people complaining much of the core libraries in the JVM world.<p>VS and VS Code integration? JavaScript and TypeScript has the best VSCode integration, other languages are just supported, including C#, F#, Java, Scala etc. JetBrains IDEs are much more powerful than what VSCode will ever offer. VS is not even cross-platform.<p>The C# used in game industry is a far cry from the one used in enterprise and I don&#x27;t think C# is the longterm answer for scripting in game dev.')
