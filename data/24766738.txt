It shows annual taxes paid on residential and commercial properties in 5 counties.<p>The reason why this map is interesting is because California has a unique property tax scheme created by Prop 13.  A resident may be paying 2x-10x as much tax as their neighbor in an identical house, depending on when they bought.  In extreme cases the difference can reach 100x.  In the renters market, landlords may charge market rate rent but pay much less in property tax.<p>I wanted to see how common these disparities are and display them in a visual way.<p>The code is quite messy, but it&#x27;s available here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;typpo&#x2F;ca-property-tax" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;typpo&#x2F;ca-property-tax</a>')
