Consequently, I expect a lot of UBports to bit-rot before its maintainers can make it a reliable and competitive option. Mobian&#x27;s stack isn&#x27;t what I would have liked (it is a lot of unoptimized GNOME libs), but at least it seems to have enough corporate backing for development to keep going.')
