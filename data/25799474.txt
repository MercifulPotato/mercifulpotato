Certainly many of the more notorious major exploits in recent years come down to memory errors. But of course, the major infrastructural software affected in bugs like Heartbleed wouldn&#x27;t be written in a dynamic interpreted language anyway. More generally, a language being safe against C-style memory bugs does not mean a (reasonably well done) implementation is actually safer than a (reasonably well done) implementation in C. That statement might be true for C#&#x2F;Java&#x2F;Haskell, but not for JavaScript&#x2F;bash&#x2F;Python&#x2F;etc.<p>It just seemed odd to not mention typing discipline at all. Presumably the author has experience with frustrating type errors in Python or &quot;object of type None does not have method xxx&quot; - these can be really bad for security in a Flask app unless you have careful exception handling ! And, unlike Rust, Python offers very little to actually help you with the exception handling.')
