I think that lack of pretence&#x2F;arrogance in this ethos is what draws people to libertarianism.<p>Any non-libertarian political persuasion will advocate for all manner of government measures that use force against peaceful people to force compliance with a larger social plan.&quot;<p>If you were talking about the original socialist libertarianism, then you would have had a point.<p>Unfortunately libertarianism today is more of a &quot;live and let die&quot;-type ideology, where those who cannot support themselves must fail, as they provide &quot;no value&quot;. It is social darwinism writ large.<p>Regulations exist for a reason and the effects of gutting for instance the EPA has massive consequences, irreparable damage to the environment and to people&#x27;s health. Or do you think the people in Flint, Michigan should just move somewhere else?<p>We absolutely cannot trust powerful people and corporations to do the right thing, since they do not feel the consequences themselves and thus actively do not care, because that would eat into their profits.<p>Voluntarism doesn&#x27;t work, for that exact reason. Hence why regulations and laws are needed.')
