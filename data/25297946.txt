In the end I couldn&#x27;t do it. I spent a lot of my time at my computer writing LaTeX documents, and for this the ctrl-click capability of a GUI editor is indispensable. That is, the editor brings up the source and compiled file simultaneously, and by ctrl-clicking somewhere in either, I am brought immediately to the corresponding place in the other display. I don&#x27;t really use any conveniences of the editor (e.g. autocomplete) except this.<p>Whereas, in vim, trying to do random-access edits like this with just a keyboard is sort of a nightmare.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a way to rig ctrl-click up in vim, but to me the appeal of vim is the (purported) speed boost from your hands not leaving the keyboard, so that really defeats the point.<p>If anyone has ideas in this regard, I&#x27;d be happy to hear them!')
