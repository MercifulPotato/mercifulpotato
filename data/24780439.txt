Weekends may be at work, but I’m then less focussed during the week, so it evens out.<p>So it has been pretty easy bootstrapping. Of course life is hard, but it is hard for other jobs too.<p>I think the entrepreneurs’ biggest force is normal companies spend 50% of their workforce synchronizing with colleagues...<p>That comment was just to show there are happy stories. Big thanks to HN and especially Kalzumeus for teaching me how to do business. I’m forever indebted but, being extremely bitter with life, I’m currently bad at reimbursing. Currently. I still teach my experience to every school I can, though (but with more talks about the downsides of course).')
