As Nick Maggiulli recently posted (on a somewhat unrelated topic):<p>&gt; <i>If it wasn’t obvious before, it bears repeating now</i>—some people are going to beat you at investing.  <i>Some of them will be dumber than you.  Some will be less knowledgable.  Some will even be completely wrong about the future.  But they will beat you just the same.  There is no great arbiter of justice in the investment world.  There is no cosmic force that ensures that only the knowledgable make money.  If there were, then I would be a far richer man today.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ofdollarsanddata.com&#x2F;let-them-vote&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ofdollarsanddata.com&#x2F;let-them-vote&#x2F;</a><p>As someone who rides a motorcycle, I think it&#x27;s stupid not to wear helmet, gloves, etc., and yet in Michigan it&#x27;s legal to ride without a helmet.
