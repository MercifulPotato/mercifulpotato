But the RISCs in general are much less likely to touch memory (only if you do a load&#x2F;store from a register that isn&#x27;t clean, maybe). From a glance, MIPS looks like it might work, since the opcode field seems to use all the bits and the remaining bits just encode reg&#x2F;func&#x2F;imm in various ways. The one caveat I see is that I think the top bit of opcode seems to encode memory accesses, so you may be forced to deal with at least one.')
