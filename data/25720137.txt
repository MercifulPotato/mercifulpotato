Got it used (to avoid getting a butterfly keyboard MBP), almost max CPU, max RAM, swapped in an NVMe SSD and a semi-permanent microSD card.<p>I love my 16&quot; MBP but wasn&#x27;t blown away by the upgrade. Touchbar is meh and mostly in my way. Speakers are a big win. Keyboard is a tossup but at least I avoided the butterfly era. Everything else is just noticeably better but not a &quot;wow&quot; better. My biggest annoyance is fan noise when attached to a monitor. Running at native panel resolution seems to help.<p>I&#x27;m looking forward to the 16&quot; class M1.')
