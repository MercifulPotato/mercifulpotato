The ones I can remember without looking up:<p>- Cloud saves require paid NSO subscription. You also can&#x27;t export saves locally. So it&#x27;s a matter of time until something happens to your device and all your saves are lost. Or you can pay Mafia^H^H^H^H^H Nintendo for protection.<p>- They recently introduced a timed exclusive game. You either buy it before the deadline or you can&#x27;t ever buy it after that. Pinnacle of FOMO if you ask me.<p>- Nintendo never fully accepted the well-known joy-con drift issue, and after many years it&#x27;s still not addressed in newer units.<p>... list goes on and on, though I&#x27;m not sure how much those things affect their public image outside of the hacker circles. Since there&#x27;s no strong demand from the public for Nintendo to do better, they likely will not.')
