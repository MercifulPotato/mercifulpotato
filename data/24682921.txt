Could be a good option for &#x27;multithreading&#x27; without having to insert another module. (caution: I&#x27;ve kept to the rpi for weird little side projects, so haven&#x27;t actually tried this. Double super big caution: Never add hardware before profiling your current system to figure out where the bottleneck is... it might just be a matter of changing your &#x27;main loop&#x27; a bit.)<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;beagleboard.org&#x2F;pru" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;beagleboard.org&#x2F;pru</a>')
