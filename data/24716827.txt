I read elsewhere (can&#x27;t find it now) just how much lines of code and language spec is dedicated to generics in Java.<p>Right now, the Go spec + compiler chain are a lot simpler; adding generics would have made things a ton more complicated. Second, by first spending a lot of time perfecting the core language, understanding it, and resolving early issues, they have a much more stable base now to build generics on top of it. As the comment also implies, they take things slow and steady when it comes to Go; it&#x27;s a language made to run core systems (e.g. at Google) for the next 30-50 years.')
