For example whereas JS is basically only functions, in Python you have a huge range of ways you can do incredibly complex things with slot wrappers, descriptors, and metaprogramming.<p>Ultimately, Python will get faster, but diminishing returns are inevitable. Python can never be as fast as the equivalent code in a compiled language. It simply has too much extra work to do.')
