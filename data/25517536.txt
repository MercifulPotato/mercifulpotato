This can be reported factually, or spun in a positive or negative light.  For example, a sensationalist might try to stir up interest by spinning a narrative that focuses on the vaccines being unreliable and dangerous, as proven by science that Big Pharma doesn&#x27;t want you to know about!<p>And as we&#x27;ve seen, sensationalists can get cult followings.  However bad their ploy may be for society overall, the sensationalist themself may stand to profit.<p>So as reprehensible as censoring legitimate scientific research would be, a directive to &quot;<i>strike a positive tone</i>&quot; sounds like it could be a very different, far more sensible thing.')
