They should confirm with their installer that their inverter is storage ready, which enables them to add a battery in the future when costs decline further, while capturing available incentives and cheaper power today. I&#x27;m making some assumptions, but I highly encourage getting three quotes from installers through <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energysage.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.energysage.com</a>, a quote from Tesla [2] (usually cheapest but you might have to aggressively project manage them), and compare systems to their historical electrical consumption.
