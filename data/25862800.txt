For what it&#x27;s worth this is the same feature (for the same reason) you need to enroll FIDO authenticators to unlock a Windows system, so if you use one to do that today, it definitely ought to work with this too.<p>I intend to spend the next few minutes playing with code to check I&#x27;m correct about this, but I might get distracted, so either there will be an edit saying I was right, saying I was wrong, or no edit because I watched Youtube.')
