Short of regulating quasi-monopolies&#x2F;antitrust and illegal content, media companies - regardless of their size - shouldn&#x27;t be interfered with. If Apple pays to produce content, then Apple can decide to stop paying or shelf it (in accordance with any contracts they entered).<p>To me, Apple&#x27;s own streaming offering - which at least for now has sizable competition from giants such as Disney and Netflix and Amazon as well as small producers on youtube and elsewhere - is quite different from &quot;social media&quot; companies with their defacto &quot;marketplaces of ideas&quot; interfering with legal free speech of regular people, which I see with far more concern. It is also quite different to their quasi monopolist walled garden otherwise known as the App Store.<p>Apple really is just a minor player in the TV space right now, and far more concerning is the Disney&#x2F;Fox&#x2F;Hulu behemoth, where we&#x27;re slowly heading into antitrust territory.')
