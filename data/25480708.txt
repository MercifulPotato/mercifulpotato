But there are no measurable, quantifiable units attached to such a list, nor could there be.<p>It&#x27;s probably not fair to indict too strongly on this phrase; people use exaggerated language all the time (&quot;X is the best&quot; to mean &quot;X is very very good&quot;), and so reading it as &quot;thinking quantitatively is very very important&quot; seems appropriate.<p>Nonetheless, as valuable as quantitative thinking is, it has (immeasurable) diminishing returns. It can never be more than a tool to realize our qualitative human values. Somewhere we have to &quot;cash out&quot; the numbers into things we care about, which don&#x27;t have numbers attached: human dignity; individual autonomy; the look of joy in a child&#x27;s eyes; the emotional security of family and friends; etc.')
