All of those people in those jobs may want to buy a car, a house, go food shopping at a store that doesn&#x27;t take crypto... If they&#x27;re only paid in crypto, they can&#x27;t do those things unless there&#x27;s on-ramps and off-ramps from crypto currencies. Those ramps are bottlenecks subject to the regulations of the jurisdictions in which they take place.<p>At best, even if a shadow economy built up to facilitate those transactions, tax agencies (IRS for those of us in the US) will knock on a lot of doors and say &quot;you have lots of stuff. That means you&#x27;re receiving value of some sort. You owe us a cut of that, pay up.&quot;')
