Item(by='zinekeller', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605252869, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25079389, text='The problem with both RIAA and Google takedown demands is never about the DMCA takedown in relation to copyright infringement, its the circumvention (it seems that EFF understand this very well, but most online commentors didn&#x27;t get this, which was exarcabated by GitHub using the DMCA takedown repo). Now, no one knows if GitHub were also directly targeted by legal threats as an acessory to &quot;enable&quot; the distribution of circumvention tools, which RIAA and Google is arguing.<p>Also, what RIAA is trying to remove is the code that allows to get the music video files from YouTube, which is served differently to normal videos (not just the test units in question). This was conspicuously absent from all discussions I&#x27;ve read.')
