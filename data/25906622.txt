Some CA hospitals report 50% of their staff do not want to be vaccinated. CA has vaccinated less than 1% of its population, Israel more than 20%.<p>We are wasting time with a failed &quot;ethical rollout&quot;. If the objective is &quot;herd immunity&quot;, we should spend more time and energy vaccinating the people we can rather than creating prioritization road blocks and vaccine shaming.')
