Those of us who are old enough to remember embedded programming in assembly language, aren&#x27;t all that old! The following developments occurred after I had been doing embedded development for a few years:<p>* Microcontrollers that could be programmed in C with tolerable results<p>* Big enough memory and performance to not need hand tweaked assembly code<p>* Vendors who didn&#x27;t expect you to pay for development tools<p>* A single CPU platform prevalent enough for someone to adapt GCC to it<p>However, embedded developers are certainly not unaware of developments in general software development tools. For one thing, they invariably end up writing higher level software to interact with and test their embedded creations. For another, all but the biggest shops have some interaction between the embedded and software teams. In my own case of doing modest projects in R&amp;D, I&#x27;ve often got Arduino and a Python IDE open side-by-side on a lab computer.')
