I&#x27;ve been at organizations that had an &quot;up or out&quot; type of atmosphere, where you were a dead man walking if you were in the same role&#x2F;department after 2 - 3 years -- you didn&#x27;t necessarily have to move up to management, but at the minimum you needed to find a different group in the organization to move to.<p>Then there are organizations that feel they can&#x27;t &quot;survive&quot; without you (although this is something to avoid too, since you can&#x27;t advance or have peaceful days off).<p>Now as for the work itself -- in order for me to get to the point where management values my contributions, I have to have the skill and motivation to make useful things.  And that skill comes from job interest (I have a difficult time building up a skill in a subject I&#x27;m not interested in).  So the one is almost a necessary precursor to the other.')
