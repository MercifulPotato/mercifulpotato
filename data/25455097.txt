Perhaps SOMEONE somewhere knows that you gave a donation, but functionally, many donations are as good as anonymous. If I give $300 (or even $3000) to a food bank, no one is calling to give me a congratulations. Do they have my name? Yes. They might send an automated thank you. And they DEFINITELY will reach out for future donations. But it doesnâ€™t have a meaningful effect on my reputation.')
