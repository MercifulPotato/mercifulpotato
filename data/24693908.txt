It turns out that burning embers can travel miles in the right wind conditions.<p>And pasture land is the worst type of buffer, since dry grass burns easily, and quite hot. NorCal, for example, has <i>lots</i> of pasture land, especially in wine country, and that is one of the reasons that Santa Rosa and Napa have been hit with major fires every year for the past 3 years.<p>There are existing ways to protect a town from burning down, largely related to building designs and materials. The problem is that these all cost money, and the type of people that live in these high-risk mountain towns generally don&#x27;t have the money to incorporate those features into their buildings.')
