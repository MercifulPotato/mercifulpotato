Almond &quot;milk&quot; has almost no nutritional content compared to real milk. It&#x27;s useless for people trying to gain weight&#x2F;muscle mass.<p>It has ~20% of the protein and fat content of regular whole milk, so at the very minimum it has to be 5x environmentally friendly.<p>In fact it is so nutritionally empty, that it is more fitting to compare it to slightly sugared water, and see if it beats that on environmental record.')
