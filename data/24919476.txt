Remember when H264 became the standard just because Google decided it after what must&#x27;ve felt like a fakeout to mozilla.  Then had to start working on a non proprietary implementation of what google already had ready. \nThis was back when people consistently complained bout firefox having fallen behind because a single youtube tab could make the entire browser lag and when chrom(ium) wasn&#x27;t as dominant as it is today.')
