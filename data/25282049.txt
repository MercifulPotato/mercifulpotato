Counting just the PWR reactor vessel, and not the entire containment facility, seems a huge cheat.<p>We&#x27;re talking economics of energy. PWR Fission reactors have enormous footprints, averaging 1 square mile. An ARC reactor wouldn&#x27;t need anywhere need that size. The very nature of using pressurized water means your containment facility has to be a factor of 1000 larger than the reactor vessel to handle a flash boil over.<p>Current costs to build a 1GW fission plant are $6-9 billion. Predicted costs to build a 200MW ARC reactor are $4-5 billion, so the ARC reactor costs ~5x more at the high end, and 77% more at the low end, for the same output (e.g. build 5 ARC reactors to equal one fission plant). The economics are still viable, and your costs for storage, disposal, and de-comissioning are far lower, as is your land footprint. Note that these ARC costs are for the first reactor, include the sunk development costs, and not the economies of scale that would occur from dropping HTS costs.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s all about the limits on areal power density at the reactor walls.<p>No, he makes lots of assumptions about how the magnets are shielded, how breeding works, and how heat transfer works. All of these are addressed by FLiBe, there&#x27;s no &quot;structure&quot; to the heat blanket to damage, it acts simultaneously as radioactive shielding for the magnets, heat transfer, and a breeder. The &quot;blanket&quot; in ARC isn&#x27;t a surface sandwiched with a super structure, it&#x27;s a volume that&#x27;s continuously pumped and recirculated.<p>He also makes the implicit assumption that reactor wall damage is a huge problem. Instead of seeing it as a problem, you should see it as a solution, like an ablative heat shield on a rocket or capsule. As long as the cost of maintenance or replacement is low, and reactor downtime is limited, it is not a problem. Current estimates for ARC, which is designed to be modular, so it can be easily maintained, is that the reactor walls will last about 1 year.<p>He doesn&#x27;t even mention the biggest unsolved engineering problem, removing the &quot;ash&quot; (Helium) that accumulates in the plasma.<p>His article has all the trappings of reusable rocket naysayers in the 80s and 90s, who claimed reusables could never work, because carrying wings, landing legs, heat shielding, and structural reinforcement to make rapid reusability would cut down on your usable payload, and thus doom reusable rockets to always be substantially inferior. And this is because of an obsession with a single variable, like power density, or payload fraction, and ignoring the end to end economics of the entire system, including safety margins, maintenance, footprint, etc.<p>And that&#x27;s why I believe ARC will prove Lidsky wrong.')
