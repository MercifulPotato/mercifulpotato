Lots of British shows get their soundtracks neutered because of this when they are sold abroad.<p>[1] Example: Sky Sports F1 is pretty big budget, but they&#x27;re still stuck using [knock-off version of The Chain] rather than the real thing, whereas the BBC can break out a really expensive song (e.g. Money for nothing by Dire Straits) for a throwaway segment.')
