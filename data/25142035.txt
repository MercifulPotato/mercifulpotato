I&#x27;m not even saying you did it on purpose, just drawing attention to it.<p>Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft, are hardware manufacturers with integrated, proprietary software stacks, just like Apple. Androids are made by dozens of manufacturers, and you can side load, use the App Store of your choice, and so on.<p>The fact that Play Store does the lions share of business is the sum of: doing a great job, and nudging users in that direction through various defaults. Fact is, you can load what you want on an Android, and to me that undermines the case for forcing Apple to do likewise.<p>I&#x27;d still like the ability to sideload apps on my iPhone, and think it&#x27;s worth pushing on Apple to get there. But as long as there are general-purpose phones available for purchase, and there are, I don&#x27;t see the anticompetitive argument in the iPhone being a console: either put up with it or don&#x27;t buy one.<p>I&#x27;m drawing a distinction between a bad business decision which customers should push Apple to change, and anticompetitive behavior which governments should force Apple to stop engaging in. I don&#x27;t see the case for the latter.')
