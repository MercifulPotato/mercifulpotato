All sorts of things. Sometimes I pick something to put my time into well and make something I’m proud of, sometimes I waste a tonne of time and then give up &#x2F; get bored &#x2F; get excited by something else before I’ve finished.<p>I’m at the point of just finishing a year long project that turned into a published book (good choices, yay!) and now I need to start something new.<p>So I wondered, how do you, the good folk of HN decide which self directed projects to put your time into? How do you decide when to go ‘all in’ or abandon? Do you have a process for that or just a gut feel?<p>Thanks.')
