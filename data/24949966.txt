And then sometimes it&#x27;s actually advantageous to specialise systems into a corner, it has benefits, but these decisions need to be considered and made with care, and then it needs to be an understood limitation going forward that it can&#x27;t be rolled back at a later time without a high cost.<p>Thinking about the above further I notice the things I&#x27;ve learned over the years also require the ability to link problem to cause, or in my case it came in reverse, cause linked to problem.<p>I ran into problems for years, learned how to fix them, and then during code reviews (even in self review), discovered the cause behind these problems.<p>Sometimes these were causes that would only become problems at a later date because of knock on effects.<p>I don&#x27;t know how you teach that. Possibly antipatterns &#x2F; code smells which usually hint at underlying problems that may be elsewhere &#x2F; at a different level.<p>Refactoring by Fowler and TDD by Beck cover a lot of these in good detail.')
