In college, I had a tricked-out compiz setup with wobbly windows and a skydome and a wallpaper set via script and a bunch of other cool frills, a far cry from the spartan, productivity-focused keyboard-only setup I have now (I don&#x27;t even have a wallpaper because a tiling wm means I can never see it). But at any given point, the majority of my workflow was similar to what it was the year before, and many of my config files date back to when I first started using Linux. Even when switching to i3, I already had a very keybinding-heavy workflow, so I just needed to learn one or two extra keybindings to get started, providing a gentle transition from my previous setup until I became more of an i3 power user.<p>&gt; I&#x27;d be curious to see a video of a few cycles of a build-test-debug cycle with your setup<p>For work, I use a single screen session per &quot;task&quot;. Im an MLE working on autonomous vehicles, so my environments vary, but I tend to avoid GUIs so every workflow (except browser-based tools like tensorboard or github code reviews) can fit within my screen sessions. Switching from my dual-monitor workstation to my laptop is pretty seamless; the same screen session is used for each task, but mapped to fewer visible windows at a time.<p>&gt;  I would also be curious to know how your file-system is organized<p>Nothing too interesting here')
