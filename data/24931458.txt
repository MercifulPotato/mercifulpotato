COVID is just an anecdote.<p>Second - our understanding of Corona with respect to masks has not hugely changed to the point wherein that decision would have been otherwise 6 months ago.<p>1) We know what Coronaviruses are (remember SARS?)<p>2) Our medical staff have <i>absolutely</i> been wearing masks since day 1. Why? Because obviously we knew they helped in some manner.<p>3) Asian countries wear masks and have &#x27;done well&#x27; very early in the game and have been begging us to mandate masks.<p>4) We obviously would err on the side of caution and worn masks were it not for the shortage.<p>The only thing that has really changed is the widespread availability of them.<p>So while I do think that &#x27;perspective on masks&#x27; has moved a little bit on the policy-making front .... we still knew they could be effective.<p>If Dr. Fauci were being totally transparent 6 months ago in March, he would have said:<p>&quot;Masks can possibly help, but not as much as you think, so wear one if you want, but don&#x27;t believe that this will protect you to the point of taking other, risky behaviours&quot;<p>But he didn&#x27;t say that. He literally said:<p>&quot;There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask&quot;.<p>Read that again:<p><i>&quot;There’s no reason to be walking around with a mask&quot;.</i><p>That&#x27;s a really, really powerful statement from the &#x27;Nations Most Credible Doctor&#x27;. A mistake of enormous proportions, one that without the &#x27;shortage caveat&#x27; would seem inexcusable, given the otherwise &#x27;low opportunity cost&#x27; of asking people to wear them even if they were ineffective.<p>We knew masks could help, but we were more worried about shortages, that was the impetus for the public communications, as an example of &#x27;propaganda&#x27;.')
