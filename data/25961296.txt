It just happened to benefit the short sellers who had been squeezed because they could easily find people willing to sell.<p>You definitely could still buy GME if you found some extremely random call option holder who needed to <i>sell</i> to cover their position. This would not be changing a net new position, just like selling to someone looking to cover a previous short, and this was never blocked - itâ€™s just there was no volume for this, nobody owned calls and needed to sell.')
