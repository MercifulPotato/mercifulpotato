There is also random noise on top of that gap. And that noise can sometimes cause the transistor to flip randomly, which results in an error. More voltage means system is more stable and has less random errors. But in gaming people often don&#x27;t care if there is an error or two now and then, so they can tradeoff stability for lower power usage. Companies don&#x27;t like that, because that means more technical support when programs randomly crash.')
