That&#x27;s part of anything in business whether it&#x27;s a new office, new equipment or new salesperson.<p>Whether something provides a return or not for your specific situation doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with whether the product itself is working and valid.<p>Ebay situation is different because search is as close as you can get to &quot;intent&quot; in advertising. You don&#x27;t need user-targeting when you have a search query telling you exactly what they&#x27;re looking for. Targeting is a proxy for that kind of intent when it&#x27;s not available.')
