And now she&#x27;s going to regulate them. I&#x27;m sure those million dollar paychecks won&#x27;t affect her judgement at all. I&#x27;m sure the insight based on intelligence and expertise, completely outside of getting an advantage understanding and&#x2F;or influencing regulatory behaviour is what they all felt was worth the money.<p>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s all completely legal but it&#x27;s completely corrupt. The best we can hope for is she doesn&#x27;t let these intended <i>bribes</i> influence her - and she may not.<p>Fame you say? Do you really believe that? If you do does it matter that the optics are foul and most won&#x27;t agree? Square that when people are going broke and wondering about food and children&#x27;s future when considering her millions in fees.')
