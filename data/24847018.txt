I agree it could probably be made better. I think the easiest way to do it is probably to find an example page that does something similar to what you&#x27;re after (hopefully you can find one) and then export that CSV data&#x2F;gps data as a starting point. I agree that that they&#x27;re not really CSV but most people seem to get confused if you talk about TSV for tab formatting. The reason TSV is used is to that you can just paste from Excel directly into the page.')
