Step one is to not listen to the propaganda machine, otherwise we&#x27;ll just exchange one broken system with another. I&#x27;m amazed at how almost everyone seems to distrust the government except when it points at Russia. If the government points at Russia, PRC or NK I would take a step back and disregard all information from anyone associated with them and then make up my mind. I don&#x27;t believe for a second that Russia is behind this <i>unless</i> NSA etc. already knew and did nothing for whatever reason and that&#x27;s far worse than having Russia access your systems.')
