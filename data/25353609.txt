Item(by='Mediterraneo10', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607473356, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25344313, text='Honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t expect much from GPS on the Pinephone (at least the 2GB version): the only maps apps available are extremely bare-bones, little more than tech demos compared to Android software like OSMAnd or Maps.me.<p>Also, while Anbox has been used in some cases so hackers can say &quot;See, I did it&quot;, I don&#x27;t think Pinephone users are actually going to be using Anbox on an everyday basis. It is too RAM-heavy and too taxing on the Pinephoneâ€™s weak processor. People expect to be able to near-instantly switch between apps (e.g. between Signal and Firefox), and that is probably never going to be possible on this iteration of the Pinephone.<p>With regard to music and Bluetooth, however, already Mobian on the Pinephone gives me the same functionality with my Bluetooth amp as my Android phone. No complaints there.')
