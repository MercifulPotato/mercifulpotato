Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606936651, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25278901, text='&gt; It&#x27;s always frustrating but never particularly hard to find the special incantation that will invoke it to do the thing that you want it to.<p>not always. I used to use google play music to play music from my own library in the car. any time I asked it to play a moderately obscure artist, it would interpret that as whatever popular artist had a similar name. it would then play the radio station for that artist, since I didn&#x27;t have the premium subscription. I found some success with spelling out the artist name letter by letter, but even that consistently failed for certain names.<p>also sometimes I would say &quot;list albums by X&quot; to help me remember the name of what I wanted. no matter what I tried, it would only list three albums &quot;and others&quot;. who could want this behavior? if I ask you to list albums, yes I actually want to hear every single album name!<p>I&#x27;m now paying for YT music (since the free version apparently does not support android auto), and it so far it works flawlessly. infuriating.')
