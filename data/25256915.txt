That is the only reason I ever look into maybe switching away from pip.<p>Running a pip freeze to generate a requirements.txt file doesn&#x27;t work nicely when you use a requirements.txt file to define your top level dependencies.<p>I&#x27;ve been bitten by issues like this so many times in the past with Python where I forgot to define and pin some inner dependency of a tool. Like werkzeug when using Flask. Or a recent issue with Celery 4.3.0 where they forgot to version lock a dependency of their own and suddenly builds that worked one day started to break the next day. These sets of problems go away with a lock file.')
