It would&#x27;ve been better to have additional biochemical data, and in particular immunological data, to determine what was the reason for the escape from the immune system.<p>P.S.: we still have 5 confirmed reinfections over a million cases. Very short lived immunity may (may, in absence of data, at this point) be an exception rather than a rule. It will be far more interesting to see data from a few months onward (1+ year from early infections).')
