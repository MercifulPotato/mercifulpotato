Many students from marginalized society, especially from poor countries might never go to school again as they have been employed by their parents for meager sum.<p>But I think definition of who&#x27;s &#x27;vulnerable&#x27; is what going to be contentious, apart from obvious front-line workers and elderly whom would you decide are vulnerable? Immunity compromised individuals? I&#x27;m myself house ridden for over 2 years now due to spine surgery and so likely immunity compromised but there&#x27;s no way that could be informed to the Govt. I just hope my elderly parents get their vaccine.')
