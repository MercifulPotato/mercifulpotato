I disconnected from social media, and my social life immediately died. Friends only communicate with each other through Facebook, so I&#x27;m really only staying in regular contact with my very closest friends anymore. Most of it I don&#x27;t miss, because social media has also reduced the quality of communication to the level of gossip, but what I do miss out on is any sort of invitations to social gatherings.<p>It also eliminates opportunities to make new friends. It&#x27;s surprisingly difficult to find a knitting group in my area that doesn&#x27;t organize using Facebook Groups, for example.<p>It frankly worries me. In the past, we worried about monopolies on things like oil and diamonds. I&#x27;m not sure our culture has the tools to cope with a monopoly on participation in society.')
