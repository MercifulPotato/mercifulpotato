This is a massive shift. My amazon order stats are:<p>2020 - 235<p>2019 - 107<p>2018 - 91<p>2017 - 112<p>2016 - 34<p>2015 - 39<p>2014 - 53<p>Note the two step jumps. I broke my arm at the start of 2017 for ref.<p>Edit: also to note I&#x27;ve had two (yes just two) issues with Amazon in that time and they just sent new items the next day without argument. Retail has been a shit show on that front for years. I remember standing in Argos arguing with the manager because the DVD player I bought had broken with one of my DVDs inside it and he wouldn&#x27;t replace it until I&#x27;d got it out and I couldn&#x27;t get it out because the thing had no release hole.')
