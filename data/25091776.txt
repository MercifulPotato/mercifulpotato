It says nothing of the sort. “Old people are evolutionarily valuable” doesn’t mean that dying of old age is good; if anything, an affirmation of the value of old people helps support the idea that dying of old age is bad.<p>Also: the important part of “old” in this article is “people who have lived for a long time”, not “people who have aged and are close to death”.')
