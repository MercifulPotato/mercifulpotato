I understand that &quot;proper&quot; first world countries should take care of them through social programs, but I&#x27;m just surprised it only took us a few generations to completely abandon the obligation to take care of grandma, grandpa, mom, and dad when they get too old to work.<p>My buddy is a latino and as soon as the elders got too old, they just moved in to the family house and their needs were met.<p>* I do understand that some level of care is unable to be met by normal families but I&#x27;m talking about the situations where its really just room, board, food, and love.')
