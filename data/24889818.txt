If you don&#x27;t like my choice of bulb, then do your own math and show it like I did.  See what watt bulb (not bulbs plural, or moving the goalposts even further, an entire bathroom) it takes for your assertion to be true.  Actually I&#x27;ll just do that myself because it&#x27;s easy.<p>Now, we already discussed generating 1800Wh per month using this bike.  So:<p>1800 &#x2F; (8 * 2) = 112.5<p>Or in other words:<p>112.5W * 8h * 2 = 1800Wh<p>So you&#x27;d need to run a 112.5W light bulb for 8 hours per night, twice per month, just to equal the amount of electricity produced by the article author.  Although you said that leaving the light on wasted more, so, let&#x27;s just go with a 113W bulb.  I&#x27;m old enough to remember 100W incandescent light bulbs, but even then, they were rarely bought and used because that&#x27;s an insane amount of electricity for indoor lighting.<p>Now where I live I can&#x27;t even buy incandescent bulbs because they&#x27;re not for sale.  For 112.5W to be <i>average</i>, there would need to be millions of Americans using stadium lighting just to take a shit.<p>I think you should take a step back and reflect on why you&#x27;re so quick to attack someone for doing a cool hack (this is Hacker News) that reduces their electrical usage (in the time of climate change).')
