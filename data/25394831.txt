Item(by='easde', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607740669, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25394444, text='I like Apple&#x27;s approach of having more narrow vector units rather than a few extremely wide ones. Narrower vector units are generally easier to program and easier to support on small cores (like the efficiency cores). It&#x27;s a good tradeoff for cores used outside of niche applications that do a ton of numerical calculations.<p>Compare this to a design like AVX&#x2F;AVX2 that has wider 256-bit vectors, but almost always forces the programmer to treat them as two 128-bit vectors glued together. All because Intel realized they had to power down half of each vector ALU to save power at idle.<p>Of course, the future is hopefully more flexible vector ISAs like SVE. AVX-512 is not too bad either today, but Intel seems almost pathologically opposed to making forward-looking decisions (what about when they want to double the vector width again??).')
