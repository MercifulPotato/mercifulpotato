Instead:\n&gt;\n&gt;    Hire people who care about users.\n&gt;    Hire people who understand the difference between a job and a hobby.<p>In the same breath he wants people who LOVE their jobs and super-productivity, but yet also understand its only a job. You can&#x27;t have the super-productivity that comes with intrinsic motivation if the environment is boring and lacks anything that might produce intrinsic motivation.<p>There was a great article about Elon Musk about this from collaborative fund, which I can&#x27;t find. People love that he&#x27;s crazy enough to build spaceships and electric cars, but they wish he would just tone down the crazy when it comes to Twitter or whatever controversy he gets into. Its a fundamentally dehumanizing attitude - you DON&#x27;T get to pick the good parts of crazy without taking the bad too. You have to take or leave the whole person - warts and all.<p>Most companies ultimately value more predictable and less productive over slightly crazy and more productive. I realized this is kind of my situation.. advice on what do is much appreciated :)')
