Instead, you would use SHA-512, SHA3 or another highly secure algorithm.<p>No, you should use a (poorly named) &quot;password hashing algorithm&quot; which has different security properties from normal cryptographic hash functions.<p>Later on they indicate that they&#x27;re using PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512, which is outdated and not as good as scrypt or bcrypt, both of which are offered in the pycryptodome library they&#x27;re using. The only reason to use PBKDF2 is for backwards compatibility, or with systems that don&#x27;t offer better (memory-hard or cache-hard) algorithms. The documentation even states &quot;New applications and protocols should use scrypt or bcrypt instead.&quot;[1]<p>Hardly ultra-secure. They didn&#x27;t even bother reading the docs of the crypto library they used.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pycryptodome.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;src&#x2F;protocol&#x2F;kdf.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pycryptodome.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;src&#x2F;protocol&#x2F;kdf.html</a>')
