People were lining up for their toilet paper, hand sanitizer, lysol chicken etc.  Old people standing next to young, shelves stripped bare in the stores, people driving around from store to store and even going up to NH looking for the basics.<p>It was a free for all, pandemonium.  It had to have been a super-spreading event in it&#x27;s own right.<p>In May, Gov. Baker activated the Mass National Guard to help the nursing homes, there were troopers&#x2F;medics going from home to home, administering COVID tests, checking vitals and, unfortunately removing bodies.<p>What we _should_ have done is activate the National Guard back in late January to blockade all nursing homes, hospitals etc. to make sure only approved people entered and that they were provided with some of the limited PPE we had and were using it.<p>Additionally, towns could have organized volunteers to deliver food, groceries and medicines to the vulnerable who were quarantining at home.<p>So yes, some focus and we could probably have cut the death rate by 80% in MA.')
