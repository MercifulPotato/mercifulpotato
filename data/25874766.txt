I&#x27;m confused every time this noise protocol comes up (apparently not often enough for me to remember right away). The &quot;communication&quot; in the title should also not be interpreted too specifically. It&#x27;s just about two computers talking to each other, not about securing your communications by adding noise, perhaps that added to the confusion in this case.')
