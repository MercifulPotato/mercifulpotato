I was given a 1U server by a company I was working at. Some old ~2010 machine with 32GB of RAM and 2 CPUs. I anticipated noise but not quite that much, so I decided to move it to the exterior shed that had one outlet. This was in July in Canada so peeks of 33-34 celsius are expected but not much more than that.<p>The shed was in the sun and would get pretty hot for humans, but I thought it would be fun to try it and worst case scenario it wouldn&#x27;t last long. Turns out we had some intense heat for the entire week and the server was dead about 8 days after putting it in the shed.<p>I opened it to see what had happened and several capacitors had popped.<p>TLDR: Intense heat isn&#x27;t good for 1U servers, but I bet you knew that already.')
