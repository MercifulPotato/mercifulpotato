While it&#x27;s true their build is solid and they look good, they always seemed overpriced to me regarding specs.<p>And even the build quality... a friend who&#x27;s an Apple fan used to tell me &quot;they are better quality, they have less problems&quot; yet his macbooks seem to break down at about the same rate as my Dell, HP or Lenovo laptops, so...<p>I&#x27;ve decided macbooks look good, have good quality screens and the best touchpads. I&#x27;m unwilling to pay a premium for that, and I don&#x27;t even like OS X&#x2F;macOS...<p>&gt; <i>I&#x27;m afraid that when&#x2F;if fast ARM alternatives arrive, they will probably cost 80-100 % of what the MacBooks cost.</i><p>Possibly! I wouldn&#x27;t buy them when they are the latest new thing, either.')
