LTO 6 drives should be cheaper than 7&#x2F;8 (though still not cheap) and have a capacity around 6TB.<p>AFAIK a post on &#x2F;r&#x2F;datahoarders says that the breakeven point for tapes vs shucked hard drives from a pure storage perspective is around 50TB. Given the hassle associated with dealing with tapes, it&#x27;s probably only really worth it if you have 100+TB of data to store.')
