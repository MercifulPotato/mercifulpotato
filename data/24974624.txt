It’s possible that Shelby didn’t know it was faked at first, but by now he’s had the chance to find out and is complicit in the lie since he hasn’t confessed.  I think a lot of other companies are going easy on them because they have also cheated and don’t want to start throwing stones in their zillion dollar sky castles, lest all the ultra rich owners that never drive their cars find out it’s a lie.<p>But expect to see a lot of hemming and hawing about how they’re having a tough time getting this next attempt scheduled and ask the permits in place.  Because it isn’t going to happen.  If it could, then they would have released the real footage and data to begin with.')
