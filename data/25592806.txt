Depends. If you want to calculate how a golf ball travels upon being hit by a golf club, then you’re going to get more predictive results if you consider the dimples in the golf ball.<p>If you only want to calculate the number of balls you can fit in a bag, by all means ignore the roughness.<p>Just as in the flat earth debate: it’s perfectly reasonable to assume flat earth when planning your bike trip, but the assumption breaks down when you want to fly large distances.<p>For me it is all about knowing which models and abstractions are useful in which contexts rather than philosophising what is “real”.')
