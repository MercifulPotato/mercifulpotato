Plus, the crappy documentation doesn&#x27;t bother to tell you what coordinate system they&#x27;re using so you get to guess! I wish I&#x27;d known about the little calculator they have on this site - which guesses the coordinate system in use - back when I was doing that project. Would have saved me a <i>lot</i> of headaches.<p>The next pain point has got to be China&#x27;s insane &quot;GCJ-02&quot; obfuscated coordinate system, as alluded to and linked on this site. I&#x27;ve had a lot of trouble getting basically anything GPS-related to spit out meaningful things while in that country (more accurately, matching basically anything up with maps while there). While it has been reverse-engineered, you always get to wonder whether the authorities are going to come after you for having GPS data that&#x27;s too accurate...<p>Coordinate systems are hard. GIS stuff is hard. I&#x27;m glad this website exists. Even if it&#x27;s hard for people to identify the problem, this site at least makes one aware of the problems in the first place.')
