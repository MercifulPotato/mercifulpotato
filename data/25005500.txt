If &quot;Workers&quot; are read as &quot;employees&quot;, then the conclusion is false and depends on the use-case, especially as organizational&#x2F;communication overhead scales quadratically (N choose 2) and reduces marginal value of every additional worker. It appears the author is talking about background workers processing task queues. This title should be changed to avoid confusing people who don&#x27;t read articles and only read titles.')
