I can rent an apartment in a much better area for fifteen to twenty years for just the initial investment.<p>A house can easily lose its value or at least cause large expenses, e.g. if the cellar floods or develops mold problems. Or if the surrounding neighborhood becomes worse.<p>Selling houses has a large transaction cost.<p>I really don&#x27;t see much benefits to owning over renting. I&#x27;d rather have 200k in a diversified portfolio that earns me 5k a year after taxes and has a much lower probability of losing 30% of its value while living in an apartment in a central location than own a house in a suburb that costs me a few thousand a year in upkeep and taxes. I&#x27;d likely need to buy a car too in that case, which is another few thousand a year.')
