Not that it would help.  It would mean they read the docs&#x2F;code.  Usually that is 99% of what they need to do.  Some people are &#x27;help vampires&#x27; and know they need something but want you to kind of do it for them.  I do not even think they mean to do it.  I think it is just text and this form of communication creates this weird air of authority that is not really there.<p>For my personal case my private repos are mine and have no license&#x2F;rules of the road because they are private.')
