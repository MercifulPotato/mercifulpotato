No need to get up and get dressed and drive to&#x2F;from work. I roll out of bed, turn on the computer and start working. Frankly the company is getting a lot more work out of me.<p>Sometimes I&#x27;m stuck on a problem and I just need to get up and walk around and do something to clear my head. But, when I worked in the office I felt like I needed to always be seen either in a meeting or butt in chair. So I would often get stuck and just spin my wheels all day. Then I&#x27;d often figure out the solution in my head while walking to my car or driving home or sleeping on it. Now, working from home, I feel free to get up and walk around the block or go unload the dishwasher or whatever while my mind thinks about it. Again, the company gets much more useful work from me than they ever did when I worked in the office.')
