Making CPUs is inherently less political than web search and ad tech, and so I suspect there&#x27;s less interest in social justice type protests at Intel than at Google, and maybe more economic concerns or general work environment concerns.<p>I think there are also a lot of industry common practices that ought to changee but may require not just individual unions at different companies but unions in multiple companies working together.<p>Examples include: onerous intellectual property agreements, excessive executive compensation tied to short-term stock gains, anti-compete clauses, severance packages with anti-disparagement clauses, and whole-day uncompensated interviews.<p>There are also rights that I think should be commonplace in the tech industry: certain minimum working conditions, like a minimum cubicle size, high cube walls if you prefer them, and multiple monitors of a reasonable size and resolution, the right to refuse work if documentation required to do one&#x27;s job correctly is unintelligible or nonexistent, the right to have any question raised by ten or more employees be addressed in a timely fashion by senior management (even if the legitimate answer sometimes is &quot;that&#x27;s a secret, we can&#x27;t tell you for strategic or legal reasons&quot;), the right to have your name and contributions to the company listed publicly if you want, the right to (in cases where it doesn&#x27;t directly undermine the company&#x27;s ability to collect revenue) publish one&#x27;s work with an open source license, and so on.<p>Anyone working in the tech industry could come up with their own list that would be different, but maybe there&#x27;s enough overlap to make collective action workable.')
