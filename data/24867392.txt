Item(by='Angostura', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603444021, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24866833, text='&gt; It&#x27;s funny because Apple&#x27;s vision of the &quot;computer&quot; isn&#x27;t really a tool for the kid but a means to control them and use them for value extraction, as we know.<p>Really? My kid uses their iPad for content creation and whatnot and as far as I can tell they aren&#x27;t controlled in particular. The only value that is extracted is that from my wallet for additional apps.')
