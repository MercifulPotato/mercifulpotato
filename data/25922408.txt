Item(by='cesarb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611704627, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25920970, text='&gt; Every laptop, home computer and all-in-one computer and many PCs use exactly a single PCB.<p>That&#x27;s only the case if the memory is soldered to the motherboard; otherwise, it&#x27;s on a separate PCB. The storage also has to be soldered in (not M.2 or a traditional HD). The WiFi has to be on the motherboard too. And so on.<p>The laptop I&#x27;m using to type this comment has at least five PCBs: the motherboard, two memory boards, a storage board, and a WiFi board. It might have more that I missed.')
