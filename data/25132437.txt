Unfortunately right now it’s collected from the lower and middle classes, but no matter what you do drugs, treatments, doctors, hospitals, etc. cost money. It’s never, ever, ever “free”. If a drug costs $2,000&#x2F;month there are probably some inefficiencies baked into the price, but even if it were $500&#x2F;month, that $500 has to come from somewhere.')
