I don&#x27;t understand exactly why this is<p>SLBM are <i>big</i>, a Trident II is 13.6m long and 2.11m wide[0] and Ohios need to fit them straight up plus the hull, so we&#x27;re talking 14m moulded depth or so (excluding the sail), and a pretty similar beam, at which pointâ€¦ you just have a big sub, because it can&#x27;t exactly be a ball: you need to fit 12 Tridents in a row, plus the reactor, engine, crew compartments, passages for the crew to move around, torpedo tubes, and enough stores to last for literally months.<p>Attack subs can have vertically mounted cruise missiles but those are puny compared to an SLBM, a Tomahawk is 6.25m long with booster[1]: an Ohio-class carries 24 Tridents in SSBN configuration, if converted to SSGN it carries <i>154</i> tomahawks.<p>Los Angeles carries 37, Seawolf carries 50 (and on both this competes with torpedoes and anti-ship missiles, on an Ohio you get 24 tridents or 154 tomahawks <i>plus</i> a dozen torpedoes or anti-ship missiles).<p>[0] and Typhoon&#x27;s SLBMs were even larger at 16.1m by 2.4<p>[1] and 0.5m wide')
