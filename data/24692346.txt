The WaitForObject will only return at the next interrupt of a system timer.....so exactly at the same point when a Sleep(1) would have woken up too. There is no benefit to using the event architecture, because for those sub-16ms events it doesn&#x27;t actually bypass the constraint of the system timer interrupt.<p>&gt;&gt;So that one thread can wake another thread immediately.<p>The problem here is that the immediate part isn&#x27;t actually immediate, that&#x27;s the crux of the whole issue.')
