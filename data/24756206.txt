Rental cars and Uber are expensive.<p>If you even take a few Uber trips a month, you&#x27;re probably better off owning an affordable car.<p>If you have visitors regularly, you should probably buy a house with that extra bedroom.  It&#x27;s an asset that you can sell and recoup virtually 100% of your investment later on.
