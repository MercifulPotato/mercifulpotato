We will be having features that you have to pay a subscription for. It starts with the usual suspects: custom SSO, custom domains, and authorization - things that we would be hosting as an ongoing service for customers. Most features will be open when we create them -- this is near and dear to our hearts -- itâ€™s important our users can be successful with the OSS version. Over time, the commercial features will also flow into the open as we release new proprietary ones. Our commercial features will be public in our repo, under a commercial license.<p>We will also have a managed version where we deploy and maintain it for the customer in a cloud account they provide us.')
