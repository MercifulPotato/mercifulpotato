(English English, not American English.) Seems to me he did a great job. I am not a native speaker, so my opinion probably doesn&#x27;t matter much here, but at least I can say he sounds quite different from other people who have English as a second language.<p>Knowing how much time and money he spent to achieve this goal, it seems to me like a complete waste of time and money. Apparently, his opinion differs. But his example makes me believe that the goal is attainable... but also explains why most people don&#x27;t do it.')
