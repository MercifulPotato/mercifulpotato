However, my impression from trying to install more complex projects is that a main issue is a cultural one: Python package developers are happy to introduce breaking changes if they think they will not break for too many of their users.<p>For example there are packages which transitioned to being python 3 only without changing the package name, or changing the version major number. This breaks the assumption that packages use semantic versioning, which many tools use. And that&#x27;s arguably less of a problem for that shiny new startup company which will, with 95% likelihood, have gone bust five years from now, and also not for the FAANG companies, but it is a <i>big</i> problem in scientific institutions which do not have money or personnel to constantly rewrite their software.')
