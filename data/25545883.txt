I&#x27;ve got a mess of monitors that are VGA&#x2F;DVI, and the video cards don&#x27;t always have that output anymore.  Some do... but watching them fade.  VGA maxes out at 1920x1200 or so before you need to make the jump to DVI.  Think dual link DVI starts at 2560x1440.<p>If you know of a 3080 that has DVI, I&#x27;m interested.')
