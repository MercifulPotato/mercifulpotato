Don’t get me wrong, I’m a huge fan of Rust, but seeing people blindly suggest it as a panacea gets frustrating for people. The reality is that when people talk about Rust being fact, it’s because a decently optimised Rust program might be <i>comparable</i> to an equivalent C program. C is generally not the problem when it comes to performance issues in the kernel, which means rewriting that thing in Rust wouldn’t magically make it faster.<p>The issue will probably be some sort of pathological case in an algorithm being used, or perhaps from a poorly chosen algorithm. The point being, it’s not clear yet, and to solve that requires understanding the problem, not effecting a needless rewrite in a new language.')
