Our public discourse is not some extravagance that our government allows us. It is the core of our system and has been from the moment of the country&#x27;s founding in reaction to hereditary monarchy. The government&#x27;s right to rule flows out of this conversation. If the conversation stops, the country will cease to be.<p>So while I think you are quite wrong about the current risk, we are in complete agreement that freedom of speech should be vigilantly protected.')
