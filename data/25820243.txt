Settings are protected from tampering by password each time you wanna make a change - which is weird but since it requires only username and password is a fair requirement, I guess. Multidevices support was present but removed due some bugs but as Loki Foundation behind IM states, it&#x27;s gonna eventually return.<p>What is unique, is the way contacts are handled - it&#x27;s an alphanumeric ID you pass to your contact but seems there&#x27;s a plan to support standard usernames with a fee. Tho, there are also QR codes on profile page you can share with contacts which should make easier adding people.<p>There&#x27;s emoji support obviously but no stickers (if someone cares actually about that), delivered&#x2F;seen messages status and typing, audio messages and spellcheck.<p>Seems like yet another pretty good alternative but the fact is Australian-based worries me - Oz guys have some issues with encryption law iirc.')
