We&#x27;ve been testing the product by putting it out there to get feedback and validation, and then work on our pricing strategy based on the positioning we take. Given our architecture, one of our aims was to offer a free forever plan, the other was to have an eject strategy so that you can take you project with you as a complete and functional code repository.<p>We feel that currently, the learning curve is pretty minimal.
