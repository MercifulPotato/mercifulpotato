Item(by='awb', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610394119, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25733932, text='&gt; Do they literally have to buy physical servers and host them on their own property somewhere?<p>That&#x27;s exactly what companies did not too long ago for this very reason. They wanted full control over the entire stack and yes had physical servers in physical offices.<p>Over time, folks laid off their IT staff and traded away their control for convenience. That&#x27;s the tradeoff: their house -&gt; their rules, your house -&gt; your rules.<p>&gt; But then how do they get connected to the internet without going through some privately owned ISP that might cut them off?<p>Now that is an insurmountable obstacle and a real problem. For that matter, what if Comcast cut off all of AWS until they banned Parler? It would take years to build a physical cable network. The highways are much more important than the parking lots.')
