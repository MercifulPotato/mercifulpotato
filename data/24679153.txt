Not saying this is the proper way to look at it but it is a way to get it through to some people who may see their grounds flooded in their lifetimes.

The more certainty we get the more it will impact prices and insurance. People do not ignore those and there are plenty living close to the sea. Again it is a lagging and not proper way of looking at it but we need to reach people who are not able to absorb more complex stuff.')
