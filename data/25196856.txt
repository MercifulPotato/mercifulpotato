Its heroes, themes, and aesthetics, will likely self-replicate for centuries and be used by historians as a reference for cultural values of these times. It is already much bigger than Mickey Mouse, in practice, and has now enough material to be enjoyed throughout one&#x27;s entire life (it&#x27;s actually becoming difficult to be a completionist, with all these TV series).<p>I fully expect, in about 100 years time, to get statues of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa erected not-ironically.')
