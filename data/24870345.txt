People who develop &quot;creative&quot; systems by working ground-up starting with foundational system logic. They create proprietary systems really fast, and those proprietary systems often do some wackadoodle things in the name of internal logic.<p>As a result, those systems are typically harder to maintain or secure by just anybody, even by some experts who are not from the NIH mindset (here&#x27;s where the author&#x27;s approach isn&#x27;t really fair, IMO). Proprietary systems are are less likely to present the typical bell curve security issues that an automated scanner would pick up.<p>What they are more vulnerable to is puzzle logic--the &quot;what&#x27;s going on here, hmm let&#x27;s have a tinker&quot; approach. Which is exactly what the author presented and it also matches his broader approach of &quot;let&#x27;s have a tinker...with freelancers&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s a subjective security vs. objective security approach. Both sides are important. But both sides should know about how the other side works.')
