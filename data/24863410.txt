The word scientist was coined over a debate on whether &quot;natural philosophers&quot; was accurate&#x2F;narrow enough of a term to describe what they were doing. In answer to a challenge by poet coleridge, Whewell came up with the term scientist - &#x27;If philosophers is too wide and lofty a term then, by analogy with artist, we may form scientist. In other words, snobbish philosophers who worked with their minds looked down on these &quot;scientists&quot; who worked with their hands and wanted to differentiate themselves from scientists.<p>Here is her wonderful TED talk describing the history of &#x27;scientist&#x27;. It&#x27;s interesting how since then, the reputation of scientist has risen and philosophers have dropped. Now philosophers and everyone else from economists and political &#x27;scientists&#x27; want to be called scientists.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jc_-Y9rDN2g" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=jc_-Y9rDN2g</a><p>We are told that in war, truth is the first casualty. Sadly this is true for the culture war as almost everything peddle during this war is half-truths or outright lies. The worrisome part is that so much of media and tech is involved in the disinformation. For anything remotely cultural, I know if it&#x27;s in wikipedia, the nytimes or posted here, it&#x27;s most likely bullshit. But nevertheless the bullshit must flow.<p>[from the article]<p>&quot;That women should face such an Everestine climb toward inclusion and equality is a piece of curious and rather cruel cultural irony, for the very word “scientist” didn’t always have the overwhelmingly male connotations it has had in recent history. In fact, it was a coined for a woman — the Victorian polymath Mary Somerville&quot;<p>The above is pretty much all cultural propaganda.<p>1. Women didn&#x27;t face everestine climb. Especially privileged wealthy white women like somerville. Sure she had some hurdles, but nothing her privilege couldn&#x27;t overcome. Somerville had it easier than 90% of men and 95% of women.<p>2. Scientist always had an overwhelmingly male connotation because scientists are&#x2F;were overwhelmingly male. Not saying it should be this way or not, but just stating reality.<p>3. It was indeed not fact, that the term scientist, was coined for a woman.<p>I doubt the author or the site will correct their lies. I doubt wikipedia will fix their site. And I doubt this is the last we&#x27;ll see of this here.<p>Edit: Of course these &quot;warriors&quot; are now distracting with straw man comments. The first 3 minutes of Laura Synder&#x27;s ted talk explains the origins of scientist. It&#x27;s not that long of a watch. If you think she&#x27;s lying or mistaken, then feel free to comment on that. But I see no reason why she would lie and all the evidence, including the one&#x27;s the naysayers are posting seems to show she is right.')
