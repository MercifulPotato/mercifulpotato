Any individual case of a public prosecutor refusing to prosecute a murderer (because they&#x27;re also employed as a cop) is an injustice at the scale of the entire jurisdiction. Statistics on the race of the victims aren&#x27;t actually necessary to get outraged. So your argument, at best, applies to the political framing of the subject rather than the core issue.')
