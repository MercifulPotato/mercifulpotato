That&#x27;s really weird, why wouldn&#x27;t they want to have the best performing, most powerful applications possible on the desktops? Because they can&#x27;t. Google as an organisation doesn&#x27;t have the mental capacity and patience to do real desktop programs.<p>Because it&#x27;s a waste of very expensive time to develop native desktop apps in 3 different platforms?')
