Everything is alien.  Even Microsoft&#x27;s own stuff doesn&#x27;t feel native any longer.  Every program I care about is based on some widget tookit&#x2F;framework that isn&#x27;t now and probably never will be whatever Microsoft is pushing this year, and Microsoft&#x27;s own software spans some unknown number of GUI evolution phases as well.<p>I used to think there was value in being well aligned with the native Desktop UI.  Now I don&#x27;t really know what that is any more and I no longer really care.  I care that a given application serves it purpose and the degree of an application&#x27;s alignment with the latest native UI trend is well down on my list of concerns.  Coping with the delta between applications is a small problem I try not to get hung up on.')
