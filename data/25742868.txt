I expect that such a theory&#x27;s proponents should be absolutely burning with interest in probing, studying and understanding what goes on at this peculiarly discontinuous boundary in Nature.<p>Those two things haven&#x27;t happened, which is kind of sad.<p>Quantum Mechanics predicts the results of experiments better than anything else.  If &quot;predicts experimental results&quot; is the only thing you care about, then Bohr was right, QM is complete, and there&#x27;s nothing more to be written in that book.')
