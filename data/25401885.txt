If you&#x27;re going to use a quantum model of light (which you have to to use the concept of &quot;photon&quot;), then you have to use the quantum interpretation of &quot;intensity&quot;. The quantum interpretation of &quot;intensity&quot; is the <i>probability</i> of detecting a photon; and this is a continuous quantity which can get smaller and smaller indefinitely without ever dropping to zero.')
