CBT, mindfulness,  etc - there are a lot of therapies that work VERY WELL. Especially (and this is anecdotal, from friends), combined with things like replacing alcohol with marijuana, reducing or eliminating caffeine, eating well (avoiding sugar &#x2F; white bread and other carbs), and getting regular exercise.<p>But we live in a sick society, where the above are often untenable.<p>Therapy? That&#x27;s 1:1, time intensive, and insurance abhors it if a pill can do the job.<p>Marijuana? Illegal, or expensive and over regulated when legal.<p>Exercise? Hard to do if you have long hours and a long commute.<p>Healthy food? Expensive, sometimes hard to cook. (I looked at an Indian recipe book for vegetarian ideas and many of the things I love, like palak paneer, are very labor intensive).<p>But put someone on antidepressants or other pills that are covered by insurance or purchased in generic? That&#x27;s a simple solution, so it&#x27;s what&#x27;s used, even as patients suffer HORRIFIC symptoms going off these meds when they do not work.<p>Imagine mustering the courage to ask for help, being given a pill that does not, and makes you have trouble doing the work that gets you insurance.<p>And then not to mention the therapists themselves - having to find the right one, and that&#x27;s if you just don&#x27;t mesh and don&#x27;t have a very bad experience.<p>I&#x27;d argue a lot of what we call &quot;depression&quot; or &quot;anxiety&quot; are actually quite normal responses to a sick system in desperate need of change and people are often &quot;nudged&quot; by the system to do the &quot;wrong&quot; thing then punished for following the path laid out for them.')
