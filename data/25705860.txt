I was doing pullups 3X a week, and I tried not overtrain by a very very gradual increase over months in an Excel-sheet-level programming, since the pandemic and I got a pull-up bar at home.  I was super careful.  And yet it happened - it&#x27;s called Golfer&#x27;s Elbow and it&#x27;s technically called medial epicondylitis, and it hella sucks.  It lasts many months, it doesn&#x27;t magically go away if you do nothing, because I think it&#x27;s due to a muscle imbalance (impossible to confirm that via online research, just anecdotal), and it&#x27;s very painful.  In the mornings I get a stinging elbow pain just by lifting a piece of paper or scratching my head.<p>So careful with the pullups.<p>Your cat cow with wrists flipped sounds very intriguing, I&#x27;m going to explore that.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that Yoga fixed you up.  Glad that helped and thank you for sharing.')
