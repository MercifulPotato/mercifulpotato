Solar panels (as in photovoltaic energy) is the worst &quot;green&quot; energy when accounting for waste and probably the one that caused the most cancer with children near zinc&#x2F;cadmium mines, but fear not, in the following years they will start killing people near landfills[0][1]. More wastefull in term of minerals too, but veolia might have something to say bout this (Best company working with renewable imo). Maybe in 50 years.<p>You can&#x27;t smelt rare earth without a lot of energy, whereas you can reduce iron and CaCO3 with hydrogen and make steel and cement almost carbon-free. And as Fe and CaCO3 are present almost everywhere, you also don&#x27;t have to globablize the production.<p>Ow, and if you evalutate the CO2 ton to be around 100$ (i think its at least 4 time this price), solar energy is twice as expensive to build and install as nuclear per kWh(and if we start reducing iron and cement with hydrogen, the difference will only grow). Thats only installed power, not produced power, also not counting energy storage.<p>I really like wind though and geotermic energy though, i think thermo solar is a good idea (not as good as passive) and maybe next gen solar won&#x27;t use as much rare earth. Also if you&#x27;re really interested, you should check how a power grid works.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S0048969720310962" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;abs&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S00489...</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;solar-panels-are-starting-to-die-leaving-behind-toxic-trash&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;story&#x2F;solar-panels-are-starting-to-die...</a>')
