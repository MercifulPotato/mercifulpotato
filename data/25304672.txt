I strongly agree that 4-5 hours deep work is a solid accomplishment in any office environment. Even on days where I spend 90% of my time in productive apps and don&#x27;t have any meetings, it&#x27;s still surprisingly difficult to pass 5 hours of productive time in an 8-hour work day. It&#x27;s amazing how much time disappears to things like lunch, bathroom breaks, &quot;quick&quot; phone calls, and other breaks.<p>That said, I think it&#x27;s a mistake to believe that there is an upper limit on productive hours in a day. I&#x27;m part of a mentoring group where I see this idea stated as fact by a lot of juniors. The catch is that they&#x27;ve all read different sources that put the upper limit at anywhere from 4 hours to less than 2 hours per day. This leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy where they stop trying to work after they&#x27;ve reached their pre-determined target, whatever that is.<p>When working alone or in isolation, I can often put in 10+ hours of measured, productive time in a day. The key for me is to do it in 2-hour chunks, with 1-hour breaks in between to recharge by playing with the kids, cooking and cleaning, exercising, and so on. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing this consistently for an employer, but it&#x27;s been a huge boost for hourly consulting and working on my own business.')
