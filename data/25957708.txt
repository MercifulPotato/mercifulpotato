Companies are not cells in a multicellular organism. They&#x27;re a totally different thing, and you can&#x27;t just drop context like that. Context-free reasoning by analogy is horrible.<p>To illustrate, I&#x27;ll give a more obviously and dangerously wrong example: humans are cells in the body of humanity, so therefore we should kill weaker and older humans for the same reason the body disposes of senescent cells.<p>See the problem?<p>That being said: there are definitely valid social criticisms of the idea that the only purpose of a company is shareholder value for the sake of shareholder value. This is part of why Elon has stated that SpaceX will not go public until they are flying to Mars; SpaceX has a purpose beyond just making money.')
