Interestingly, he explicitly mentioned Oracle v. Google, where Google&#x27;s use of Java APIs was considered non-transformative, but distinguished this case from that one.<p>Note that, like most cases involving novel legal issues, this is all but certain to be appealed by the losing party.<p>Also, the judge only granted summary judgement on Apple&#x27;s copyright infringement claim, not their DMCA anticircumvention claim, which he held involved a &quot;genuine dispute of material facts&quot; and thus would have to go to jury trial.')
