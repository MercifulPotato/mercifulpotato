A common sentiment among those who committed those property crimes was &#x27;no one listened to us before we started burning buildings,&#x27; and in this sense I have a sympathy for their claims. I don&#x27;t believe that the 2020 protests will ultimately be found to have been on the wrong side of history.<p>My grandfather, as an old old man, still referred to MLK as the &#x27;bane of the south.&#x27; In his time, the civil unrest of the Civil Rights movement was an unforgivable disruption to the lives of ordinary white folks, and...well, we all know 50 years later that this was such a trivial complaint in the face of the great progress made in healing a society still dealing with the ripple effects of a most monstrous institution, which our nation firmly embraced without hesitation upon its founding. We are still grappling with the fact that when my father was a boy African Americans had to enter through the &#x27;colored&#x27; entrance, and the song &#x27;Strange Fruit&#x27; was disturbingly still relevant. Remember Emmett Till was lynched in 1955. That&#x27;s not <i>that</i> long ago. The wounds are still raw.<p>The vast majority of protestors were peaceful, and the point of the protests was that law enforcement should no longer be able to commit violence with impunity against those without a voice.<p>Many, including myself, have expressed sorrow at the damage done to small businesses over the course of the civil actions. But, it&#x27;s good to see a robust and healthy willingness of the citizenry to turn out in order to oppose just the kind of targeting of the little guy that our friend from the former Soviet Bloc is concerned about.')
