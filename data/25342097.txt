The movie &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; was released in 1983, when I was 12 years old.   The movie and Yeager&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Yeager, and Autobiography&quot; were frequently consumed during my teenage years.    I often watch the right stuff right up to that moment that the focus shifts away from Yeager.<p>I learned plenty from Yeager&#x27;s story and his accomplishments.  I admired how he became a pilot in WWII, as a &quot;Flying Sergeant&quot;, how he worked to break the sound barrier, and how he sought combat commands in Korea and Vietnam.<p>Today, I am reminded of one minor anecdote that had a big impact.  In the book, Yeager describes the treatment he used to avoid permanent burn damage from his F-104 accident in 1963.  During college I crashed on my mountain bike and suffered road rash on the left side of my face.    The ER doctor advised me that I should expect permanent scars. Remember Yeager&#x27;s treatment for his face, I used the same (an alternating application of Vaseline and Hydrogen Peroxide).  The treatment left me with no scars, just as it left Yeager with no scars.<p>The lesson for me is that we can learn valuable knowledge in unexpected places, but we have to seek it out.   Having heroes, respected authors, interesting subjects, and&#x2F;or a focus of curiosity is a great way to learn and become inspired.   Chuck Yeager met many of these for me, from 1983 when I first found him, to recent years enjoying his Twitter feed.   He was a larger than life legend who encouraged me to be more daring, and saved me from permanent scars.<p>Godspeed General Yeager')
