Or anyone else? If this was just a gaffe factory then surely it would be a staple of the presidential interview genre, no?<p>That doesn&#x27;t even make sense! Biden <i>isn&#x27;t the sitting POTUS</i>. The question &quot;will you support a peaceful transition of power&quot; only makes sense when asked of a sitting POTUS, not an incoming POTUS. Biden doesn&#x27;t currently have any power which he&#x27;s required to transmit to Trump!<p>I know TDS can be a powerful effect, but surely you&#x27;re not asking me to believe (or to take seriously) that there&#x27;s someone else other than Trump who currently holds the position of POTUS.')
