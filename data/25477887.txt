And hence they try to build moats around their core businesses to prevent competitors from entering that market, or in the worst case, causing the entire market to become commodified. The form of that moat varies depending on what said core business is. One version is even mentioned in the article:<p>&gt; An\xadother way that I like to ex\xadpress that is “cre\xadate a desert of profitabil\xadity around you”. I once had a strat\xadegy pro\xadfes\xadsor de\xadfine the Google busi\xadness model some\xadwhat like that, where “Google tries to make every other busi\xadness around it free or ir\xadrel\xade\xadvant”…A desert of profitabil\xadity shifts con\xadsumers to you, and keeps com\xadpeti\xadtors away.<p>&gt; Wouldn&#x27;t a Zero to One &#x2F; Blue Ocean mindset be smarter?<p>So if you&#x27;re about to start a business, should you create a new market (becoming a monopolist in that market), or should you enter some existing highly competitive and commodified market? The answer sounds obvious. Once you do that, then the next question is how do you maintain your monopoly position within that market? See above.')
