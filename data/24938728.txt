Item(by='gnramires', descendants=None, kids=[24938782], score=None, time=1604027296, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24934722, text='Awesome, if you&#x27;re looking for another language that &quot;tries to formalize X&quot;, where X=&#x27;3D Rigid object&#x27;, look up OpenSCAD. You build complex shapes using primitives (using a descriptive language), but the idea is a bit different.<p>I like the mockup aspect of this: trying to capture functionality and abstracting away detailed looks or positions. I&#x27;m thinking of a system where mechanical ideas can be tried quickly to get a functional idea of whether they work, using a maximally abstract functionally-equivalent basis of elements.<p>I feel like common mechanical subsystems like cams (which, for example, allow a rod to follow an arbitrary velocity curve when you move a knob), gears, and other devices may be abstracted away by a simple primitive (plus something like a descriptive curve or function). Your system of &#x27;wagons&#x27; and &#x27;tracks&#x27; seems to achieve this, at least partially. It&#x27;s like when, in programming, we use a high level, abstract description of behavior. Perhaps it would be possible to analogously &quot;compile&quot; wagons, tracks and probes into actual mechanical elements like gears, cams, rods and shafts.<p>Abstraction is a powerful tool!
