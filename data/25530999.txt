All the campaigns leading up to the conversion ad aren&#x27;t profitable, then you make all your money on the conversion ad.<p>So advertisers actually intentionally target you repeatedly, most people it just annoys but for the subset of people that are actually interested in your product, it can work. Familiarity and repeated visibility seems to lead to a sort of trust for certain people.')
