Loved Turbo Pascal back in the day.<p>A port happened before didn&#x27;t it? I remember setedit and rhide about twenty years ago.  At that time I was desperate for a CUA editor under Linux.  So, I stripped down setedit and made my own simple editor in the tradition of dos edit and nano.  That worked for a number of years but the tvision? lib was removed from Debian and I couldn&#x27;t build the editor any longer.<p>Couple of years later I found the ne editor and that was decent, and two or so years ago found micro, which is better than I could do myself.  But these others are all missing that special something, the final polish of having a complete widget set like turbo vision.<p>Looks like this port got a lot farther on Unicode, awesome!  However, 16 colors?  Don&#x27;t think I can handle that any longer, just too spoiled.  And C++, am too lazy, haha.  Unlikely anyone is using DOS any longer, maybe freedos but still.  Also, windows console is in maintenance only these days.  Everyone is moving to Windows terminal and for good reason.  Focus on win console instead of full ansi support may be suboptimal, not sure yet.<p>All in all my dream would be to perhaps port Qt to a TUI or make a wxTerminal so we could write apps in Python as well.  Without funding though will probably never happen.')
