They don&#x27;t understand that culture is more important than they are, and it shows.<p>They know their place. They look at spreadsheets all day long, and they see that some money losing piece of culture is preventing the business from creating non-money losing piece of culture ... or making payroll.<p>&gt;It started with the chain bookstores. Used to be, getting in was the hard part, but once a writer got published, he stayed published.<p>It was great for the writer that got published, but not so great for countless others who couldn&#x27;t get a break and couldn&#x27;t get into the vaunted &#x27;club&#x27; of gatekeeping published writers.<p>&gt;Then there are the literary agents, who don&#x27;t even read 99 percent of the work sent to them<p>Because there are magnitudes more writers, than writers who can generate an income, and always will be. This is the long-tail that everyone was predicating at the advent of the web. Democratization of culture and media means that it will be much harder for most (except for the tiny few) from making any sort of living from it. You see this on Instagram, YouTube, Twitch streaming, and podcasts because the barrier of entry is so low, it means there are hundreds of thousands of people trying all the time (and those that fail at making an income, are replaced by fresh young faces willing to try). But it&#x27;s also true of more traditional media, like publishing.<p>&gt;I&#x27;m not surprised this is happening to Netflix<p>Neither am I. Every single series that Netflix invests means they have to pass on countless others. There is no other way to run this business. The funny thing is that early on with Netflix, when they did not have a lot of content, they would keep renewing unpopular series forever. As they ramped up production, they followed the same trajectory as traditional network channels like NBC&#x2F;ABC&#x2F;FOX.')
