Issues can only be caught after some disaster, as we see with Grenfell and the preventable tragedies behind every other regulation and certification board. Individual renters can&#x27;t conduct independent fire safety tests on the cladding and insulation of their (low income) housing, that&#x27;s absurd. Government regulation and testing for product safety is necessary for society to function, and there are <i>many</i> examples to this effect.')
