Item(by='troupe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610909705, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25810396, text='&gt; How many IPOs in the past 10 years have come from turning old doors into desks instead of going to Costco?<p>I know Bezos&#x27; perspective was that the door desks were a way of creating the culture he wanted in the company both for employees and for investors. A desk from Costco would probably cost $400 to $2000 whereas the cost of what you need for the materials for a door desk from Homedepot is $50 to $75. Having put together some furniture from Costco, I&#x27;d guess that the time spent creating a door desk is probably less than the setup time for a Costco desk. Folding tables might be another option in the same price point &#x2F; setup time as the door desk.')
