For example, steps are mostly pure Job spec, instead of defining its own subset of features.<p>I think it&#x27;s also more easily extensible than others if you want to trigger your pipeline in a different way. Sensors such as github-screener have a really simple event producing architecture.<p>One thing specific to github-screener is that it&#x27;s focused on pull mechanism instead of relying on public webhooks like most of the other tools do. So you can easily host your private CI&#x2F;CD without exposing a public endpoint.<p>(Edit) The reason I focused on having less of its own DSL because I ultimately saw how limiting it can be to have one. and it often end up as essentially a full featured language which is not reusable outside of the tool.')
