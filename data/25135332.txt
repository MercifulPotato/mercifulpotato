Some comments are alluding to the same issue from other perspectives, but I&#x27;m going to talk a bit about graph theory, because that&#x27;s where I first encountered it.<p>On a piece of paper, draw 5 nodes and make a fully connected graph. What shape does it have? Well, whatever way you drew it, the shape is quite recognizable and distinct.<p>Now on a piece of paper, draw 1 million nodes and make a fully connected graph. You can use a computer if you want. What shape does it have? You can&#x27;t tell, because all the lines are in the way? Alright, well what if we make 5 clusters, and represent them as nodes, and since it&#x27;s a fully connecte graph, you can just connect those 5 nodes fully. It has a recognizable shape again! Nice :) There is the tiny little caveat that you now have a cluster of nodes represented as one node, but what could go wrong?<p>More layers of indirection, that could go wrong. The more concrete stuff you have, the more you need to abstract away in order to maintain a high level overview, but the tradeoff is that while it is high level, it is less concrete (more abstract).')
