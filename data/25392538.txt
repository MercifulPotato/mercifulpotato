I&#x27;ve DDG for years, and I&#x27;m not sure whether their results have gotten much better, or I&#x27;ve trained myself to &quot;search the DDG way,&quot; or both, but I find what I want in almost all cases. When I (rarely) don&#x27;t, I try a !g search, and have never gotten better results. Not in years.<p>I believe you, I&#x27;m just saying that&#x27;s not my experience at all.<p>Meanwhile, I struggle to give up GDocs and remind myself to use Zoho instead.')
