At 2:00 pm it was $226, 2:05pm it was $431, and then came back down to $237 at 2:15pm.  That sort of volatility is, I think, unprecedented which means the market makers don&#x27;t have good risk models.  So you&#x27;re right that they could be cleaning up here with a large spread.  But that profit comes at unknown levels of risk.')
