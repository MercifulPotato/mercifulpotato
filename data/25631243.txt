We&#x27;ve already seen that googlers&#x27; voiced ethics aren&#x27;t humanitarian, just against the things bad enough to make them personally uncomfortable.  And a union is explicitly for the benefit of it&#x27;s members, not humanity writ large.<p>They&#x27;re going to continue happily building the world&#x27;s largest private surveillance system.  The most honest googlers I know are the ones that will admit they&#x27;re just there for the money and have real issues with google&#x27;s dealings.  I doubt we&#x27;ll get that level of candor from their union.  The union will be for everything that makes money but doesn&#x27;t get google bad publicity (just like google itself).')
