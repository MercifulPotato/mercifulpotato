Between a 2 and a 3, you&#x27;d rather learn from a 3. If you don&#x27;t need to learn, you&#x27;d probably rather work with a 2 than a 3. Basically, even if their mental model isn&#x27;t perfect, they deliver explanations that can quickly lead others to at least be as good as them and possibly better quickly if you can see the mistakes in their mental models (their descriptions could potentially be 100% accurate without it reflecting their poor mental model).<p>Anyways, this observation leads to the standard cliche, &quot;Those that can, do; those that cannot, teach.&quot;')
