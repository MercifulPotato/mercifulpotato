There are two reasons why this is actually bad for TSLA:<p>1. Tesla Motors makes money on regulatory credits that conventional automakers must purchase in order to offset their ICE vehicle production. That&#x27;s actually Tesla&#x27;s only source of profit. Unfortunately for Tesla Motors, those regulatory credits aren&#x27;t going to be in such high demand in a world where major automakers each produce hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles.<p>2. Tesla Motors doesn&#x27;t currently compete on things like build quality and fit&#x2F;finish, because the major factor determining whether you want to buy a Tesla is whether you want to buy an electric car. However, the time will come when you can get a mainstream electric car with the interior of an Audi, or the reliability of a Toyota, or the utility of a Ford truck. That competitive environment would be a wind shift for Tesla&#x27;s business, not to mention the amount of pressure that other automakers will put on Tesla&#x27;s autonomous driving features in court and with regulators.')
