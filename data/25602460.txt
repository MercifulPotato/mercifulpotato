This process has happened in the past and has enriched many old cities. By the same token, I&#x27;d also love to see blue-collar workers able to move back into cities where they work, but where they&#x27;re currently priced out of house ownership.<p>We might see a boom in commuting two or three days per week, and a growth in clusters of more localised communities, more like villages than cities. They might encircle a city made of a mix of business meeting places (office blocks) and the more bohemian&#x2F;blue-collar pockets I mention.<p>At least, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d like to see. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a prediction as such.<p>I&#x27;d also like to see desk- and office-rental businesses openly embrace this and explicitly move away from current models that encourage the corporate sterility seen in many modern cities, and towards an enriched, happier working environment.<p>I can hope!')
