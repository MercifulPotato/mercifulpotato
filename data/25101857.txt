I work on a very UI-heavy interactive app (it&#x27;s a gantt chart) for work and therefore have been doing react daily for 1.5 years.  React is probably making life a little easier here, and I don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t love it either.  If I didn&#x27;t love my team so much I would be looking for a job working on a more classic web app in Rails.  And when I profess my appreciation for Rails, I could just as easily be talking about Django, Phoenix, or any other _opinionated_ backend framework. [edited for spelling]')
