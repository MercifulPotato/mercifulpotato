Yep, Google&#x27;s own music product can&#x27;t communicate with Google&#x27;s own music player product.<p>The &quot;solution&quot; is to cast the tab. Which means lower bitrate, no music controls, and if you cast to a display device, the whole tab screencasts etc.<p>I guess it&#x27;s because nobody important uses the web anymore? Or something?<p>(Disclaimer: I work at Google. But not on YTM. Most Googlers I know have switched to Spotify, including myself.)')
