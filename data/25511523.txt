For me it would be incredibly interesting.<p>If we take that life plausibly &quot;started&quot; as as one single-celled individual who then &quot;reproduced&quot; through cell division (let&#x27;s call him Luca), then he&#x27;s effectively never died - in the same way that we consider ourselves to have not died despite regularly cycling tissues and cells.<p>All life as we know it, if viewed like that, is one organism whose chain of cell division has never been broken as he&#x27;s grown over billions of years. Variation between those cells (kingdoms, species, plant &#x2F; animal etc) become like skin, hair and brain &#x2F; liver cells within the human body.<p>It would be like taking a runner grass or banana tree and trying to draw a line around true individuals.<p>If we created life outside of that unbroken chain of cell division, we would have created something which is definitely &quot;other than Luca&quot; and that feels philosophically significant.')
