Which other copyleft licenses do you have in mind, and what advantages do they have over GPL-compatible licenses?<p>What strong copyleft licence do you know that is compatible with any <i>GPL</i>?<p>The <i>F.S.F.</i> indeed alleges that it was intentional, and perhaps it was, but every single strong copyleft licence is pretty much incompatible with every other — one must go out of one&#x27;s way to make them compatible and even it&#x27;s typically an asymmetric compatibility.<p>Advantages? They obviously do things differently and there&#x27;s probably a reason why big companies tend to craft their own licence rather than relying upon a template.<p>Examples:<p>- <i>Eclipse Public Licence</i>\n- <i>Mozilla Public Licence</i> 0.1 and 0.2\n- <i>Apple Public Licence</i>\n- <i>Common Development and Distribution Licence</i>\n- <i>GPLv2</i> — yes, it should be mentioned as an example<p>&gt; If you release your code under a permissive license, it&#x27;s basically guaranteed to be compatible with the future GPLv4, so you&#x27;re in that situation anyway.<p>You assume that the only option one have is <i>GPLv2+</i> or a permissive licence.<p><i>Linux</i> is simply released under <i>GPLv2</i>, exactly because Linus Torvalds and many others in it disagree with some of the <i>GPLv3</i> provisions; <i>ZFS</i> is simply released under the <i>CDDL</i>, and <i>FixFox</i> simply under the <i>MPL</i>.<p>They have their reasons to choose other licences than <i>GPLv3</i>, because they disagree with some of the provisions thereof.')
