I&#x27;m a &quot;drive straight thru&quot; kind of person, and road trips in my Telsa frustrate me.<p>A few times a year, I make a ~950mi drive in my 2017 MX 100D (~295mi rated, ~220 maybe at 75 mph).  In an ICE car its 13.5 hours of driving, and about 4.5 hours of charging.  I frequently find myself wishing I owned an ICE car when I&#x27;m on the trip.  Especially when the weather is cold, and I&#x27;m debating the range impact of turning the heat on vs 12 more hours of not being able to feel my toes.  Or when the supercharger is busy and it ends up taking 2x as long to get from 5% to 45% because I&#x27;m sharing... or the anxiety of trying to make it one more charger to be able to save time by charging 2% -&gt; 55% rather than 12% -&gt; 65% (to avoid charging past the taper..)<p>I&#x27;m hoping the new models coming with 500 or 600 miles of range improve this.  I&#x27;d probably only need to charge 3 times.')
