You buy the <i>best</i> stuff the first time, because you will usually save money over the long run. If you bought the cheap stuff first, and it didn&#x27;t work or didn&#x27;t last, but then bought the best stuff later, now you paid extra and wound up at the same place.<p>This doesn&#x27;t apply to everything, though. The boss I had who operated this way strictly decided he didn&#x27;t want the $80 video card in his computer, he wanted a $200 one (which back then was like buying a GeForce 3070 just to run spreadsheet applications on a single monitor).')
