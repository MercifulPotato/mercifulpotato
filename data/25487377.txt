It may have been problematic, but it&#x27;s not like there was no non-problematic answer to the problems at the time.<p>That position became unpopular after the short-term success of the following troop surge in Iraq (and the continuation of the <i>de facto</i> but less complete 2-way partition into a Kurdish entity and the rest of Iraq) resolved the immediate issues it was proposed in response to, but given the subsequent internal instability with regional involvement (the 2014-2017 civil war and the current internal instability and Iran-US proxy war in the country) driven largely by the internal conflict between Shia and Sunni groups outside of the Kurdish region and external intervention in that conflict, I don&#x27;t think the short-term success of the surge really vindicated it and the situation is sought to make concrete as the correct way forward.')
