But once you&#x27;re talking 2-3 moves, forget it.<p>Anecdotal but we have several (Expedit, the old Kallax) and they have survived 4 moves, one quite a distance and they are used daily to hold media and in a living room, one was part of my desk for 4 years. They are still in great condition. I expected 2 years out of them and am coming up on 10.')
