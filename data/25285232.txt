I did try, and picked up some phrases, but intermittent trips rather than a contiguous multi-year stay made it more difficult.<p>That said, the difference between Japanese and Latin languages does play into the &quot;foreign-ness&quot; I mentioned. My very bad high school&#x2F;college French is enough to feel comfortable deciphering a lot of Spanish and Italian, both written and spoken. Needless to say, that skill didn&#x27;t transfer to Japan.<p>Again though, I love Japan because you truly feel as if you&#x27;re in another culture. When I step off the plane in most countries, the first impression is sameness: same brands, same clothes, same affectations and language cadence. Flying to Japan truly feels like travel; I imagine it similar to going anywhere 100 years ago, before globalization (modulo British colonialism, of course).<p>It would be a heck of an adventure to commit to a few years&#x27; stay and really explore the country. I&#x27;d just want to do it with a partner to share the adventure with me.<p>I&#x27;m very happy you&#x27;ve had a great experience. I&#x27;m sure you will carry this with you regardless of where life&#x27;s journey takes you.')
