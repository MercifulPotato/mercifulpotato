Zoom was the only one at the time that offered a smooth connection regardless of the other person&#x27;s internet speed for decently sized groups. \nAlso their creepy hacks that open their so or the installer were universally panned on HN (for good reason) but it was the only way I could talk to my more senior members of my family without being on a forty minute phone call walking them through every step of the other companies&#x27; offerings<p>I&#x27;ve seen product updates from LINE touting their improvements and I assume the Skype team got yelled at for blowing it so bad at the beginning but there&#x27;s just no inertia for anyone to bother with something else until after the pandemics over. I&#x27;ve stopped looking. The company seems shady but I&#x27;ll take a product that works to be able to actually talk to friends and family in the short term.')
