This historical treatment is odd given that hardware\nand software have frequently determined which research ideas succeed (and\nfail). This essay introduces the term hardware lottery to describe when a\nresearch idea wins because it is suited to the available software and hardware and not because the idea is superior to alternative research directions.\nExamples from early computer science history illustrate how hardware lotteries can delay research progress by casting successful ideas as failures.\nThese lessons are particularly salient given the advent of domain specialized hardware which make it increasingly costly to stray off of the beaten\npath of research ideas. This essay posits that the gains from progress in\ncomputing are likely to become even more uneven, with certain research\ndirections moving into the fast-lane while progress on others is further obstructed.&quot;')
