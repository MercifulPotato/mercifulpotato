They&#x27;ve always been a pair of blocks with very few differing bits, such that the differences &quot;cancel out&quot; in the computation and the internal state is the same regardless of which of the pair is run through it. I suspect trying to create a colliding pair with differing lengths is much more difficult, since SHA1 also includes the length as part of the calculation.')
