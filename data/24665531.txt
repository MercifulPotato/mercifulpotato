Living with your parents is not the definition of childhood. The definition of childhood is not realizing rent and food cost large sums of money, or that credit systems allow you to purchase rent and food without money, or that houses can be bought with the bank&#x27;s money. I&#x27;d go one step further to say childhood ends when one realizes the fictional settings in books and video games are just linearly connected thoughts etched into their respective paper or magnetic mediums, but that&#x27;s another topic.')
