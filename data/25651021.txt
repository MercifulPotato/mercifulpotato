Item(by='kypro', descendants=None, kids=[25651598], score=None, time=1609880662, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25649314, text='I&#x27;d argue that it should be within our rights to have discussions about breaking laws we don&#x27;t agree with.<p>Last week a lot of people were disagreeing and openly discussing breaking the government rules about sending kids back to school which was tolerated by tech platforms. I strongly suspect it&#x27;s only because this example of disobedience isn&#x27;t seen as favourably by US tech leaders that they are targeting it.<p>Selective censorship seems to be the norm on YouTube though. It&#x27;s perfectly acceptable to push left-wing conspiracies or support violence and looting if it&#x27;s for a cause like BLM, while right-wing conspiracies or support of violence is quickly removed (perhaps rightly so).<p>I share your lockdown-related mental health struggles though. I&#x27;ve suffered with depression most my life and one of the few things that helps me is being out in nature, especially if I&#x27;m with friends and family. As someone with almost crippling anxiety it&#x27;s been quite nice not having to go into the office, but in general I&#x27;ve also found it very difficult this year. I was in quite a rough spot a few years back and the only thing keeping me going back then was the support of my friends. Although even then things could have gone either way. I guess I&#x27;m grateful this has come at a time I&#x27;m more mentally prepared to cope with it all, but I know it&#x27;s not been as easy for everyone.')
