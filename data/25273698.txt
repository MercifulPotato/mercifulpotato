Yes, you lose a lot of freedom. Your routine is different, travel is different. But they&#x27;re priceless and I would give up much more for any little moment with them.<p>It&#x27;s worth mentioning that sleep routine discipline for the kids is worth working towards. Not being free until 11pm is just crazy. We have friends who sit&#x2F;lie beside their kids for an hour or more until they get to sleep - insane.<p>Our kids are usually in bed at 7:30 and more often than not, we walk out after saying goodnight and don&#x27;t hear from them until the morning. If the eldest struggles to get to sleep, he goes out to the living room to read for half an hour and then goes back, but it&#x27;s nothing that would stop us watching TV elsewhere, working, doing dishes, etc. If the youngest sulks about sleep, being responsive&#x2F;attentive and caving to demands will not help you in the future.<p>Doing dishes as you cook is worth it. Cooking more so you have leftovers for the next night is worth it. Combining routine with play (kids help cook, help clean, etc) is useful. Those little helpful things add up and buy you time.<p>Another one is, if date nights are difficult to schedule (or babysitting expensive), work from home on the same day as your partner or work a four day week, and then go out for lunch while the kids are in school&#x2F;childcare.')
