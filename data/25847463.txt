The actual facts in this case indicate that it wasn&#x27;t common or accepted (as indicated by the fact that a major investigation was triggered and carried out), and in fact there&#x27;s no evidence that it occurred in this case. You&#x27;re now withdrawing to &quot;well, we can&#x27;t prove that criminal behavior didn&#x27;t happen&quot;. That&#x27;s true; we also can&#x27;t prove that the Clintons aren&#x27;t aliens. It doesn&#x27;t make your claims any less unsupported.<p>ETA: The relevance to today is that the same standards will likely apply to any pardons made by Trump this morning. If people paid other parties to lobby for a Trump pardon then it may not be illegal (as much as it&#x27;s terrible policy.) If direct payments to Trump or his businesses were made then it could be criminal behavior. There&#x27;s also precedent for appointing a special prosecutor to investigate it.')
