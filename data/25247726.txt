If the tutorial you chose is consistently unclear to you, pick a different tutorial. Use a variety of resources.<p>Which language kind of depends what you&#x27;re working on. Python is the lowest barrier-to-entry, probably, but for all I know you&#x27;re working on an iOS app and maybe Swift would be a better starting point since it&#x27;s more relevant to what you&#x27;re doing. Avoid Perl, probably.<p>Once you&#x27;ve got a handle on the general basics of a programming language, solve some basic problems. Use google to find a list of basic 101 programming challenges that suits you. Solve them.<p>Once you&#x27;ve got a handle on basic programming, try building a simple app of whatever nature you like. The classic example is a TODO reminder&#x2F;checklist app, but you can do whatever interests you. The goal should be to pick something that you definitely <i>don&#x27;t</i> know how to build, thus forcing yourself to learn how. It will involve a lot of googling but you&#x27;ll find yourself learning rapidly. You&#x27;ll feel it.<p>Lastly, StackOverflow is your friend.')
