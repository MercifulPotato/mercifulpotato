The  number  of  elderly  persons in  institutional  care  is  still  relatively  low  by  international  standards,  being  19.8  per  1,000  inhabitants  aged  65  or  older.&quot;</i><p>The key points are<p>- elderly care in Italy has always been in the hands of religious intitutions, that&#x27;s what the 43% of private non profit institutions are. (and that is honestly an entirely different can of worms, but a can of worms nonetheless. I could talk about what opus dei does here it for hours  ...)<p>- Italy is an old country, 25% of the population is &gt;=65, most of them are in relatively good health conditions, as the study confirms.<p>- only 22% of the long term beds for elderly are private for profit, usually they are for richer people, who want to separate themselves from the rest of us.<p>- in total, on 15 million elderly, only less then 300k are hospitalized and only 60k of them are paying.<p>- the vast majority of the elders are taken care of at home, if they are not self sufficient, the State gives the family an allowance to take care of them.<p>- the problem here is the opposite: many try to trick the State into thinking they need monetary help faking disabilities they don have.<p>Not counting that elders in Italy have pensions, all of them, regardless of the amount of retirement savings (savings here are mandatory, a minimum of 23% of the salary, of course more savings mean higher pensions, but with zero savings people still get a - fairly low - pension) , payed directly by the State, adjusted for inflation, and that we spend around 15% of our GDP in pensions.')
