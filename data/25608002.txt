In what ways can a recession be useful for forcing inefficient public-sector agencies to lay off redundant workers and reduce bloat?<p>&gt; Answer. None.<p>And keep in mind that academia might as well be considered public sector, but the idea transcends to most large-scale&#x2F;loosely-planned cost cutting for efficiency gain schemes.<p>Your starting point is a lot on individual virtue, and bad apples crowding out the good. I don&#x27;t disagree that some researches are better and some are worse, but I think that any &quot;cure&quot; is going to be gamed and worse than the disease.<p>&gt; but the largest will be that as funding becomes a scarce resource, a higher curation of both researchers and topics will come into effect<p>Do you have any evidence of this? I disagree in the strongest of terms. By my reckoning, curation, preventation, and other &quot;forsight-drive&quot; work is persistently undervalue by our society and economy. The nastiness that will accompany shrinking funding as research groups fight for <i>short-term</i> survival will only make that worse.<p>&gt; but the largest decrease in research will be those that are bullshit<p>Why would those who are the best at gaming incentives now loose that skill?<p>&gt; It&#x27;s been happening for years, centuries, as a basic economic cycle, and looks something like this: _&#x2F;T\\_&#x2F;T\\_&#x2F;T\\<p>So after centuries of Byzantine decline, there is new group of lean and mean Greek Constantinopolitan bureaucrats?<p>After the Spain grew rich on New World bullion and then poor with a dearth of industrialization there is a new generation of hyper-efficient factories putting Germany to shame?<p>I dunno what history you are reading, but the good actors never outlive the broken system and get the last laugh in mine.')
