You know, knock-off products made to look like something bigger&#x2F;higher quality but containing mostly air.<p>It is a shame though, since light can be very strong and high value. I personally wouldn&#x27;t want almost half a kilo of headphones on my noggin, and this article&#x27;s emphasis on weight is ... disappointing.')
