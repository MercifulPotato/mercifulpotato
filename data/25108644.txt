If we’re <i>really</i> talking about greatness, there should like 0.5% of HN that fit the bill, or something like that across the industry.<p>Reframe the question, who are our Bachs and Beethovens? Were they great because they created a lot of good work fast? Is good even enough? None of that shit defines greatness.<p>Our best developers came from open source. The stuff they made was undeniable. Is being super productive the same as making undeniably useful programs(languages, tools)?<p>Look at our greats and I think you’ll see they made a breed of work that sits outside workplace metrics of productivity, the same way a Hitchcock was genre defining.')
