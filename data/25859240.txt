Once you have a brain with a reward system, a good way to encourage (discourage) a behavior that is (dis)functional is to make it (dis)pleasurable.<p>A similar distinction in explanations of human behavior is what anthropologists call [emic&#x2F;etic](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Emic_and_etic" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Emic_and_etic</a>). The emic viewpoint is that of the subject themselves; the etic viewpoint is that of the anthropologist (the ethologist in this case). A classical, and beautiful example is Malinowski&#x27;s description of the [Kula ring](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kula_ring" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Kula_ring</a>) in Papua New Guinea. Participants in the ring see themselves as exchanging presents; Malinowski showed that there is a further political and economic significance to the ring. The two perspectives are perfectly compatible.')
