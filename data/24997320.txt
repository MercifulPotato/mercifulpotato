And when we were not able to sell, we thought It was because of lack of feature.</i><p>I mean, I&#x27;d naively think it to be true as well-- that not being able to sell (to target customers) would be usually be due to lack of features. If not that, what, you think, were some reasons Marketfox couldn&#x27;t?<p>&gt; <i>At some point we blindly started copying features, without thinking why we need to build it.</i><p>You mean Marketfox didn&#x27;t know if a missing feature (that a competitor had but Marketfox didn&#x27;t) was important &#x2F; critical but expended engineering resources on it anyway? If so, what you&#x27;d have done in its stead? How <i>else</i> you&#x27;d approach figuring out what to build?<p>Also, I am assuming Marketfox had access to founders&#x2F;mentors who had done SaaS before... why you&#x27;d think that didn&#x27;t make a difference (given your analysis that the mistakes you enumerated were avoidable)? What&#x27;d you, in the light of that, do differently?<p>Thanks.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=VU5CAVZ4hoA?t=8m30s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=VU5CAVZ4hoA?t=8m30s</a>')
