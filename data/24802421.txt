There are two really important questions to be asking when trying to figure out if the exodus of Silicon Valley is temporary or permanent.<p>1. Is the damage or outside stressors that are causing the exodus permanent? (I really hope not...)<p>2. Was there a natural cause (repeatable, will continue) for the previous abundance, or was it just momentum and luck that kept Silicon Valley as abundant as it has been.<p>Point number two I leave for discussion.')
