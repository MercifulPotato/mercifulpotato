ISP censorship is extremely dangerous because there are very few options and circumvention requires expensive physical infrastructure. YouTube not allowing certain videos on their site… doesn’t seem to me to warrant these histrionics, since there are multiple other channels for video distribution (Vimeo, Twitch, Dailymotion, BitChute, Periscope, Twitter, and Facebook all come to mind off the top of my head). And, if there were no other channels for video distribution, a $5&#x2F;mo server gets you one of your own.<p>Is it a huge bummer that we can’t have nice things and that the ‘free marketplace of ideas’ concept is fraying at the edges? Yes. Is this the end of the world, or even a slippery slope to a dystopia? Seems pretty unlikely. Distributors have always been allowed to choose what they will and won‘t carry; Barnes &amp; Noble won’t sell books published by Amazon[0], and you know what you can do? Just buy them at Amazon. YouTube won’t carry your video? Fine, post it somewhere else.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;business.time.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;02&#x2F;06&#x2F;in-latest-moves-barnes-noble-is-betting-it-can-compete-with-amazon&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;business.time.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;02&#x2F;06&#x2F;in-latest-moves-barnes-...</a>')
