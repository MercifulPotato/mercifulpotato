It&#x27;s enormously hard to get perspective on just how bad things would be if we had done something else. This is a perennial human problem. We are really terrible at counting the disasters that should have happened but didn&#x27;t.<p>The other thing is 2020 was enormously stressful. People under stress tend to look for something to blame. In the face of an event (like a pandemic) where they can&#x27;t control the actual source of the stress, they often look for a <i>scapegoat</i> in the form of something they feel they have some kind of control over.<p>Blaming it on working from home so you can be mad about this policy will tend to make people feel like &quot;This is someone&#x27;s fault and we could have done something different.&quot; and helps mitigate feelings of helplessness. Humans have a tendency to be more comfortable with righteous anger and looking for someone in authority to hold responsible than accepting that &quot;This just really sucks and was probably going to suck no matter what we did.&quot;<p>Am I happy with how things were handled? No, I&#x27;m not.<p>But I have long worked from home due to my medical situation, so I am disinclined to treat that aspect of this situation as the scapegoat I want to hang my angst and ire upon.')
