As others have noted, e2e was a novelty at the time, not a norm, and the platform itself was extremely new (less than a year old), and their stated reason for this was to protect against weak client RNG, which in retrospect sounds like a weak reason, but looking back at the news of 2013, this was right around the time the Snowden leaks caused everyone to believe RDRAND could indeed be compromised, so &quot;client having state-compromised RNG&quot; was indeed something on everyone&#x27;s mind.<p>Everything you said here was addressed by the OP.
