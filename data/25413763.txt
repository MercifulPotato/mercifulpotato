Item(by='Der_Einzige', descendants=None, kids=[25421714], score=None, time=1607922249, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25397628, text='It seems absurdly difficult as someone who didn&#x27;t have a wrenching father, to learn how to wrench.<p>I learned how to change my oil, change a tire, and do ultra basic shit like change the engine oil filter and head&#x2F;tail lights on my wifes 2014 ford fiesta. Outside of this, I&#x27;m SOL. Sure, I can youtube some of this - but not all of it.<p>I&#x27;d sometimes feel like I&#x27;d understand how cars work at some points after doing research and watching videos about my own car, and then I&#x27;ll hear someone talk about a part I&#x27;ve never even heard of. I don&#x27;t know where to even begin with learning the more fun parts of modding, or tuning. The fact that it&#x27;s apperently impossible to get proper workshop manuals now makes it feel like this industry is as hostile to DIYers as it gets.<p>I don&#x27;t know all the institutional knowledge to even begin with purchasing tools. Apparently I want to avoid harper-freight jack-stands (as the common meme goes) because they are very likely to fail and crush people. I&#x27;m concerned that not knowing enough about automotive memes may get myself killed one day. I don&#x27;t know what I don&#x27;t know and it scares me.<p>It&#x27;s doubly bad because the automotive industry is especially full of frauds and cheats. They don&#x27;t call them &quot;stealerships&quot; for nothing.  Mechanics are extremely unsavory (even the &quot;good&quot; ones) and I do not feel comfortable letting other people do work on my vehicle. Anecdotal stories of work conditions within dealer repair shops give me further reasons to be uncomfortable.')
