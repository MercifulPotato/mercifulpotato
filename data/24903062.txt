Between my bookish nature and some terrible gym teachers, I loathed it. But once I moved to San Francisco, everybody was so healthy here! So I decided to try it out.<p>For quite a while, I&#x27;d start on something like running. I&#x27;d do it doggedly but in retrospect too intensely. Each time, it was kinda awful. Eventually my motivation would run out and I&#x27;d quietly drop it.<p>But now my approach is that my first goal should be enjoying it. For example, after an injury I stopped all exercise for 6 months or so, and was totally averse to returning to it. Eventually I grabbed my laptop and just went on a long walk, stopping at coffeeshops, restaurants, bookstores, etc every time I felt my enjoyment flagging. After doing that a few Sundays in a row, I shifted away from the stops, making it a pure long walk. Again, focused on enjoying it. Then I added bits of running here and there, upping the challenge until I was back doing a 7.5 mile long run every Sunday.<p>I apply the same lesson to learning new technologies. Every time I dive into some new language or toolkit, I find it easy to get intimidated. So I structure it as a series of small, rewarding increments. I pay attention to when I&#x27;m tired or too frustrated, taking breaks and rethinking my approach so it ends up as a sequence of small rewarding moments.<p>I think the same lesson lies behind Kanban approaches for teams as well. Small units of value moving quickly though a pipeline become very satisfying. It turns the work week into a series of modest accomplishments that over the long haul add up to real results, building good habits along the way.<p>Is that helpful?')
