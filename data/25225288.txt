If it were legally available then maybe more people that would use it casually would emerge than if it were illegal, and the number of negative experiences would increase. From what I understand, it&#x27;s best to have a good mindset and have someone else knowledgeable of the substance to guide you through the process, otherwise it isn&#x27;t as effective or harmful to the psyche.')
