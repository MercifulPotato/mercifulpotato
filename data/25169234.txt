I don&#x27;t much like my work office.  It&#x27;s on the top end of &#x27;good&#x27;:  spacious, well equipped, light, modern, free snacks, etc.  But... and it&#x27;s a big but, it&#x27;s open plan.  And noisy.  With people eating at their desks, talking, interrupting you and so on.<p>But I still miss it.  The last nine months has taught me that whilst I work fine from home, I thought I&#x27;d be completely happy like that, but I&#x27;m not.  And I&#x27;m surprised by that.  I want to go back to the office, but not for 9-5, 5 days a week.  Once a week will be fine.')
