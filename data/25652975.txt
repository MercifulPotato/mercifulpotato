The 767s Amazon is acquiring are ex-Westjet (previously Qantas) and Delta passenger aircraft, and likely last saw a Boeing factory somewhere around 15-25 years ago.<p>That said, Alaska just put in another order for MAXes, and Ryanair is buying more as well. Part of why these 767s were available for Amazon to purchase at all were due to the industry model shifting and airlines favoring single-aisle, fuel-efficient aircraft like the MAX. COVID-19 has only accelerated that, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see more MAX orders unless it crashes again or Airbus ramps up their 320neo production.')
