Item(by='xienze', descendants=None, kids=[25337322], score=None, time=1607373438, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25336769, text='&gt; Easy access to nature means I can go on a scenic five-mile hike between lunch and dinner.<p>So can I, as I mentioned there&#x27;s a major state park within the city limits where I live...<p>&gt; It means I can see a beautiful view without planning a day trip.<p>Incredibly vague and subjective.  What constitutes a &quot;beautiful view&quot;?<p>&gt; I can meet with groups of friends of all fitness levels and enjoy a pleasant afternoon outdoors where we all have fun.<p>Not unique to the SF Bay Area at all.<p>Again I think this is very much a cherry-picked definition of &quot;easy access to nature&quot; that is designed to preclude any place not named &quot;SF Bay Area.&quot;  Still, the kinds of things you were describing can be found in metro areas all over the country.')
