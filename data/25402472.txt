Daily, I see much more abrasive blogs on HN: instead of lampooning them for asking GitHub to be better, they are not rarely lauded for their &quot;brutal honesty&quot; while often straight-up insulting the blog&#x27;s target.<p>This is not meant to criticize you, OP, personally. Rather, I just want to point out a structural double standard.')
