Usually shell scripts have <i>more</i> dependencies,  and even worse, they are implicit since Bash provides no mechanism for managing dependencies. Programs like sed, awk, grep, cut, paste, curl, jq, gzip, tar, etc. These are all separate dependencies, usually in separate packages (some are grouped together into coreutils), supporting different feature sets between distributions and OSes. All of those can be replaced with the Python standard library.<p>Bash itself is pretty anemic and isn&#x27;t very useful without gluing together external programs, which is its raison d&#x27;etre after all.')
