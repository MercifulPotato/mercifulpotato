Item(by='astrange', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611374255, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25876830, text='&gt; I tried to find some numbers on the relative amount of chips in a standard ICE car vs. a BEV. I&#x27;d have to guess BEVs have perhaps even an order of magnitude more chips. Certainly, they have chips that are far more advanced, looking at the Tesla FSD computer[0].<p>Well, you could have FSD in an ICE car just as easily.<p>In fact, I&#x27;m going to guess an electric vehicle has fewer chips than an ICE car because it doesn&#x27;t have an engine. Depends how many PMICs you need for the battery cells.')
