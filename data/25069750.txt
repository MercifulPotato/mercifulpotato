I’ve been fine with 16gb on Ubuntu with a Dell XPS 13 for VS Code&#x2F;Python&#x2F;PostgreSQL for what most people call CRUD work. Android development has been a little painful with both Android Studio and device emulation slowing things down but still workable.  Otherwise I’ve had no problem with web app style work on large projects. Honestly I’d prefer 32gb for those things (and to “future proof”) but I need a Mac dev environment for early 2021 and will  probably go with the MacBook Pro 16gb unless the reviews or benchmarks on things I actually do look poor.')
