A FET dissipates the least heat when it&#x27;s fully on or fully off. Operating in the resistive regime will result in orders of magnitude more dissipation.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to over-come that, particularly because it&#x27;s not a comparison between &#x27;analogue v 64-bit float&#x27;, but &#x27;analogue versus 8-bit int&#x27;. (it&#x27;s tough for scale analogue circuits to operate even when 8-bit accuracy).')
