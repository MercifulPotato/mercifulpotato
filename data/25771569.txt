No more rigid db schemas, primary keys, or trying to cram “one or many” connections in to a column.<p>Shoutout to Neo4j and APOC, as well as to one of my inspirations: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neo4j.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;building-graph-history-codex&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;neo4j.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;building-graph-history-codex&#x2F;</a>')
