Item(by='cgrealy', descendants=None, kids=[25022924], score=None, time=1604804651, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25021843, text='&gt; there&#x27;s nothing that&#x27;s going to stop climate change except the free market agreeing to pursue sustainability.<p>That is exactly the attitude that got us into this situation in the first place.<p>The free market will NEVER voluntarily choose compliance costs. The value simply isn&#x27;t there.<p>The free market is an engine to optimise profit. That&#x27;s it. All other considerations are secondary.<p>While there is a market niche for &quot;ethical products&quot;, that is ultimately (and somewhat ironically) unsustainable without regulation.<p>If I start a business behaving ethically, using renewable energy, paying my employees and suppliers a fair wage, etc... my only hope is that I can attract a niche market that will pay a premium for that. But history has shown us that is simply not the case.<p>Regulation levels the playing field. Otherwise, we would still have child labour, weekend work, dangerous working conditions, etc.<p>As for the argument that other countries will ignore this:\n1: other countries AREN&#x27;T ignoring this. The US is the one that pulled out of Paris\n2: The US is the still the biggest economy in the world. If the US government imposed regulations that all business must act in a sustainable fashion (including the supply chain) the rest of the world would have to follow through.')
