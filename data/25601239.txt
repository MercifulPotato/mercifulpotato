The Telecaster and Stratocaster were very popular, but it&#x27;s very tough to pick them out in a recording from other types of electric guitars. Hammond Organs are distinct and popular, but nowhere near as ubiquitous as the DX7.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=JTTC_fD598A" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=JTTC_fD598A</a>\n[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zXRLozwejDk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zXRLozwejDk</a>')
