They are, and always have been, for the benefit of Google and the advertisers. Google wants you to believe that advertisements are an inevitable, unavoidable feature of the web, despite the fact that they didn&#x27;t want to be in this business when they started the company. They even go so far as to tug at your heart strings to and say how &quot;hard&quot; they work to make sure their product is &quot;safe, unobtrusive, and as relevant as possible,&quot; implying that capturing your attention to part you from your money effectively is the ideal outcome. [0]<p>This is gaslighting. Interest-based advertising on the web is not an immutable feature, a naturally occurring phenomenon. It&#x27;s a scourge invented to further surveillance capitalism and it must be abolished.<p>All this is to say, I&#x27;d change your letter to say:<p>Dear Advertisers:<p>Stop tracking me or I&#x27;ll block you entirely at every turn. Your business model does not concern me. My attention is not for sale. Change, or be regulated out of business.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;policies.google.com&#x2F;technologies&#x2F;ads?hl=en-US" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;policies.google.com&#x2F;technologies&#x2F;ads?hl=en-US</a>')
