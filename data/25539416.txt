Who was defining what was &quot;good&quot;? There isn&#x27;t some abstract, mathematically verifiable best ranking, a platonic ideal that all search engines should aspire to. Google has always made choices about how to rank that trade off the interests of various groups of users, from the very beginning. The complaints that you and I have about pinterest being ranked so highly come because Google has decided that our desires for how the results should look are not important enough compared to how other, perhaps larger, groups of users want them to look. Maybe Google deranks pinterest tomorrow, but they&#x27;ve made the choice to keep it as such for a couple years now. Whether it&#x27;s because they think they have better ways to spend their time or because they like it the way it is, it&#x27;s not really possible for us to know without somebody leaking that information. But, I imagine, there would be a group of people who would be as disappointed as we are elated if Google were to change this.')
