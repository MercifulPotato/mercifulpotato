We don&#x27;t even need to grace these collective nouns with words like <i>fact</i> for them to still be fun. There isn&#x27;t really a &#x27;fact of the matter&#x27; as to whether there&#x27;s <i>really</i> such a thing as a &#x27;parliament of owls&#x27;; it&#x27;s just a fuzzy matter of adoption in the English language.<p>I think of it more like knowledge of your favourite TV show, or fiction book. There&#x27;s a sense in which it&#x27;s &#x27;real knowledge&#x27;, and a sense in which it&#x27;s not, but the point isn&#x27;t for it to be useful.')
