Nobody looks at enron&#x27;s abuses and says corporations are blanket bad (okay, many do, but not most). Nor do they say enron&#x27;s abuses were fine because corporations as a whole benefit society. Most look at enron and say corporations have the potential to do good or bad, so let&#x27;s figure out how to keep them from going bad.<p>It&#x27;s not unions good or unions bad. The focus should be on how to get unions that don&#x27;t lead to the abuses people are afraid of. When it comes to unions, the discussion seems to be much more take-it-or-leave-it.')
