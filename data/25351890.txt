I hadn&#x27;t considered that. Using geoIP mode would also be worth investigating. I&#x27;ve often found geoIP to be quite inaccurate when on cellular networks (e.g. reporting that I&#x27;m in San Jose when I&#x27;m actually in Los Angeles). Any thoughts about that?<p>&gt; It&#x27;s too bad you can&#x27;t force location services to only use built in GPS vs pinging their internet servers.<p>My understanding is that on Android if you only use the platform location services instead of the Google Play Fused Location Provider, it will only access satellite positioning (GPS, GLONASS, etc.). It will also use up your battery faster, but I think that&#x27;s tangential. So, at least on Android, I can code a path to only use location services.<p>&gt; Apple also has an issue where they silently stop location tracking apps in the background, you might have to make a nag notification<p>That has been a real pain in my side on iOS and Android. So many deceptive apps have abused the location system for so many years, that Apple (especially) and Google are making legitimate use cases of background location very inconvenient. I can&#x27;t say I blame them either.')
