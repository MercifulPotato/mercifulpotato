This circumstance could come about as a result of external stimuli (or lack thereof), or through some imbalance or other more internal issue. I think the technical terms are something like situational depression vs clinical depression.<p>Even with situational depression, a fresh perspective can often give people the bit of confidence and hope that they need to proactively break depressive cycles.')
