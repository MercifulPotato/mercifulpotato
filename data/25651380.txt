We&#x27;ve had the JVM for decades, and it even has a GUI layer, it&#x27;s just a much less powerful GUI layer than today&#x27;s web.<p>People have been trying to create a simple, native, platform-agnostic GUI layer for as long as GUIs have existed. Nothing but the web has ever come close to succeeding. It may be a flawed solution, but it&#x27;s what we have, and it works, and I wouldn&#x27;t hold my breath for a greenfield alternative supplanting it any time soon.')
