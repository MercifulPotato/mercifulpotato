There are already hundreds of state changes that must be rolled back: all of the succeeding entries in the ROB.  So the work performed by the recovery mechanism isn&#x27;t changed by the amount of clobbered state because it is completely clobbered!  The ROB must rewind it all.<p>The register file doesn&#x27;t need any additional ports, because the fault recovery mechanism doesn&#x27;t touch the physical registers.  It only updates the register alias table (RAT) to point to the appropriate registers.  But that machine must be capable of restoring 100% of the register pointers very quickly no matter what.  Whether the faulting instruction touched one, two, or 16 registers doesn&#x27;t matter.  The 100+ updates following it are enough state that the answer must be: &quot;Everything&quot;.')
