If possible, keep them far apart on the spectrum. If not, differentiate them some other way, such as by intensity or saturation.&quot;</i><p>Because <i>&quot;keep them far apart&quot;</i> on the spectrum might not be helpful when taken litereally, here is a link to Lines of Confusion Diagrams im CIE 1932 color space.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.color-blindness.com&#x2F;2007&#x2F;01&#x2F;23&#x2F;confusion-lines-of-the-cie-1931-color-space&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.color-blindness.com&#x2F;2007&#x2F;01&#x2F;23&#x2F;confusion-lines-o...</a><p>&gt; <i>&quot;Second, use other cues if possible. Color is complex, so if you can add another component to a line on a graph, such as a dashed versus dotted pattern, or even good labeling, that helps a lot.&quot;</i><p>I find this easier said than done. My issue with alternative cues is that they often introduce a form of unintentional order or hierarchy. For example: When I want to plot two different variables and I want to avoid that one of them appears more important than the other I can do this nicely with color.<p>Other line attributes are not so easy. A solid line will always seem more important than a dashed or grey line and a dashed line more important than dotted one. Trying to change the dash and dot pattern so that they have similar grey values makes them hard to distinguish. I find color is the easiest way to distinguish things without introducing unintentional order.')
