If you say religion can&#x27;t be fact based and aren&#x27;t open to any alternate view that&#x27;s scientific cultural dogma, in my opinion but also that&#x27;s dogma by definition. If science can have dogma, then it has at least one similarity to religion which establishes a resemblance.<p>I&#x27;ll give an alternate definition of religion that I think is compatible with a scientific world view rather than oppositional: religion is an ancient applied science of managing authority and consent in large groups of people. That&#x27;s the reality it dealt with, just as modern science might deal with materials or biology.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to give you a hard time. This topic is very difficult to talk about given the intense factions around it. But that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important to talk about it even if it makes folks mad at you initial. Sorry if I irritated you.')
