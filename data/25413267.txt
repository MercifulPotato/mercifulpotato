In the best case, I can choose “1” to be my password, and no one will ever guess it.<p>In the worst case, we assume that the attacker has done their home work and knows the algorithm by which the password was generated, but not the content of this particular password. So, knowing the algorithm, what can the attacker exploit that would help them discover the contents of this password in the shortest possible time?<p>I submit that the worst case analysis is really the only one we care about.')
