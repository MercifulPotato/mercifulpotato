Web apps are implicitly assumed to have internet access.<p>This should be fairly obvious, and the notion of granting more local access to arbitrary outsiders should be distressing. The fact that google and web sites feel entitled to everything on and about you computer says a lot about them. If they were humans with that lack of boundaries and sense that what&#x27;s yours is theirs, we&#x27;d label then narcissists or psychopaths (not sure which).')
