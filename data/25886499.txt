It is known that it often is sufficient to reach a real human at Facebook or Google to find out it was a false positive and unban you. But actually reaching a real human who would check your case consciously and competently is extremely hard - you have to know one personally or pay some agency (the lowest price quote I have seen was $500) and hope for the best.<p>What actually seems going on here (as well as on YouTube with copyright stuff) is a wild misuse of AI technologies. Like if the police was giving people life sentences just because they had a weird accent or suspicious face triggering a neural network signal - perhaps deploying such measures on global scale could help catch a lot of murderers but undoubtedly it would also ruin many innocent people and this can hardly be considered OK.<p>So we don&#x27;t even have to regulate Facebook in particular, just regulate large-scale AI usage.')
