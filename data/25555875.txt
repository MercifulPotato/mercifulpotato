The fact that the US and Europe as a whole are roughly comparable proves this simply can’t be correct.<p>“Dismissing other countries because “The entirety of NZ has a population comparable to the size of a large metro area in the US” is the problem. Start fixing that attitude..”<p>I’m not dismissing other countries.  What I’m dismissing is this claim of a fix that everyone else is applying and that the US is not.<p>You mention strawmen in another part of the thread,  presumably you must realize that the idea that California’s problems stem from an ‘attitude’ is a strawman.<p>As I point out elsewhere, the entire message you are delivering here is to attack America with this strawman and claim (now) that <i>almost everyone</i> else is governing better.<p>When asked for a single idea about <i>how</i> others are doing better, you simply say ‘look at other countries’ and admit that this is a vague handwave.<p>Have you considered asking people <i>why</i> they think there is nothing better?  You might discover they have different values to you.<p>Drilling down on policy would be much more meaningful than claiming America’s problems stem from an ‘attitude’ you don’t like.')
