When selecting by individual characters&#x2F;lines, I&#x27;d much rather use my keyboard and know that for each keypress I&#x27;m interacting with some X amount of text than fumble with my mouse until I get exactly what I want selected. Vim keybindings specifically are nice because they provide a pretty universal interface - most applications I use implement Vim keybindings, so there&#x27;s very little context switching when working with my IDE, CLI file browser, Firefox w&#x2F; Vim Vixen, etc.<p>Also, I find that preventing constant movement from the keyboard to my mouse and back helps mitigate wrist pain and discomfort from long sessions at my PC.')
