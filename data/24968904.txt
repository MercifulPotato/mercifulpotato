It&#x27;s admissible because someone testifies under oath that they have personal knowledge of its provenance. The burden is on the party introducing the evidence to show that it&#x27;s reliable, and the question of whether or not it is indeed reliable is a factual one for a judge or jury to answer. It&#x27;s not assumed to be &quot;true&quot; or to accurately reflect reality just because it&#x27;s a purported photo, video, or audio recording.')
