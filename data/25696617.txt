This press release links to the executive order, which is still in force: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obamawhitehouse.archives.gov&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2013&#x2F;02&#x2F;22&#x2F;expanding-public-access-results-federally-funded-research" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;obamawhitehouse.archives.gov&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2013&#x2F;02&#x2F;22&#x2F;expandi...</a>.<p>The policy allows journals to generally have a one-year embargo, and agencies are allowed some latitude in how they implement the order, but most new federally funded research should become freely available on places like PubMed (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;</a>) after embargoes expire.')
