I can&#x27;t sit down for more than 15 minutes at a time and lately even standing at my sit&#x2F;stand desk causes too much pressure on my spine. I have to lay down most of the day and change positions every couple minutes. I am so afraid that I will never be able to work even a part time job because sitting at a desk for 20 hours a week would be torture. I really, really hope things like adaptable workstations like this improve in the future, because it&#x27;s the only way someone with my issues will ever be able to work.')
