To get significantly more than 2K after taxes here as a new grad would put you in the top 10% of devs your age, definitely not the norm in the industry or in Europe.<p><i>&gt;An MBA graduate makes €90k+ annually in Denmark. </i><p>Do you have a source for this? Because if you do then it would be best for me to give up my dev job in Germany and become an MBA in Denmark. Not &#x2F;s, but quite serious.')
