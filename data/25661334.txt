LA Care is a rare &quot;public option&quot; run by LA county. When I switched from Oscar to LA Care this year, I did so because both UCLA and Cedars showed up as &quot;in network&quot; for LA Care. And when they assigned a UCLA clinic physican down the street as our primary, I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. But I knew not to celebrate prematurely, and I was right. LA Care did pull through, and our appointment this morning went great. I&#x27;m still holding my breath until I see the bill and it&#x27;s not wrong.<p>I checked the LA Care provider directory yesterday, and there were no Cedars doctors. I can only assume there&#x27;s something up with that.<p>I had Blue Cross a few years ago, and I still have PTSD from the three way call between them and Covered California where their rep flat out contradicted an email they had sent me, even after I read it out word for word. She was also trained to not help me. This training is ass-backwards.')
