What are you assuming the protestors would have done if the police weren’t deployed?<p>&gt; I just hope people like you die out before this country is irrevocably harmed, and your children don&#x27;t carry your sickness to a new generation.<p>This is a pretty radical statement. I’m actually a center left liberal and you’re wishing that I die simply because of a fact I brought up that refutes your narrative. Can you substantiate your claims that I’m causing harm to this country by citing facts? How did you get this radicalized?')
