But subsidized by negative energy prices during excess production. So rather than bleeding money while someone else makes profits any power company will prefer to build less overcapacity (which also avoids risking devalued assets) and run their own peak-shaving if they can.\nWhich means this problem still has to be solved one way or another. Whether you call it long-term storage or excess energy use.')
