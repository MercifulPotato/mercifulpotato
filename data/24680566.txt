The quote says that the problem is that those subsidies were used for <i>horizontal development</i> (i.e. sprawl), which rapidly expanded the infrastructure. You are correct that future maintenance wasn&#x27;t budgeted, but if the city had expanded vertically (i.e. denser urban cores), the infrastructure costs wouldn&#x27;t have risen quite so dramatically.')
