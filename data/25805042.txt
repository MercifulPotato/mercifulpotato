If the letter of the law was followed in its actions, an organization&#x27;s liability should be protected as provided by corporate law.<p>Obviously, bankruptcy also isn&#x27;t meant to allow jurisdictional avoidance. But the NY AG&#x27;s actions are themselves a legally questionable means of pursuing a political motive, for which they are skirting the spirit&#x2F;intent of the law.<p>And they certainly fit the spirit&#x2F;character of an overly aggressive creditor, if not the letter.<p>Which results in a potentially interesting dilemma for the NY AG- claim interest in the case as some kind of a creditor, which might afford NRA relief from them, or claim sovereign interest as a state, which might preserve since of their legal claims, but sideline them until the federal bankruptcy proceedings are over (with NRA emergence from protection in Texas).<p>From a practical&#x2F;ethical perspective, if NY&#x27;s pursuit&#x2F;prosecution is just in NY, it should also be just in Texas.<p>If NY can&#x27;t pursue the same prosecution, (or the same equitable relief) once the NRA moves, is that not an implicit admission of misusing jurisdictional authority?')
