Then that basically really proves the existence of paradoxes. It doesn&#x27;t disprove the existence of all other kinds of statements, of course.<p>A statement &#x27;x == 1&#x27; might be contextual (with a free variable x), but I think the theory is talking more about statements like<p><pre><code>  for all x\n  (x + 1)^ 2 == x^2 + 2*x + 1\n</code></pre>\nwhich <i>is</i> true and does not depend on x. Contrast that with<p><pre><code>  for all x\n  x == 1\n</code></pre>\nwhich is obviously false.<p>But the proof outlined in the article constructed a statement with a free variable, where a substitution with a certain value leads to a statement which is neither true, nor false. That means that the general statement in the proof&#x27;s example is neither true nor false either.<p>Sorry about the awkward terminology, BTW, my engineering degree was a decade ago and in a language other than English.')
