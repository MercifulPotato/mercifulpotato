But how do you improve the return in this scenario?<p>&gt; This is the same reason that a 60&#x2F;40 stock-bond portfolio has massively outperformed 100% stocks historically<p>How is this possible? If I invest 100% in stocks, my return after 10 years is higher than 60&#x2F;40 stock-bond. So why do you say the latter outperforms it?')
