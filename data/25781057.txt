Good top soil produces fertilizer itself, so growing the same yield on less acreage means higher fertilizer usage which means less efficiency, not more. Not to mention corporate farmland is more likely to grow monoculture crops and do less crop rotation, which also increases fertilizer usage and decreases topsoil depth.<p>Corporate farming COULD be more efficient, but in common practice it is not.')
