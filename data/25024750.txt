I gave sources for a reason.<p>It&#x27;s obvious why COVID-19 would have killed more people this year than a typical flu season: more people can get infected, because it&#x27;s a novel disease which we have no prior immunity for. Additionally, infections are likely to be more serious, as immunity isn&#x27;t a binary. Meanwhile the various viruses and virus strains that we call &quot;the flu&quot; has been around our whole lives.<p>But the fact is, if you do get infected with the flu, and you&#x27;re young (particularly children), you&#x27;re roughly as likely to die as if you get infected by COVID-19.<p>&gt; I personally absolutly don&#x27;t mind sitting around for a year to wait this out. I only have one live and i don&#x27;t want to have covid right now nor any long term issues from it.<p>You are welcome to make that decision for yourself. But remember, others&#x27; will have different priorities. My job is mostly unaffected, so far. Other people I know have lost their businesses and careers. I personally know some people involved in food aid in poorer countries: people are literally starving to death due to lockdown.<p>The COVID-19 infection fatality rate by age is approximately the same as overall mortality by age. It shouldn&#x27;t surprise people that many people would decide that they&#x27;re willing to take that risk, especially when we have examples like Sweden, New York City, large parts of India, etc. to show that even uncontrolled spread is not an existential threat to society, and herd immunity kicks in and things go back to normal. (antibody testing has found about 20-30% of Stockholm, 30-50% of NYC, etc. has been infected, most without realizing it)<p>&gt; Covid showed something quite interesting to me: You are better of in dooms day scenarios if you can sit it out a little bit.<p>You are lucky to be in a position where you can do that. A significant chunk of society can not. And the fact is, very few places in the world have been able to control COVID-19 without indefinite lockdown. It&#x27;s just too contagious in most societies.')
