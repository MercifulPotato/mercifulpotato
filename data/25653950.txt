As confidence gets stronger, more people volunteer.  Eventually, third party labs (maybe regulators like the FDA - maybe NGOs like the UL) certify that they believe a vaccine is safe and effective, which makes even more people comfortable getting it.<p>If we had done that, how would life be different now?  Could we have closed fewer things?  Would more people have led a more normal&#x2F;less stressful lives?  Would we be closer to being done with this mess?  How many fewer long-term ramifications (health, financial, social, developmental, psychological, mortal) would people have to deal with?<p>We reconsidered, reenvisioned, and reinvented so many things this year.  Why can&#x27;t we apply that same mindset here too?')
