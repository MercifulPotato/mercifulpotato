Item(by='ACow_Adonis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611528546, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25894533, text='for those outside the US, based on my quick google: PTO means &quot;paid time off&quot; and FMLA I think means &quot;family and medical leave&quot; (the abbreviation is for the family and medical leave ACT).  FMLA provides provisions to take UNPAID leave. PTO seems to cover both holidays and paid sick leave.<p>Please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong any US person.<p>I&#x27;m guessing from the context of getting VP approval for 15 days compared to my wife who took off a year in approximate half-pay through various combinations of annual leave, maternity leave,  and long service leave and gov payments that the talk of not bumping into shadow limits has to do with cultural expectations of how much leave you&#x27;ll take and that you&#x27;ll be soon back to work rather than actually they&#x27;re being no shadow limits.  By which I mean my wife&#x27;s actual case would so obviously hit up against any shadow limit that practically no one would try it on,  but I&#x27;m happy to be educated on that too...<p>For context,  I managed to take 3 months off on about half pay through similar leave gymnastics...')
