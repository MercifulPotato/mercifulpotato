I would like to add two points. First, I have rarely seen only one approach to &quot;it works&quot;. There are always more than one ways to &quot;will it work?&quot;. Second, in order to get around the definition of &quot;working&quot; - I encourage people to specify success criteria upfront. Now, even if the definition of success criteria change later - they are all transparent. Everyone involved in the process has accountability and responsibility to oversee the right success criteria, change of success criteria.')
