Item(by='chongli', descendants=None, kids=[25840293], score=None, time=1611090083, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25838433, text='It’s interesting how Reddit‘s failure to effectively monetize and cut their most important users in on the action, the way YouTube and Twitch have done, seems to have led to a grey market. This hurts Reddit (obviously, since they’re cut out of the market) but it also hurts users due to a lack of transparency. This exposes users to all kinds of astroturfing, shilling, and other misinformation.<p>In a way, it’s quite similar to the issue of Amazon product reviews. Amazon tried to push off a core cost centre from their business onto the backs of volunteers. Now the system is totally corrupted by manufacturers and their paid shills.')
