Item(by='throwaway0a5e', descendants=None, kids=[25259196], score=None, time=1606771246, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25258908, text='&gt;It&#x27;s very hard to dissent against the current narrative because any dissent can easily be framed as &quot;killing people&quot;.<p>Every dissent winds up getting framed this way.  The numbers don&#x27;t matter.  The way you win is by having &quot;your side&quot; be the side who&#x27;s policy kills people less directly.  When you take it to extremes like &quot;make everyone do backbreaking labor and all the health problems that comes with that to save a few dozen kids with cancer&quot; the absurdity becomes obvious. It&#x27;s maddening but this is the nature of a lot of arguments we have in society today.  For example you have Safety Sally wanting to do something that will crush an industry in order to save a few dozen workplace injuries.  How many years of life will be lost from all those people&#x27;s reduced standard of living?  Hard to tell.  But Safety Sally always wins because she can argue that anyone arguing against her policy is killing people more directly, numbers be damned.  Sometimes (e.g. coal industry) the numbers do work out in her favor.  Often times it&#x27;s hard to tell and then you get into arguments about who&#x27;s analysis is more accurate')
