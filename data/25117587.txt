Prior to the cash register, the owner had to trust cashiers not to pocket money. Cash registers became enormously popular and revolutionized sales since they kept everyone honest, as well as letting business owners know what was going on.<p>(The book &quot;Before the Computer: IBM, NCR, Burroughs, &amp; Remington Rand &amp; the Industry They Created&quot; goes into a lot of detail on this.)')
