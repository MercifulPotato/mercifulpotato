You just need to equip a largeish fraction of the parking spots with a charger. You don&#x27;t need high currents, because most people drive less than 30kWh (~150km) a day, so a normal 220V 16A plug is more than sufficient. The only issue are long roadtrips, where high current chargers are needed, but they already exist. In 20 minutes you can recharge more than you can drive in two hours. You&#x27;re supposed to take breaks anyway.')
