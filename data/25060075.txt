You may be right, but the machines will be in the hands of users next week.  It would be stupid for Apple to make those claims if they weren&#x27;t true.  We&#x27;ll see soon enough.<p>Assuming the claims are true, we shouldn&#x27;t forget that Intel per core performance improvements have been incremental at best for several years.  They&#x27;ve really run into some major problems with their fab process development in recent years.  TSMC (Apple Silicon foundry) is well ahead.  It has been kind of hard to watch since that has historically been such a strength for Intel.  They&#x27;re a strong company, they&#x27;ll get it together.')
