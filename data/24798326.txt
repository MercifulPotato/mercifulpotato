Possibly both.  I have a nice modern car, and it stopped working the other day.  And I had absolutely no idea what was wrong. No way to diagnose and no conceptual framework.<p>Military hardware (I am guessing) cannot be as fragile as my nice car, so it must now be lagging behind the cost benefit curve of commercial car production - all the efficiency gains Ford makes must get lost as they cannot risk the fragility.<p>Additionally military hardware is really a special\nsnowflake - lots of highly specific not really available commercially parts.<p>So military hardware must be desperate for actually working 3d printing &#x2F; one off manufacturing - it solves the cost problem and the special snowflake problem.<p>So I am guessing the DoD will be a heavy investor in all things additive manufacturing for a decade ?  Am Inway off base ?')
