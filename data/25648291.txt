It seems like the pollution of EVs has been widely discussed in all kinds of media. Even extremely pro EV site like Electrek or CleanTechnica writes about it all the time.<p>The pitch has always been that they pollute less globally (and that how much depends on the electric energy mix, but will generally decrease over time) and way less locally. EVs is also the only solution to have a viable path to net zero lifetime CO2 impact. It&#x27;ll take a zero-emission grid and zero-emission mining, but we need those anyway, and EV tech will help make mining zero-emission.')
