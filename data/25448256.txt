It&#x27;s so finicky that I&#x27;m not shocked bugs like this happen. The only programs I&#x27;d be reasonable sure wouldn&#x27;t screw it up are Acrobat itself, and pdflatex and friends.<p>I think we need a multi-image container format. It could be something that&#x27;s literally a bunch of jpgs&#x2F;pngs&#x2F;pick your poison in a tar container, and given a new extension. OSes would open it and present it as a gallery in order. There&#x27;s no value in a non-ocr&#x27;d PDF existing. For OCR&#x27;d text that gets more complicated, but it feels like we should be able to come up with a common denominator that doesn&#x27;t have the legacy of a binary format derived from postscript in the early 90s.')
