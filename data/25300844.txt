One gift came from a global brand. Next day I saw the ads. I didn&#x27;t googled for sure for that brand on my end nor posted anything on social media. And on my parents&#x27; end, who received the gift, I&#x27;m pretty sure their internet skills are not enough for a brand search.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t want to convince anybody here, I might be pretty wrong. Just helping others who might have the job to verify all these findings.')
