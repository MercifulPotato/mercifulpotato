While actor systems use the actors as the main units that you connect, with fire and forget messaging to each actor&#x27;s inbox, FBP proposes communication between named ports over channels with bounded buffers, very much like the CSP implementation in Go (just that you have long running components as in actor systems -\nsomething that can easily be implemented in Go with structs with go channels in fields for the ports, as shown in the FlowBase library I mentioned in another comment).<p>The FBP model provides implicit backpressure, because of the bounded buffers on the channels. The actor model on the other hand is more loosely coupled and flexible.<p>This actually means FBP systems are slightly more optimal for efficient within-one-node, in-memory parallellisation, whereas actor systems shine more for distributed systems.<p>They shine on different scales, in other words.<p>I wrote a post many years ago on this, that seems to have aligned with the experience of a number of people, based on the reactions in the comments:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rillabs.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;flowbased-vs-erlang-message-passing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rillabs.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;flowbased-vs-erlang-message-passin...</a>')
