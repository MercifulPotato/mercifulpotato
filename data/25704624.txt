It seems alarming to me that so many devices (Canon and iPhone at least) are putting out patent-encumbered HEIF&#x2F;HEIC files <i>while</i> the available decoders are so incredibly slow.<p>Last I looked, libHEIF is &gt;50x slower than the built-in iOS decoders, which makes the format hundreds of times slower to decode than JPEG. With JPEG, the differences between free decoders and the &quot;best&quot; ones has been 2-3x in speed, but 50x slower is a huge cost that makes these formats unworkable for a whole lot of things, like most webservers.<p>Does anyone know if things are getting better here?<p>As an example, here are some 2019 benchmarks of Apple&#x27;s HEIC decoder vs. libHEIF:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;joedrago&#x2F;avif&#x2F;issues&#x2F;11" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;joedrago&#x2F;avif&#x2F;issues&#x2F;11</a>')
