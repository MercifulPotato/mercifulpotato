The printer manager refused to open each time I tried to print.  Frankly, that&#x27;s unacceptable.<p>I have preferred Apple&#x2F;MacOS since 2007.  However, my 2019 MBA suffered the infamous shaky keypress issue, randomly inserting an extra space when I typed.  After 6 trips to the Apple store to fix under warranty I told myself it is my last Apple product.<p>I wanted the MBA for the portable form factor.  Now I work from home and portability is no longer a consideration.  I will mostly likely ditch this device in favor of a linux system.<p>What a disappointment.')
