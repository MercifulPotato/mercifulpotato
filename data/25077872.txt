Of course, you can make everything good by throwing enough time and money on it, but that&#x27;s not the point.<p>The issue is that to have a nice and well architected code base, you have to constantly refactor and improve - sometimes you need to re-arrange and refactor huge parts of the code. Without types _and_ tests, this is just not gonna happen. It will be unproductive and scary, so that people will start to stop touching existing code and work their way around it.<p>&gt; I think the understandability and maintainability of a code base has more to do with the person writing it than the availability of a type system tbh.<p>That is the same thing. Because someone who wants great maintainability will also want a great type system (amongst other things).')
