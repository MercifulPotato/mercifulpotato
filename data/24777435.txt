Use a base image that is regularly updated. For your own images, ensure that they are also being rebuilt regularly.<p>There are a lot of semi-official Docker images on Docker Hub that are published once and never updated until the next software release. That is a huge anti-pattern in my view, those images should not be relied on for production.')
