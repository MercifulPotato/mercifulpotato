The presence of CVEs in software is a sign of maturity, not insecurity. It&#x27;s frustrating to see people use CVE numbers to point at some larger problem. The key element is to realize that security issues are just bugs, especially in the context of C software. What you should be cautious about is upstreams that doesn&#x27;t handle security issues well. Systemd is not one of these upstreams.')
