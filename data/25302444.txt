I&#x27;ve increasingly seen and heard employers trying to take advantage of the current situation and we need more regulation and protection for workers. People are being asked to do extra and too afraid to speak out especially with so many companies making redundancies.<p>One area of focus for me is sickness and working from home. Sick days should be about rest and recovering both physically and mentally. Often see people working through while they aren&#x27;t fully capable mentally but are too afraid to say so. We need measures like this ASAP.')
