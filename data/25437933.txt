And the more specialized&#x2F;efficient functions were squirreled away in a non-default package. Well that, and a bunch of other things like a different module system.  SBCL seems like such a nice compiler that doesn&#x27;t get the respect it deserves for being able to compile fast binaries for such a dynamic language.')
