Many graphics developers have had experiences with Nvidia support where they run into a strange bug and are instructed to set a magic value to enable a driver hack. AMD drivers have had good and bad periods and hacks of their own, but are usually better behaved in this respect. But it&#x27;s actually Intel that gets the most praise for adhering to spec, and therefore being a useful baseline. So user perceptions and dev perceptions diverge on what makes the drivers good, actually, and this has shifted with the different generations of APIs too; as we&#x27;ve gone towards a lower level access model, the basic driver functionality has become less focused on performance hacks, but there is a lot of legacy support there to support old games.<p>We&#x27;re long past the worst period for Radeon on Linux which was back in the 2000&#x27;s with &quot;fglrx&quot; - a driver that I never managed to get working. The new stuff will run with some competence.')
