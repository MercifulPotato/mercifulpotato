I too lurk from time to time on thedonald.win and far-right subreddits, you can see that over there reality is completely distorted, calls to violence are constant and they just feed off each other&#x27;s insecurities, fears and hate.<p>Nothing good comes out of these places, regardless of where in the political spectrum you position yourself (except maybe downright fascists). Look at what happened at the Capitol, did he further the right&#x27;s agenda? Of course not, if anything it put them in a much more awkward situation.<p>Reddit admins are enablers and they share a part of the blame. Remember how subreddits like &#x2F;r&#x2F;jailbait and &#x2F;r&#x2F;creepshots were allowed on the website for months, if not years (among many others I can&#x27;t be bother to remember, including some extremely explicitly racist ones)?<p>Then it&#x27;s always the same thing, some news outlet or politician talks publicly about how Reddit hosts fascists&#x2F;pedos&#x2F;racists or something like that and within two days you have bans and a heartfelt post by the admins saying how they felt that it was their duty to do something and &quot;think of the children&quot; and all kinds of bullshit.<p>Reddit is 4chan wearing a tie to try to look more business friendly.<p>These subreddits and websites don&#x27;t host free speech, they host hate speech. I have zero issue drawing a line in the sand here. &quot;First they came for the fascists, and I said nothing because I&#x27;m not a fascist, and the world was a better place. The end.&quot;')
