There are tons of targets where AlphaFold2 didn&#x27;t score over 70%. It was typically only 10% ahead of the next best program. The metric everyone is looking at, GDT_TS, gives marks for atoms that are within eight angstroms of where they should be - by experimental standards, eight angstroms is a huge miss! There are targets where on some important metrics, like C-alpha RMSD, AlphaFold2 did worse than another program!')
