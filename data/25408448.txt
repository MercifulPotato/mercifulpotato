Item(by='jancsika', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607882003, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25400557, text='&gt; Thankfully, like you said, there is now Stack Overflow.<p>It&#x27;s interesting because we can imagine a history where the docs were written much more professionally with such examples. And we can imagine that work having lowered the barrier to entry such that a critical mass of users becoming compositionally literate in shell scripting. (And perhaps shellcheck being written much earlier in this alternate history.)<p>But Stack Overflow not only obsoletes such an effort, it IMO obsoletes <i>becoming literate</i> in shell scripting, at least in the way the author describes. SO&#x27;s existence is equivalent to being able to write a natural language query on the command line which &quot;automorphs&quot; into the relevant Stack Overflow example. At that point you just need to understand basic piping, redirection, and enough of the syntax to spot-check the magic answer in order to make small changes for a use case. That&#x27;s a different kind of skill.')
