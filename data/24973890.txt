That forces a bit of visibility and accountability on the government in that it shows people just how much they&#x27;re working for the government before working for themselves.<p>This is similar to how the US makes sales tax visible to the payer, rather than hiding them behind an invisible VAT.  It&#x27;s about transparency.')
