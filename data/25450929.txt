I&#x27;ve found that nothing beats playing games and analyzing them afterward.  The analysis is first just using my wits, then with an engine.  I&#x27;m mostly looking to see where I made a mistake or where my opponent made a mistake and I missed it.  I build drills to teach myself what moves to play in given positions.  I use chessable for that.<p>I agree with the commenter who said that 1200-level players on chess.com do come with opening prep and will try to catch you out with their pet lines.  Obviously it&#x27;s too much to learn refutations for all the crazy gambits out there, but it&#x27;s worth spending a bit of time understanding openings.  The fine article we&#x27;re commenting on does not go too far -- even for a beginner, it&#x27;s worth knowing the difference between a Sicilian and a Caro-Kan.  Even just learning the first four moves of the common openings is worthwhile, because it will save you time and energy that you need for the middlegame.<p>I agree that learning deep theoretical lines is a waste of time.  Most likely you&#x27;ll be out of book by move five in an amateur game.  So learn a small number of moves (ideally, with a good reason why that move makes sense, even if it&#x27;s just to develop a piece) and have some idea of the common plans that each side has in that opening.')
