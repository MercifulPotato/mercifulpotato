I&#x27;ve thought about trying to consider the &quot;obviousness&quot; of certain moves, and then only explore those branches with a probability relative to its obviousness.<p>&quot;Obviousness&quot; would take into account things like the last move played (&quot;ah, your pawn is attacking my bishop; I should move it&quot;), and whether the move is a capture, check, or attacks another piece. A forward move for a knight is more obvious than a backward move, as is moving it towards the center of the board, versus moving it to the edge of board.<p>As the depth increases, the probability of exploring a branch decreases. I think it would be pretty easy to scale such a system to make it play better or worse by simply adjusting how much the probability of exploring a branch decreases as the depth increases.<p>Perhaps this could lead to more natural blunders where a line is simply missed?<p>I&#x27;ve also wanted to come up with an evaluation system that scales better with skill level. A position may be +3, but only if you play the next 5 moves exactly correctly. In another position, one move might be +1, and another might be +0.5, but the +0.5 requires four moves of perfect play from your opponent to keep it even. Can these subtleties be expressed clearly? Maybe something like &quot;turns until positional advantage is converted to a clear material advantage.&quot; When you&#x27;re just starting engine evaluations often don&#x27;t make any sense.<p>I&#x27;ve watched a lot of chess on Twitch lately, and it&#x27;d also be cool to have scores for all the relatively-subjective terms that the commentators use: &quot;lots of attacking chances&quot; (just pure count of checks possible in next N moves? percentage of lines that lead to checkmate in next N moves?), &quot;very sharp position&quot; (how many moves drastically change the evaluation?), etc.')
