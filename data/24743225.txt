Item(by='runarberg', descendants=None, kids=[24744918], score=None, time=1602380374, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24743171, text='Many people (including my self at work) handle webpack configs just fine. I started a vue project at work the other day and it was as simple as:<p><pre><code>    npx @vue&#x2F;cli@latest create my-project\n</code></pre>\nThis scaffolded a fully configured project with webpack, babel, typescript, eslint, a custom dev server, etc. I think react developers have a similar tool called create-react-app. I personally (or professionally, since I only use this at work; personally I just have an `index.html` and a python server) just let vue-cli handle the webpack config and forget about it. I guess rust developers use cargo to the same manner.<p>I suspect much of the complain about the complexity of the front-end ecosystem comes from people that either a) don’t do front-end regularly and are trying to build a website for them self but get bad advice for the tools needed, or b) are backend developers at work and think they know better about the front-end then their front-end counterparts. In the case of (a), they simply just need better advice on tooling (and which tools are an overkill), the tone of my original comment was more directed at the other group (b; although the advice I gave was for the former group—whoops).')
