All modern CPU&#x27;s are really similar internally in that sense. ISA is just a frontend that gets translated into micro-ops that then get scheduled based on dependencies and available execution ports. Even the registers in ISA don&#x27;t match the internal registers at all. ARM64 has 32 general purpose registers in ISA level. M1 seems to have 354 internally [Anandtech]<p>This is also the reason why the whole CISC and RISC debate in it&#x27;s original form is outdated. The processors internally are all RISC. But the ISA can be more complex.<p>The x86 ISA makes the decoder harder to parallelize, so it takes more chip area compared to equivalent width for ARM64. And the wider you want to go the harder it becomes, whereas with ARM64 you just slap more decoders.<p>Another is the x86 memory model that restricts how stores can be issued into memory so that they&#x27;re visible to other cores.<p>This is also a good thing for AMD. They could &quot;just&quot; make a Zen ARM CPU. Sure it would be a lot of work, but vast majority of the chip is shared.')
