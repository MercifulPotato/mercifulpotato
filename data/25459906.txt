The regulatory landscape in traditional finance is somewhat fragmented as well, which simply means people&#x2F;institutions&#x2F;corporations shop around for the regulatory venue they prefer.<p>Or the US can impose its own de-facto global regulations, similar to what it already does on a global scale because a huge % of finance goes through US banks at some point. For example: Want to go against the Iran sanctions? Well, you can, legally, if your country hasn&#x27;t signed on to them. You just won&#x27;t ever be able to do business that touches anything US related. Which means you won&#x27;t be able to do business with any other major western or global bank either under threat of the US cutting ties with <i>them</i>.<p>Without large institutions, and a few of the largest  playing the part of &quot;market makers&quot; that provide liquidity, you won&#x27;t get significant liquidity for large moves, not unlike the current crypto situation. And large institutions will always be subject to the sort of regulatory situations above.<p>It&#x27;s a bit of a paradox: Part of crypto&#x27;s appeal is its freedom from regulation. But in order for crypto to really go mainstream, global financial systems &amp; their regulations. Nations have a strong interest in keeping monetary policy within their control. They will use every tool at their disposal to make sure crypto can&#x27;t do an end-run around that control.')
