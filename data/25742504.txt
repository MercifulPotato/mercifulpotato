For a 60% effective vaccine, you get (1 - 1&#x2F;2.5) &#x2F; .6 = 100% of the population.<p>Yes, the slope is slightly different but the rolloff is exceptionally gentle.  There is a huge difference in practicality between even an 85% and 95% effective vaccine (70% of the population vs. 63% of the population).<p>Not to mention that none of what we&#x27;ve measured is differences in transmissibility; it&#x27;s quite possible that a 70% effective-against-symptomatic-illness vaccine only mitigates transmission rates by 35%, and thus can&#x27;t reach herd immunity at <i>any</i> level of vaccination.')
