Instead of justifying censorship as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; in some essential fashion, I think it&#x27;s important to be clear about the context.<p>EDIT:  In fact, Twitter has done more than just ban a few leaders, removing many accounts associated with QAnon, for example [1].  The point still stands that context matters and the two situations don&#x27;t appear to be exactly equivalent.  (It can still be argued that Twitter&#x27;s ban was not good for society, but the argument should be more nuanced than &quot;because censorship is always bad&quot;.)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;11&#x2F;trump-twitter-ban&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;technology&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;11&#x2F;trump-t...</a>')
