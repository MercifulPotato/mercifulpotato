One day someone decided to do make our loading bar more accurate by splitting loading into several segments and keeping a local record of the average time to load each segment. The result was a smooth progress bar from 0 to 100. We were proud of it.<p>Years later I worked on a popular AAA franchise and we had replace our loading screen spinner with a progress bar due to console requirements.
