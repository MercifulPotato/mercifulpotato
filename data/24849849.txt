There&#x27;s Firefox for iOS based on WebKit like everything else on iOS, but I don&#x27;t even know that StatCounter would count it as &quot;Firefox&quot;.<p>* Android: Google for a long time had (and in many cases continues to have, as far as I know) agreements with OEMs that forbid a default browser other than Chrome.  In some cases those agreements forbid preinstalling a non-Chrome browser at all, even as non-default.  So you have to rely on people downloading an extra browser from the app store, and people don&#x27;t do that much.<p>In addition to all that, &quot;mobile&quot; sites tended to be written to &quot;WebKit&quot;, not &quot;standards&quot;, for a while for various historical reasons.  Unfortunately, at this point that&#x27;s pretty deeply ingrained and people continue to do that, albeit with &quot;Blink or WebKit&quot; replacing &quot;WebKit&quot;, which entrenches the problem.')
