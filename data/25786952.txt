Item(by='KMag', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610684271, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25786712, text='&gt; HN has a serious pedantry problem. Anything that challenges conventional wisdom is villified and attacked<p>I think you&#x27;re being downvoted because you&#x27;ve misinterpreted the GP as saying a proposition is untrue (&quot;exclude the possibility&quot;), when the GP is just saying this study isn&#x27;t evidence either way.  Then you went on a pseudoscientific naturalistic tangential rant.<p>You seem to be claiming that denying this study is evidence either way shows an over-reliance on statistics.  Furthermore, this over-reliance on statistics is a myopia particular to Western culture.  This over-reliance on statistical significance has lead to poor environmental policy (with some thrown in hints toward naturalistic fallacy arguments).  Am I understanding your argument correctly?<p>I would argue that the major problem with environmental policy in the U.S. is that it under-values statistically significant studies.<p>Fetishization of non-Western and pre-modern cultures isn&#x27;t helpful.  There are plenty of environmental disasters in both Asia and Africa.  Slash-and-burn agriculture predates history, and Rio Tinto shows environmental damage from mining operations 5,000 years ago, so &#x27;reject Western culture&quot; and &quot;just return to the old ways&quot; aren&#x27;t sufficient as a basis for environmental policy.  (My apologies if you weren&#x27;t hinting at a return to pre-modern practices.  I know you didn&#x27;t mention anything about ancient peoples, but I got a feeling that&#x27;s where this discussion is headed and wanted to cut one round-trip out of the conversation.)<p>What would you propose as an alternative basis for environmental policy, if not studies of statistical significance?')
