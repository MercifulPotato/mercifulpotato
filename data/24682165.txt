The reason is exactly this -- I can work out traffic lights very easily although I&#x27;m r&#x2F;g colorblind, however the test was about showing a number of different colors and asking you to name them. I failed, obviously, but the instructor did a <i>favor</i> and marked me as passed.<p>I still have no idea what practicality that test provides in driving.')
