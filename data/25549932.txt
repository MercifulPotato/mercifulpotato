It had gone under a radar of many RTS players, but it was revolutionary in terms of APM: there were so few actions per minute that you could competitively play it on an xbox controller (which it had a great control scheme for). The challenge was always to out-fox and out-smart your opponent, and you didn&#x27;t have to click fast to achieve it.<p>Unfortunately, the developer, Eugene Systems, didn&#x27;t keep this in later games. The Wargame series are an excellent and very deep strategy games that further built on recon and other mechanics from Ruse, but it is, once again, a bit of a click-fest.<p>Still, I highly recommend both; Ruse is more on a casual side, and Wargame series if you want something more hardcore.')
