The actions by Apple, Google or Twitter are not a massacre on the political enemy (in fact, I don&#x27;t consider companies to have political enemies beyond the SEC and other regulatory instances). It&#x27;s not even a call to murder anyone.\nOn the other hand, the &quot;Nacht der Langen Dolche&quot; was a coordinated massacre of (among others victims?) political enemies, with the goal to reinforce the political power of a discriminatory regime (which, just to be perfectly clear, was governed by an ideology that openly planned and then proceeded to kill of millions of human beings).\nThat killing blow on the German democracy is a different league, even compared to the recent attack on democracy the world witnessed in DC (an attack on the elected representatives of the US, fueled by the elected president, so there are some parallels, but not the ones you intended to point out?).<p>Some (imho much too large) companies getting their act together and moving in against hate speech and people outright calling for the killing of their political enemy, however, is not about murdering people. (I <i>guess</i>[!] it&#x27;s about covering their ass, because mentioned regulatory instances will investigate why it became so easy to spread wild murder fantasies across the Internet and into the real world. With, surprise, people getting killed and democracy seriously endangered).')
