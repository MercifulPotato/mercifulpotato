I wish that there was a version for 8080 but I understand why they went with the Z80.  Borland went on to create Turbo Modula-2 for CP&#x2F;M which was very similar to TP but with lots of language enhancements and faster execution time of the resulting binaries.  However, it was released quite late in 1986 and quickly withdrawn.')
