Item(by='Shacklz', descendants=None, kids=[25349427], score=None, time=1607442461, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25344881, text='&gt; mostly based on some outdated views on the role of the army<p>And this is where we differ - I think _your_ opinion is outdated ;) The services that you listed mostly do not require an &quot;army&quot;, what exactly is camouflage gear &amp; combat training good for with regards to helping with covid-related tasks (or any other &quot;Katastrophenhilfe&quot;-related endeavour)?<p>The &quot;Swiss army knife&quot; metaphor is exactly what I so despise about the Swiss army; it&#x27;s their excuse for essentially being an eternal &quot;Pfadilager&quot; for adults. Actual participation in conflicts mentioned by GP aren&#x27;t an option anyway thanks to Switzerland&#x27;s neutrality.<p>Luckily, it seems the trend is clearly in my opinion&#x27;s favor, as was evident once again with the results of the last referendum on fighter jets - the pro-army-folks are a dying breed, it is just a matter of time until the &#x27;Wehrpflicht&#x27; is finally abolished (I estimate it takes another ~20 years or so until the cold war era generation starts to become a minority), and when that happens, it&#x27;s just a matter of time until the rest of the army gets to boot too, as all the nostalgia-driven sentiments towards it will not exist anymore (currently, put 10 Swiss men in a room, and it will take at most half an hour until their army experience becomes a topic).<p>And you know what? It&#x27;ll be for the better of the world, and Switzerland especially. Finally, we will be able to say &quot;We do not participate in this barbarian head smashing anymore, we&#x27;re civilized folks&quot;; someone needs to make the start and Switzerland is in the best position to do so. We&#x27;re already not participating anyway; but we&#x27;re still training generation after generation to do so; and this needs to stop eventually. My hope is that this will be the case in the next 20-30 years or so, I wouldn&#x27;t mind if it was earlier ;)')
