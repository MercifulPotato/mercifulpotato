We&#x27;ve all got a few things wrong with us.  Find someone with weirdness you don&#x27;t really mind, help them grow, but don&#x27;t try to change them.  If talking to you too much (edit: asking you what you want to eat and when) is the worst thing about your partner, your life is pretty sweet.<p>Edit: there&#x27;s also a heavy dose of cultural and personal context here.  Her calling isn&#x27;t being needy, but feeling culturally duty-bound.  In her home country, as the only daughter, it&#x27;s considered her responsibility to take care of her parents.  Her brother lives 5 minutes from the parents, and he makes sure they&#x27;re taken care of, but my wife feels a bit guilty living in another country and wants to make sure her parents don&#x27;t feel abandoned.  One of her father&#x27;s sisters married an American, moved to the U.S., and slowly lost touch with the rest of the family, so she wants to ease any anxiety her parents have around that.  Also, as much as I remind her that it&#x27;s not her job to cook, as soon as she finishes lunch (at her place of work), she feels like a bad wife if she doesn&#x27;t consult with me about what she should cook for dinner and what time she should start cooking to have dinner perfectly timed for my return from work.  I&#x27;ve tried a bit to get her to stop asking what I want for dinner, but you can&#x27;t change a person, and it is very sweet, other than it makes me feel a bit awkward.   She cooks and I clean, and she finds cooking a good way to de-stress after work, but I still feel a bit bad that she feels like it&#x27;s her duty to cook.  She also talks with her brother&#x27;s kids one or two times a week to help get them practice with their English.  She&#x27;s really trying to help out her whole family and keep everyone connected across the miles.  Thailand: land of spicy food and sweet people.')
