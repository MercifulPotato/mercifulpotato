It also has a chat and private rooms. I&#x27;m seeking advice for turning this into a successful business or a potential buyer. I&#x27;m also seeking advice about monetization models. It currently allows buying ads for $1&#x2F;month. It is powered by Redis and Ruby on Rails 6 with WebSockets. I have closed 58 issues on it and only 14 remain. It is a powerful alternative to Microsoft Whiteboard and contains some features missing from that app. My intention is to provide collaborative drawing software for artists and a whiteboarding solution for teams. It is a fully collaborative real time software (not turn based.)')
