Item(by='wodenokoto', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603880355, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24916233, text='&quot;Siri suggested websites&quot; has been part of safari for a long time. I actually find them more useful than Google, since it is quick to suggest wikipedia articles, while Google prefers to show their own cards instead of linking to the wikipedia source of those cards.<p>Annoyingly, Siri often suggests a wikipedia article from en.m.wikipedia.org, but send me to a dk.m.wikipedia.org page where the article doesn&#x27;t exists.<p>So the suggest is good, but at the same time kinda useless.')
