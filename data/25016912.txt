I have only ever built a non-toy GraphQL server in 2016, for evaluation purposes. Never used in production.<p>Tooling back then was probably much more primitive than it is today, so apply that discount to the subsequent statements.<p>Writing GraphQL resolvers for the API that we were building was painful and required a solid understanding of our data model and what the database was capable of (we were using MongoDB). We were much happier at the time to stick to tried and true REST API tools and frameworks than to jump on the GraphQL bandwagon.<p>All the complexity of managing REST calls was simply pushed from the client side to the GraphQL resolution server. This complexity seems irreducible to me, and I am highly skeptical of anyone claiming that they can make this complexity vanish.<p>Have never so much as been tempted to use GraphQL since then. Unfortunately, this probably also marks my entry into dinosaur-hood.')
