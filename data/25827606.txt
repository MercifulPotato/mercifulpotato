It&#x27;s &quot;glass houses&quot; all over again. Why should a nation of 350M people have ASAT capability in the interest of national security, but not a nation of 1.4B people? We&#x27;re seeing what happens when power is concentrated in the hands of a few (Trump&#x2F;Parler bans) and it cannot be allowed to happen at a geopolitical level, in the interest of world peace (it sounds crazy but it has worked post WW2).')
