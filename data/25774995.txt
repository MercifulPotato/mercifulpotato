I&#x27;m in a &quot;traditional&quot; industry so product and project cycles last decades, not just moths or years. It takes a couple of years for a new hire to be really productive. I can&#x27;t compare it to  some other places I have worked where half the staff would change every year and a large project would ship in 6 months.')
