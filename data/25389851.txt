Insisting on a zero axis can crunch the data and obscure the trends and is unnatural for some data sets (e.g. the mortality time series—if that trend line ever goes to 0...something has gone awry).<p>Quote from Tufte on the subject:<p>&gt; <i>” In general, in a time-series, use a baseline that shows the data not the zero point. If the zero point reasonably occurs in plotting the data, fine. But don&#x27;t spend a lot of empty vertical space trying to reach down to the zero point at the cost of hiding what is going on in the data line itself.</i>”<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edwardtufte.com&#x2F;bboard&#x2F;q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=00003q" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.edwardtufte.com&#x2F;bboard&#x2F;q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=...</a>')
