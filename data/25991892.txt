I&#x27;d take $80k&#x2F;yr working for myself over $800k&#x2F;yr working for someone else because I love working for myself and can support my basic needs with my existing passive income.<p>Realistically, there&#x27;s some price where I&#x27;d take a job working for a big corporation, but it would have to be <i>extremely</i> high ($2M+) or an unusually good learning opportunity for me to be willing to give up my current lifestyle.')
