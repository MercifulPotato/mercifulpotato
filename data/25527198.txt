Bumping your salary in the next job by 50% is not uncommon while may be much harder to achieve when staying at the same firm for years.<p>As others have pointed out before, interviewing is a skill that can and should be practiced. The best way to prep (except grinding through leetcode problems) is to go to a <i>real</i> interview and practice telling real stories from experience and solving problems in real time under stress. So yeah, I would definitely recommend going to at least a few interviews for jobs that might not be your first choice before going for that “dream job” interview.')
