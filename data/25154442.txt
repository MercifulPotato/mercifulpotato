Not sure about Epic but Embark Studios do use Blender for sure. From their blog:<p>&quot;Many of us at the content team at Embark use Blender daily, and our long-term ambition at the studio is to use Blender as our default program for 3D and environment art.&quot;<p>Ubisoft Animation studios are using Blender and there were some rumors last year that Blender is used in some capacity in game studios too.
