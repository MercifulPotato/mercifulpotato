This explains why almost everyone whose job involves distribution— whether they&#x27;re in sales, marketing, or advertising— has a job title that has nothing to do with those things. People who sell advertising are called &#x27;account executives.&#x27; People who sell customers work in &#x27;business development.&#x27; People who sell companies are &#x27;investment bankers.&#x27; And people who sell themselves are called &#x27;politicians.&#x27; There&#x27;s a reason for these redescriptions: none of us wants to be reminded when we&#x27;re being sold.”')
