It&#x27;s about the fact that almost all value is extracted by Google and Facebook, that the web doesn&#x27;t inspire a younger generation, that reviews are gamed, that even politicians, authorities, and public broadcasters post on proprietary message boards to feed polarized masses, that\nthere&#x27;s an industry employing extortionate practices (blackout shops and restaurants not willing to pay from public presence through network effects), aggregators taking undue money for payment services, musicians having to go to &quot;platforms&quot; where they get screwed, citizens and pupils needing to kiss the ring of an ad company to access information, monopolies taking over web and IP infrastructure and standardization to create enormous craptastic media formats to make it impossible to create browsers from scratch, ever again. Hell, even F&#x2F;OSS developers have been brainwashed to bring all their traffic to github and create fscking webapps.<p>The web was supposed to work like <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;person&#x2F;thing" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;person&#x2F;thing</a> but turned into <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thing&#x2F;person" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;thing&#x2F;person</a>. We didn&#x27;t need that; that was exactly what we had before.<p>When was the last time you went to a new website? Listen to new music?<p>The web isn&#x27;t dying; it&#x27;s dead already. The only question is if we can eventually come up with a truly recommendable way to author and distribute text and other media digitally that&#x27;ll serve us as well as books.')
