I don’t think this is truly how competition in search will rise. Nobody is going to build a Google that gets users to consciously replace Google as a default in a browser. It seems futile to focus on this.<p>Google search competition will come from 2 places: the most popular platform that controls the users browser will cut them out aa default or a new search context outside the browser will become more important for searching. This is why Google pays Apple oodles of cash to make a favorable decision for them and why they invest in Google Assistant. This money defends against competitive threat. Somehow burying the ability to switch your web search engine..? Seems unimportant')
