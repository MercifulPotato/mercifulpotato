It generally was a hobby project and was honestly pretty cool as a rideable work of art - apparently they were pretty comfy to ride- less stiff than carbon frames.<p>I&#x27;ve seen bamboo ski poles as well, so perhaps this is a new fad... perhaps we&#x27;ll see bamboo bike racks, etc etc.  Wonder if the waterproofing polyurathane coating they use to treat them before use makes it more or less eco friendly than just using metal materials?  Although I guess the metal would be water treated as well.')
