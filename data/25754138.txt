Like, map is a keyword. The standard library doesn&#x27;t have many data structures at all because, well, without generics they&#x27;re not very useful. There&#x27;s a few things like a linked list and a thread-safe map that accept interface{} types but then you&#x27;re basically throwing the type system out the window.')
