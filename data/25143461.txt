I was skeptical about Tailwind, but the trailer makes it feel like you&#x27;re my kind of person, and I want to try your product.<p>Also credit to a post above, which acknowledges the &quot;it feels wrong but it makes sense in the end&quot; sense. I&#x27;d dismissed Tailwind in the past over the feeling that it was the Wrong Thing. This convinces me to give it a try the next time I&#x27;m starting on something.')
