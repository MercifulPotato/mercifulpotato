It worked like a charm on my CentOS VPS. I was able to scale videos uploaded by users to different resolutions, cut out frames for video cover, get size, resolution, convert video to different formats supported by various browsers. It was amazing and only solution available. The project was eventually suspended because of various reasons, but working with FFmpeg was amazing experience and still, when working with videos it is a great solution. Surely FFmpeg impact on today&#x27;s internet is far bigger than anyone of us can assume. It is for video internet, what mp3 was for audio internet.')
