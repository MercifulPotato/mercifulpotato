Item(by='perpetualpatzer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602184646, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24720753, text='&gt;Is there a legal or internal Google policy basis for the distinction that you&#x27;re setting up?<p>I understand OP to be distinguishing between &quot;overbroad&quot; and &quot;not overbroad&quot; warrants. The legal basis for that distinction is the particularity requirement in the 4th Amendment[0].  Overbreadth is a common point of contention that gets warrants denied&#x2F;challenged when they probably cover a lot more targets than just the suspected party, for example, in this high-profile geofence search case[1].<p>An example, if you can prove &quot;the perp lives in this apartment,&quot; it&#x27;s okay to search it. If you can only prove  &quot;the perp lives in this apartment building&quot;, you can&#x27;t get a warrant to search the whole building, because you&#x27;ll definitely wind up searching a bunch of innocent people.<p>The different search query you&#x27;re referencing was for a specific name during a 38-day period[2]. A man of that name had been defrauded by a person using a fake passport with an image that appeared in Google&#x27;s image search results for that name (but not Bing or Yahoo&#x27;s, meaning it was likely obtained from Google). That, like the address, should yield a smallish number of total searcher (depending on the name&#x2F;address).<p>OP seems to believe that warranted, specific searches aren&#x27;t as unchecked as &quot;giving data to police based on search keywords&quot; seems to suggest. I&#x27;d tend to agree. Given the evidence presented, you could write a similar article saying &quot;Bank of America is giving banking information to police based on Walmart purchases, court docs show&quot;.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;law.justia.com&#x2F;constitution&#x2F;us&#x2F;amendment-04&#x2F;09-particularity.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;law.justia.com&#x2F;constitution&#x2F;us&#x2F;amendment-04&#x2F;09-parti...</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;deeplinks&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;new-federal-court-rulings-find-geofence-warrants-unconstitutional-0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eff.org&#x2F;deeplinks&#x2F;2020&#x2F;08&#x2F;new-federal-court-ruli...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.documentcloud.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;3519211-Edina-Police-Google-Search-Warrant-Redacted.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.documentcloud.org&#x2F;documents&#x2F;3519211-Edina-Police...</a>')
