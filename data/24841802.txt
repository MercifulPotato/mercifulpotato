I haven&#x27;t seen a single outside analyst that has said this is a good case. Let&#x27;s check in on what the market thinks of this case: GOOG: up 1.39% today as of time of this comment.<p>&gt; that the case wouldn&#x27;t have been brought by a Biden administration then this may have been the best opportunity to make the complaint.<p>Why? Why not November 4, or December 3, or January 14? Why now, 2 weeks before an election. It reeks of political motivation. Even if that wasn&#x27;t the intent, it has the appearance of that intent which could have easily been avoided by simply waiting until after the election day.')
