Item(by='throwawaysea', descendants=None, kids=[25710961, 25710921], score=None, time=1610256612, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25710582, text='One example is <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cultural_Marxism_conspiracy_theory" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cultural_Marxism_conspiracy_th...</a>, which is about a term called &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; which has been used by some mainstream right-leaning people as well as some right-leaning extremists (particularly in the past). If you look at the article itself, it titles this article as a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; and specifically features the conspiracy theory version of &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; in its opening sentences. However, the term as commonly used in modern times, does not refer to that particular conspiracy theory but is more like a shorthand for leftist ideology that features collectivism, particularly when it infiltrates academic institutions (and not the notion of a coordinated mass conspiracy).<p>From a quick Google search, I was able to find other articles that draw this distinction clearly (example <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spectator.us&#x2F;whats-wrong-cultural-marxism&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spectator.us&#x2F;whats-wrong-cultural-marxism&#x2F;</a>). However, the Wikipedia article doesn&#x27;t draw this distinction well, and it seems intent on casting the phrase &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; as racist, and so it features the worst interpretation of it. It sources articles that are also written primarily to repudiate right-wing political figures or intellectuals like Jordan Peterson. The related debate and edit wars are apparent when you look at the &quot;Talk&quot; page for this article: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Talk:Cultural_Marxism_conspiracy_theory" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Talk:Cultural_Marxism_conspira...</a>. Note that the Talk page mentions the article is controversial, is in dispute, that there have been attempts to recruit editors to change the article, there have been circular sources introduced, and so forth.<p>That&#x27;s just one example, but if you dig deep enough into any topic that has a left- and right- perspective and a Wikipedia article, you&#x27;ll find the same. Wikipedia is, in my view, developing a US-centric English-centric left-leaning bias. All that said, I still love Wikipedia and will continue to use it everyday. I just worry that like all human-centric institutions, it is itself a target, a theater of battle in the on-going ideological wars.')
