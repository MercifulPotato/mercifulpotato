The default legal framework should include medical &#x2F; epidemiology research as freely licensed and commercial use as ... well let&#x27;s just say i think my license conditions will be expensive.<p>If an advertising channel then shows ads that breach license they are liable.  A fairly simple licensing process will come into play and we can find new ways to fund things<p>Edit: Yes i do get a lot of the issues around regulation of tech - it&#x27;s almost like saying regulation of every day life which is really broad.  And the different bodies and approaches will also need to be broad.  But i am a believer in markets and individual decision making and i also believe that personal information has in the past few years become a genuine new ... commodity? And we need to raise that commodity into visibility - to be able to put prices on it openly.  Maybe it won&#x27;t work, maybe privacy is like a human right and can only be dealt with at that level - but i don&#x27;t think so - privacy to me seems ephemeral and usually poorly defined. Longer discussion to be had')
