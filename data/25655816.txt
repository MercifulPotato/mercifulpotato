But at the same time, I also had people I could talk to about it! At age 10, my cousin and I were constantly discussing how to make StarCraft and Fallout better. At age 13, when I first picked a C++ book (after prior failed attempts of other people to expose me to Basic, Pascal and VB) with intent to learn gamedev, I had a friend at school who decided to learn C++ as well. Over the year, we&#x27;ve managed to drag a third person into learning to code, and another one as a spectator to what turned into years of trying to one-up each other in doing shit in OpenGL.<p>And then I got on-line and discovered a local gamedev community, where again, I could participate in mutual showing-off.<p>Point being, as I re-evaluate my early years of coding, I notice I always had someone to talk to who could relate, or at least be impressed (real!impressed, not fake &quot;I don&#x27;t understand or care about any of this but go you!&quot; parent!impressed). Looking at all these stories here about programming to automate homework - which presumably also impressed classmates - I&#x27;m starting to wonder if this isn&#x27;t a <i>necessary</i> condition for a kid to get into programming.')
