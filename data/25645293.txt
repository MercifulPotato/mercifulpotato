Item(by='bartread', descendants=None, kids=[25645653], score=None, time=1609853614, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25645217, text='&gt; I have lived in five countries now, but not one (local or state) government had an online presence that was nearly as good as the gov.uk infrastructure.<p>It is a neverending source of wonder to me that, whilst our government may be a shambles[0], our government <i>services</i> are so fantastic. They really are very impressive and, for the most part, very easy to use. Clearly a group of people have invested a lot of time and effort into this, and to me they demonstrate very clearly the value of investing heavily in user experience.<p>Also, the site is almost never down, which is good for somebody like me who tends to remember that they need to do thing X at random-o-clock at night.<p><i>[0] Not intended as an especially partisan statement as I have been known to vote Conservative (and over the last few years have criticised both Labour and Conservatives pretty equally), but I think it&#x27;s tricky to argue that, as an example, sending 3 million kids back to school for 1 day before changing your mind demonstrates competent leadership.</i>')
