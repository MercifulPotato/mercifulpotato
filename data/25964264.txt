If it&#x27;s even possible.<p>34.2 million people in the US are estimated have diabetes and you&#x27;re proposing housing all of them (and a bunch of other people) in isolation for a year or two while everyone else goes about their business.<p>That&#x27;s a lot of housing to find somewhere, food to provide, etc. Now try to do it in, say, six months.<p>At it&#x27;s peak, unemployment from COVID shutdowns in the US looks like they were around 20-30M last summer. So in terms of making sure those people still have income, the number of people isn&#x27;t too dissimilar, but that number has declined and we also didn&#x27;t have to find new, isolated, housing, food, and other services for that group.<p>It&#x27;s also a lot of people suddenly pulled out of their existing jobs and out of the regular in-person retail market, which means you&#x27;re <i>still not going to avoid some of the shocks we&#x27;re seeing anyway</i>.')
