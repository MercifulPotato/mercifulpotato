We were alone there and, certainly, not causing any problem. The police approached us and fined my friend for drinking in public (I don&#x27;t remember how much it was, this was some years ago). I live in front of a park now and I&#x27;ve seen similar things. I&#x27;ve also been drinking many times in public without any problem, and I am quite sure the police noticed us.<p>The Netherlands is, in general, a very tolerant country, but not as much as some people think. Maybe it is compared with America (although, in my very limited experience, I&#x27;ve never had any problems with the American police), but the difference with most European countries is quite moot.')
