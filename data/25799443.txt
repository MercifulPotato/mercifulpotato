Must have been something in there that was good to this very day.<p>Eh, no. From the mouth of Brendan Eich himself [0]:<p>&gt; InfoWorld: As I understand it, JavaScript started out as Mocha, then became LiveScript and then became JavaScript when Netscape and Sun got together. But it actually has nothing to do with Java or not much to do with it, correct?<p>&gt; Eich: Thatâ€™s right. It was all within six months from May till December (1995) that it was Mocha and then LiveScript. And then in early December, Netscape and Sun did a license agreement and it became JavaScript. And the idea was to make it a complementary scripting language to go with Java, with the compiled language.<p>It was completely down to marketing. I&#x27;ve heard it described as riding the coattails of Java, which Sun was dumping huge amounts of money into marketing to begin with. Allusions to &quot;something in there&quot; notwithstanding.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infoworld.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2653798&#x2F;javascript-creator-ponders-past--future.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infoworld.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;2653798&#x2F;javascript-creator...</a>')
