You insert some famous pop song as 3 minutes of filler and try to transfer the affection for the song to the show.<p>A recent example is in The Umbrella Academy one of the characters dances to &quot;I Think We&#x27;re Alone Now&quot; by Tiffany. It is entirely superfluous. It&#x27;s not a new technique. I recently watched Love Actually for the first time and it had at least 3 of these types of scenes. When they happen though I just tune out as my brain screams &quot;you&#x27;re being manipulated&quot;. They&#x27;re filler. They&#x27;re like &quot;design by committee&quot; or &quot;marketing checklist&quot;.<p>Related is the downbeat 3 minute musical interlude montage. Something disappointing to the character happens and then there&#x27;s a downbeat montage of them brooding etc. IIRC Angel had 1 or 2 per episode but they&#x27;re all over in modern shows.')
