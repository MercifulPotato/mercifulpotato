I also end up with a heavier pack, because all my clothing and gear are larger, I consume more food, I consume more water. So I&#x27;m even more top-heavy. I like poles for balance and leaning. I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re &quot;better&quot;, and I certainly accept that they may be a crutch (literally and figuratively), but I feel more comfortable with them than without.')
