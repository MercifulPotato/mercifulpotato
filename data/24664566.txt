Any relevant comments will be in the source code.<p>GitLab (and several others) can be self-hosted for free; and the walled garden (GitHub?) is tolerable enough. And as long as you keep your software development practices sensible (centred around git, not GitHub), there hardly is a wall really.<p>&gt; As far as local development is concerned, there&#x27;s no reason you can&#x27;t use all the git tools to manage your changes.<p>Certainly possible, but I didn&#x27;t manage to get git-svn working the last time I wanted to contribute to a SVN repo. In the end I just created a local git repo in-place and generated the patch with git format-patch.')
