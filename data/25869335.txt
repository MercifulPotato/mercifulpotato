I found the first one (9mo ago, dang, <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22767151" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22767151</a> ) but it didn’t really describe the purpose.<p>The purpose seems to be obvious; a YC backed site is launching. The interesting consideration is whether these are actually fresh launches or just awareness campaigns.<p>Btw, cool biz. Makes sense. I’ve spent way too much time doing by hand what you’re providing an out-of-box solution for. Good luck!')
