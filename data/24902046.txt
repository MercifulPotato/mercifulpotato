That strawman you built up is an example of toxicity.<p>The pettiness is that this looks like a non-issue blown into a flamewar where the BA has every right not to accept contributions from yourself because of past actions taken by the business you founded. I thought it was fine for them to close the issue was out of scope&#x2F;focus, it didn&#x27;t need more attention or for you to project your own gripes onto it.<p>All told this thread left a very bad taste in my mouth with respect to Wasmer, while I have a lot of respect for the BA and Wasmtime teams and I&#x27;m very glad that they found a home at Fastly.')
