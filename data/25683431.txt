There were Atari guys in my hood and Amiga guys, and I was an Amiga guy apperently. It was a hell of a computer. I&#x27;d go to a book store, browse through those fat AMIGA ROM Kernel books (could not afford all), go home, hack assembly code, hack C code, compile it with a copy of the Aztec C compiler, all night, go to school sleepless, and talk about graphics, sprites and whatnot with my friends. This was a hell of a time.')
