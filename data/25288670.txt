Scheme also feels more cohesive, at least R(4,5)RS which is what I know.<p>The appeal of Common Lisp (to me) are CLOS, the condition&#x2F;restart system, commercial portable GUI toolkits and specially the low level capabilities. Compared to it, Clojure just feels like a verbose APL.<p>Depending on the camp you are, Dylan, Factor and Julia are better Lisps than Scheme and Clojure, even if they are not s-expression based.')
