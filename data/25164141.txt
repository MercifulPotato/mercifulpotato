I have tried this multiple times and always give up. I ran FreeBSD for a decade as a server in a datacentre and have a deep and abiding love for it, but it doesn&#x27;t sound it makes a usable desktop these days. Ubuntu appears to be the desktop of choice, but I find it buggy, sluggish and tedious. I&#x27;d like a practical and speedy OS that is responsive and configurable. But I don&#x27;t know enough :)')
