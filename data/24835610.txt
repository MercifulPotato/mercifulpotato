This is used for example in gRPC, making the protocol far more versatile than given credit.<p>[1] No, I&#x27;m not talking about Server Push.<p>HTTP&#x2F;3<p>HTTP&#x2F;3 should bring benefits in wireless connections where TCP disconnections are frequent. QUIC handles connection identification so frequent TCP disconnects or even changing IPs would impact much less an HTTP&#x2F;3 connection. I don&#x27;t have the benchmarks but I would expect HTTP&#x2F;3 to shine in this scenario which is bound to be more and more relevant with mobile devices, 5G, etc... In ideal, wired network, conditions HTTP&#x2F;3 is probably not going to bring any improvement maybe even worse performance considering how much effort must have gone to optimizing TCP.<p>For me, both upgrades have a raison d&#x27;être but that doesn&#x27;t mean that they displace HTTP&#x2F;1.1 of all use cases. If you don&#x27;t care about the performance improvements or need full-duplex no need to use HTTP&#x2F;2, if you are not targeting mobile networks no need for HTTP&#x2F;3. Luckily protocol negotiation should be quite seamless.')
