But I learned how to write chrome extensions and it turned out extremely easy to insert my own CSS and JS snippets to the selected pages. So I just added few URL filters to remove most obnoxious tracking and ads, I added very few CSS edits to the selected websites to remove popups and I added some JS to youtube to remove its ads. Web is pretty fast and usable for me. I did not cut every ad, but I don&#x27;t often browse new websites and I&#x27;m okay with some ads as long as they&#x27;re not very bad.<p>The reason I don&#x27;t use uBlock is because I think that it&#x27;s overkill for me to run thousands of filters for every website in the world. And also I like the fact that I&#x27;m in control of my user agent. For example recently I turned off feature on some website which paused video when I switched to another tab. I did not like that feature, so I disabled corresponding JS handler, simple as that.')
