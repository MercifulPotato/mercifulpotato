They&#x27;re just saying they don&#x27;t have the cash so need to reduce my stake. They will budge on the 3% I&#x27;m sure, but I don&#x27;t value the equity much if I&#x27;m not involved.<p>I&#x27;m not too sure what a lawyer would recommend at this point? I also can&#x27;t really afford one personally - especially as I may be out of work soon haha..')
