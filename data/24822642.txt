Thankfully my case is relatively mild, but it can still be both disruptive and stressful at times (especially during my first few attacks, prior to formal diagnosis).<p>I spent a lot of time obsessing over it and the rest of my life was suffering as a result (it really exacerbated my trouble sleeping into a serious problem). In order to combat this I mostly tried to spend my time either being productive or doing whatever recreational activities my condition would allow.<p>Over time, as I started to eliminate worries (diagnosis, medication, learning what would cause flair-ups and just generally coming to a better understanding of it), it&#x27;s become more or less routine&#x2F;normal. Can&#x27;t say the same will apply to other people, but that&#x27;s how it has played out for me so far.<p>Best of luck and apologies that I can&#x27;t give a more helpful answer.')
