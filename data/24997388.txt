A good resource for this is the Kotlin Koans for example or the Kotlin STDlib itself. I also maintain some OSS projects that use these things extensively (pun intended). What&#x27;s also present in the language is the multiplatform functionality. You can&#x27;t do this in Java and you probably never will be able to do it. With this I think Kotlin is one of the two languages that&#x27;s capable of isomorphic behavior all across the board (you can write everything in Kotlin).')
