So every day that passes, the problem of scrubbing <i>enough</i> carbon actually becomes harder--whereas the problem of simply not putting it out there keeps the same magnitude.<p>Put differently, it costs &quot;one less airplane trip&quot; to prevent the carbon associated with  1 flight out of the air, but it costs an <i>increasing amount of trips</i> to get it out.<p>Lastly... we <i>know</i> how to keep carbon out of the air. It&#x27;s a politically difficult problem but one with a known solution.  <i>Just stop doing things</i>. And stop doing them by taxing them to oblivion.... whereas we don&#x27;t actually know how to get carbon out of the air in a clean way with sufficient magnitude in order to prevent runaway growth. And it goes without saying that in that scenario we&#x27;d probably have to reduce emissions as well!<p>The argument that reducing emissions to ~0 is unrealistic is true, but it&#x27;s more realistic than the alternative.')
