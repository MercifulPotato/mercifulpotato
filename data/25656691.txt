I&#x27;m wondering what contributions it has made to the wider programming community. I guess things like the warren engine may have helped inform efficient methods of interpreting other languages, or the parallel prolog investigations probably again helped other languages.<p>It&#x27;s pretty clear to me that functional languages from the time (e.g. Miranda) which live on it Haskel have had a massive impact on modern programming languages, and approaches to resolve complex threading problems. I&#x27;ve a feeling the prolog innovations may be quite wide too, just maybe less obvious.')
