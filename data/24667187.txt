My point was actually nothing to do with superforecasting but superforecasting is obvious bullshit. Probabilities aren&#x27;t computable in any consistent way, and the nature of these events mean that it is often very difficult to work out if someone&#x27;s track record is actually real (example: the sample size you need for events that occur infrequently is, in practice, much larger than the sample size you need for events that occur more frequently). In the real world, all that matters is information. The idea that there is a group of some super-smart genius forecasters is a rather common mistake of academics...in the real world, the issue is not having information (i.e. the outcome of a vote is not a random event, that is why investment banks&#x2F;hedge funds pay politicians for information). Btw, I think philosophers in the late 18th century understood this...suggesting that you can sit in your ivory tower and just reason through all these things should seem ludicrous.<p>Also, you cannot predict black swans. If you think you can, you don&#x27;t understand what black swan is. The point of a black swan is that it is unpredictable because it has never occurred before.')
