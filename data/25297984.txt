In Wall Street terms, he is aligned with Intel others who are shaking in their boots right now. He&#x27;s not going to say that the M1 is great until Intel&#x2F;NVidia&#x2F;etc. allow him to.<p>These pundits know which side of his bread is buttered.  He knows that his clients were caught off-guard by the M1 announcement. He needs to give his clients enough time to sell their Intel stock before it becomes conventional wisdom that the legacy chip makers have a business model that doesn&#x27;t work.<p>The history of the tech industry is dotted with pundits nay-saying anything new from companies they aren&#x27;t in bed with. Eventually they can&#x27;t deny reality any longer. Through the magic of the media&#x27;s short-term memory they change their song and deny they&#x27;ve every said anything else.<p>I remember in the 1980s when the top pundit of the industry was John C. Dvorak. Everyone read his column. EVERYONE.  The Amiga was a potential threat to John, who was aligned with the MS-DOS world. He wrote many columns about how multitasking was stupid because &quot;your desk can&#x27;t fit more than one keyboard and mouse&quot;.  Yeah, that was his reason.  Of course, once MS-Windows arrived, suddenly his column was about how multitasking is this new thing, the best thing, the thing everyone should have. If you don&#x27;t have it, you&#x27;re an ignorant loser.  I remember telling my friends that I wish I had saved his old, anti-Amiga&#x2F;anti-multitasking, columns because I want to show up at one of his public appearances to ask how MS-Windows allows you to fit so many keyboards on his desk.')
