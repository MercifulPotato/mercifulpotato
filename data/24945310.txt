We can easily add new fields and eventually deprecate old ones, evolving the API similarly to GraphQL.<p>Apparently, gRPC also has some introspection capabilities like GraphQL (since again you have a clear protobuf schema)  but I have never used them in my clients, and perhaps they are not as baked into the system as in GraphQL.')
