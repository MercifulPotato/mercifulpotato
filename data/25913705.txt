For example, some genes are regulated by a large number of enhancers, which results a combinatorial complexity. That is, you don&#x27;t need a large number of regulators for your system. Instead, there&#x27;s just a handful, but they&#x27;re mixed and matched to create thousands of combinations. Alternative splicing and post-translational modifications contribute to complexity as well, as you can create hundreds of thousands of protein variants with relatively few genes. And not to forget that genome is highly dynamic: there&#x27;re constant rearrangements, which allow producing complex patterns of gene expression.')
