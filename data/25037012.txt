While it could be argued specifying JS out-of-band would make it less likely for XSS to occur, anywhere that JS is specified is still likely to be programmed dynamically, with external inputs (db values, etc.), so the risk remains.<p>For example, a lot of modern XSS leverages innerHTML rather than server-side markup insertion. e.g.:<p><pre><code>  element.innerHTML = fetchData(endpoint);\n</code></pre>\nThis code is XSS-able (especially in the case of things like jsonp payloads), and it&#x27;s completely agnostic of where the JS is specified (in-band or out-of-band).<p>The proper solution, as a sibling commenter mentions, has already been specified: it&#x27;s CSP and it works well if used.')
