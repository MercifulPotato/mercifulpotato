I don’t expect any product I buy to suddenly stop working, unless it is defective or a wear-and-tear item that is expected to wear out. Software has no moving parts and therefore should not wear out, so it should work until I no longer need it.<p>Imagine if a hammer had a time bomb that destroyed itself after the manufacturer’s arbitrary “end of life” date. That would be totally unacceptable.')
