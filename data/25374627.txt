The players on the actual songbox pages themselves are nicer. I may pull the embed functionality as I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s used much.<p>Maybe when songbox scales it will be useful but right now the main use of my product is for tracks that are NOT YET public, so the embed thing was probably a waste of my time lol.')
