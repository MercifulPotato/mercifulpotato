The difference in presenters&#x27; accents now, compared to the &#x27;90s, is like night and day - a lot of them actually exaggerate their regional inflections now, particularly on the radio. Which is a good thing overall. Things can improve still but I&#x27;m not an advocate for the wanton destruction of RP either, there is value in a certain image the BBC built up over the years (particularly abroad) and losing it completely would be damaging. For example, that &quot;mildly bored&quot; tone that used to be commonplace in RP speakers, and which people directly associate with &quot;poshness&quot;, has basically disappeared already in public broadcasting... it&#x27;s a bit sad.<p>But yeah, in everything else, the disparity is pretty glaring. I knew I was doing well professionally when I noticed I was attending more and more meetings where the dominant accents were RP and other Mid-Southern England inflections, and I was doing badly when I heard less of that.')
