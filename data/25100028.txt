In my experience using these systems side-by-side for over 10 years now, it&#x27;s pretty obvious that Microsoft has stabilized while &quot;stealing&quot; Apple&#x27;s good parts, and that Apple hasn&#x27;t really evolved any further than they got in about 2010. In essence, Apple has allowed Microsoft to close the gap, although by about 2005 Apple managed to become so high quality on the computer market, and so ahead of its time (by &quot;stealing&quot; the good parts from Linux) that it&#x27;s hard for me to say how they could possibly keep that position for long. (I&#x27;m not saying that they literally stole things. Obviously they&#x27;ve done a lot of innovation themselves, but there are also some pretty obvious signs of &quot;inspiration&quot; going on too.)<p>There has for sure been downgrades with Apple too, but not really in regards to pure stability. In my experience most of it started in the 2010&#x27;s, when Apple decided to turn away from the pro market to focus more on the trend consumer market instead. At first it happened slowly with a few technical changes that put off web designers. However the first major blow was against Final Cut Pro. I guess it turned out well in the end, but in the beginning they stumbled badly and gave away a large market share to Adobe as media pros started fleeing from Apple. Soon after came system changes that made Adobe crash more often (I&#x27;m sure it was just a coincidence...), only resulting in customers fleeing from Apple as a whole. Today Apple Mac&#x27;s are decidedly more of a tightly controlled trend brand than the prosumer brand it used to be. (Kind of like Hasselblad has gone from the photo engineer&#x27;s brand to an almost purely luxury brand by now.) (Also I really miss the MagSafe lol.)')
