Not all do that to the best of their ability, and there&#x27;s residual bias even with those that do. But, statistically speaking, if you&#x27;re facing charges in US, and you&#x27;re innocent, it&#x27;s better to go with a judge than with a jury. And conversely, if you actually did it, you have better chances convincing the jury that you didn&#x27;t, or that you deserve a more lenient sentence.')
