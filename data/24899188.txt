There are laws e.g. prohibiting utility companies from refusing customers they do not like like people who criticize the company or nazis and &quot;nazis&quot;.<p>I do think that common infrastructure companies (analog to the utilities companies, just essential digital services) such as cloudflare, dns registrars, hosting and cloud providers shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to discriminate against people with the &quot;wrong&quot; opinions.<p>And even &quot;social media&quot; companies of a certain size&#x2F;marketshare&#x2F;market power should be severely limited in what they can censor (e.g. banning nudity and porn and gore etc is OK in my opinion, banning speech inciting violence is too, if narrowly defined, banning people because they belong to a certain political party or stream is not). Yeah, here be dragons; it would be hard to find a good  balance, but given the alternative of a few (social) media companies right now growing ever more powerful it still would be the right thing to do.')
