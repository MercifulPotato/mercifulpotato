Sure, your neural network is hooked up to a basic chemical analyzer and a couple other nifty I&#x2F;O devices, but they all just produce neural firing patterns. All that <i>thought</i> and <i>feeling</i> are meaningless statistical noise when looked at in a micro scale.<p>Who is to say what GPT3 <i>feels</i> when processing text about wine? Maybe it really <i>likes</i> the sensations of certain firing patterns triggered by symbols in particular orders. And maybe with enough complexity it will be able to describe the sensation of these firing patterns.<p>I don&#x27;t see any reason to believe your firing patterns are more &quot;real&quot; than GPT[n]&#x27;s.<p>You do have access to better equipment than GPT3, however I&#x27;d hesitate to ascribe too much significance to this. A future machine intelligence with integrated gas chromatograph might conclude that humans don&#x27;t really like or dislike wine itself; mostly they judge taste by the shape of the bottle and the price tag:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2011&#x2F;10&#x2F;you-are-not-so-smart-why-we-cant-tell-good-wine-from-bad&#x2F;247240&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;health&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2011&#x2F;10&#x2F;you-are-n...</a><p>The symbol processing may be more important than you think.')
