Several other companies have announced similar policies and this trend will likely become widely adopted very soon.<p>So far, geographical proximity to a job has so far been an important factor for several employment based visa types like the h1-b. With this quickly changing, can you share some thoughts on how the diminishing importance of a physical work place and proximity to offices will impact various employment related visa types? Is there any indication that some guidance or rule changes to accommodate the changing nature of how we work will be considered any time soon?')
