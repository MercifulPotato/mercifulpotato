But if more people would follow the rules with a bit of discipline, things would be much better. As shown in Asian countries, which mostly don&#x27;t have a Covid-19 problem. My list wasn&#x27;t meant as preventing Covid-19 or similar diseases completely, but like things we can do to make the next pandemic a lesser problem in those months during which we wait for the vaccine.
