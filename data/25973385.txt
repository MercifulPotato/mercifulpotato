In my opinion “finding the square root” isn’t a “problem”, perhaps precisely because it doesn’t involve search. Something like “how can I determine the side length of this square I needed 67 sq feet of tile to cover” is a problem: I could use your algorithm on paper, I could guess based on prior experience, I could measure, I could estimate, I could use a calculator, etc. Which of those I pick is a search based on the constraints at hand (how much time do I have, what resources do I have, how precise an answer do I need, etc), and the act of considering many approaches to the problem and proceeding with some based on the constraints at hand is evolution.<p>Again, this is all semantics imo, so not really a debate so much as sharing world views. Which perhaps is what debate is. Hm.')
