At any rate my suggestion&#x2F;idea was to take inspiration from:<p>&gt; If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if it could work with, or be a good idea for, the DMCA. But I&#x27;d guess one would say something along the lines of &quot;any invocation of provisions in the DMCA revoke any license grants herein&quot;.')
