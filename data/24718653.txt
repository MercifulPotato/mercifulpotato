Literally no one treated me as deviant outcast and no one except players cared that I play D&amp;D.  There is not dichotomy between D&amp;D vs friends, just like there is no dichotomy between playing music instrument vs friends.<p>It is just that thing, most kids who don&#x27;t share your favorite activity just don&#x27;t care about that activity. If they are nice, they will listen a bit about it.')
