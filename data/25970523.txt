Perhaps announce they&#x27;re going to do a major rebrand, partner with Starbucks and become some game cafe of sorts?<p>I imagine GameStop, if their management is up for it, wants to create the expectation that their new true value is greater than their value a month ago and less than what it is now. If they can issue new shares at the difference and revitalize their company perhaps something meaningful could come from this for them.')
