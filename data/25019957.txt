Republicans represent &quot;Whites&quot; (e.g. 92% of Trump voters in the 2016 election were White).<p>As long as there are conservative Whites living in California in sufficient numbers, there will be a Republican Party to represent their interestsâ€”that&#x27;s how a &quot;representative democracy&quot; is supposed to work. Republicans lose when there aren&#x27;t enough Whites with conservative beliefs to elect them, and win when there are enough.<p>Republicans today remind me of the Confederacy in a lot of ways, and I expect them to fade away over time in a similar manner. The US can no longer support an effectively White-only national party.')
