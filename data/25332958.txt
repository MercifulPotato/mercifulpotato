It&#x27;s saying that staying informed != participating in politics. Which seems fair and isn&#x27;t excluding anyone. If you just read the articles and chat with friends about politics, you are not _participating_ in politics.<p>&quot;Political hobbyism&quot; feels a bit like the style of virtue signaling that&#x27;s ridiculed so much. You can show how smart you are, you can have all the most virtuous opinions but let&#x27;s not pretend you&#x27;re actually contributing.')
