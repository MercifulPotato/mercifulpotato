It could well be just rounded to the nearest integer, making my +500ms assumption wrong. However, this would result in 59.51s being displayed as 0:60, though it should be 1:00. Rounding up has the same problem.<p>I went through the same assumptions coding my own timer. Let&#x27;s just round everything. But this resulted in 51.0s being displayed as 1:51 on the timer, with rounding up it&#x27;s even worse resulting in 1:01:51. So at least hours and minutes have to be rounded down. But that makes it even more confusing that seconds are NOT Math.floor().<p>So in the end I &quot;gave up&quot; and used the date-fns package (works great) but it also rounds everything down. That&#x27;s why I believe that iOS adds 500ms so the minutes and hours work properly.')
