So someone that does a few sprints, to max intensity, over 20 minutes actually will have better cardiovascular health than someone that runs or jogs for an hour or more.<p>If you’re sprinting at full exertion for a few minutes, you’re able to hit a much higher max than you would if you were running long distance.')
