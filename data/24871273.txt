Microsoft, on the other hand, was blithely jackhammering away at the foundation of their business.<p>For sure, I think MS was panicking tbh.  They missed the mobile revolution (This was Ballmer and Gates), and then cloud was starting to take off and realized their OS and Office products were not optimized or read for that shift.   I think they realized they had to change, and change fast and as a result didn&#x27;t go well.  But at least it started the change we see today with MS (for good or bad).')
