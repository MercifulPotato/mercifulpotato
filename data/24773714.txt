If we were talking about two left parties competing in our “non-partisan” General elections, you would have a point, but it is Democrats top to bottom, who are only slightly distinguishable from each other in the context of San Francisco politics. In the context of California politics, they’re expected to all carry the same amount of fealty to the Unions, the State Party and its platform as any other California Democrat and in the context of Democrats nationwide, the San Francisco Democrats may as well be the bloody Borg.<p>The Mayoral special election between London Breed, Mark Leno and Jane Kim could be called “competitive”, but no matter who won (London won), the trajectory and policies of the City would have remained effectively the same with the only difference being who could advance their career that year.<p>Or to put it another way, it is a very competitive environment as long as you are a Democrat, but it is not an ideologically or politically competitive environment and the policies of the City government are stagnant (Fix homelessness! Save Muni! Stop car break-ins! Build more housing but only the right kind, maybe! etc.). This is unlikely to change under single party rule.')
