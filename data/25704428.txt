After two serious runs at buying TSLA in 2018, where we got to the brink and then backed off, I made a strategic mistake. I was concerned about the risk of me overreacting to trivial events, so I restricted my intake of stock market information to reduce that risk. My mistake was, I put in too heavy of a filter.<p>My mistake is what created the opportunity for my brother to substantively contribute. He could have ridden to the rescue of our joint project by mentioning it to me when TSLA hit 200. I had repeatedly opined in August 2018 that it seemed possible for TSLA to fall as low as 200 before climbing to the hoped-for 3800 or 6000 in a decade. My brother saw TSLA hit 200 in May 2019, but he didn’t see fit to mention it.<p>&gt; Your brother sounds like he wasn&#x27;t really on board with the plan,<p>Yes, in hindsight, you’re right that my brother wasn’t really on board with the plan. All I can say is that he gave every indication that he _was_ on board. It appears to me that he lied in my face. This speaks to family issues that aren’t going to be of interest to HN so I’ll say no more, except to note that missed investment opportunities are a thing that can foreground classic human problems.<p>&gt; which is the prudent, sensible course of action.<p>Bold action when opportunity presents is a component of that, in a broader view.')
