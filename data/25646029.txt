Within a couple of weeks it was immediately obvious to me how much more alert I was throughout the day, how much of my normal workday sluggishness and brain fog was artificially caused by caffeine, and how much less greasy my skin was<p>Interestingly, I also quit fairly quickly, about two years ago.  Honestly though, I did not experience such major, obvious benefits.  I was definitely overdoing coffee in the past, and when it got to the point that I needed two strong ones before 9AM to get going, I decided it&#x27;s time to stop taking loans out against my sleep.<p>But basically post-quit, I have similar levels of energy&#x2F;tiredness, overall (compared to a normal, on-coffee day).  It&#x27;s just less peaky and trough-y, and sleep is more predictable. The main difference I would say is that on that rare occasion when I now have a coffee, it has an extremely sharp effect.  It&#x27;s pretty odd, and I&#x27;m wondering if people are overblowing the effects, or if I&#x27;m just the odd one out.')
