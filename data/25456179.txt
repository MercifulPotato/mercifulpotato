A couple of hours with a few hundred assorted components and some scrap PCBs will help to perfect the steps (tin the bit, hold the bit to the joint, apply the solder, pull the solder wire away, pull the bit away, inspect the joint).  Things are a little bit trickier today because the alloy of the solder and the flux you use do make a difference, but lead-free solder today is very good.<p>Then practice with PVC insulated wire. The PVC insulation shrinks if it gets hot so this is good practice at speeding up.<p>I looked through the NASA document and most of it is not advance technique.<p>EDIT: people are saying &quot;good tools&quot; and I wanted to say a bit more about that. You can buy an iron for a few dollars from ebay. Don&#x27;t use those. But almost any iron above that is going to be fine. I&#x27;d prefer to always be using Weller or Hako, but failing that any of the chinese no-name irons with temperature control are going to be good enough for most hobbyist projects.  I love my Lindstrom and Bahco snips, but you can get good-enough cutters much cheaper.  If this is something you&#x27;re going to be doing all day every day you&#x27;ll want to invest in the tools.')
