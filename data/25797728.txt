All you needed was to align the mount correctly, and then a simple clock can run the movement.<p>Alt-Az requires a computer to tell the dials where to go at every step of the way and are very non-linear dependent on absolute position on the sky.<p>Also Alt-Az gives a much more compact design.   So as long as you have the computer to control it, isn&#x27;t Alt-Az preferable?')
