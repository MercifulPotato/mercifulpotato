If someone comes to you with a problem they say that they are stuck on and can&#x27;t figure out, please don&#x27;t respond solely by giving them encouragement to just keep plugging along. Either encourage them to find someone else with time to listen or give your time to listen.<p>1. It feels incredibly _isolating_ to be told something like, &quot;Thats just imposter syndrome. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll figure it out.&quot;<p>2. It is much harder to focus and succeed when you&#x27;re trying to push yourself down a path you think is probably fruitless.<p>3. It is much harder to solve problems when you don&#x27;t have a sounding board. When you can have conversational space to teach someone else about the problem space, paths open up.')
