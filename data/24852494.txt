I mean, worth more than paper, right?<p>Why do people have such difficulty grasping the abstraction of credit? And that it has value?<p>The entire system is based on credit - which is more intangible that &#x27;bushels of wheat&#x27; or &#x27;shiny rocks&#x27; but frankly it&#x27;s not that hard to grasp.<p>The bonds are not &#x27;paper&#x27; they are a &#x27;promise to provide some value&#x27; - and most people take TBills at at least face value because the US Gov tends to honour the contract.<p>A currency based on a shiny rock has only one, small possible advantage, in that there is essentially a fixed supply of said rocks, and that it cannot be debased, however, this is in most ways <i>not an advantage</i> i.e. it precludes the possibility of any monetary policy.<p>Ergo we have systems of credit, currency based on that, and a whole bunch of rules around it.<p>&quot;But the actual intrinsic value of the materials in a rare painting worth hundreds of millions of dollars might be a few bucks at best.&quot;<p>No, when things are configured in a certain way, they have value more than the constituent parts. A &#x27;Tractor&#x27; is worth more than the &#x27;Metal&#x27; it is made from. &#x27;Art&#x27; is something that people like to look at beyond it&#x27;s constituent bits of paper and dyes.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s abstract, but it&#x27;s not hard to grasp.')
