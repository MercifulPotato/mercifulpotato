This is the lowest form of shallow content that receives millions of dollars to be in front, surpassing good stories by authors with notoriety on the subject.<p>Facebook is the place where some of my &quot;acquaintances&quot; learned that Bill Gates gives them COVID, that everything is a conspiracy designed to take something from them, that the vaccine will implant them nano-chips or 5G &quot;reactions&quot; and sleeper nano-whatever that will wake-up on the right frequency.<p>I hate that platform because it gives a big mouth to everyone, to the bad apple that can now infect the rest over the internet. One look at shared.com homepage and I knew...I couldn&#x27;t be bothered with their story.')
