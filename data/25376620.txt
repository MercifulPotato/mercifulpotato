Apple does not have control over this, as evidenced by the legality ruling of jailbreaking.<p>&gt;Apple makes the devices, they are 100% legally allowed to only allow apps from their own App Store and that precedent has already been set.<p>This is false. As proven time and time again, the Device Owner has full legal control after purchase.<p>It is monopolistic behavior due to the scope of the control from Apple. The devices are the owner&#x27;s property, and it is monopolistic for them to implement software&#x2F;policies&#x2F;hardware blocks, that prevent users from using the devices as they see fit.<p>Take a simplistic example, Keurig. Keurig tried to prevent users from using any other coffee pod besides theirs. There is precedent to these monopoly lawsuits.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;2913062&#x2F;k-cups-war&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;time.com&#x2F;2913062&#x2F;k-cups-war&#x2F;</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;topclassactions.com&#x2F;lawsuit-settlements&#x2F;consumer-products&#x2F;beverages&#x2F;keurig-agrees-to-settle-indirect-buyers-antitrust-class-action-lawsuits-for-31m&#x2F;#:~:text=Keurig%20has%20agreed%20to%20a,September%202010%20and%20August%202020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;topclassactions.com&#x2F;lawsuit-settlements&#x2F;consumer-pro...</a>.')
