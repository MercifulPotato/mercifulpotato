For example, a simple burglary ends up with &quot;breaking and entering&quot;, &quot;trespassing&quot;, &quot;theft&quot;, etc. This way, the prosecutor &quot;throws the book at you&quot; and if all the crimes apply, you are facing 50+ years in jail. You are then pressured to skip the court system and accept a plea bargain without facing a jury of your peers. This is a perversion of the judicial system.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Overcriminalization-Limits-Criminal-Douglas-Husak&#x2F;dp&#x2F;0195399013" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Overcriminalization-Limits-Criminal-D...</a>')
