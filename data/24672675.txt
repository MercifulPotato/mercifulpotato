The points become rephrased:<p>&gt; that there is an epistemic reality about which all rational observers can know half of the ontic facts<p>&gt; that this epistemic reality is governed by natural laws which are themselves epistemic<p>And so on. Crucially, there are no local hidden variable theories which can reproduce what we observe already; there are situations where there cannot possibly have been an objective ontic reality in the laboratory.')
