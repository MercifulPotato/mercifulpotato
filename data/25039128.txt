We did it based on the incentives that the governments offered us to operate,” Schmidt told one interviewer in 2012. “It’s called capitalism.”<p>As much as I enjoy watching people dissemble while describing their true actions, there’s not really anyone naive enough to believe Schmidt didn’t actively create the rules google currently operates under, is there?<p>Maybe he really was just a bystander in his company as it poured millions of dollars into lobbying the American government and he was powerless to stop them.<p>Or maybe he though the lobbying did nothing and he thought wasting money was a good thing.<p>Or he’s just lying and hopes people don’t acknowledge that there were maybe half a dozen people who had more power to shape the laws and regulations he operated under. But trying to just pass himself off as an uninvolved observer just rings thoroughly disingenuous.')
