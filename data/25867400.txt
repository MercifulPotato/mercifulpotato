If Elastic wanted to force Amazon to contribute modifications back, they could have switched to the AGPL to do that. But they didn&#x27;t — because, as the AWS blog points out, <i>AWS was already contributing their changes back.</i><p>The problem wasn&#x27;t that the spirit of open-source was violated. The problem was that AWS is better at acquiring customers for their competing hosting service. So Elastic switched the license to the non-open-source SSPL, which makes offering a hosting service essentially impossible (to satisfy the terms, Amazon would need to open-source effectively all of AWS).<p>This license switch is more antithetical to the spirit of open source — that is, user freedom — than what AWS was doing, which was offering a hosted version of open-source software that competed with Elastic&#x27;s hosting business.<p>Ultimately I think selling hosting of a single piece of open-source software as a funding model for developing a single piece of open-source software (e.g. Mongo, Elastic) has proven to not be a very sustainable funding model; at least, not if you&#x27;re hoping for VC-backed company sized returns. And... I can see why that doesn&#x27;t feel great. At one point, hosting was believed to be the silver bullet model as compared to consulting. But ultimately I think it&#x27;s just not worked out: hosting as a model makes sense for proprietary software, but for OSS, either:<p>* You pay developers to build the software and also pay more developers to build the hosting stack — but then your competition only pays for the latter and can beat you on price, or<p>* You only pay to build the hosting stack, but then — what&#x27;s the point? You haven&#x27;t solved funding the software development.')
