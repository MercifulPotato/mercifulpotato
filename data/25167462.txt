I have Bootcamp installed on an exteral HDD. I find the user experience on both Linux (desktop) and Windows to be pretty miserable compared to macOS. Having said that, I run three headless 4GB pis with ubuntu installed on them and continue to love the cli experience in linux, as long as I can drive from macOS. :)')
