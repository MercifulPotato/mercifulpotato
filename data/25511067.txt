Pointing out the performance impact and cost to end users, how diabolical it is for those on lower latency or poorer network connectivity (i.e. most of the world), and so on.<p>Same thing as always happens with these pendulum swings, newer engineers come in convinced everyone before them is an idiot, are capable of building their new thing and hyping it up such that other newer engineers are sold on it while the &quot;old guard&quot; effectively says &quot;please listen to me, there&#x27;s good reasons why we don&#x27;t do it this way&quot; and get ignored.  Worse, they&#x27;ll get told they&#x27;re wrong, only to be proven right all along.<p>I&#x27;m not denying there are obstructionist greybeard types that just refuse to acknowledge merits in new approaches, but any and all critique is written off as being cut from the same cloth.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly possible to iterate on new ideas and approaches while not throwing away what we&#x27;ve spent decades learning (&#x27;Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it&#x27;), but tech just seems especially determined not to grow up.')
