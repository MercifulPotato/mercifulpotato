There are several reasons I chose it:<p>* It&#x27;s not <i>extremely</i> limited like an NES, e.g. I can imagine some of my game ideas working well on it.<p>* The limitations it <i>does</i> have restrict what I can do, helping to prevent me from scope-creeping myself out of ever releasing something.<p>* It&#x27;s a well-known platform, with several high-quality emulators. This means that no matter how much modern hardware changes over time, it should remain playable due to the fact that emulators will be kept up to date on newer hardware.<p>* To your point about it not becoming obsolete in the future, it&#x27;s a fixed piece of hardware. I can learn the ins and outs of that hardware, and my knowledge&#x2F;tools etc. will still be useful if I want to make another game on the same platform.')
