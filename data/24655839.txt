Certainly, it seems &quot;fair&quot; to ensure the punishment is equal to the crime, but fair isn&#x27;t the same as just. Why don&#x27;t you go Code of Hammurabi on someone, and inflict the same kind of injury? The logic still holds. Of course, it now requires people willing to commit torture and rape and the like, to equal the crime, but that&#x27;s the logical conclusion of trying to be &quot;fair&quot;.<p>But even without taking it to its conclusion, I&#x27;d contend &quot;fairness&quot; as you define it there isn&#x27;t necessarily the best outcome for society; an ex-hacker is probably an excellent choice when hiring for electronic security, an ex-robber an excellent choice for hiring for physical security, etc. Even a murderer can go on to great things that benefit society. I mean, hell, Miguel De Cervantes, author of Don Quixote, the first modern novel, wrote his first published work while in prison. The Birdman of Alcatraz (Robert Stroud), a murderer, published major works in ornithology, and found a cure for a bird disease. Rehabilitated criminals can still benefit all of us, as well as redeem themselves in their own eyes by doing good for themselves and their loved ones.<p>But all that aside, you&#x27;re saying you believe the additional punishment should be societal scorn carried out by vigilantes (i.e., average citizens deciding the person shouldn&#x27;t hold a job even though they&#x27;ve paid the price the courts decided on)? That hardly seems just or &#x27;fair&#x27;.')
