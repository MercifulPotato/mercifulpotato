I&#x27;m pretty sure you can make the exact same mistake: copying destination unto source instead of the contratry.  I used a Windows software and not DD for it was a Windows computer and I didn&#x27;t feel like booting a live Linux CD to do the dump but under Linux, I always use dd.<p>Is it really that hard to learn that in dd the &#x27;i&#x27; in &quot;if&quot; means &quot;input&quot; and that the &#x27;o&#x27; in &quot;of&quot; means &quot;output&quot;?<p>The problem with &quot;making things simple using a GUI&quot; is that you typically totally lose the ability to do not just advanced things but even &quot;average&quot; things.  For example for read-only media I always write the checksum on the media itself, using a sharpie. That way I can easily verify that my disk (or the copy) is ok doing a dd and piping into sha256sum (there are some gotchas to keep in mind but it works fine when you know how to do it).<p>Like, say, a Debian install ISO. I like to have these on read-only medium and make sure the checksum matches the official one (so I prefer a write-once &#x2F; read-only DVD than a read&#x2F;write memory stick).<p>How do you that with the GUI? Piping into a cryptographic hash?<p>I can understand that people prefer GUI over command line for many things but I think that people imaging entire disks are at least power users and can learn the difference between &quot;input&quot; and &quot;output&quot;.  Heck, maybe it&#x27;s even doing them a service to teach them to use the CLI.  Maybe it&#x27;s the opportunity to teach them about piping, about cryptographic hashes, etc.<p>And once again: you can totally screw up with a GUI too.<p>I don&#x27;t mean it in a bad way at all but... Linux on the desktop (which I use since 20 years) ain&#x27;t exactly enjoying a huge market share compared to Windows or OS X and I think that&#x27;s fine. If a Linux user cannot or isn&#x27;t willing to learn dd, maybe that user is better served by Windows or OS X. And really: I don&#x27;t mean it in a bad way. I don&#x27;t think Linux has to &quot;win&quot; the Desktop war. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s wrong not to use Linux.<p>But I do think it&#x27;s wrong to believe users willing to learn Linux cannot learn the difference between input and ouptut.<p>Also a strong case can be made that someone for whom it&#x27;s a &quot;disaster&quot; to overwrite it&#x27;s main drive is one hard disk failure away from disaster anyway.<p>I&#x27;m for educating users, not baby-feeding them with tools that are going to keep them in the dark and reinforce their bad practices (like not doing proper backups and hence being &quot;one hard drive failure&quot; away from disaster).')
