I&#x27;ve personally worked on a Rust web server with several significant-sized libraries, including Serde which was mentioned in the article as being pretty large, and turnaround time was 1-2 seconds for small edits to my own code (including the server startup time). I kept a watch script running that rebuilt and restarted on each change, and the experience was comparable to Express.')
