At some point, I became an old Asian guy with old Asian guy values that the second generation Asians and young kids don’t necessarily agree with. And I quickly realized that one of the downsides about being a minority is that it’s very hard to have a social debate within a minority group without it getting subsumed into larger political debates occurring among the majority. A handful of young, progressive Asians get massively amplified by young progressive running outfits like the Atlantic. The Atlantic isn’t exactly reaching out to me, much less my parents, to ask them “hey, what do you think of the idea that assimilation is racist?” (They’d say that’s absurd, and I’d agree, but nobody asks us.) It was very jarring for me to realize how much power young white progressives had to communicate to the next generation what Asian identity and values mean.<p>I wonder if Herman Cain ever felt this way. There’s plenty of Black conservatives (regardless of what party they vote for). But you hardly see those views represented in media.<p>I think this dynamic can even drown out the majority view within a minority group. My dad—a Democrat and immigrant from a Muslim country—was commenting that he was annoyed how the media made Ilhan Omar ‘the face of Islam’ in America given how “extreme” her views are. For obvious reasons, most Muslim Americans are actually squarely in the conservative wing of the Democratic Party, and indeed a majority voted for George W. Bush back in 2000. But you’d never know that by the media coverage. Both the right and the left have decided—for the same reason—that Omar is the archetype of Muslims in America.')
