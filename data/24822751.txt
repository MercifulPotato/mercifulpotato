In relativity, two spatially separated objects (or two ends of a spatially extended single object) that have the same proper acceleration in the same direction do not stay at rest relative to each other; they move apart, as seen in each of their own frames. This is different from the behavior predicted by Newtonian mechanics. In order to have the two objects (or two ends of a single extended object) remain at rest relative to each other, the one in front has to have a smaller proper acceleration than the one in back. (Rindler coordinates are often used to describe this case.)')
