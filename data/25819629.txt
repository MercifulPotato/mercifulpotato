The earth is clearly flat and that is a sensible assumption if you haven&#x27;t left your local area or been in space or seen a picture from space.<p>Or not. Flat earthers are quacks.<p>It is the same principle essentially. It is illogical to think &quot;hey if I keep walking that way I&#x27;ll hit a wall eventually&quot;. That is why flat earthers are quacks from the beginning.<p>The same principle applies to space. What quack seriously thinks that eventually there is just a wall in space or that it wraps around?<p>Wrapping around makes zero sense in 3-dimensional space.')
