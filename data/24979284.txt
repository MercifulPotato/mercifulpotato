Some of the scalped cards were being listed upwards of $3000 for a 3080. Many had fake bids, I watched as eBay did nothing. People were even trying to mislead users by selling cardboard images of the Nvidia cards, but in a way it looked like you were buying a card (even if the description did say cardboard).')
