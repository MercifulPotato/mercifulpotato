From this list Monoid, Iosveka, Anonymous Pro, and Share Tech Mono at least fall into that category. I think it&#x27;s meant to be sort of a callback to bitmap fonts? I know the Linux console font (terminus) looks similar, but that&#x27;s clearly due to technical limitations. Is there something wrong with my font rendering, or are there people actually liking this style? If you do like this style, what OS do you use? I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a common trend where such fonts render better on macOS or something.')
