Lot of people here, especially Americans that should care about their country&#x27;s sovereignty and safety, would actually agree to the ban if they knew that Tiktok is a propaganda tool that is influencing your children and is also a data mining paradise that can be weaponized to enhance data collection for targeting dissidents or other nefarious purposes. The fact is, not enough people in this country understand that China is an <i>adversary</i>, not a friend to the US. In fact, &quot;adversary&quot; is putting it lightly.
