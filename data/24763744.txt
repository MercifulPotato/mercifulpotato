If so, I canâ€™t see any mention of it.<p>Yes, I did.  And to make sure we&#x27;re talking about the same thing, the article is:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arcdigital.media&#x2F;abolish-the-cash-bail-system-3cf6476ecaae?gi=ba1434b72697" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;arcdigital.media&#x2F;abolish-the-cash-bail-system-3cf647...</a><p>Here&#x27;s the section I mentioned:<p>&quot;It is also questionable whether the cash bail system does a better job guaranteeing individuals will appear in court. Washington, D.C. was an early pioneer in pretrial reform, eliminating secured money bail and bolstering pretrial services in 1992. The results have been extraordinary. Today, it releases 94 percent of those accused for crimes as they await a court hearing, and 91 percent of them appear in court for their trial. New Jersey likewise passed a suite of criminal justice reforms in 2016 that essentially eliminated cash bail and created a new pretrial services program. A year after the reforms were implemented, 95 percent of defendants were released pretrial and 89 percent of them appeared at their trial dates. These rates of appearance for trial are similar to, or better than, the rates of appearance before the reforms were implemented. It would appear, then, that the cash bail system is not required to guarantee a high rate of court compliance nor does it do better than the alternatives.&quot;<p>And here are the links that were embedded in the section above supporting the author&#x27;s assertions:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cjpp.law.harvard.edu&#x2F;assets&#x2F;BailReform_WEB.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cjpp.law.harvard.edu&#x2F;assets&#x2F;BailReform_WEB.pdf</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;02&#x2F;644085158&#x2F;what-changed-after-d-c-ended-cash-bail" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;02&#x2F;644085158&#x2F;what-changed-after-...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americanprogress.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;criminal-justice&#x2F;reports&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;16&#x2F;481543&#x2F;ending-cash-bail&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.americanprogress.org&#x2F;issues&#x2F;criminal-justice&#x2F;rep...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.njcourts.gov&#x2F;courts&#x2F;assets&#x2F;criminal&#x2F;2018cjrannual.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.njcourts.gov&#x2F;courts&#x2F;assets&#x2F;criminal&#x2F;2018cjrannua...</a>')
