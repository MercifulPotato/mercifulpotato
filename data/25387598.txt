IIRC from the industry data I had access to, there were over 100 different models in a variety of form factors from a couple dozen OEMs concurrently being sold at its peak.  So it was at least ahead of all the alternatives before that point, which weakens the argument that it was &quot;other considerations&quot; that were the main culprit.')
