Item(by='ghaff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610292267, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25713706, text='There are fairly predictable quirks about Wikipedia:<p>- Articles in areas of math written in impenetrable jargon<p>- Encyclopedic articles about obscure, trivial subjects<p>- Stubs about relatively important individuals<p>- Tug-of-war entries about current events<p>- Random endless lists<p>- A lot of procedural fighting about original research, notability, etc.<p>But, as you say, a way to get pointers to or a quick take on a topic, it&#x27;s pretty good. Am I going to take anything Wikipedia says to the bank without double-checking? Probably not. And, if you look deeply enough into some topics, you find a lot of circular references to some other single source of information. But overall, it&#x27;s a good go-to reference.')
