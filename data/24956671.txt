I just checked out of curiosity and Edge (for lack of an installed Chrome) used &quot;just&quot; ~380MiB for a rather big website.<p>Sure, websites (and especially ads!) taking up unnecessary amounts of memory and performance play into this, too, but the expectation that you can just leave 10 bloated websites open on a glorified netbook from 2014 is more to blame than anything else.')
