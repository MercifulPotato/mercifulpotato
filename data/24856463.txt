Item(by='seszett', descendants=None, kids=[24857183], score=None, time=1603361531, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24851703, text='I just discovered Mullvad (just a VPN provider) and for some reason, they don&#x27;t have &quot;English&quot; in the list of languages available for their site.<p>So they redirected me to the Dutch version because I&#x27;m in a nominally Dutch-speaking region, and I had no option to get it in English. I had to go with half-translated French until I noticed that I could replace the &quot;fr&quot; in the URL with &quot;en&quot;, and actually get to an English-language website.<p>The region-based redirection was annoying enough, and the half-assed translation job was expected, but not even providing an easy way to get back to English is really idiotic.<p>I still wish I had some kind of system that would automatically use a connection in the right country for geoblocked content. For now I just use SSH proxies to (my own) strategically located servers combined with Firefox Containers and Container Proxies, but it&#x27;s all manual.')
