You will see that the heavier ones tend to fall faster than the light objects. If all you care about is predicting which object will fall faster, you could simply say gravity pulls the heavier one faster and call it a day.<p>But if you were to forego predictive power and seek understanding, you&#x27;d eventually see that objects fundamentally fall at the same rate, and a confounding factor of air resistance was the reason for the observed discrepency. With this deeper understanding, you can make models of gravity and fluid dynamics which are not just more accurate for the specific cases you measured, but also extensible to other cases like the orbits of planets.')
