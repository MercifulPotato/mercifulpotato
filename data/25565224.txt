I&#x27;m working on some login detection logic using IPs, user agents, etc to determine when a log in maybe be suspicious.<p>If you&#x27;ve taken on this kind of project, would love to discuss what worked&#x2F;didn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t want to reinvent the wheel.<p>My approach will be to track logins by a combination of user agents, locations and timestamps, and then when a new login comes in, come up with a way to make a login threat level based on what&#x27;s been seen before.<p>If it&#x27;s over a certain value, send off an email to the account owner to notify them.')
