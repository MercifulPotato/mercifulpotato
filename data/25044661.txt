No one I&#x27;ve known at the university or in 5 different software companies that I&#x27;ve worked at used vim&#x2F;emacs as their primary code editor. Vi was used sometimes to change a config file or to inspect something while SSH-ed into a server, but IDEs have always been used as the primary ways to write source code.<p>I&#x27;ve mainly worked with Java, JavaScript and Python. I started with NetBeans and Eclipse for Java at the uni, but soon moved to the JetBrains stack (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm). Everywhere I worked people have been using mostly IntelliJ, some of them VS Code recently.<p>I tried learning vim properly, memorizing the shortcuts etc. I had several attempts at this throughout the years. Mostly because of articles like this one, hyping vim&#x2F;emacs. But I always felt it slowed me down soooo much. Modern IDEs allow me to edit code, jump though files, classes, methods, variable usages, rename all usages of a class&#x2F;method across the whole codebase sooo quickly!<p>And almost everything works out of the box. I don&#x27;t have to install plugins or configure anything to have syntax highlighting, git etc. I import a Gradle project and IntelliJ knows everything.<p>I do get the argument from one of the comments that this isolates you from how javac&#x2F;maven works under the hood, and that it can be bad. But throughout the years you&#x27;ll learn those things eventually. And in the meantime you don&#x27;t need to master them to be productive.<p>I completely don&#x27;t get the comments that you need to constantly Google things like &quot;How to do X in Eclipse&quot;. Some of them you do need to Google, but most things are straightforward. Meanwhile when working with vim I kept constantly Googling things like &quot;how to replace a word&quot;, &quot;how to copy a line&quot;, &quot;how to delete a line&quot;...<p>To sum up, I agree with one of the comments that said that it&#x27;s the vocal minority that keeps talking about vim&#x2F;emacs that makes it look so ubiquitous. In reality I feel like 95% of programmers use IDEs for most of their work, get their job done and don&#x27;t talk about it. That&#x27;s why it looks to be the other way on the internet.')
