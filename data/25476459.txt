And that side becomes stronger with every repetition of your code.<p>Also, some of the negatives of not-repeating-yourself are not general:<p>* Often your repetitions themselves are localized.<p>* Sometimes, you can generalize your code even _more_, to factor out the non-general parts, so that you end up with a generalization of the scheme&#x2F;mechanism, applied with specific details.<p>* You can limit your DRY to within your scope of ownership, i.e. have module-local &#x2F; unit-local utility constructs. Then, only if you agree with others on the generalization, do yu surrender ownership.<p>etc.')
