In some (many? most?) other countries that&#x27;s reversed and such activities are much less prevalent.<p>I imagine that once STIR&#x2F;SHAKEN is fully implemented, a variety of actors will step in to capitalize on the opportunity to provide blocking&#x2F;tagging spam&#x2F;scam calls as well.<p>As with most things, there isn&#x27;t a simple, singular solution.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fcc.gov&#x2F;call-authentication" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fcc.gov&#x2F;call-authentication</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;STIR&#x2F;SHAKEN" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;STIR&#x2F;SHAKEN</a>')
