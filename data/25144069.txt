Perhaps some users will only start to care about the potential for censorship when a site being censored is one they want to access.<p>Generally, anyone using third party DNS is potentially subject to censorship via an easy, popular method.<p>SNI is another easy method.  Browsers by default send plaintext SNI to every HTTPS site.  However not all HTTPS sites require SNI (check for presence of SNI or check SNI against Host header).  Additionally, all Cloudflare sites support encrypted SNI.')
