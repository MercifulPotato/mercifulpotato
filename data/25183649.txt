Our platform provides industrial experience to learners, without them having to work at a company.<p>Marks, grades, field of study, and college - all act as barriers to securing a job or an internship. Most times, learners don&#x27;t even apply for opportunities because they are scared of rejections because of the previously mentioned factors. This feeling was something that I encountered in college too. Although I had a good technical profile, my grades always pulled me back, and I decided to start Widhya because I didn&#x27;t want others to face a similar problem.<p>We tie-up with companies, take up tasks from them and put them out for our users to solve. This way, (1) Students learn about what it takes to become a part of the workforce, and (2) Companies get access to these students who solve their tasks and know precisely whom to hire based on quality and cultural awareness.<p>Many e-learning platforms have videos to help people learn(MOOCs). At Widhya, we adopt a text-first approach where every project&#x27;s fundamental concepts are explained over multiple smaller-scale tasks. Since students know that nobody judges them based on anything but their quality of work, we&#x27;ve noticed that they feel more relaxed &amp; confident and tend to learn and perform better over a period of time.<p>In India alone, hardly 25-30% of the students get access to opportunities. Widhya intends to instill confidence among the remaining 70-75% by giving them access to various industrial tasks while ensuring that employers can get top-quality talent for their organizations. I would love to hear from you about your thoughts on this!')
