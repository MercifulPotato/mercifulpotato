Item(by='rsj_hn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606870493, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25270170, text='&gt; Microsoft has such a gigantic advantage when it comes to enterprise productivity software<p>Is that really true? I&#x27;m biased since I&#x27;m on the dev side, but everyone I know is using macbook pros, with very rare stragglers using windows or linux, and they use web clients for most stuff (e.g. gsuite, etc) rather than thick clients. I suspect with the push to working from home this will only accelerate.<p>This is a shame, since I like Microsoft Office products and am one of the few people I know who thinks VB is a great productivity tool, .Net is superior (in terms of language design) to Java, and Excel, Visio are better than anything else out there. But it&#x27;s been almost a decade since anyone I know has needed to use that stuff in the office.')
