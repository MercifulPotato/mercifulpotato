This whole discussion, my point was that your &quot;threshold of acceptance&quot; is ridiculously, insanely high.<p>For instance, I do think that the BBC guy in this video is acting in good faith. Also, given the two following hypothesis:\n- Thousands of people around the globe have been putting up complex magic tricks and keep the secret for more than two centuries to make me believe that a gas can burn an produce water;\n- Hydrogen and oxygen mixed together and ignited produce water vapor.<p>The latter is far, far more likely than the former.')
