Item(by='dundarious', descendants=None, kids=[24740963], score=None, time=1602355058, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24739888, text='It does reveal that Epic doesn&#x27;t have a &quot;public interest&quot; defense in the sense of getting their game back in consumers&#x27; hands, and a public interest defense is listed as a requirement for preliminary injunctive relief.<p>Is your point that Epic could&#x2F;did argue that they need relief because escrow via Apple&#x27;s payment systems provides no benefit to customers who want to use an alternative payment system?<p>I&#x27;m no expert but it would seem odd to grant &quot;relief&quot; that alters the status quo. That&#x27;s granting automatic improvement over the original terms Epic signed up to.')
