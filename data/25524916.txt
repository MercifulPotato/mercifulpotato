Central server matching the public IP used to then share their private IP? Or does WebRTC provide a discovery service?<p>Edit: Ok, Looking at the server code [1] there is indeed a “room” per public IP and the server passes messages between peers in the same room.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RobinLinus&#x2F;snapdrop&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;server&#x2F;index.js" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;RobinLinus&#x2F;snapdrop&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;server&#x2F;in...</a>')
