None of those have to do with apes or their everyday lives. Or try explaining &quot;political correctness&quot; to an ape...<p>We are perfectly fine abstracting high-order things that have nothing to do with apes, and using those terms and abstractions IF they are useful. We are also perfectly fine to not bother with it if existing terms offer the best possible utility.<p>So no, our basic assumption is not that everything is an ape.<p>I&#x27;m not sure where this fascination with undermining the great intellectual feats human brains are capable of is coming from?')
