Item(by='TaylorAlexander', descendants=None, kids=[25721537], score=None, time=1610319628, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25720074, text='Strange thing: Open Collective&#x27;s offers fiscal hosts for simplifying paperwork, but if you select the Open Source Collective as your fiscal host, donations are not tax deductible because they say &quot;the IRS doesn&#x27;t consider software development a charitable act&quot; or something. But there&#x27;s so many software non profits in the US and I really don&#x27;t understand that claim.<p>So Open Collective has another fiscal host for charities and those donations are tax deductible, and I&#x27;m now trying to figure out what the difference really is as I&#x27;d like to set up my own charitable organization to fund a farming robot I am developing.<p>Anyway I could <i>almost</i> just say Libjpeg-turbo could set up an opencollective as their whole mission is to solve the paperwork problem for open source projects, but for whatever reason their open source software donations aren&#x27;t actually tax deductible...<p>Does anyone here know about this IRS issue?')
