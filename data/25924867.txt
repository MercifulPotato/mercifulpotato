If these new funding sources work just as well, what exactly is the problem?<p>Like it or not, Mozilla&#x27;s continued existence hinges on Firefox&#x27;s market share bringing in search engine deals. With their market share falling, the only things they can afford to spend their money on are 1) making their browser more competitive, and 2) building alternative revenue sources.<p>MDN docs maintenance is neither. It&#x27;s certainly an asset to end users, but it&#x27;s a cost center for Mozilla. It&#x27;s good that other companies are stepping up to fund this. Somebody has to pay for our nice things.')
