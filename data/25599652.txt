All it has to do is launch 1 thousand nukes, start world war 3, and kill off 99% of the population&quot;.<p>Like, sure. The government <i>could</i> end the world, by launch a nuke at every major city in the world. And it is true that by doing this it would end all theft .. because everyone is dead.<p>But you are kinda missing the bigger picture if you are seriously suggesting this as a counter argument to anything.')
