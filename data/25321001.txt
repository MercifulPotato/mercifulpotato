There are always two sides to every story in practically everything.  You just happen to be on the wrong side of the rant this time, and you know enough to know the other side of things in this case.<p>How many times did you accept one-sided characterizations on other topics without question?<p>Like, say, a Federal bailout is the solution to all the problems?')
