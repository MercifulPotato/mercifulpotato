This is almost by definition the level of mastery that comes from significant practice &#x2F; experience.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that some of the very smart people I&#x27;ve worked with for years did not ever really achieve mastery of their language or tools, and I think that&#x27;s at least partially because they didn&#x27;t care to take the time to try and figure things out without looking them up, and thus the inner workings of things remained inscrutable to them.')
