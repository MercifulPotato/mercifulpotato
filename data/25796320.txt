My understanding is that with these new changes, WhatsApp will no longer need permission to share my contact list with Facebook.<p>Though importantly, if I didn&#x27;t opt-out before, WhatsApp was already sharing this information with Facebook.<p>Right now I don&#x27;t allow WhatsApp access to my contact list. It means all my messages are to phone numbers, which is a little inconvenient, but not overly so.<p>Come May 15th, will my app just refuse to open my messages list unless access to contacts is granted?')
