The waste is shorter lived than fission waste but is still a risk.<p>A more obvious risk is the pure destructive power of that much energy. High pressure, 100 million degree plasma is full of risks. It&#x27;s nice that fusion reactors can&#x27;t &quot;run away&quot; like fission does, but you still have to deal with material 6x hotter than the sun escaping confinement.')
