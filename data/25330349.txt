I always had the idea that I needed to grok all of Kube to get productive with it (and very much got that feeling last time I explored the docs). But knowing that I can ignore a lot of that if I use some kubernetes cloud service and just put my images up there, that&#x27;s super nice. Thanks (also to some sibling comments of yours) for clearly drawing up the difference between those two things.')
