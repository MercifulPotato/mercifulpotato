Item(by='brabel', descendants=None, kids=[25836490], score=None, time=1611076377, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25835161, text='&gt; I care that more companies are encouraged to release their software as OSS because they can make money for it.<p>But they can&#x27;t! Tell me how many companies make profit off purely OSS... RedHat maybe? What else?<p>And even if they can, they shouldn&#x27;t be surprised when competitors use their OSS for their own benefit because OSS explicitly allows for that. Making money off OSS is a red herring, just because it works in a couple isolated cases, doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a viable business strategy.')
