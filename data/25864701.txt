The pay is significantly higher than if I was a salaried employee. In addition all of my salary comes to me, pre tax. This allows me greater flexibility regarding what I do with my $. For example I will use all income in the first half of the year to pay off all of my debt (2 cars, credit cards and money down for a house refinance). The second half of the year I will save for taxes and at that stage my overall monthly bills are massively lower. I get my health insurance via my wife who is salaried. In addition it allows me to write off a lot of things for taxes. Getting paid through my company gives a lot of tax benefits.<p>The contract is for a year, with the option to extend. The job I just left was salaried but actively laying people off. So while both positions have risk, the contracted one provides a much higher income and flexibility to use it as I see fit. Plus any work I do on the weekend for the contract position is paid, as a salaried employee its not.')
