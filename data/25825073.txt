According to January NHS England data, almost 25% of cancer patients didn&#x27;t start treatment on time despite an urgent referral by their primary care doctor. That&#x27;s the worst performance since records began in 2009.<p>And keep in mind that &quot;on time&quot; for the NHS is already 62 days after referral.<p>Unsurprisingly, British cancer patients fare worse than those in the United States. Only 81% of breast cancer patients in the United Kingdom live at least five years after diagnosis, compared to 89% in the United States. Just 83% of patients in the United Kingdom live five years after a prostate cancer diagnosis, versus 97% here in America.&quot;<p>(<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;sallypipes&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;01&#x2F;britains-version-of-medicare-for-all-is-collapsing&#x2F;?sh=58e2eb1536b8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;sallypipes&#x2F;2019&#x2F;04&#x2F;01&#x2F;britains-...</a>)<p>Yes, I know Forbes has a bent.  And I&#x27;m generally in favor of single-payer options and not defending the U.S.  However I have seen the Wait Time stat over the years in the context of cancer patients, and this is one data point.  Canada is apparently worse.')
