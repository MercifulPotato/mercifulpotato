(Maybe he had it, but he hid it well.) Several times we&#x27;d find him multiplying by matrix A and then by matrix A&#x27; (or doing multiplications by some random constant and then dividing the result by that same constant to get the sizing correct) because he was in the habit of jiggling things just until they weren&#x27;t <i>obviously broken</i>.<p>I always assumed that he was just a one-off, but I suspect this could easily arise from copy&#x2F;paste and framework usage. (I&#x27;m also not sure I think this is universally bad; I think it&#x27;s great that early teenagers can whip up a Minecraft-ish demo without having to learn all of linear algebra first.)')
