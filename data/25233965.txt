This doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with fires, and the gas doesn&#x27;t have to be &quot;more massive&quot; than O2 to retard fires either.<p>Low pressure (100-200 mbar) pure oxygen behaves similarly to low partial pressure atmosphere in inert diluate (i.e. air). It&#x27;s not perfect -- things still burn faster without the diluent -- but it&#x27;s not as dangerous as pure O2 at sea level pressure, nor is it like the high-pressure pure O2 environment in the Apollo 1 test.<p>Also, N2 (and especially Ar) aren&#x27;t consumed to an appreciable degree. They can be recycled in an artificial life support system (as they are, and have been, for decades).')
