The issue isn&#x27;t about humans balancing on the thing (as with the examples of canoes or horses that are already stable at rest), but rather that a bicycle _does not balance unless it is moving_, and moreover making it balance depends on the fact that it has steering â€“ fix the front wheel in place and you can&#x27;t ride it.<p>This is not intuitive, except with the benefit of hindsight.')
