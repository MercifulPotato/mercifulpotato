But I&#x27;m not here to compete in the Victim Olympics.<p>&gt; Most people don&#x27;t know any CEOs, PMs, or hiring managers.<p>Good thing attending a hackathon is free. Good thing you can interact with literal SV royalty here on HN for free. Good thing you can contribute to famous OSS projects with minimal investment...<p>&gt; In the situation I described above, where you absolutely need that job, all the people you mention have a good chance of forgetting about you due to day-to-day politics. Guess who won&#x27;t? That recruiter. Because they get a cut of your salary.<p>Yeah, I disagree with this. I&#x27;ve been &quot;forgotten about&quot; and &quot;ghosted&quot; by more recruiters than I can remember. Not to mention that half the time my area of expertise wasn&#x27;t even lined up with what they were looking for, and as soon as they hear about a potential pivot (front end to back end, engineering to product management, etc.) they jump ship. But people I&#x27;ve impressed (old bosses, old PMs, people I met through hackathons, obviously old founding partners) are always willing to come up to bat.')
