It&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve heard about a lot -- I&#x27;ve been coding for fifteen years, professionally for seven, and certainly I have used Stack Overflow occasionally, but I go to the language documentation a lot more often, and honestly write a lot of code without looking at more than the source of the libraries I&#x27;m interacting with -- which are often proprietary so SO wouldn&#x27;t be any help anyway -- or the standard library.<p>Who&#x27;s on Stack Overflow all the time? I&#x27;ve never even made an account. I guess I referenced it more often when I was a younger programmer but never all that much..')
