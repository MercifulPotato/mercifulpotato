Here&#x27;s a question:<p>Using the AFC test [1], which seems common throughout the case law cited, how does one distinguish a <i>design decision</i> from a <i>standard programming technique</i> [2] in the context of a programming language&#x27;s standard library API? By virtue of terminology, it&#x27;s a standard. Is it defensible because it is a design decision concerning a programming language implementation? Then how does that square with computer languages not being copyrightable? What argument can one make so it can pass the filtration step of the test?<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Abstraction-Filtration-Comparison_test" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Abstraction-Filtration-Compari...</a><p>[2] <i>Computer Associates Int.

This is a result of the fact that a programmer&#x27;s freedom of design choice is often circumscribed by extrinsic considerations such as (1) the mechanical specifications of the computer on which a particular program is intended to run; (2) compatibility requirements of other programs with which a program is designed to operate in conjunction; (3) computer manufacturers&#x27; design standards; (4) demands of the industry being serviced; and (5) widely accepted programming practices within the computer industry.&quot;</i>')
