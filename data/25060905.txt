It&#x27;s been a while since the highly developed world experienced a devastating outbreak, but it may be premature to flat out dismiss the risk. In 1918, an unusual strain of flu managed to kill 75 million people.&quot;<p>Well, this aged well!  I&#x27;m glad to see this very reasonable take so far.<p>One thing that I don&#x27;t see mentioned is a &quot;go-bag&quot; or &quot;bug out bag&quot;, which I find to be one of the more useful preparations.  Have a bag with some clothes, your documents, medication, whatever you might need if you need to leave your house in a couple of minutes notice for a couple of days.  Super useful even if it&#x27;s not a total life and death emergency, but you need to see or help someone, and won&#x27;t know for how long.  A lot of good advice here about what to put in it though!  And a lot of useful advice on good skills to have.<p>One other small note: always have a roll of paper towels and toilet paper in your trunk in a bag.  Just trust me on this one, you&#x27;ll thank me later.')
