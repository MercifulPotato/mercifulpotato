The sense of how much Android actually &quot;mattered&quot; in this sense goes right to the &quot;effect on the market&quot; prong.<p>As for the broader case, both the copyrightability and fair use claims have been presented to the Supreme Court here. The temptation from the outside looking in is to think&#x2F;hope&#x2F;dread that the court will just resolve these questions once and for all, but they often prefer to resolve cases on narrower grounds, where available. Google spent a lot of time arguing for, and would be perfectly fine with, a simple remand based on the Federal Circuit&#x27;s standard of review of the jury&#x27;s fair use verdict.')
