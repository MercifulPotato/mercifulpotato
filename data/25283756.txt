Because mass power means mass power that can be turned against me. 2016 taught me something. There are a large contingent of anti-immigrants out there. Should you allow the creation of a mob, a day will come when the populists will take control of it.<p>In moments, the mob can break generations of integration. The best defence against it is prevention of its formation.<p>No, should you gain any appreciable fraction of power to unionize, I think there&#x27;s a lot of my money I would throw into the opposite effort. No populist mobs. Never again. No group should have that power.')
