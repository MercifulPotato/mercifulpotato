If we were to use net or cloth bags, and if all new bags (and fabrication materials) were taxed to the point that the only economically viable choices were sustainable overall, then that would achieve sustainability (e.g., people would repair bags--by sewing or weave--instead of discarding.  This is the actual way to solve the problem.<p>The issue there, of course, is that we have a whole modern civilization built around consuming and discarding, and it&#x27;s hard to achieve change once these habits are built and there&#x27;s little direct incentive for change.  It&#x27;s entirely feasible--sometimes people point to &quot;labor specialization&quot;, but it takes a day (if that) to learn to do basic sewing and weaving pretty well--but we would need to drastically shift (back) to a rather un-capitalist society of home industry with very strong incentives for mending rather than replacing.')
