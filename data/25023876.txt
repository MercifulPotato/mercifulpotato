I was trying to break into the area as a graduate from the PNW. No one but small startups would reply and they took advantage of my dwindling savings. My story is similar as yours as I had nowhere else to go since no other places in the country were responding but all these startups in the bay area. They were exploitative assholes and knew it completely. I never stopped interviewing and found a place eventually that paid the normal $110k&#x2F;yr for entry-level positions but it took about a year after I started that first post-graduation job. Pretty terrible experience up until that moment.<p>Guess I should mention - I wasn&#x27;t even on H1B. I&#x27;m a US citizen. I feel bad for people on H1B who have to live like that and can&#x27;t escape that level of exploitation. I think it hurts everyone involved.')
