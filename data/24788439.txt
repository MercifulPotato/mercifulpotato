If I did, I apologize. I may be bad, or good, or decent, or terrible at it, I don&#x27;t know. The point I was trying to make on that part of my original comment was simply: I do spend time on my campaign and A&#x2F;B test difference, not as-in &quot;I&#x27;m great&quot;, but as-in &quot;I didn&#x27; just make my first campaign there in 5 minutes without trying to improve it or learn from my mistakes&quot; because I think anecdotal evidences given from that point of view have no value at all.<p>So again, sorry if that is indeed what can be understood in what I wrote because that would be egoistical and wrong, but I genuinely don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s what I wrote.')
