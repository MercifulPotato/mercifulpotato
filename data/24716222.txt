If this technique is about converting mine waste to semi-potable for use in agriculture, or mining, and also uses the CO2 on-hand, and salt on-hand, its a virtuous industrial circle.<p>I&#x27;d hate it since it would be monetizing part of the mining industry I don&#x27;t like, but it makes economic sense in the narrow. If diamine is bad, and gets into the food chain this wreaks longterm harm. If the liberated salt is bad, likewise.<p>I tend to &quot;stop the mining&quot; but understanding the pressure of water issues on mining and farming, there may be huge upsides here.')
