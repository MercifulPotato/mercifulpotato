I don&#x27;t recall him complaining that it&#x27;s not in the docs (since that&#x27;s where he looked it up). The bug was only a story, the thing that prompted him to look into it. Take a breath, this isn&#x27;t StackOverflow (not that being rude and offended&#x2F;butthurt is welcome there either).')
