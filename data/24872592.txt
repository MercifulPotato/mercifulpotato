This is about structure, which is very different.  It is entirely unclear that we &quot;need&quot; to know every structure to solve most important problems in biology (either basic research or applied).<p>As for Deepmind... they made an incremental improvement over the existing field (and everybody will be doing the same thing in 2 years).  This ignores and underweights the decades of contributions from a wide range of people to bring us to this point in protein structure prediction and design.')
