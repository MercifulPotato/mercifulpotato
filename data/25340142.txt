Many indigenous peoples in Africa, eg the Bari of Sudan, eat monkeys and other apes. Whales have been hunted in Canada by aboriginal peoples since time immemorial. It doesn&#x27;t matter how smart or social you are. Someone or something unsympathetic is going to eat you, and it just might be humans who don&#x27;t share your (actually our) ethical ideas.')
