The way Google ranks pages makes today no sense. It is a waste of time doing SEO because above everything else, anyone who has more money will be higher and you can&#x27;t change that. No matter how good content you have. I have more time to focus on what really matters when I ignored SEO and Google. At this point I don&#x27;t care if it will index my website or not. It does not have any impact at all.')
