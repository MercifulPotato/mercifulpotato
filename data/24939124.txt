Otherwise everything would carry a penalty worse than death.<p>So there&#x27;s a trade-off between handing out more of that punishment in fines to be paid to the victim or in economically inefficient activities like prison time.<p>As a related matter, I think corporal punishment deserves more consideration.  Mostly because it&#x27;s cheaper to administer than prison, and also avoids forcible socializing convicts only with each other as happens in prison.<p>(Of course, it&#x27;s a punishment with a certain cruelty.  Alas violence and injury are a common enough sight in overcrowded prisons, too.)')
