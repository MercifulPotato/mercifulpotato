Perhaps not all of that thinking makes its way into final policies, whether for practical or political reasons.  Perhaps much of that thinking - especially where nuance, expertise, or uncertainty are concerned - gets dropped from layperson reporting on the policy.  Almost always, you can find publicly-available documents, transcripts, etc. that exhaustively list these details - all the arguments, all the community consultations, all the policy whitepapers.<p>These all exist, and unlike in modern academic publishing, you can almost always find and read them for free!  That said, I do agree that we as a society need to put <i>much</i> more effort into accurate communication around expert fields.  Specialization, and the resulting glut of information written for and consumed by specialized audiences, is one of many forces that make it harder to build a shared, agreed-upon sense of reality.  What might it look like to solve this problem in the 21st century?')
