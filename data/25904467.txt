Item(by='cycomanic', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611589464, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25903717, text='&gt;I think it&#x27;s interesting how they use Fox News in the title, not News Corp. Sadly the makes it clear this is a agenda article not really about the people. The statement is made that the funds raised should goto the Australia citizens and not the news producers who&#x27;s content is being used by big tech without compensation. While the law maybe bad it&#x27;s not made clear by the anti &quot;Fox News&quot; agenda of the author, sadly this is what most news has come to not reporting but reporter agenda pieces.<p>I think it is perfectly valid to call out Fox News in the title, because most readers would not know who News Corp is but do know Fox News, and for the intents of this article they are very similar.<p>Moreover the reason why this is called in particularly the Fox News tax is because News Corp are the main beneficiary by quite a margin, they have &gt;50% market share in Australia [1].<p>Furthermore Murdoch has a strong history of influencing Australian politics in his favour and the ruling liberal party has a history of implementing policy directly to benefit him.<p>The National Broadband Network was widely popular in Australia, however it threatened Murdoch&#x27;s payTV business. So he had meetings with liberal party leadership, who promised to hamstring (or roll-back) the NBN. They were essentially voted into power with headlines of &quot;vote these suckers out&quot; (Labour was in power) and similar in all Murdoch papers and no none of the &quot;left-leaning&quot; papers ever did something remotely close to that. As a non-Australian it was quite shocking to observe how blatantly partisan those headlines were.<p>News corp is not media it is a far-right billionaire propaganda organisation.')
