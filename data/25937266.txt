And it&#x27;s not Tesla&#x27;s desire for a proprietary network to support its EV sales that causes fast charging to be a disaster in the US for non-Teslas.<p>&gt;&gt; By buying a Tesla you&#x27;re supporting the notion that proprietary connections are good.<p>&gt; You continue to say this, but your evidence is nonexistent for this claim. Standards exist, Tesla doesn&#x27;t use them for &lt;reasons&gt;, therefore if you buy a Tesla you disagree that standards are good.<p>&gt; And I think present-day vendor lock-in is a small price to pay for 10-years-from-now higher EV adoption.<p>You&#x27;re literally making the argument that you&#x27;re suggesting nobody is making. That ultimately its better for consumers if Tesla has a proprietary connector. Your reason for that line of thinking is because you assume if Tesla didn&#x27;t have a proprietary connector there would be no market for fast charging at all, or that it would have been massively delayed. You even acknolwedge at some point in time in the future maybe we&#x27;ll have a standard connector, but clearly there&#x27;s some reason why it can&#x27;t be done now and we shouldn&#x27;t really be demanding for a standard. It took a few comments to draw that out, but as you can see clearly some people <i>are</i> making such an argument as that&#x27;s ultimately the root of your postiion.<p>I disagree with that basic premise. Look at the massive amount of J1772 chargers out there in the wild. They&#x27;re mostly J1772 chargers because when they were built several years ago CCS2 didn&#x27;t exist except on paper and J1772 was seen as the industry standard connector in the US market. Now that CCS2 is a real standard and is on real cars driving on real roads, CCS2 chargers are starting to exist. Imagine a world where Tesla did open the connector back when CCS2 was just a spec on paper. Anybody in this market could have built a DC fast charger. Any other car company could have built a Supercharger compatible car, so there would have been more on the market. With such a wider possible market at both ends, do you think there would be <i>more</i> or <i>less</i> widely compatible fast charging stations? Note that Tesla could still have made up for other companies piggybacking on their initial investment of the chargers, as the earlier Teslas had free charging. I imagine the free charging wouldn&#x27;t have applied to a Ford or VW or Nissan at a Tesla station. Or do the massively anti-consumer move of not allowing other brands to charge at their stations. So boom, there&#x27;s the whole argument of &quot;but why would Telsa want to invest if not for the vendor lock-in?&quot;<p>If third parties could have manufactured Tesla&#x2F;Superchargers or cars, I imagine there would be a lot more Tesla&#x2F;Supercharger compatible chargers in the wild today.')
