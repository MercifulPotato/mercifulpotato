For me, after somehow squeezing through DiffEq, I met complex analysis, taught by the math department.  I started the semester, got way behind, dropped it.  Did that a second time.  The third time my advisor wouldn&#x27;t let me drop it, and I ended up with a gentleman&#x27;s D (the only D in my life, aside from like handwriting in 3rd grade).  The very next semester I took pretty much the exact same material from the EE department.  I got it, I loved it, and aced it completely.<p>But 50 years later, I still have those gonna-flunk dreams.')
