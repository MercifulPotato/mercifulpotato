It shouldn&#x27;t be too long to be usable, or too short to be readable. It should be pronounceable. It should capture its object&#x27;s purpose fully and at an appropriate level of abstraction. It has to differentiate itself well from other names. Often a whole naming scheme must be worked out, depending on the nature and relationship of the precise things to be named. Changing any one name can create a need for many other names to also be changed, or for the named things to be rearranged or redesigned.')
