One of Wu&#x27;s specific critiques is my biggest disagreement I have with Thompson, and is a train of thought that seems to be dogma in Silicon Valley Twitter.<p>Wal-Mart putting their own brand of toilet paper on more prominent end cap shelves <i>is</i> fundamentally different than Amazon promoting their own Amazon Basics toilet paper on a search results page on Amazon.com. Amazon has a <i>much</i> greater ability to drive conversion to its own products than a brick-and-mortar retailer (e.g. limited screen space, UI, information hierarchy, better data, etc.)<p>Thompson&#x27;s argument that &quot;it&#x27;s all the same,&quot; &quot;private labeling has been going on forever,&quot; is flimsy and intellectually lazy.<p>Once we agree on this basic set of facts the more interesting question becomes: is this dynamic bad for consumers long-term?<p>The crux of this round of tech anti-trust scrutiny is time horizon. Many of these practices are neutral or beneficial to consumers <i>in the short-term,</i> but that&#x27;s always how monopolies operate. Undercutting prices to put a competitor out of business benefit consumers immediately, but hurt consumers after the competitor goes out of business and the monopolist can raise prices. Amazon selling Amazon Basics products at a loss or near-loss is good for customers now, but  if it puts too many other online retailers out of business, eventually they&#x27;ll raise prices and hurt consumers.')
