Can somebody explain this to me? Is this HURD? Or does it have a kernel? Is it some sort of hypervisor or application container? I always found HURD to be exciting in a sci-fi kind of way but from what I’ve heard this sounds like it’s actually something that could be practically useful. Where would I start? Does it make any sense running in VirtualBox let’s say?')
