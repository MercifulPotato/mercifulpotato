Though AFAIK this definition of &quot;like a full time employee&quot; is not very strict.<p>IMO problem is that income taxation should be treated (mostly) the same, no matter how you earn the money. Because now (where I live), the wealthier you are, the more elaborate schemes you can run to avoid paying taxes on your income.')
