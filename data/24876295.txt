And if we are talking about addressing climate change, we are talking about new deployment because we must replace other energy sources.<p>In places where new nuclear has been built, it has not proven to be a spectacularly desirable energy source. The entire Western world has failed at building new reactors, causing bankruptcies and state acquisitions and restructurings. Even nuclear darling France is pulling back from new nuclear, instead looking to renewables and storage, including hydrogen.  China tried valiantly but is pulling back from very large scale deployment. South Korea has had some success, but that&#x27;s because quality control turned out to be a scam, so who knows about the quality of the reactors they built.<p>Russia&#x27;s Rosatom has had some success, probably, but nobody trusts them.<p>The remaining market for nuclear are where there are corrupt bureaucracies where the prospect of a massive single project makes the potential for massive bribes possible. This is why coal succeeds in India, for example.<p>As for &quot;doing no harm&quot; with solar, I have yet to see any concrete examples of solar causing definitive harm.  A solar failure doesn&#x27;t cause massive environmental harm. The mining issues are similar to uranium mining. If solar is causing harm, I&#x27;d love to know how, but having searched for this and come up empty, and having people claim that solar causes harm and never follow through with specifics, I&#x27;m extremely skeptical of the claim. At least until there&#x27;s some evidence to look into.<p>Until we can reliably contradict nuclear and also see that it actually seems like a good financial deal (taking into account all the costs of failed builds), nobody will really want to put up money for nuclear unless it&#x27;s for ulterior reasons: corruption or nuclear proliferation or subsidizing a nuclear submarine fleet or something like that.')
