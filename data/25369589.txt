His example goes roughly like this:<p>Bogart is in his apartment. His phone rings. We see a shot of the phone ringing. He walks to the phone, picks it up, and talks briefly. He opens the door of his apartment and leaves. We see a shot of him in the hall. We see a shot of him going down the front steps and getting into a car. A shot of him driving the car. A shot of him parking the car in front of an apartment building, getting out, looking up at the tall building, and grimacing. A shot of him in the lobby pushing an elevator button, getting into the elevator, and of the doors closing. A shot of the elevator indicator moving upward (a cliche of the 1930s). A shot of the elevator doors opening on an upper floor, Bogart getting out of the elevator, walking to a door, and ringing the doorbell. Lauren Bacall opens the door, and he goes inside.<p>That&#x27;s editorial geography. Nobody does that any more. Today, one would cut from answering the phone to inside the destination apartment. But at one time, a film that left out too much geography would cause the audience to lose track.<p>See this documentary on the French New Wave, which shows how that era ended.[1]<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;0R7R0JHvvgo?t=191" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;0R7R0JHvvgo?t=191</a>')
