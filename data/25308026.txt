If Dean&#x27;s issue was it didn&#x27;t cite papers X,Y and Z, rather than demand a withdrawal, why didn&#x27;t he just demand &quot;I want you to amend the paper to add cites to X,Y,Z&quot;. And then, if Gebru and her coauthors were willing to add those cites, that would resolve it.<p>Indeed, from what I understand, &quot;you should add a cite to X&quot; is common peer review feedback, and a lot of papers get citations added due to requests from peer reviewers. So this isn&#x27;t hugely different from that scenario.<p>It would seem that withdrawal over this issue would only make sense if Gebru and her coauthors refused to amend the paper to add the requested citations, but I haven&#x27;t heard anything saying that she did refuse to do so. It isn&#x27;t clear if the alternative solution of amending rather than withdrawing was ever brought up in the discussion by either party.<p>Not that I&#x27;m a researcher or anything, but if I was, and a superior told me &quot;we need you to withdraw your paper because it doesn&#x27;t cite X,Y,Z&quot;, my immediate response would be &quot;How about I add the citations you are requesting and resubmit it with those additions?&quot;')
