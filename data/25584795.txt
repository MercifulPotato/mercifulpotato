Item(by='whimsicalism', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609355006, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25584649, text='&gt; We’ve had some of the highest effective tax rates on capital in the world for a while, and the Trump tax cuts didn’t help that much.<p>Source on any of this? I don&#x27;t think this is true - both effective and statutory corporate tax is lower. When factoring in things like the estate tax on capital, capital gains tax, etc. - all is much lower than during the 20th century.<p>&gt; In practice that’s over a 50% rate, even if the shareholder is a low income retiree.<p>Among equity held by American households, the richest 1% own more than 50% of that equity - and the top 5% owns the lion&#x27;s share (upwards of 3&#x2F;4s). The &quot;low income retiree&quot; narrative is overstated. Moreover, that retiree could count paid dividends as ordinary income, which is taxed progressively (10% or less effective tax rate) if they are low-income.<p>Meanwhile, the estate tax is much lower than it was during the majority of the 20th century, despite the fact that more than half of all wealth is not earned but inherited by the wealthiest 5% of all American households (ie. the median dollar in the economy is inherited, not paid as a wage or from capital gains)')
