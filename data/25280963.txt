It’s extremely difficult to fake Urbit expertise to Urbit insiders, so you can’t pull the parasitic move of entering a tech community with little&#x2F;no relevant experience and becoming a “developer evangelist” or “industry advocate” or whatever other bullshit positions people use to subvert tech communities with entryist politics, corporate control, etc.<p>This was described in a pre-Urbit blog post by Yarvin.
