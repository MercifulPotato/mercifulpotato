Given the introduction, LLVM (incorrectly) introduces (C) UB at times.<p>This doesn&#x27;t matter. LLVM IR is not C, and it is not convertible to C, as it implements a superset of C semantics, which includes some cases where behavior that is undefined in C is well-defined in LLVM IR. Once C is lowered to LLVM IR, it doesn&#x27;t matter what C says is or isn&#x27;t undefined behavior, because there is no longer any C code being considered.')
