It&#x27;s about control of their citizens.  They <i>use</i> terrorism as the bogeyman to try to get people comfortable with the concept, but really, they just want dragnet surveillance over everyone, period.<p>I think it&#x27;s most useful to point out that banning or backdooring E2EE won&#x27;t stop the terrorists, but it seems like the main thrust of these sorts of articles is about how backdoors are dangerous to everyone... which is exactly what these governments are ok with.  And a disturbing number of people (outside of the HN crowd) are perfectly willing to give up their own privacy and freedom if it means catching the terrorists.<p>I think a better approach to getting the public to be against these encroachments would be to drive home that backdoors and E2EE bans don&#x27;t actually catch terrorists or human traffickers or child pornographers.')
