I don&#x27;t see how this isn&#x27;t an excellent entirely passive opportunity. If the returns are low, that&#x27;s still money you didn&#x27;t have last month and money you could potentially spend on another machine to exponentially increase your business. If you are contracted with a service company you could scale infinitely.')
