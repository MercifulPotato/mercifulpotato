Upper middle class people spending money on it doesn’t mean it’s money well spent; like many things rich people spend money on, it’s largely signaling to peers.<p>Also, your caricature of why people get hired for engineering jobs bears very little relationship to what I and my colleagues look for in engineering interviews.<p>Being able to solve a few simple algorithm problems is table stakes. Being able to talk about what you’re doing and why is what’s being measured.<p>People who crammed leetcode but don’t actually understand the material are obvious 5 minutes into the interview; people who freeze up occasionally on the algorithm bits but can talk about why they’re doing what they’re doing generally get hired.')
