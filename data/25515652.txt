It&#x27;s enough if it&#x27;s in the language you know. Can even be in the same country.<p>My little moment of enlightenment here came when I realized that I really <i>can</i> attend that event I was really interested in that&#x27;s happening on the other side of the country. All I need is to travel. Oh, other side of the country is far and travel time will take as much as the two-day event itself? <i>I can always fly there</i>. Domestic air travel is a thing, and isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> expensive (which may be obvious for people in the US; it&#x27;s less obvious in Europe).<p>I ultimately ended up not going to that event for personal reasons, but planning it made me re-evaluate the possibilities I have, and how many of them appear once I reframe the question as &quot;how much money am I willing to spend to get there?&quot;.')
