I have owned a Dyson stick vacuum for over 5 years and it still runs for ~15 minutes on a charge. The newer versions of the same vacuum sold at Costco are advertised to run for up to 40 minutes.<p>That said, I switched to a Roborock S5 Max around March of last year and I have only used the Dyson once or twice since then.')
