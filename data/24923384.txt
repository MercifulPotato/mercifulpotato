Item(by='cpeterso', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603914779, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24921869, text='SiriusXM truncates a &quot;The&quot; prefix from artist names (so &quot;The Cure&quot; and &quot;The Who&quot; become &quot;Cure&quot; and &quot;Who&quot;).

Would it be &quot;The The&quot; (special case), &quot;The&quot; (default removal of &quot;The&quot;), or an empty string &quot;&quot; (in the unlikely case the algorithm recursively removed &quot;The&quot; prefixes)? Eventually they played a The The song and the answer is &quot;The The&quot;.')
