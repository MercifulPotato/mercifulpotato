I must have tried them all in my time.  Here&#x27;s a few that have stuck around:<p>Ibis Paint [0] -- [Free and paid versions]. Ignore the puke-making cutesy Manga gallery that greets you when you fire it up. It&#x27;s actually a really full featured drawing app with layers &#x2F; filters &#x2F; masking &#x2F; PSD export, etc. This is the  one I use most<p>Autodesk Sketchbook [1] --[Free] Similarly full featured to Ibis Paint, but slightly less so. Text handling tools not as good. I used to use this a lot before I discovered Ibis Paint<p>Infinite Design [2] --[Free and paid] The most full featured Vector Drawing app I&#x27;ve found. There&#x27;s a lot in there but it can be a bit clunky to use and theres a bit of lag when drawing, which puts me off using it much.<p>Concepts [3] --[Free and paid]. A real mixed bag this one. I find the pen tool one of the nicest and most expressive to draw with of any app I&#x27;ve tried. And the infinite canvas is good for just doodling and &#x27;seeing where it takes you&#x27;.<p>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s one of those apps where the designers have thrown usability guidelines out the window, to come up with an &#x27;innovative&#x27; interface, which I personally find really annoying to use. It also gets a lot of flak for the slow pace of development on Android. The developers have been promising feature parity with the iOS version [which is apparently much better] for years now, but it never seems to arrive.<p>Photo Editor [4] -- [Free and paid] This is as close to a mini Photoshop as you can get on Android] as in an app for manipulating existing images, rather than drawing <i>per se</i>. The interface is a bit menu heavy and unintuitive at times. But there&#x27;s a lot in there, if you do a bit of digging.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=jp.ne.ibis.ibispaintx.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=jp.ne.ibis.ibi...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.adsk.sketchbook" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.adsk.sketc...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.brakefield.idfree" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.brakefield...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.tophatch.concepts" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.tophatch.c...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.iudesk.android.photo.editor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.iudesk.and...</a><p>I&#x27;ve got a load of other graphic and drawing apps installed. But those tend to be the ones which get the most usage. Your best bet is probably to do what I did; install  a load of them and see how you get on, as everyone has a different style of working and a different idea of what constitutes a usable interface.<p>I found that, as with a lot of so-called &quot;reviews&quot; these days, most of the articles I searched for on topics like &quot;XX Great Drawing Apps for Android&quot;, when I first got my tablet, were little more than rehashed press releases, outlining the features of various apps but giving no insight into their &#x27;real world&#x27; usability.')
