Item(by='cmxch', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611863716, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25947013, text='&gt; Nowadays, you could just hire from the flyover states, find all the good techies that didn&#x27;t make the pilgrimage to one of the traditional hotspots, and train them on the last bits on the job for not very much more money than an international team, when all costs are accounted.<p>Why just the &quot;good&quot; or &quot;perfect&quot; techies?<p>They need to be less picky about who they hire.  One could even go with the less desirable, &quot;diamonds in the rough&quot; candidates and still do well.  If it worked passably with guest workers, it can work with flyover candidates.<p>As for my personal situation, I&#x27;d be happy to have options that were more than just government or healthcare.')
