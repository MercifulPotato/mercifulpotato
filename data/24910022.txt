That would be untenable, and so the only alternative would be to shut down the entire project and recommend no further use of the software - as was done.<p>A subsequent audit did not identify any such security flaw, so the prevailing theory is now that the maintainers were forced to stop work by a governmental agency.  It&#x27;s considered safe and now known as veracrypt.<p>However, the question I have is whether a single crowdsourced security audit would be capable of finding a flaw that it took the developers themselves years (decades?) to identify.')
