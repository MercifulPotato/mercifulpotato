But regardless, even if he had an impact, this doesn&#x27;t tell you anything about your assertion.<p>I suspect Sanders would have higher impact in a multi-party system, because apparently there is a group of maybe 30% of Americans who would be his fans and could vote for a progressive party under his leadership.<p>What I would really like to see is a comparison of the political systems, across different countries perhaps. To take an issue and compare how it was pushed through the different systems. I can&#x27;t help it but today, EU seems more progressive (in the sense of trying to make life of citizens better) than the U.S. (and UK).')
