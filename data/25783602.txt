In fact the mayor restricted what the police could do and how far things had to escalate before the police could do anything.  Lasers, fireworks, fires, bricks...not much was off limits to the rioters every single night for months.  You can claim the group was stationary and peaceful...but there were agitators mixed in and causing problems.  There are tons of videos showing the violent tactics being used by rioters...but usually the only ones to make the MSM are when the police responded.  Antifa...yes they exist...were well organized and restricted journalists from documenting everything unless they wanted them to.  Even the local news reporters were harassed and assaulted by them.')
