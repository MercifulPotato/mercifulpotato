An evil corporation that wants to leech without giving anything back can practically as easily do that with an MPL2 licensed project as with a permissive licensed project.<p>My personal reasons for MPL2 are basically:<p>- Modern goodies like explicit patent protections without being GPLv2 incompatible like Apache.<p>- Showing the sharing &quot;spirit&quot; I&#x27;d like to see, even though it&#x27;s in practice impossible to enforce against a &quot;hostile&quot; user (see above). That is, feel free to use it in your proprietary product, but if you make improvements to my code please share those with me.<p>That being said, I&#x27;m not actually sure that MPL2 is worth it, considering it&#x27;s very much an uncommon license compared to the big permissive ones.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I understand your arguments about MPL2 being better protected against forks with stronger copyleft licenses. The forker can still make their own additions subject to the xGPLv3, as long as they&#x27;re in separate source files, effectively making the combined work xGPLv3.')
