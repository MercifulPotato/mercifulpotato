The isolation is built-in. Everything is <i>contained</i>.<p>Of course if you&#x27;re editing files locally or fixing a Dockerfile it&#x27;s all the same, but it&#x27;s not the commonality that&#x27;s in discussion here.<p>And what&#x27;s all this about understanding? Who said we don&#x27;t understand the software? That&#x27;s your assumption but complete untrue. Managing everything directly isn&#x27;t a sign of deep understanding, it&#x27;s simply your preference, one that I and many others don&#x27;t share.<p>Abstractions exist for a reason.
