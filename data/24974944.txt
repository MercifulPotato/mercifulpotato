Think smart door locks, lights, thermostats, etc that can be controlled via our mobile app. We are constantly integrating with new IoT devices that make life easier for both residents and property managers. Our backend software runs primarily on AWS (ECS, RDS, API Gateway, Lambda) and we have a fleet of hubs deployed in the field which are installed in each apartment.<p>We are looking for an Engineering Manager to lead the IOTAS backend team which is responsible for architecting, designing and building the core of the IOTAS IoT platform. The team is small to start, so most of your day will be spent in the code. Over the next year you will spend time growing the team to support our future roadmap.<p>* Backend Engineering Manager - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iotashome.com&#x2F;job&#x2F;backend-team-engineering-manager&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.iotashome.com&#x2F;job&#x2F;backend-team-engineering-manag...</a>')
