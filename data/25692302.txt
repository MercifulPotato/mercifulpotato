I also support Twitter&#x27;s right to kick him off their platform.<p>That said; it seems a stretch to me to permanently delete his account based on the two tweets they cite.   They&#x27;re about to break their necks trying to find problems in those two tweets when they have a smorgasbord of inflammatory tweets over the years to pick from. Saying he won&#x27;t attend the inauguration was the final straw? It really seems disingenuous on their part.<p>I would respect them far more if they had said, &quot;You know what? Our decision to reinstate his account after twelve hours was a mistake.  Donald Trump is clearly harmful to our republic and we will no longer give him a voice on our platform.  His account is therefore permanently suspended.&quot;')
