And this story is such a good illustration.<p>All masks are not created equal. They have tiers of protection.<p>At the top are NIOSH approved N95s. They require a good seal to be protective, but if one learns it (via a fit test), it will proved near 100% protection for the wearer as well as the non-wearer.<p>The next level are KN95s and KF94s. Here is a good overview: (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4JFed_ofCwM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4JFed_ofCwM</a>) These can be 80%+ protective if worn correctly. Hospitals were short of N95&#x27;s so FDA authorized (via appendix A) a bunch of substitutes.<p>The next level are cotton masks, bandanas, surgical masks, and &quot;face coverings&quot;. They have partial and highly variable amount of protection for the individual, but if used widely in the population, it has the potential to reduce the R0 factor. Since any reduction of an exponential factor is a good thing, it was encouraged after few months of confusion.<p>Now here is the fiasco. US Gov&#x27;t authorities downplayed the usefulness of masks. Any type of mask, not just the N95s. The logic behind it was to preserve supplies for the medical workers.<p>But the medical workers had a perfectly good alternative, an elastomeric half-face mask. Since they are reusable, one set could potentially replace thousands of disposable N95s. A few US hospitals early on used them to good effect, but CDC never advocated strongly for them (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;27&#x2F;us&#x2F;coronavirus-masks-elastomeric-respirators.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;27&#x2F;us&#x2F;coronavirus-masks-elas...</a>). Instead, they encouraged increasing the supply of disposable N95s. US N95 production increased 10x in the last 10 months, but it&#x27;s still not enough. Today, hospitals workers are still getting exposed while reusing and sanitizing disposable N95s.<p>And the general public was told different stories: don&#x27;t wear masks because they are not effective. Don&#x27;t use N95s because they should be reserved for the healthcare workrs, and without proper training, they aren&#x27;t any good. Oh wait, masks are good. Please wear cotton &quot;face coverings&quot;.<p>The effect of that is that some people believe face coverings are completely useless (partially true), and others believe that face coverings are actually protective (also partially true).<p>If the public is given clear information on different protective level of different masks, wouldn&#x27;t they make a smarter choice?<p>Instead, it&#x27;s complete chaos.<p>Good, protective masks exist now (Dec 2020). High quality KF94s are available, and N95s are also becoming more available (about $2&#x2F;mask, in-stock, from reputable online sources). Elastomeric half-face respirator prices are now at pre-pandamic levels (MSA 200LS is very inexpensive).<p>And the public still don&#x27;t know anything about them.')
