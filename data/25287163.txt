Itâ€™s the logarithm of a rotation, instead of the logarithm of a scale. Like other kinds of logarithms, this converts multiplication (composition of rotations) to addition (addition of angle measures).<p>If you want to multiply two numbers, you can treat them as rotations, take the logarithm of each (i.e. find the angle measure), add the two, then take the exponential.<p>cf. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Complex_logarithm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Complex_logarithm</a>')
