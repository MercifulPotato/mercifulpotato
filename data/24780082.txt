He was wrong about that one thing, and to be fair to him, it&#x27;s still a little amazing in retrospect,</i><p>That is <i>clearly</i> wrong if one is willing to take a moment to stop gazing at the wonder of pure mathematics and look at the outside world. There is no notion of &quot;correctness&quot; for the pyramids of Egypt, the dykes of the Netherlands, Milan Cathedral, or the world economy and yet those huge-scale systems all function.<p><i>&gt; Dijkstra&#x27;s pessimism and his use of harsh, attention-getting language makes a lot of sense.</i><p>It makes sense in terms of Dijkstra&#x27;s personality, but it makes no logical sense. If you believe mathematical correctness is such a valuable principle, then you should be able to leverage that same principle in one&#x27;s own arguments. The fact that Dijkstra couldn&#x27;t dispassionately <i>prove</i> that correctness was vital and had to resort to emotionally-loaded weasel words undermines his own claim.')
