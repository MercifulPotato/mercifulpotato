This is an unofficial hack for an Apple platform notorious for having little open documentation or good interoperability with anything non-Apple. It&#x27;s always going to be an uphill battle to reliably support Linux because Apple themselves don&#x27;t seem to care (at the moment at least). Investing in Linux integration for a more supportive hardware vendor instead should yield better Linux outcomes without Apple&#x27;s baggage.')
