The college, which should be a place of delightful labor, is made odious\nand unhealthy, and the young men are tempted to frivolous amusements to rally their jaded spirits.  I would have the studies elective.<p>Scholarship is to be created not by compulsion, but by awakening a pure interest in knowledge.  The wise instructor accomplishes this by opening to his pupils precisely the attractions the study has for\nhimself.  The marking is a system for schools, not for the college; for boys, not for men; and it is an ungracious work to put on a professor.&quot;\n                -- Ralph Waldo Emerson')
