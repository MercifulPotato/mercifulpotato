The reviews on the product page <i>should be</i> reviews of the webcam, not of any individual seller experience (<i>should be</i> in the sense of &quot;Amazon wants it this way&quot; and &quot;because that&#x27;s what makes sense for Amazon shoppers&quot;). If I&#x27;m on that product page reading reviews, I&#x27;m researching that webcam, not the seller who happened to sell it to you.<p>You&#x27;re more than welcome to review the seller shipping experience (which shows up on the seller detail page that probably gets little traffic), but anything you post about a seller-specific incident on the general product review set isn&#x27;t helping anyone.')
