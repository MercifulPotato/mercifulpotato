Item(by='dkarl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611610810, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25908531, text='There are a lot of statements in these subcultures that can&#x27;t be definitively pinned down as ironic or not ironic.  For example, calling software &quot;broken&quot; started as a gross oversimplification that drew attention to itself as a gross oversimplification.  It could be used when you wanted to gloss over complex questions of what the software is good for and what you need it to do, while at the same time, to avoid lying by omission, drawing attention to what you were omitting.<p>But then people started calling software &quot;broken&quot; to express, &quot;My gut feeling is that this software sucks, and I think it would be a waste of time for me to question or attempt to substantiate this feeling,&quot; and they felt validated in that attitude because there was a perfect means for expressing it in the programming lexicon.<p>Now when I hear someone say &quot;broken,&quot; it doesn&#x27;t have the reassuring subtext of &quot;I know this is a gross oversimplification, and I&#x27;m open to providing more detail about my reasoning.&quot;  It might mean the opposite.  (Or it might mean, &quot;I&#x27;m making outrageous statements because I know I&#x27;m right, and I would relish the opportunity to bully anyone who questions me.&quot;)<p>Similarly, one person might say &quot;everybody hates me, and I can&#x27;t blame them because I&#x27;m worthless&quot; in a deliberately ironic way, to express an emotion and at the same time signal their awareness that what they believe under the influence of that emotion is not true (since their mom is bringing them tendies in the basement.)  The next person might say the same thing with no intended irony.')
