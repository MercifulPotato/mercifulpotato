There&#x27;s quite a bit of data here, definitely over my head, but I <i>think</i> page 24 has details on the specificity and sensitivity via results of the clinical study.<p>Screenshot of just that part: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;G5JVS2V" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;G5JVS2V</a><p>Edit:  From the EUA itself (linked by someone else above), I find these conditions on their marketing to be hilarious:<p>&quot;No descriptive printed matter, advertising, or promotional materials, relating to the use of your product may represent or suggest that this test is safe or effective for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.&quot;<p>Which is then <i>immediately</i> followed by (emphasis added):<p>&quot;Z. All descriptive printed matter, advertising, and promotional materials, relating to the use\nof your product shall clearly and conspicuously state that:<p>· This home test kit has not been FDA cleared or approved;<p>· This home test kit has been authorized by FDA under an EUA;<p>· This home test kit has been <i>authorized only for the detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2</i>, not for any other viruses or pathogens; and ...&quot;<p>Which is it -- authorized for the safe &amp; effective detection of SARS-Cov-2, or authorized for sale but NOT safe and&#x2F;or effective?
