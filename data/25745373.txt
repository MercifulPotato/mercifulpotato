Not till apple threatened to remove Parler from the store was it deleted.<p>I don&#x27;t think it should have been deleted at all. Let concerned citizens sue Lin wood (whoever that is) and present his threat as evidence. Why should we expect people&#x27;s words to be deleted from a public platform?<p>If nobody sued him, or went to the police, maybe it wasn&#x27;t a real threat. Or maybe it wasn&#x27;t illegal. Who are we to judge? Let the &quot;neighbors&quot; take it to the police and to the courts.<p>I really wish today&#x27;s social platforms functioned like Slashdot. Their philosophy was to never delete anything posted by users, unless compelled by a court of law. That&#x27;s the right thing to do.')
