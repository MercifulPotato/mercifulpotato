Item(by='alkonaut', descendants=None, kids=[25774500, 25776355], score=None, time=1610614835, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25773707, text='&gt; rather the minimum they feel they can get away with.<p>I completely agree.<p>I certainly would accept more pay. But I wouldn&#x27;t  switch jobs <i>just to get it</i>. There are several reasons, most importantly that interesting jobs in my niche are scarce. So my employer has a resource that is perhaps scarcer than myself!. Second (and this is the part where it becomes self-fulfilling), <i>because</i> there are no super high salaries, I&#x27;m close to a kind of ceiling. I&#x27;m not sure what that ceiling is and you could always be lucky and find some extremely well paying job, but let&#x27;s say that for a job I&#x27;d  be willing to do, the ceiling is within 50% more than I&#x27;m currently making.<p>If marginal taxes are 50% (at least), then that&#x27;s a net 25% pay rise. It&#x27;s basically $1500 more a month net, and it would require me to make probably several job switches. It&#x27;s certainly not insignificant, but it&#x27;s just not significant <i>enough</i>. Had there been jobs across the street paying 3x what I do, then certainly I&#x27;d start chasing more money. But I value my 6-8w holidays, I can already afford to travel etc. I&#x27;m comfortable.')
