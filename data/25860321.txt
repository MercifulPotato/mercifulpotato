One thing that surprised me though is that there wasn&#x27;t a single word lost on feature selection (by looking at feature importance for correct predictions) or feature engineering by combining features or somehow else applying domain knowledge. So for example, trying to figure out if you can put different attributes in relation to each other to get a better feature (e.g. number-of-spinups &#x2F; operating-time-in-hours). Personally that would be the first thing I&#x27;d try, and coincidentally it&#x27;s also the most fun aspect of machine learning for me ;)')
