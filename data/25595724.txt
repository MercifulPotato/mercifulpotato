Item(by='ocdtrekkie', descendants=None, kids=[25595759], score=None, time=1609440589, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25595547, text='&gt; Perhaps people have ideas they&#x27;d like to discuss, but don&#x27;t want to risk &quot;losing points&quot; because the idea may be unpopular. I know that I have personally experienced this, and stopped myself from expressing an idea because I&#x27;ve been pretty sure it wouldn&#x27;t be popular.<p>This is a problem with your mindset, not the HN system. You should not place significant concern on collecting Internet karma. I currently have over 18,000 karma, and I happily and regularly have expressed thoughts and opinions that get me -4&#x27;d. (Basically, as low as you can go on a given comment.) Doing so has not hurt me in any meaningful capacity, or even, obviously, in a meaningless HN karma capacity. Post unpopular views.<p>I&#x27;m mostly aware that a certain crowd will downvote anytime I point out that Section 230 <i>should</i> be repealed, that we&#x27;d all be better off as a society if Google stopped existing as a website and corporate entity <i>tomorrow</i>, or that unlimited data is a <i>bad</i> thing for ISPs to offer, etc. Sometimes I am surprised when I make a comment I expect to be unpopular, and it ends up somewhat popular!<p>The problem you run into is that many people feel that a comment they disagree with <i>is</i> low quality. Encouraging flagging over downvotes would actually increase censorship: Instead of downvoting, users would flag a lot more comments, and they&#x27;d be more likely to be hidden by the site.')
