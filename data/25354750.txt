Went with the most main stream distro, Ubuntu 20.04.<p>Result: couldn&#x27;t get the Bluetooth conference widget working. Googled around for hours and tried all kinds of things, including compiling and installing kernel modules and replacing the bluetooth stack. Nothing worked. No, this is not an exotic non-standard protocol, it&#x27;s a standard one (I think aptX or so? sorry, forgot the details again already; but I googled around and found lots of people with similar issues, and then many &quot;solutions&quot;, none of which worked; see above)<p>Anyway, I am back to plugging in my MacBook each time we want to video conference, and will soon install Windows on the media server (no matter how much I hate the thought).<p>I really want to use Linux for this kind of stuff, but it&#x27;s 2020 and I can&#x27;t get a Bluetooth widget working that works flawlessly on various Macs, Windows machines, iPhone, iPad and an Android phone.<p>So while things may be better, they are still far from where they could be, I am afraid.')
