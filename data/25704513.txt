Quick gym sessions (45 min or less), strength focused exercises and IMO for those basic barbell movements it is the best.<p>If after you a bit of time you stall in strength and wish to go farther add in more bodybuilding type exercises or switch to another program like Wendlers 5&#x2F;3&#x2F;1...etc<p>But really if I had to recommend anything to most people to stay strong (esp as you age and live the lives we live today), the basic barbell exercises taught in Starting Strength are all you really need for a lifetime.')
