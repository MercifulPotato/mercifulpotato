It&#x27;s clear that other projects like Coq suffer from a lack of traditional mathematicians formalising modern, fashionable topics. Kevin Buzzard&#x27;s implementation in Lean of perfectoid spaces is a great example of that boundary being broken, as far as I can tell the most advanced Coq proofs are the four colour theorem and Feit-Thompson theorem, which have analogue proofs from the 60s and 70s.')
