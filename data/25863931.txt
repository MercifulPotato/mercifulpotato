There&#x27;s probably a place for big, large-scale political questions (who should be president, should we stay in the EU) to be decided by direct democracy, but I wouldn&#x27;t want that for trade or monetary policy.<p>The big problem I see with democracy, in general, is that it&#x27;s highly susceptible to special-interest takeover. When a small group stands to gain disproportionately from a particular outcome, they will lobbby--HARD--to get that outcome. Even when doing so might be so harmful to the overall system, that it collapses, even if they get what they want.<p>The US analog is the SEIU&#x2F;AFSCME organizing so hard that the entire government of a state, like Illinois, becomes beholden to what they want.<p>How did AB5, the TNC bill, pass, when it was overwhelmingly not supported by drivers and the electorate didn&#x27;t want it, either? Teamsters pushed their agenda. Hard.<p>Unions will make no bones about running an employer, government, or other organization absolutely into the ground in the name of advocating for their members&#x27; interests. They do not care about taxpayers, customers, or any other constituency other than themselves and their members. And when it all falls apart, they&#x27;ll just go to the next state&#x2F;company&#x2F;etc. and run the same playbook, over and over.\nIt&#x27;s very harmful. Some things need to be outside the reach of democracy&#x2F;the masses.')
