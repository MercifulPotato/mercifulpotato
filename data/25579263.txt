Then the public hears about the 5% that they don&#x27;t stop, and especially hears about the 0.5%, say, where a probably-unreliable tip was not successfully used to prevent a super-bad act.<p>In order to argue convincingly that agencies are actually bad at using the powers or information that they already have, we would probably want to know a lot more about base rates (and about thwarted or deterred crimes).<p>Edit: This comment downthread <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25579252" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25579252</a> just before mine makes a somewhat similar point (although I was emphasizing the idea that we should want more data for this argument, while the other comment emphasizes the idea that there are more fundamental or important grounds on which to oppose expansions of surveillance powers).')
