I’m a long time mapbox gl js user for <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onthegomap.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;onthegomap.com</a> which costs $300-400 per month for running my own graphhopper routing servers and Stadia Maps tile hosting. It would cost over $3000 per month to upgrade to 2.0 and I have no need for 3D.<p>I also use mapbox gl js for visualizing large datasets locally (precomoute vector tiles from non-geographic datasets), which doesn’t seems like it needs to be reaching out to mapbox servers.<p>Happy to help, I’ve had a few pull requests accepted to the mapbox gl js codebase.')
