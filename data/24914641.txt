There&#x27;s still a double digit percentage of people on this planet who aren&#x27;t able to read or write. They haven&#x27;t been able to benefit from advanced technology at all, until recently, due to the patronizing literacy requirements held by most software. In fact, I seem to recall, at one point or another, Google even made their search engine available by phone in a language that had no written form. Talk about conquering the digital divide.')
