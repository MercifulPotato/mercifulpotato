I&#x27;d like to put if-then-else in the bigger historical context of &quot;structured programming&quot;.<p>In the late 1960s and early 1970s, it was a big debate if programmers should use structured programming, building programs out of blocks with control structures such as iteration and conditionals. (Earlier programs were built from ad hoc control using goto.) This is the context of Dijkstra&#x27;s famous &quot;Go To Statement Considered Harmful.<p>Although structured programming seems obvious now, there was a lot of resistance. At first, people weren&#x27;t even sure if structured programming could implement all the required control flows, so someone (Böhm–Jacopini) had to prove the &quot;structured program theorem&quot;. Languages needed to be modified to support structured programming, e.g. adding block if-else to Fortran 77.<p>I have to wonder what modern programming debates will seem as obvious in retrospect as the victory of structured programming.')
