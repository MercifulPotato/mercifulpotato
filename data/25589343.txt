It just happens to work okay in 3D, and even there it has all sorts of sharp edges, such as gimbal-lock.<p>Geometric algebra is a lot better at modelling physical spaces of arbitrary dimension, and one of its strengths is the ability to take various interesting sub-spaces and use them without having to make changes to formulas.<p>Both the complex numbers and quarternions are such subspaces of matching geometric algebras, so it&#x27;s no surprise that they &quot;turn up&quot; a lot in the algebras of geometric spaces.<p>Interestingly, some of the other subspaces of a GA are isomorphic to the various &quot;complex valued matrices&quot; used in Physics, such as the Pauli matrices and the Gell Mann matrices.<p>These matrices are introduced to students as essentially scalar-valued black boxes. &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about it, they just have the &#x27;right&#x27; properties.&quot; is commonly heard in lectures.<p>This seems like mathematical magic, but no magic is necessary. A much more consistent and logical theory based around GA could have been used, but wasn&#x27;t for merely historic reasons.<p>Unfortunately, lots of people will say that these alternative formulations are all isomorphic to each other, so who cares, just shut up and calculate. However one method yields an intuitive understanding, and the other one yields complex numbers all over the place with no clear picture of their origins...')
