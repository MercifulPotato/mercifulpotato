Unborn child during (planned) pregnancy, for starters. Having to drive &#x2F; commute &#x2F; get home. Employment. Social responsibilities. Then there&#x27;s the myth that in dinner it &#x27;evaporates&#x27; (TL;DR it does not in a meaningful way). Think about it as well: if it would, they wouldn&#x27;t take the effort to include <i>alcohol</i>. Alcohol is highly addictive, which alone is a valid reason to be afraid of it (e.g. my partner&#x27;s father was an alcohol addict *and indirectly died from his addiction). There&#x27;s a nice saying about if it&#x27;d get discovered tomorrow instead of &#x27;existing&#x27; already it&#x27;d get illegal right away. It is also a hard drug. The only one available without a prescription. Having a high enough age (&quot;being an adult&quot;) suffices. Turns out, a lot of people have the number of an adult age, but not the responsibility, plus more often than not alcohol addiction is a symptom of deeper rooted issues involving the individual. Still, it aids in a downward spiral.')
