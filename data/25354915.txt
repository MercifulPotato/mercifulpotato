They are recording your location. You already agreed to that except last time, you said it was &quot;anonymized.&quot; Then you said that it was recorded but not queried. Now you&#x27;re saying they&#x27;re not recording it at all? Keep your facts straight.<p>The worst part is that you&#x27;re paying for this abuse from Apple and then justifying it to others. Nobody else is falling for it.')
