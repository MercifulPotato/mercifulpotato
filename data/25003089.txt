SF has a child&#x27;s notion of how to fix problems. Rich CEO bad? Tax companies for rich CEOs. Tenderloin full of shit? Create a whole new division of people with more taxes to clean up shit. It never addresses the root cause.<p>There won&#x27;t be a Bay Area exodus anytime soon but you bet a startup is going to move out of SF when it starts to get big. The additional taxes will only hurt the companies that have a firm root here and will discourage future companies from forming in SF.<p>Sf wants everything to remain exactly the same in a world that&#x27;s changing faster than ever. It&#x27;s time to encourage new residential units, properly tax land&#x2F;property, and start actually proactively fixing its problematic neighborhoods.')
