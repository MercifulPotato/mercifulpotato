And that then it drips down to partially informed ppl that are basically tamed into whatever position interests oligarchs and that it becomes useless to try to discuss anything because information is just not reaching the overwhelming majority of people. That&#x27;s how you end up with a Bolsonaro.<p>Yeah, sure, democratic&#x2F;western ideals and blah blah, how about when it&#x27;s time to put them into practice? I think sadly we all know what happens, and we mostly just look away. To be clear, I&#x27;m not talking about any single case in particular, it&#x27;s more of an essence thing.')
