Document it before writing a single line of code. Then stick to the plan. It takes discipline, but it&#x27;s not difficult.<p>I mostly write in C with pthreads and as long as one is willing to apply discipline to the task, there&#x27;s no reason to fear concurrency.<p>If one starts adding a thread here and a mutex there and some shared structures over there without any prior plan then yes, absolutely, that leads to a world of hurt and a deep hole that is very difficult to get out of. So, don&#x27;t do that.')
