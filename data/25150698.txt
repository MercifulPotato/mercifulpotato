You&#x27;re supposed to paint the page ASAP, so you don&#x27;t want to defer loading any large content, but then you&#x27;re not supposed to have the page layout shift around at all as you dynamically load all that content later, so you&#x27;ve got to do clever things with placeholders and swapping out content and whatnot. You&#x27;ve got up to 4 seconds to load all that stuff, which is enough to load an enormous amount of data over a fast internet connection, so much so that the same amount of content might take minutes to load over a slower connection. Fortunately, they&#x27;ve chosen methods for measuring that metric that are heavily biased toward measuring the experience of people who have 24&#x2F;7 access to broadband.<p>So, yeah, Google may want to encourage a nice Web experience, but they don&#x27;t want to back this with metrics that might discourage people from sending too much business in AdSense&#x27;s direction, or fail to favor Chrome over alternative browsers.')
