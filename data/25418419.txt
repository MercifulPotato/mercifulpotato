I work at least 9-5.30pm each day, but 5.30pm would be an early sign-off. Usually it&#x27;s at least 6pm.<p>Depending on the day, I could easily work flat out for 7-8 hrs during my day. Meetings, code debugging, code writing, co-ordinating with the team, answering bug queries, writing backlog stories and documenting processes are some of the things I do each day.<p>My personal backlog list is probably about 100 items long, and always growing. So there are always things to do, but this is the nature of the SM role.<p>Deep work happens when I am most relaxed and have a task that is somewhat creative. This could be developing a new process or idea, writing some small code improvement, or thinking about how to improve my team.')
