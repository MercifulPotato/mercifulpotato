Though I generally agree with that premise, that is NOT what the results of this study show. The abstract and visual abstract clearly state this.<p>- The RCT was done only on individuals aged 70-77<p>- Furthermore the results were not statistically significant at p &lt; 0.05. You can see this in the visual abstract where the 95% CI overlaps with risk ratio = 1.0, where 1.0 means &quot;no difference&quot; between the groups.<p>Note that the results being non-stat sig does not mean that there was no difference! It means that the difference, if present, was probably too small to detect given the power (number of participants) included in the study. This is important to understand!<p>Furthermore, in the &quot;Strengths and limitations of this study&quot; they clearly outline some reasons why the results may have been non stat-sig, including:<p>- &quot;Firstly, participants in the control group had a high level of activity throughout the study, and many exercised using HIIT. This might have affected the studyâ€™s ability to detect statistically significant differences between groups.&quot;<p>- &quot;selection bias might have influenced our results, as participants were more active and had better overall health than non-included participants&quot;<p>Basically, even the &quot;control&quot; group looked like they had a good baseline level of activity, decreasing the activity level difference between that and the two treatment groups.<p>My takeaway from this study is that in isolation, it doesn&#x27;t provide much evidence for or against the effect of exercise, but taken together with other studies can be used for evidential value.<p>The results can also be used to inform future studies. The authors clearly understood this when they stated in the main measure outcome: &quot;<i>An exploratory hypothesis was that HIIT lowers mortality more than MICT.</i>&quot;')
