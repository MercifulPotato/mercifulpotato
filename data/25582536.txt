A full house needs a roof and foundation, which I neglected in my original estimate. I don&#x27;t have time to work out an estimate on an entire roof and divide it to assign partial cost to the kitchen, but I doubt the roof and foundation together are going to add any more than anther $6000 for the kitchen alone. The overarching point is that we&#x27;re still a <i>long</i> way from $60,000 for a kitchen.')
