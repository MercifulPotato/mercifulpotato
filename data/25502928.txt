The very act of even associating, even in an antagonistic way, with a Trump supporter is ban worthy?<p>Every moderator whose ever done that should be immediately stripped of all power and banned at the IP level.<p>If Reddit admins weren&#x27;t absolute cowards now, they would do it, but the site is sufficiently corporatized now.')
