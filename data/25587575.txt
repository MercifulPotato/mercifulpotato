What would be the CCP’s motives to study and modify the virus?<p>Is it to test whether different changes would make the virus more&#x2F;less communicable?<p>Is it to prevent another MERS SARS?<p>Is it to tailor disease for certain ethnicities?  CCP doesn’t appear to have qualms about getting rid of troublesome minority populations, as long as they have some amount of deniability to rely on.<p>Is it to stress test global medical science and institutions?<p>I’ll keep an open mind in that if (and it’s a large if) there are respected scientists who present evidence of it being a lab modified virus, then the motive must be understood and fast.<p>Edit:  I <i>will</i> say that China isn’t helping its case by impeding research and publishing of any studies simply trying to establish whether COVID even crossed from local (wild) bat populations; and promoting only theories that claim COVID came from elsewhere.')
