In fact I would say that about Dart in general.<p>It&#x27;s actually an incredibly nice language. It&#x27;s easy to pick up, it runs literally everywhere, it&#x27;s fast, it has good tooling, it&#x27;s sane, it&#x27;s super productive and it&#x27;s quite actively developed.<p>AngularDart could have actually become so much bigger than it ever was and while it isn&#x27;t in any danger of actually dying it may as well be since Google have made it clear that due to the lack of interest they are just going to more or less treat it like an internal framework.<p>I looked at it as a bit of a chicken and egg scenario. It&#x27;s actually an incredibly mature and rock solid framework but they never seemed to invest much into even the basics of documentation. It was a total non-starter for newbies and never had a chance to get a lot of traction. If they had a proper budget put aside for dev-rel I feel that could have been a totally different story with a very different ending.')
