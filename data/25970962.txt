I have abuse complaints emailed to your abuse address that have gone unanswered, so I don&#x27;t believe that you&#x27;re taking your terms of use seriously.<p>You can find my complaints in your inbox. It&#x27;s good to know Google is taking action - will send the same complaints to them in the future since that seems to get more of a response from the devs.')
