I&#x27;ve been reading The Anarchy, which is a history of the East India Company (EIC), and it is full of blunders on all sides.<p>When the EIC first set out from London on their maiden voyage to India, they we&#x27;re becalmed (stuck without wind)  in the mouth of the Thames for <i>6 months</i>. Just sat there, maybe 50 miles from home.<p>During some battle, one of the leaders was so high on opium that he was just dawdling around and got shot in the head.<p>At one point the EIC captured a fort next to one of their factories, then got so distracted looting that a few hours later the enemy returned, re-captured the fort, then forced the EIC out of their original factory.<p>The more I talk to people in positions of power (which is not many, but a few) the more I get the impression that everyone is just going the best they can against the randomness of the universe. (Side note - one of the may reasons I find conspiracy theories hard to believe)')
