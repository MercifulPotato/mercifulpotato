I&#x27;m noticing a wide spread lack of the ability to weigh the pros and cons of policy in order to arrive at a rational decision based on due consideration of legitimate data analysis. I guess we should&#x27;ve been concerned when today&#x27;s young adults couldn&#x27;t discern real from fake news sources. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;books&#x2F;NBK284782&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;books&#x2F;NBK284782&#x2F;</a> \nMakes me wonder how well equipped the next generation of underprivileged and minority children will be, among whom illiteracy will be a serious issue because they and their parents were never able to catch-up socially after being thrown to the wolves of self preservation and unchecked puritanical shaming. Sure a website like hacker news is well-moderated and I am appreciative, but it&#x27;s a matter of scale. A for-profit corporation granted with the ability to control the political narrative of an entire country is neither, &quot;moderated content&quot;, nor, &quot;news&quot;. If time has anything to tell it works fine, until the narrative is wrong.')
