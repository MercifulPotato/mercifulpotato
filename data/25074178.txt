It might be an impious opinion, but there absolutely comes a time in a company&#x27;s existence that internal politics begins to undermine the mission of the entire organization.<p>Of course, I haven&#x27;t worked everywhere and I recognize that this opinion is based purely on my own experience. But companies that generate billions upon billions in revenue seem to care less and less about functional process improvement and more about short-term profit gains. Because ultimately, the C suite is paid based on stock performance for most large companies, and that becomes the only metric that matters. In that situation, everything falls in line behind it.')
