That site truly shows what a &quot;hacker&quot; does, in the furiture domain, but still, decomposing, redesigning, reusing.<p>Exactly like the RFC 1392 (aka &quot;Internet Users&#x27; Glossary&quot;) as you mention. There is a distinction to the word &quot;cracker&quot; which shows malicious intent (what our dear friends on EF + NSA are doing).<p>This piece of news should also be a reminder to ALL, that these agencies that &quot;protect&quot; us (irrespective of flag) cannot and should not be trusted with&#x2F;for anything. Especially not with the truth.')
