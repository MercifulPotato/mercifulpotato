Those (careless?) empirical researchers whose careers are being retrospectively ripped apart are inevitably horrified (and coming up with a huge range of arguments both reasonable and unreasonable as to why they shouldn&#x27;t) while theorists are mostly happy and younger empiricists are taking up the reproducability&#x2F;better science challenge with some enthusiasm. Likewise, attitudes to perfect citation vary wildly. I don&#x27;t care as long as it&#x27;s vaguely consistent, which is a common (but not universal) position in my sub-discipline.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how much of your experiences are specifically a feature of management research rather than the social sciences in general. I spent a bit of time studying management (and being a manager, in pre-academic times), though now I&#x27;m a computational political communication academic. Management research is seen by the rest of us as a bit weird - a bit of an outsider discipline, with different attitudes and surprisingly little scholarly overlap. I wouldn&#x27;t expect that many political scientists or sociologists to be Taylorists, for example.<p>Publish or perish, boring papers, and problematic academic management on the other hand - that is very familiar.')
