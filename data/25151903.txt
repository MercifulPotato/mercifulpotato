Looking at switching, I imagine they have the desktop experience down. I love Spotify, but I can&#x27;t imagine a worse experience outside of their mobile app. The web player was nice but fails to load music two-three times per listening session (to be fair, they are usually 5-8hrs), the desktop application is slow, clunky, and will regularly not play music I have downloaded.')
