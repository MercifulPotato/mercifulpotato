Her subsequent behaviour - submitting without approval, rant, ultimatum, and resignation - did. And she wasn&#x27;t &quot;forced out&quot;: she resigned of her own volition. She could have chosen to make improvements to the paper based on the feedback she was given, resubmit it for approval, and then get on with her life, but she went the other way.<p>This sounds a lot like taking what Google said without including Timnit’s point of view.
