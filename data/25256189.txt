I don&#x27;t play chess to win. I play to get better at chess. And that will happen either way.<p>The learning resources provide by a good online chess site are fantastic today. Puzzles, interactive lessons, instant analysis of your games as soon as they are over. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s ever been a better time to learn chess.')
