Like you advised, I exercise critical thinking, and then I take a risk.<p>On someone else&#x27;s production machine, or a container with sensitive data, that risk is too high.  On a fun machine in isolation it&#x27;s fine.<p>The GPP asks what&#x27;s the security difference between inspecting and not inspecting the downloaded command.<p>&gt; or that they have been compromised by a malicious actor without being detected at the same time you run the installer<p>Installers are compromised quite often by malicious actors.  Running an installer is just as dubious as running &quot;curl | sh&quot;.<p>However, replacing an installer with one that looks the same but is actually malicious, is a lot more work than replacing a blind script with one that looks the same but is actually malicious.<p>And the risk of a malicious blind script going unnoticed is higher than a compromised installer when the SHA256 is shown to be checked alongside the latter&#x27;s link, simply because the attacker would need to change two places instead of one.  Yes I do check hashes of installers when that&#x27;s possible and there isn&#x27;t a package manager already doing so.  It&#x27;s a good idea anyway in case of a corrupted download file, which I do see from time to time.')
