In European history tattoos specifically are associated with punishment, judgement and exploitation: Cain was &quot;marked&quot; and banished from eden, slaves and prisoners both past and present have born brands or tattoos which marked them as second-class citizens. In the United States, being marked by the government specifically is considered a sign of the apocalypse so there is a very strong fear about such things.<p>However this can have a positive effect in a different context. Maori don&#x27;t come from a Christian background, so the act of marking people has a completely different meaning. If my life story is permanently written on my skin, that&#x27;s a strong motivator to live well and do things I can be proud of. If my ancestry is part of my public  identity, then I must also be excellent, so that my actions reflect well on my descendents and those descendents have a good role model to emulate in their lives. I think it encourages a strong sense of individual responsibility, a focus on supporting the community and multigenerational thinking.')
