I consume the product, I have many friends who make it (and do other sex work), I publicly advocate for decriminalization of prostitution.<p>The thing that’s sleazy about it is that none of the piracy sites are pirating one brand. So if the owner of one brand is operating such a site, he is certainly peddling pirated work from competitors, which is probably diverting revenue to other sex workers and even the ones who perform on his payroll.<p>It’s pretty likely he’s doing other shady shit besides.<p>For what it’s worth, this is an opportunity for any disgusting person because the law and the stigma around sex work make protecting workers difficult.
