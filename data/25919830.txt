Much of the Agile&#x2F;project tracking stuff is in Jira&#x2F;Basecamp&#x2F;Asana&#x2F;TeamCity (or GitHub projects + issues can be used if your needs are small). Some of the other stuff is done by a myriad of GitHub actions&#x2F;bots (you&#x27;d have to spend some time getting that the way you want it though)<p>If you want everything integrated together this is probably fine, but GitHub Enterprise + Jira Premium is $35 per user per month (and every other project management tool is cheaper and better than Jira, just about). I don&#x27;t know what the value add is here, other than self-hosting. (Or at least, the $65 value add).')
