That allows essentially prosecution for nothing against anyone currently out of favor with the powers that be. It obscures this deliberate corruption by hiding it behind a veneer of legalism, and allows apologists to claim &quot;if they didn&#x27;t want to be arrested, they shouldn&#x27;t have done X&quot;. It erodes the idea of laws being backed by justice, and makes them simply another tool of the powerful against the powerless.')
