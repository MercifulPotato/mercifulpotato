I enjoy story progression and the accomplishment of finishing. I find longer games to much of a time commitment. The last AAA game I quit was Mass Effect Andromeda. I loved the first two games. I love the world building of the series. But the game loop was so repetitive with very little story progression as I went from planet to planet not really discovering anything new. A good story is told succinctly in just the amount of time needed. This is why Breaking Bad is a better story than Lost. Because Breaking Bad had a beginning, middle, and end and each part had purpose that aligned with the others.')
