It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;ve been clinically depressed.  Knowing that I&#x27;ve been through periods of down moods before helps me ride out down periods and keep patiently going through the things I&#x27;ve found help me cope.<p>I&#x27;ve found that high-intensity workouts several times per week are very important for my mood.  St. John&#x27;s Wort also works very well for me.  If I start feeling a bit down, I need to make sure I get out on the weekend and don&#x27;t let myself sleep in much past 10 a.m.  Breathing&#x2F;mindfulness exercises also help keep my mood steady.')
