The big performance issues early on were compilation speed -- Racket had a simple JIT compiler that ran almost instantly.<p>2. Some rewritten parts of the system, such as IO, were initially slower, but have now been improved to catch up to the previous implementation.<p>3. Chez Scheme didn&#x27;t support some performance features that Racket BC had, such as unboxed floating point arithmetic, parallel GC, or continuation marks. Those have been added to (Racket&#x27;s variant of) Chez Scheme.<p>4. Racket&#x27;s prior compiler was somewhat more competitive with Chez Scheme than we expected, particularly for larger and more Racket-idiomatic programs.')
