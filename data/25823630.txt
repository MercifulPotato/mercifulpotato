Julia uses an &quot;end&quot; keyword everywhere, which is imho too verbose (and the corresponding &quot;begin&quot; is missing so it&#x27;s inconsistent).<p>This is an absolutely childish approach to comparing or selecting programming languages.<p>In my eyes, it says a lot about the maturity of software development as a discipline that a big chunk of our debates are at this level.<p>We should discuss about quality, breadth and depth of standard libraries, quality of implementation of the most common interpreters&#x2F;compilers, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t want to fault you personally, OP, I think this approach is quite widespread, unfortunately, one could say that it&#x27;s part of our software development culture at this point.')
