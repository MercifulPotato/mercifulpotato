I think it&#x27;s best to use the same durations for this, as an entire day changes the level of impact. &lt;1hr outages have a fraction of the impact that an entire days outage might have.<p>It&#x27;s obviously subjective, but even with our entire work leaning on Google– from GMail, GDrive and Google Docs, through to all our infrastructure being in GCP– todays outage just meant everyone took an hour break. History suggests we won&#x27;t see another of these for another year, so everyone taking a collective 60m break has been minimally impactful vs many smaller, isolated outages spread over the year.')
