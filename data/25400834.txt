The photo gallery shows it placed quite some distance in front of the teapot, which I guess is what you would expect.<p>We recently bought an Utah teapot - a company that I think is the original manufacturer (Friesland Porzellan) still produces them, nowadays promoting mainly to people like us who are familiar with it as a wireframe. Apparently the design is from the 1950s, which seems congruent with the way it looks. The thing that is most striking about it, in use, is that it&#x27;s an incredibly good pourer compared to most of the other teapots we&#x27;ve owned. I am almost transfixed by the smoothness of the tea leaving the spout.')
