I know because I have done that. And yes, if you don&#x27;t have the right version it might <i>look</i> like I never intended to buy.<p>Really though, if you don&#x27;t already have detailed pictures posted that show the state of the product from all sides then that&#x27;s something I&#x27;d consider a problem with your used games business.')
