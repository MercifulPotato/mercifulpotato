The limits of the CCPA, GDPR, and likely some future US federal data privacy act do constrain the possible outcomes.<p>I&#x27;m not sure my opinion of this should happen or that should happen matters one bit. In the US Republicans and Democrats hate Google. In the EU the regulators detest them. In China they are locked out of the market and its a laugh that any executives think they would be allowed in. What that means is Google has almost no political capital today and is basically fucked, short of the billions of dollars they will spend on lawyers.<p>What Google is or isn&#x27;t banned from doing depends on how the end &quot;Google&quot; looks. The pending state AG charges likely will cover a lot more of those details. The DOJ thing was known to have been rushed, they wanted it filed this past summer, but this week probably was the last possible window prior to the election. Ironically while the DOJ is now accused of rushing this case because of White House pressure, the Democrat State AGs are saying there actually should be more charges against Google, not less.<p>That doesn&#x27;t make things look better for Google, it makes them much worse than we&#x27;ve seen so far. Google today certainly looks a lot different then during the Obama administration when a Google lobbyist or employee would visit the White House on average <i>once a week.</i> What happened there is a mystery to me.<p>There are multiple possible outcomes here. Who knows when anything will happen, but, my guess is some combination of these things, but not all together -<p>- Split the search ad business from search engine<p>- Divest Chrome&#x2F;Android from Alphabet<p>- Force them in to some transparent search ad exchange arrangement, meaning not just advertisers but other search engines<p>Whatever the outcome here, Microsoft is probably the biggest winner. Facebook wins in terms of any incremental ad dollars they gain from Google advertisers. Amazon is also positioned very well if they chose to take advantage of it.<p>Apple is probably in the worst shape next to Google, as it is estimated 15%-20% of their profits come from the Google arrangement. Combined with changes to Apple&#x27;s tax rates globally, I could see this chopping Apple&#x27;s value in half. If 50% of Google&#x27;s US search traffic is coming from Apple, and half of the users who actually click on ads and buy stuff never leave the default search, the outcome for Alphabet&#x27;s finances is <i>really, really</i> bad.<p>This matters a lot. There are users who install adblockers and will directly navigate to google.com no matter what. Those users are worthless to Google. The users that matter are the ones who don&#x27;t change the default search, possibly click ads for <i>every single search they do</i> that has ads for the top results, and those users do buy things after clicking the ads. If Google lost half of those users, do the math.<p>Google&#x2F;Alphabet&#x27;s cash cow is paid search ads. Anything that sticks a wrench in this business model will bring an end to their golden age of doing a bunch of stuff that loses money while riding a tsunami of background cash flow. If they are split up, meaning Search, Ads, and Youtube, that probably is the best $ outcome for shareholders longer term, and Alphabet&#x27;s ultra wealthy employees probably still get sick stock options.')
