They&#x27;re just tools—they have a time and a place. If you&#x27;ve tried integrating with an email or SMS gateway, or a legacy rate limited bank you might have a different experience. Or dealing with slow job execution combined with spiky high speed job creation.<p>Depends entirely on the problem, and probably the solution team and constraints as well. Don&#x27;t think it makes sense to dismiss them out of hand for all problems, though—just as it doesn&#x27;t make sense to claim that they should be used for each and every problem.')
