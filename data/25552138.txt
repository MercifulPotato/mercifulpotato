If you are inclined enough to do so you can try it yourself. set it to a non existing address and you will see it will be routed regardless... or even set it to the address of an existing peer that has it set in its AllowedIPs setting and you will notice the peer that has the packets destination set as AllowedIPs setting will get the packets. which makes some sense as return traffic would only be allowed to come from that peer anyhow. i.e. for incoming packets the routing table is not even considered at all (analog to reverse path filtering).')
