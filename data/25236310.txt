For obvious reasons I ended up watching a Tony&#x27;s presentation. He was sharing a lot of stories about Zappos and in the end he talked about their Culture Book (a book entirely written by Zappos employees, with no editing).<p>Immediately after watch it I sent an email directly for him (at the time a CEO of a company that would be sold to Amazon for 1.2B 8 months after) asking if I could have a digital version of the book since I was living in Brazil. For my complete surprise I received a response in less than 1 hour just asking for my address. One day after I received a physical copy of the book, signed by the very own Tony Hsieh. He even invited me to visit Zappos offices if I ever were in Las Vegas!<p>Today I woke up with this sad news.\nDefinitely, a huge loss to the world. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll always be an inspiration to many.<p>Rest in peace Tony Hsieh,\nA big fan')
