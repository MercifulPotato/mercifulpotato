Word just doesn&#x27;t intersperse formatting codes in the stream like WordPerfect did (or html does, to some extent). It puts all formatting information in a binary block at the end of each paragraph. That&#x27;s both more flexible, and more fragile.<p>As an aside, me and my wife, we translated WordPerfect 6 for DOS into Latin for the Vatican, as freelance translators.')
