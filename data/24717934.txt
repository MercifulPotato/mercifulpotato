So an important assumption to make for the Monty Hall problem to work, is that Monty announced what he will do after you pick your door _before_ you pick your door. Only in that case do you have your counterfactuals correct and in that case it is indeed better to swap doors. It is a hidden assumption in most probability theory type of answers.')
