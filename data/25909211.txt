Say you just graduated college and make 30k as a waiter.  You scrape together savings, loans, CCs, etc. and pull together 20k.  Take that to Robinhood 2-3x it with margin and place a 50k bet that has a 8% chance to pay off 10x. If you &quot;win&quot; you&#x27;re up 15 years of wages or more.  If you lose, well, you declare bankruptcy and shit gets wiped.  It&#x27;s not like you were buying a house or a nice car on 30k a year anyways.')
