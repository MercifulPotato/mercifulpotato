GPL on the other hand doesn’t have an expiry date.<p>In addition, there’s no implicit patent, you have to apply in every jurisdiction where you want to protect your idea, and IIRC in most jurisdictions you either can’t retroactively apply for a patent after you’ve published the idea, or you only have a short period after publishing before the right is forfeited.')
