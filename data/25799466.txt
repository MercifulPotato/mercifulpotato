It works well with x^y as exponent&#x2F;repeat, since the rhs is qualitatively different anyway[0], and also gives you (with +) a sum-of-products&#x2F;dioid&#x2F;semiring structure for concatenation and alternation on regular expressions. Admittedly, you still don&#x27;t have a sensible semantics for division, but that&#x27;s true of plenty of other product operators (even int is iffy - either not closed (div-as-float&#x2F;rational&#x2F;etc) or not a multiplicative inverse (divmod)).<p>0: In particular, exponentiation by natural numbers (or positive integers for things like nonempty lists that deliberately exclude the multiplicative identity) is almost always well defined, even if the thing you&#x27;re exponentiating bears no resemblance to a natural number.')
