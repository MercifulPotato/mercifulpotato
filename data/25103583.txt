I&#x27;d previously tested some infinite terrain ideas in Three.JS but the resulting code was hundreds of kilobytes and slowed down my computer significantly.<p>I learned the basics of vertex and fragment shaders for this project, and realized that infinite terrain could be rendered efficiently by creating a fixed plane mesh and modulating its vertices with the vertex shader using a noise function that takes into account player movement. The resulting demo app runs smoothly on my laptop and mobile device.<p>Source code here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;freedmand&#x2F;infiniteterrain" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;freedmand&#x2F;infiniteterrain</a>')
