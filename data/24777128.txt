You always need to wait for maintainer to package it for you, and it is not as fast as upstream. To have multiple version of a same package usually require to compile yourself, use a PPA or download a package and install it. Compiling a software not always easy, and it takes times. The PPA and install a random package from Internet isn&#x27;t really securer than Windows&#x27;s way of software distribution IMO.')
