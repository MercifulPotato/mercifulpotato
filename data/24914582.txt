I often see it where I work at a lower level with new managers who want to rename the departments under them. It means they can immediately say in their first performance review &quot;I <i>created</i> department X!&quot;.<p>Part of the way I identify good managers is by whether or not they do such a thing, or whether they wait a year to fully understand things before making more substantive changes.
