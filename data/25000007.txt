The problem is you&#x27;re taking your C# &#x2F; .NET libraries for which solution already exist in the browser instead of building APIs around what already exists in the browser.<p>To put it another way, instead of starting with wrapped native apis and doing wasm last. Start with browser apis and make native ports of those, then you&#x27;ll get something that works well in the browser and (95% of the time IMO) will work fine in your native version as well.')
