Item(by='Lazare', descendants=None, kids=[25900122], score=None, time=1611549085, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25881724, text='Odd story.<p>First, the teapot isn&#x27;t actually famous. It seems to be the second known copy of another, much more famous teapot, but even <i>that</i> teapot would not seem to be the worlds &quot;most famous&quot; by any objective measure, and the story doesn&#x27;t even try to justify that title.<p>Second, as the story notes, provenance in artwork is <i>extremely</i> critical. But having noted that this is an issue, that&#x27;s...essentially the last we ever hear of it. There seems remarkably little curiosity about the backstory.<p>Third, the story notes that the seller refused to provide the name of the person who gifted the teapot to them, apparently for fear that the person would be upset when they discovered how valuable it was.  But of course, once a story has been published and written, and the teapot is on permanent display in a museum in the country of the gift giver, wouldn&#x27;t they find out....anyhow?<p>Fourth, the whole concept of Canada having laws to restrict the movement of an British tea pot feels a bit strange. I have mixed feelings about laws that try to keep a countries cultural heritage inside its borders, but I can certainly see the argument for them. This seems harder to justify, but it&#x27;s presented a self-obvious good by the article, with no real reflection.<p>Fifth, the headline is just...weird. There wasn&#x27;t really a tempest, and it wasn&#x27;t international; it was an article written by a Canadian about another Canadian&#x27;s rather boring interaction with an obscure part of the Canadian government staffed with Canadians. I know, I know, the urge to cram some sort of pun in the headline was overwhelming, but this one just had no relevance.<p>On the other hand, it <i>is</i> a lovely (if impractical) tea pot design, and I found it interesting that it had been made in 1879; it looks more like something made in 1979. Modern, clean, elegant. I&#x27;m glad I read the article, even if the tone just seemed oddly...unquestioning.')
