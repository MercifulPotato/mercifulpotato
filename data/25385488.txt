From what I know, Facebook makes some real euros there, so adoption rate is quite high, but still, democracy is not &quot;under attack&quot; in these countries because of &quot;automated newsfeed&quot;.<p>Consider these countries as a control group for &quot;facebook being bad for democracy&quot; test.<p>Maybe US should take a hard look into a mirror and accept the fact that it is very polarized country, not very cohesive society, with very little common ground (if any at all) between different factions, and facebook just shows this fact.<p>Don&#x27;t blame the mirror for what you see in it.')
