Inflation of assets, home prices, equities should be considered.<p>Their mandate is not comprehensive enough. They&#x27;ve created a huge societal risk by effectively propping up companies that took on excessive risk or were otherwise poorly managed. Yes, they blunted unemployment in the short run, but excessive risk taking is now being rewarded, which has longer run consequences.<p>It&#x27;s natural and healthy for poorly run companies to fail in times of crises... it leads to strong companies surviving and more stability in the long run.<p>They&#x27;ve also positioned it such that it will be very difficult to raise interest rates in a reasonable timeframe. When the next crisis comes, there are fewer levers to pull.<p>Finally, it&#x27;s pretty clear the Fed is watching the stock market closely, as they backed off on increasing rates after the market dipped in Dec 2018. Their actions show they aren&#x27;t strictly abiding by their mandate (see also: they very recently changed their rules on what they consider unacceptably high inflation)')
