I&#x27;ll search for it &quot;along my route&quot; and I get a bunch of other gas stations that I don&#x27;t want.<p>I suspect they are prioritizing the other gas station brands because they paid for preference, and selected &quot;Maverik&quot; as one of their keywords, but the impact to me is that the exact thing I searched for doesn&#x27;t come up even though I know it&#x27;s there because I&#x27;ve stopped there before.<p>If somebody gives me a simple maps product algorithm that just shows me what I&#x27;m asking for without preferencing paid people using key words and I&#x27;ll likely switch.  I&#x27;ve loved Google for many years but they are getting much worse.')
