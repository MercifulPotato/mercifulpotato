You just weren&#x27;t able to. Now things are much more complicated and this complicated services are assembled in a haphazard way to form big applications and platforms (e.g. too lazy to bind a folder with proper config to enable SSL, so put an NGINX https bridge container in front of it). As a result, the edge cases are not as edge anymore and breaking the configuration of a webapp is much easier.<p>Similarly this onion structure of abstraction over abstraction makes debugging and mending things much harder. To fix a one-off bug in a DB operation, you need to go to relevant container inside the pod, find its DB location, access if you can and update the table. That table maybe anywhere on this planet. This is impossible for a support engineer in most cases since we have convoluted SSO configurations which makes this kind of access impossible and the original developers couldn&#x27;t care less in many cases.<p>I&#x27;ll sound old, but even the new capabilities are fascinating, we have gone backwards in a lot of things, software quality and robustness related IMHO.')
