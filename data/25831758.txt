It&#x27;s a shame that they have split up BBC UK and BBC International so strictly and do everything they can to lock all BBC UK offerings to citizens of the UK. It infuriates me that I&#x27;m redirected from bbc.co.uk to bbc.com and are being displayed something else than people in the UK. If I go to bbc.co.uk, I do that to find out what Brits are seeing.<p>My girlfriend would gladly pay for being able to access BBC UK series, but that&#x27;s apparently impossible. They&#x27;ve made some horrible contracts with BBC International that seem to prohibit that. It makes no sense that she has to resort to illegal streaming even though she&#x27;d love to be a paying customer.<p>Another problem is also that BBC International creates and distributes US productions that are far below their normal standards. So if you&#x27;re looking for BBC nature documentaries, for instance, you have to manually sort out all those trashy international productions that are like National Geographic commercials. As I&#x27;ve said, it&#x27;s a shame.')
