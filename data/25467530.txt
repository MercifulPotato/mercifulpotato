As ARM server designs love to throw out tens to hundreds of cores which sounds good on paper, but are not really useful to lots of workloads as they have a shit interconnect or lots of NUMA nodes.<p>Interconnect is key, e.g., see the improvements between zen2 and zen3, especially for the `4 &lt; cores &lt;= 8` models - which stem mostly from having 8 cores per die with direct good interconnect, instead of two dies with only 4 cores.<p>An anecdote: I got some hands on a box with a Cavium ThunderX2 96 logical core processor about two years ago, kernel compiled slower than on my high-end, but non overclocked and common, i7 based workstation from ~ 2015 - that is certainly not to a statistical relevant comparison and there may be some workloads that do good with those CPUs, but it&#x27;s neither single thread nor massively parallel, maybe something in between...')
