The millionaire lobbyist birthday party, the $350 and up plating, the enclosed space, no masks, the other lobbyist guests. It makes it pretty hard to believe they are thinking about their constituents or even have the ability to empathize with them at all. Are we supposed to believe these friendships have 0 effect on enacted policy?\n Is it the wealth and power these people have had throughout their life that makes them do things like this? Is it the fact they know they could get the best doctors and treatment if they did happen to catch the disease, whereas the waitstaff serving them doesn’t even have insurance?<p>It plays so infuriatingly perfect into the “the virus severity is a hoax made to profit big pharma and give more power to the government” conspiracy. I’m beginning to see how people could become convinced of things like this and then jump to even more extremist conspiracies')
