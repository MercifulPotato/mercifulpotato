The next step will be, even having these animals on pastures is unethical, as they cannot be free to go where they want (despite these essentially domesticated livestock being unable to live in the wild without heavy evolutionary pressures I.e. massive death or extinction)<p>The only way for this massive death&#x2F;extinction (within the current system) is if everyone adopts this vision overnight.\nWhat&#x27;s more likely to happen is by people eating less and less meat, animals will be less and less bred by farmers. Probably something similar to when cars supplanted horses in cities.')
