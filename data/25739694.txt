(They&#x27;re still extremely useful for e.g. circuit analysis, as a practical application)<p>But it&#x27;s not just complex conjugates, but eigenvectors as well. Also spectacular: &quot;the square root of a negative number, which by definition does not exist&quot;<p>Uh. That&#x27;s a complete lack of connection to anything beyond 10th grade math. Maybe not the ideal foundation for criticizing QM.<p>And yes, I get the complaint that QM comes with a lot of &quot;if you just hold your nose and accept this&quot;, and intuition doesn&#x27;t really work for it - but that&#x27;s hardly a valid criticism by itself, outside of saying &quot;well, this is hard to understand&quot;.<p>And the idea that a mathematical model isn&#x27;t perfect and as a result of that can&#x27;t be true really just betrays a complete misunderstanding how models work.<p>This piece boils down to &quot;I don&#x27;t understand it, and so it can&#x27;t be correct&quot;.')
