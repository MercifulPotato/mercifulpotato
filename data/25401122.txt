Using H.265 to anything other than experiment and research in my country(as the patent law stated these for the exception of patent use) has a risk we cannot take.<p>I guess rest of us, honest patent-abiding citizen and low profit buziness have to wait until the middle of 2030s to use H.265 safely.')
