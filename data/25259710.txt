Very large. The number who need 32GB is at least an order of magnitude smaller. The number who need 64GB another order of magnitude smaller. The number who need 256GB of RAM or more is likely in the low thousands or even hundreds.<p>&quot;need&quot; can be a combination of objective and subjective takes, but I would posit that the amount who would at least purport to need 256GB+ is radically, radically higher than the low thousands.')
