Of course, you couldn&#x27;t actually read that whole list as there are too many of them. In the US, there are hundreds of thousands of software patents.</i><p><i>There is no way you can keep track of what they are all about. You would have to try to search for relevant ones. Some people say that should be easy in these modern days of computers. You could search for key words and so-on. That one works to a certain extent. You will find some patents in the area. You won&#x27;t necessarily find them all however. For instance, there was a software patent which may have expired by now on natural order recalculation in spread sheets. This means basically that when you make certain cells depend upon other cells, it always recalculates everything after the things it depends on, so that after one re-calculation, everything is up to date. The first spread sheets did their recalculation top-down, so if you made a cell depend on a cell lower down, and you had a few such steps, you had to recalculate several times to get the new values to propagate upwards. You were supposed to have things depend upon cells above them. Then someone realized why don&#x27;t I do the recalculation so that everything gets recalculated after the things it depends upon? This algorithm is known as topological sorting. The first reference to it I could find was in 1963. The patent covered several dozen different ways you could implement topological sorting but you wouldn&#x27;t have found this patent by searching for spreadsheet. You couldn&#x27;t have found it by searching for natural order or topological sort. It didn&#x27;t have any of those terms in it. In fact, it was described as a method of compiling formulas into object code. When I first saw it, I thought it was the wrong patent.</i>”<p>— Richard Stallman, 2002 (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;software-patents" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;philosophy&#x2F;software-patents</a>)')
