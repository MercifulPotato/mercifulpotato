Item(by='KwisatzHaderack', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608849156, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25521794, text='&gt; candidate can come off as likeable to one interviewer and unlikeable to another.<p>&gt;  I apparently got rejected was that &quot;I asked too many (clarifying) questions&quot; about the leetcode problem.<p>&gt;  I get rejected again, and given feedback. One of the reasons given? &quot;I asked too few questions&quot;.<p>It sounds like they didn&#x27;t like you _personally_.  If the rejection reason wasn&#x27;t due to technical or behavioral mismatch but a fake reason like the ones above, it&#x27;s the often the problematic &quot;Airport test&quot; (ie. They don&#x27;t want to be stuck in an airport with you&quot;reason).<p>And to be clear, I think it&#x27;s wrong to reject candidates because you personally can&#x27;t think of &quot;being friends&quot; with them.  It&#x27;s unfair to both the candidate, but also the company as it misses out on great engineers.')
