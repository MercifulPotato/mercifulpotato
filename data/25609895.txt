When I was younger, especially at the beginning of college, I loved to build things by programming. I learned new languages, new patterns, wrote an OS, a website with all the front end complexity, etc. I could hack something on the weekend outside of schoolwork.<p>For a few years it has felt so difficult to start something - perhaps a curse of “experience” is that you see the failure modes ahead of time. I think I’m overall more efficient, but my motivation to just strike out there and try something has been wrung out of me.<p>Lately I’ve been trying to trick myself into working through that feeling and learning on the side. A desire to “finish” (i.e. write up as a blog post, publish software, send to a friend) is what gets me to overcome this bias to inaction. But it still shocks me how much more creative energy I had as an 18 year old than I do now.')
