After that they are written off. But let the lenders see everything -- school, major, test scores.<p>This ensures loans can never become a crushing burden. But more importantly, it incentivises the banks to provide very useful information to the potential students. Unlike colleges who, since they get paid up front, are strongly incentivised to let marginal students study expensive things.')
