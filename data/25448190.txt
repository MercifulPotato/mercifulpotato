While it is of course true that there are situations that require a deeper knowledge of Docker, this is also not universally true.<p>Many projects these days have a Getting Started doc that has some options like:<p>- Build from source<p>- Install this package<p>- Use Docker<p>I often choose the Docker option because I know I&#x27;ll (most likely) get a working version of the project in 5 minutes with minimal effort. I might not even fully understand the project yet or its architecture (much less that of Docker), but I can get it up and running with `docker pull` and `docker run`.<p>In many cases, I&#x27;ll never need to know anything more.<p>I&#x27;ve personally spent more time using docker to build my own stuff, so I&#x27;ve had to learn more. But for many folks, it absolutely is a magical box that just works, and that&#x27;s perfectly ok.<p>I agree that all abstractions tend to eventually leak. But depending on why you&#x27;re using Docker, you may never have a reason to encounter that leakage.')
