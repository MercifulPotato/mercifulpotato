I used it just for myself and never had a problem, so one day I posted it with instructions on how to use it. A few minutes later I got a really angry reply; some guy had hit a weird edge case and it was downloading the same links over and over, rapidly filling up his small SSD and causing all kinds of problems. I apologized and posted a fix, but I was already getting absolutely reamed in the replies by other people who either had the same bug, or some other. That&#x27;s how I learned newbies should not throw random code on the Internet - it pisses people off when you tell them &quot;Use this!&quot; and then it breaks their computer.<p>When I people say &quot;I want everyone to be able to code on the web in JavaScript&quot;, what I really hear is &quot;I want an Internet full of broken, unusable, and possibly dangerous garbage, written in one of the least safe and elegant languages ever created, where most things are completely hostile to the majority who come across it.&quot;<p>Additionally, if this person can&#x27;t read a ten-minute tutorial on how to install Ruby with homebrew, imagine what else they probably won&#x27;t do:<p>- Read&#x2F;write a CoC or contributor&#x27;s guidelines\n- Spend time translating their web pages, or making them accessible\n- Understand basic security and privacy issues&#x2F;best practices\n- Take the extra time to make useful bug reports, or make reports at all\n- Read (or write) references, documentation, or tutorials\n- Learn general netiquette for commits, mailing lists, pull requests\n- Understand the basics of open-source licenses<p>And maybe this is totally fine for your completely personal hobby project, but the next logical step is having other people use it. This isn&#x27;t the kind of behavior we want to carry into that next step.')
