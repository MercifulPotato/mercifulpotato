And several outlets did investigative journalism on how easy it was to hack the election machines. Also the DNC servers.

But there was very clear allegations of hacking, with mysterious and secret evidence of Russians and Putin himself involved, as there always is...<p>The distinction you&#x27;re saying appeared in the MSM only after Biden win.
