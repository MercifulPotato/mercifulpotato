If I remember correctly it was the first time Apple turns to using lots of animations for their product page. Before that Apple&#x27;s product page were fast, beautiful and elegant.<p>The TrashCan webpage was using lots of animations to show case their <i>cant innovate anymore my ass</i>. Your MacBook Fan would spin up simply by scrolling through the page as if Apple were nagging you its time to upgrade your Mac.<p>I think they learned their lesson and tune down those animation abit with later products and pay more attention to performance. But since then it has spread across the industry like plague. You dont get fired for using and designing with flashy animation because Apple are doing it.')
