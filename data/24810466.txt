Since then the fancy solution is incomplete and mothballed while the simple deployment has been running ever since.<p>The next value add was consolidating data in a db with web ui so relevant non-devs can view and help add to it + easily integrate different data sources with automatic validation. I wish their was a nice open source thing here you could spin up without much effort. There&#x27;s middle ground between complex&#x2F;paid full solution that can scale to huge data sets and integrate with turking etc and emailing csvs or sharing google sheets links around.')
