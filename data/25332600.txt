A test mindset that ranges from the business ideas, to the new features developed and the code that we write.<p>We enforce 100% test coverage. Not 90, not 95, not 99, but 100. You need to test your code if you want to reach production. And production is the only environment we have. Having just prod generates less friction and allows us to make more changes, more features. But in order to live by this premise, the team needs to be really good at testing.')
