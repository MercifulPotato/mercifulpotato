It also had at least one significant vulnerability (some code injection IIRC) so I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d say that it does &quot;encryption well&quot;. Having applications with such a needlessly huge attack surface is not good crypto in my book.<p>I do like Signal, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t put up with that software. But you can both enjoy the protocol and Android client and think that the desktop app is a pile a donkey dung.')
