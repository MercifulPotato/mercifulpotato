If I was editing code in the languages they used in environments like theirs using underlying tools that performed like their tools in a codebase the size of `ex`&#x27;s, I&#x27;d certainly trust the defaults. But I&#x27;m not doing any of those things.<p>Today, I work in a codebase whose <i>human-readable source alone</i> might be larger than any installed digital storage system that existed when vi&#x27;s shortcuts were chosen. By necessity I navigate it with semantically-aware indexing and information-retrieval tools that would have been miraculous back then. My edits are guided by static analysis and effected with automated refactoring and code generation tools.<p>My configuration doesn&#x27;t suit my environment as well as vi&#x27;s defaults suited their environment. It does, however, suit my environment better than vi&#x27;s defaults do.<p>And let&#x27;s not even get into emacs configurations. :P')
