I&#x27;ve been following the blockchain space for some time now (mainly from a point of view focused on the technologies and what new use-cases it enables), and while there are a lot of bells and whistles especially from new projects and those not so familiar with the technology, it&#x27;s great to see sustained developer interest and even growth this year since the bull run. Reminds me of the early internet days when a few people saw and firmly believed the technology could vastly transform the world and how we live our lives.<p>At the end of the day, blockchain is a new and fascinating technology enabling digitization of things requiring trust, and being able to do that anonymously and at scale is in my opinion a breakthrough that will have a lot of disruption in the next few years.')
