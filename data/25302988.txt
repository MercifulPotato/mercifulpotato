You know that feeling when you read some code and it&#x27;s like &quot;am I an idiot or is it this code?&quot;  The state machine graph was:<p><pre><code>    A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt; D\n</code></pre>\nHe used a FSM library for this.  I replaced it all with about ten lines of code and bounced it back to him.  I got the feeling after that that he didn&#x27;t like me, but wtf am I supposed to do?  Dude&#x27;s my boss but he doesn&#x27;t know what a state machine is.<p>(I was ready to quit, talked to HR on Friday, Monday they laid me off.  Bullet dodged IMO.)')
