Item(by='WorldMaker', descendants=None, kids=[25274999], score=None, time=1606848832, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25265412, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t think ARM Windows will go to places anywhere soon since software availability is the only thing that keeps users bound to Windows in the first place.<p>Windows on ARM has supported x86 (32-bit) emulation for some time now (for just a bit longer than the Surface Pro X has existed), and x64 (x86 64-bit) emulation is in the beta-testing pipeline now. It&#x27;s a different system than Apple&#x27;s Rosetta, but capable enough that a lot of legacy Windows applications can run (unmodified) on ARM today. (ETA: You can even find demos of people running Steam and an interesting variety of classic Windows games on ARM hardware.)<p>The big thing Windows on ARM has needed was the right processor hardware to really make it sing, and if anything this is an indication that Microsoft has been correct to invest in ARM for the last few years, that Windows already benefits from the improvements from Apple Silicon even before being tuned to specific characteristics of the hardware, and possibly a huge blow to Microsoft&#x27;s ARM partner Qualcomm who should be very worried about catching up to Apple&#x27;s Silicon efforts.<p>At this point I wouldn&#x27;t even be surprised if the next Surface something &quot;X&quot; on ARM switches to Apple Silicon chips if Qualcomm can&#x27;t keep up. Though it may not be obvious if such a switch occurs because Microsoft has been working to brand their own ARM chips since early in the Qualcomm partnership, albeit nothing to same extent that Apple has been working on it.')
