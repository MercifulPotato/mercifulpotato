You spend an hour or two configuring your build tooling and then don&#x27;t really have to mess with it much after that. But I also never bother setting up TypeScript for JS one-offs or scripts (where I <i>would</i> bother to add Python type annotations in those cases), so make of that what you will.<p>Deno is currently trying to bridge that gap - putting TS directly in your interpreter - but right now it comes with some caveats around being a separate runtime with incompatible system APIs, unfortunately. We&#x27;ll see if it takes off enough that that becomes less of an issue.<p>Aside:<p>&gt; it&#x27;s a problem made difficult by an accumulated legacy of unfortunate decisions and there just isn&#x27;t enough investment to move it forward<p>This is funny to me because JS has an even bigger accumulated legacy of unfortunate decisions, it&#x27;s just gotten an obscene amount of investment to move it forward despite all odds ;)')
