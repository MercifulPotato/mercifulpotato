Completely unrelated to the comment you replied though as that was not the point they made, but since you’re in a sharing mode, I’m interested to hear:<p>1 – Who paid for your education in your native country?<p>2 – With how much student debt did you arrive in the US?<p>3 – How did you get your starting capital including flights, rent money, etc?<p>4 – What are your rationale explaining any of the social issues in the pre-COVID America? (homelessness, foodbank, opioid, incarceration, etc...crises)<p>Really interested to hear your take.')
