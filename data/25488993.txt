It could be classified. The evidence may need to be locked away for 40 years. Satisfying your demand is not enough reason to expose the means by which evidence has been gathered. At they said in WWII, loose lips sink ships.<p>Imagine yourself in WWII, demanding evidence of something that had been determined by cracking the Purple or Enigma cipher. No, you don&#x27;t get to see that evidence. Sorry. You aren&#x27;t trusted to keep that from the enemy.<p>Also note: neither Rubio nor Pompeo presented any evidence! Why would you demand evidence from Trump, but not from them?<p>Rubio has his motives. He has never liked the president. Pompeo is harder to pin down, but may be likewise. Either one could be pushing the increasing anti-Russian sentiment for political gain or worse.<p>In any case, attribution is difficult. Countries purposely misdirect. This does however have a very Chinese feel.')
