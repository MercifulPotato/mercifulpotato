Sierra helped push the budgets of adventure games to the point where no one could compete with them (except maybe LucasArts, and LucasArts didn&#x27;t seem interested in competing to the same costs) and then after setting that unreasonable market perspective of what a AAA adventure game &quot;should&quot; be, they died. Even today most of the controversy with the &quot;nostalgic kickstarters&quot; is that a Kickstarter can&#x27;t approximate (adjusting for inflation) even a tenth of Sierra&#x27;s final few adventure game budgets (much less a quarter to a half of LucasArts&#x27; last few).')
