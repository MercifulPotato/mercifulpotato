These aren&#x27;t great abbreviations, we just get used to them.  My main issue with this project is that if you want to use k8s and are using it, you want some measure of control.  Unless you are just using it &quot;because&quot;, your business goals intersect with the k8s philosophy and you need some element of it. In every case I have deployed it in there is a lot of fine tuning.')
