I know lot of software in C++ can be written better even in an AOT&#x27;d GC language with equal or better performance, because of so many C++ performance pitfalls that appear at scale.<p>But we can&#x27;t throw away all the code already written. There is lot of talent pool for C++. And the supposedly better languages have non existent talent pool. (Go doesn&#x27;t count, such a boilerplate language hampers any readability at scale).')
