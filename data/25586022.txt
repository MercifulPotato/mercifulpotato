Graduating even with a STEM PhD from a mediocre state school means less than graduating from an Ivy league with a bachelors in literature. In order to get into a prestigious school you have to play an incredibly bullshit game- apparently one significantly influential university this year wanted to know how students would eat a raw potato.<p>To me, the relationship between education and class is a bit more insidious and doesn&#x27;t necessarily flow the way that benefits society.')
