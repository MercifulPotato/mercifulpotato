We had a weekly movie night where we would both watch a film with some other friends - shitty action films or crap 90s films where everyone could just talk a bit of shit and have a laugh. But I would also have a weekly zoom with some old friends where weâ€™d sink a few beers and catch up, which sort of more or less replicated the effect of actually getting out of the house and spending time with other people by myself, which (as backwards as it might sound) I find to be a pretty important part of being in a couple. Absence makes the heart etc etc.')
