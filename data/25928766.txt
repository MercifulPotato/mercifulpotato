The US stock market and economy outperformed much of the rest of the developed and remerging world post-Covid in spite of a lot of deaths. It is not the absolute debt that matters so much, but rather the interest paid on debt relative to GDP, which is very low and has been falling for a long time. Rising interest rates does not mans that the debt will be harder to service, because the economy will also be growing more too. There is also huge demand for treasuries by pensions and sovereign funds, which should keep rates very low for a long time to come.')
