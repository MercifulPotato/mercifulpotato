I still have one sitting on my bench, running TomatoUSB. I got it 9 years ago, and for the past 5 years it&#x27;s been a 2.4ghz wifi bridge, connecting the hardwired devices in my office to the wifi router in my house. It just keeps working, so I keep using it.<p>Of course I can&#x27;t forget the first time I got a WRT54G. My brother in law had one just sitting around unused (around 2006 I think) and while I didn&#x27;t know a lot about them, I asked him about the router. I ended up trading him a well used laptop for it. The router was the locked down version. Then it died. Oh well.')
