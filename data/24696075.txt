Hey, JSON and Javascript libraries are the answer to that, eh<p>There are already enough potential issues with CSV interpretation on wrapping strings, escaping characters and so on, but changing the content when a delimiter is found should not be added to that list.<p>You bold point is the most important, the default behaviour of Excel when opening a plain text CSV file is to alter the content for display, applying magic and often-unwanted formatting rules. That should be optional.<p>It should be possible to open a text CSV file in Excel, view the contents in columns but the same textual form, save the file in CSV format and open it in another viewer&#x2F;editor and still see the same content as the original file.')
