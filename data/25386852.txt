At 326g they are undeniably and uncomfortably heavy. It&#x27;s not about the headband or earcups, it&#x27;s the mass it gives your head when turning, leaning, moving. I don&#x27;t use them because of the weight. At 384g, the Airpod max is about 15% heavier. I currently have a pulled neck as a result of too many hours sitting at my desk. I cannot fathom wearing such a heavy headphone for long stretches. It would be injurious. That Apple would release such a heavy headphone for mass consumption is truly bonkers to me, much crazier than the price.')
