These totals include rejections because of signatures, but also include, for example, ballots received late or past deadlines, problems with return materials or a voter having already voted in person.<p>&gt; It may be that Trump was referring to the 0.15% of ballots specifically rejected for &quot;missing or non-matching signatures&quot; when saying that ballots rejected in 2020 were &quot;almost zero&quot;, but this percentage is consistent with past years. The higher percentage he mentions for past years is likely based off the total rejected ballots (here) which can not be compared with 2020, as this information is not available.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;uk-factcheck-georgia-rejected-ballots-fo&#x2F;fact-check-georgia-rejected-ballots-did-not-go-from-4-to-almost-zero-in-2020-idUSKBN2832CM" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;uk-factcheck-georgia-rejecte...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sos.ga.gov&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;elections&#x2F;number_of_absentee_ballots_rejected_for_signature_issues_in_the_2020_election_increased_350_from_2018" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sos.ga.gov&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;elections&#x2F;number_of_absentee_ba...</a>')
