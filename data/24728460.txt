The Quest 2 is important because it&#x27;s being mass-produced at very affordable retail price. It will be the first and most impactfull VR experience for huge amount of people. I only have experience with Quest 1, but it&#x27;s already apparent that Q2 is improvement in every way while being noticeably cheaper. Q1 was out of stock for most of it&#x27;s product lifetime. BTW I&#x27;m enjoying Q1 quite a lot. It is an open Android platform with no DRM and good support for independent developers.<p>The VR is merely a playground for AR. A really tiny market that&#x27;s brewing technology for the post-smartphone revolution. The AR hardware might be some years from now but there are already huge investments in software platform and social features. There are only two relevant competitors: FB with cheap and excellent consumer headset you can buy today, and Apple working on next big thing in shroud of mystery. FB vision is obvious. They want to collect more of your data and also control what you constantly see in AR. Part of this is forcing you to use the FB account that was verified to belong to you, forcing you to give up on your privacy right from start. This translates to enormous amount of marketing money, but also to shaping opinions and controlling emotions. Next generation will likely have eye tracking which will make privacy invasion so much worse, as our eye movement is mostly subconscious and reveals our interests and affinities.<p>Many of us are sceptical of our smartphones working against us, tracking location and actions. Imagine a device mere centimetres from your brain doing the same, but having also access to eye movements and maybe EEG readings. If FB manages to convince general population that lack of privacy is in best of their interest, we&#x27;ll have some dire times ahead of us.')
