I have, 150 pages to say &quot;Sally is upset because her toy sailboat got left outside in the rain, and she wants dick to go get it&quot;. When I&#x27;m looking at a 3am level bug I don&#x27;t want to wade through that mess, and odds are that the more complex rendering I gave. The complex rendering might have even &quot;used the word storm above&quot; and averted the entire 3am crisis.<p>Dick and Jane has a place for my 5 year old.
