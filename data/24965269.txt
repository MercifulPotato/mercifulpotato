I appreciate that it is a bit unfair to ask for one here, but I fundamentally disagree with your point and would like to learn more about why you believe it to be true. While I concede that at the extreme high end, there are limited ways to invest without distorting the market yourself, itâ€™s just not the case that returns are higher with less money. If anything, returns are lower, because Fred in this example must pick more conservative investments with his single unit of investable utility - he has only the one to lose! By contrast, Bob is free to make riskier bets with higher payoffs, as his asset portfolio starts with ten units of utility.')
