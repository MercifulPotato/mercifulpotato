I personally use HugSQL[1], so no ORM, but I also don&#x27;t use stored procedures. I guess my main point is that the boundary between application and database matters and not putting logic in the database doesn&#x27;t make that boundary go away (putting logic in the database also doesn&#x27;t make it go away). But I take your point, its not to the same degree.<p>&gt; there&#x27;s nothing unique about ORMs that make them susceptible to bad code, or poor SQL understanding.<p>I think that there is: it makes database code look like client-side application code, so there&#x27;s some temptation to just blur the boundaries and mix them together. This is how you end up with code that queries for data, then does looping and filtering outside of the query, then queries some more. Sure, you can write equally bad code in stored procedures, but the boundaries are more obvious. At the very least, its likely a different programming language from the rest of your application.<p>&gt; Removing the ORM is not the solution to your engineer not know how RDBMSes work.<p>Sure, however, in practice, at least in my experience across multiple teams and companies, education hasn&#x27;t been a reliable solution. People still abuse the ORM and treat it as if the database is magic. Removing the ORM doesn&#x27;t automatically fix it, of course, but it does force people to consider the database as a separate service whose access crosses a boundary. In an ideal world, everyone already keeps this in mind and ORMs can be used as they were intended, but, at least in my experience, this just hasn&#x27;t been reality. Have I just been unlucky?<p>If <i>different</i> people and teams keep making the same mistakes with the tools, maybe its time to re-evaluate the tools and what they encourage people to do. Its not that the tools are <i>bad</i> in and of themselves, but that they encourage bad usage.
