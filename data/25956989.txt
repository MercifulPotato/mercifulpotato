Unfortunately it had been in the city for 2+ months prior and then ravaged the elderly &amp; medical&amp;front line workers who were out there dealing with it while we got to WFH.<p>Close, especially indoor contact, without masks, in cooler dry weather appears to be the recipe for disaster here.. ‘\nWe are seeing it play out in Wave 2 (or 3?) here as people have all gotten very sloppy, even if they are WFH.<p>From March-October in my social&#x2F;family circle I knew 0 people with COVID.
