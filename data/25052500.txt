Item(by='jll29', descendants=None, kids=[25055796, 25053060], score=None, time=1605045228, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25052254, text='My company gave me the current 16&quot; late last year, and it&#x27;s been a piece of junk: suddenly starts to roar without a reason (while plugged in to power supply) so people on a phone conference complain I should switch off the hoover.<p>Often freezes with not much open other than a few Chrome tabs, O365 and Sublime (not actually DOING much with any of them at the time).<p>The keyboard is poor, the touchbar is useless but doesn&#x27;t get in the way that much, the touch pad is too large and disturbs me sometimes while typing source code. The lack of ports means without a hub the whole machine is pretty useless (and that means all users will have to buy an USB-C hub for another $100 - annoying but the real annoyance is to have that hanging of your laptop all the time, and you mustn&#x27;t forget to pack it, or you&#x27;re screwed).<p>I also dislike the 16&quot; form factor compared to 13&quot;, as it breaks all my leather bags when I try to carry it (not so relevant anymore in the days of the home office..).')
