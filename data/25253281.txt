I&#x27;m going to talk about three of them.<p>The first is fugitive [1]. It came to life because I just learned about git hooks and thought of using them for generating a blog with all of its meta data in Git itself. I wanted to have only Git as a dependency so I wrote the whole thing in pure sh (not even using some convenient Bash features). It was for fun and for just myself initially but it had maybe like two dozen users in the end, some of them even contributed to the project or maintained their own forks.<p>The second one is not released. It&#x27;s what I use for my own web page [2]. It&#x27;s a make file + a few Bash scripts that make use of xml2 parse an HTML template and content files, then uses the GNU coreutils (mostly sed) to insert the content in the template and adjust a few things, and finally use 2xml to build the final HTML document. It also has two additional scripts: one that can take an XML file and build either an RSS feed or an HTML output to be inserted into a page, and one that can build an HTML representation of my list of publications.<p>The third and most recent one is called cigala [3]. It was written for people around me with no web development experience but who needed a simple web page (typically people in academia outside CS). It&#x27;s a single PHP file that uses SQLite to store the CMS content and is able to build static HTML files whe you want to publish your website. It was originally run from my own server where I created accounts manually each time someone asked me to. But it now is available for larger use and is easy to install as well.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.up8.edu&#x2F;pablo&#x2F;fugitive" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.up8.edu&#x2F;pablo&#x2F;fugitive</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pablo.rauzy.name&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pablo.rauzy.name&#x2F;</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.up8.edu&#x2F;pablo&#x2F;cigala" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;code.up8.edu&#x2F;pablo&#x2F;cigala</a>')
