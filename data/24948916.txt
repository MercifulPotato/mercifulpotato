Netlify CMS lets you view the Markdown, but the non-tech editor would have to understand there&#x27;s a build delay to the page going live and the final page might need reviewing.<p>Nothing&#x27;s perfect though, I just find most static site stories don&#x27;t address the above so any thoughts are appreciated!')
