The semantic web does not.<p>CURIEs and the depending standards alone are well over 100 pages.\nLanguage tags alone has 90.<p>RDF has like 100, Sparql has a combined of more than 300, and OWL has more than 500, even though it assumes that the reader is generally familiar with Description logics, so it&#x27;s probably a couple thousand if you take the required academic literature into account.<p>Nobody is going to read all of that, let alone build that.<p>Especially not a bunch of academics who don&#x27;t care about the implementation as long as it&#x27;s good enough to get the next paper out the door.<p>So everybody pools on these few projects, because they&#x27;re the only thing that&#x27;s kinda working.\nOWLAPI, Protege, ... uh that&#x27;s it.<p>Because everything else, is broken and unfinished.<p>Here&#x27;s a thought experiment, name one production ready RDF libray for every major programming language (C, Java, Python, Js), that doesn&#x27;t have major, stale, unresolved issues in their issue tracker.\nIt&#x27;s all broken, and there is simply too much work required to fix things.<p>It&#x27;s only natural that people start\nto infight when there is only few hospitable oasis.<p>What we need is a simpler ecosystem, where people can stake their claim on their niche, where they have the ability and power to experiment and explore.')
