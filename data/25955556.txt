That Chamath guy gave a long impassioned speech but then just bought options and immediately sold for a big windfall, which isn&#x27;t exactly squeezing anyone in a principled stand, it is essentially just pumping and dumping (he donated to charity to avoid allegations of that, so it was really probably just PR for his populist political campaign that offers 0% taxes).<p>And the big hero to the little man stick it to the big man movement is.. the richest man in the United States?  Who gave WSB lots of drama and laughter with the $420 stock fraud thing and is anti regulation and SEC enforcement to their newfound desire for enforcement on powerful players?  Who ripped off NASA to buy bonds in SolarCity and then bailed that out with Tesla or would probably have gone bankrupt?<p>The WSB people are basically doing this for fun and most of the principle stuff is only on moves that have directly affected their position.<p>Even before some of the bad moves from brokerages today they had principled screeds to draw people in, but the only people who seem to be mad in principle are the crazy qanon people that have now joined in that are basically spreading blood libel against bankers and stuff and latching onto this and probably praying for violence to result or some kind of revolution like fell out of the Albanian MLM stuff.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pyramid_schemes_in_Albania" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pyramid_schemes_in_Albania</a>')
