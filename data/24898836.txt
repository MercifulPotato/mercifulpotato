A thing to feel proud about.<p>An engineer is often tasked with moving a metric they don&#x27;t personally believe to be meaningful, or worth while.<p>If I&#x27;m told that &quot;We&#x27;re prioritizing new user activation and engagement&quot; and my team&#x27;s quarterly review will be based on how I move that metric, it&#x27;s soul sucking to realize that the optimal way to engage new users happens to also be objectively worse for our existing users.<p>There is no unequivocal &quot;Good&quot; for me to do.  I&#x27;m not really doing &quot;Good&quot; at all, I&#x27;m just making bank for an employer that:<p>A - Won&#x27;t return the favor in any meaningful sense.<p>B - Is of questionable business acumen (Is trading old customers for new customers a viable strategy?  Maybe.  Maybe not. I don&#x27;t get to see the discussion and understand the trade-offs that were discussed).<p>C - Clearly values metrics that correlate to profit over any real pride in their product.<p>----<p>Once you dispense with the idea that you&#x27;re actually helping people with your profession, the only real motivator left is money.  Money certainly matters (anyone who says otherwise is lying) but every dollar has a diminishing return on motivation.<p>If I can pay mortgage&#x2F;utilities&#x2F;food and still have enough cash for a night out or a nice drink every now and then, I no longer want more money - I want more fulfilling work.<p>That might mean making smiles.<p>That might mean having more control.<p>That might mean working on a task that judges excellence more objectively than &quot;Making lots of profit&quot;.')
