Users will not subit a github issue&#x2F;bugzilla.<p>Also, if you think that product is terrible you must not have tried their competition (Remedy) which I can only  describe as a product that feels like  a hundred teams all that exclusively use IE came up with a 100 checklist feature items and then randomly distributed it to a hundred other dev teams that also only use IE and skipped UAT.<p>Much like GNU&#x2F;Linux, my theory is that FF devs themselves rarely use enterprisy products with webui and a lot of bad js that magically works great under chrome.<p>I spent an hour today on support for a certain app because it turns out their app was using my default browser (FF) for certain features which just would not work. Worked great in chrome.<p>Not trashing FF, but we need to talk about these issues if they are to ever be addressed.')
