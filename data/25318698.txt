It can be interesting academically, to trace the evolution of philosophy, but it won&#x27;t really scratch that itch of engaging in the big questions.<p>The biggest value I got out of being a philosophy major was building reading concentration skills - being able to read dense passages takes a lot of commitment and practice, and that can build thinking skills. The internet teaches us to skim and do fast&#x2F;shallow reading, which doesn&#x27;t lead to deep thinking. Reading older philosophy is a great way of building those deep reading skills, even if the actual content of those texts is not applicable to modern life.<p>To the OP, if you see this, I would suggest looking into Experimental Philosophy. It&#x27;s a branch of philosophy that focuses on using neuroscience to understand how we think about the world. Books like Thinking Fast and Slow may be much more interesting to you.')
