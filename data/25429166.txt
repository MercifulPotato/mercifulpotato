It&#x27;s a distortion of the market.<p>We wouldn&#x27;t lose much if advertising would just be forbidden. A traditional definition of it would probably be enough to get rid of most of it. The main problem is that huge sums of money are involved, and almost all media profit from it to some extent, so there&#x27;s a huge incentive to shut down this conversation.')
