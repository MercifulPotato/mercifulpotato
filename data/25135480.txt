That was the context of Japan attacking the US at Perl Harbour[1].<p>The US had already effectively declared war on the US at that point from the point of view of Japan. They&#x27;d demanded an unconditional withdrawal from China.<p>There&#x27;s some alternate history where Russia never sold Alaska and Japan military bases there. What do you think if the US had done in 1941 if Japan demanded it withdraw from the &quot;occupied&quot; territory West of the Mississippi and return it to native control, while amassing a fleet in Russian&#x2F;Japanese Alaska?<p>Furthermore, maybe Japan just wanted the US withdrawn from New Mexico &amp; Nevada[2] (post 1937 occupied territories), but left the demand delibirately ambiguous so as to suggest everything west of the Mississippi (Manchuria)[2] (search for &quot;was later deleted&quot;).<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting those are morally equivalent, but merely that Japan at the time pretty much saw it that way. Manchuria was around half of the empire&#x27;s territory.<p>So suggesting that Perl Harbor wasn&#x27;t reasonable is a pretty big stretch. Unless one of your options is to effectively become a vassal state of the US (unconditionally abandon &gt;50% of your territory) war was inevitable.<p>At that point they could either take the initiative at Perl Harbor, or wait until the US attacked them at its leisure.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor#Diplomatic_background" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor#Diploma...</a><p>2. <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sdh-fact.com&#x2F;CL02_1&#x2F;56_S4.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sdh-fact.com&#x2F;CL02_1&#x2F;56_S4.pdf</a>')
