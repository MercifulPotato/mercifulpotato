I&#x27;m not sure the value of cultivating positive view of the small manifestation, but then scolding it when it becomes big. Imho, yes it&#x27;s understandable, but not a perspective we should value as part of our growth -- we should just work to will it out of our minds, and maybe someday succeed?<p>Yours seems like a perspective that&#x27;s valorizing the control of the impulse, putting fault in &quot;lack of control&quot;, but still aspiring to salvage a wisdom compass from the feeling...? Many would say the core feeling doesn&#x27;t truly serve us in any way that something more positive couldn&#x27;t equally stand in for.<p>Regardless, I appreciate your sharing your perspective. I&#x27;m willing to consider we&#x27;re both right, and mumble mumble &quot;different strokes for different folks&quot;, and the world works out only when we can both push for it as we please :)')
