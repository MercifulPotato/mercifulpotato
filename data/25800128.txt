Further, when going after monster corporations it can be both physically dangerous to your well-being and career threatening, so the financial reward should be there to take on a trillion dollar company with tens of billions in annual profit and extreme political clout.<p>Any lawyer willing to try to cut into these extraordinarily evil companies, I say give them the money. The lawyers are being compensated like SEC whistleblowers in a modern war against vast human rights violations, they&#x27;re mercenaries in a conflict and should probably be compensated as such when they achieve big results.')
