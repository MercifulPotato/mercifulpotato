My last statement should have been split into two separate proposals:\n1.) Better legal&#x2F;financial support for cooperative business models (the laws on the books are prohibitive for capital intensive projects).\n2.) Revising the NLRA to allow competition among multiple unions for representation. Right to work laws are too far on this issue but unions should not simply exist as a monopoly, they should have to have some incentive to earn their members.')
