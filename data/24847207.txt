No disagreement there.<p>But, given an increasing income disparity between the top ~5% and bottom half, and a continuing sense of &quot;being left behind&quot; by many workers in labor-intensive industries, it seems doing a better job of describing those disenchanted workers (whether they be part-time at AutoZone, or recently given up looking, etc) would be beneficial to all.<p>For one of those disenchanted employees, seeing &quot;Unemployment is at all-time lows! The DOW is at a record high!&quot; on the evening news (while they&#x27;re working 3 part-time jobs for $9&#x2F;hour and zero benefits) isn&#x27;t just unhelpful, it&#x27;s insulting.')
