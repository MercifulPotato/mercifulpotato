Edgerunners aren&#x27;t treated as nearly the deniable assets they should be (hell, the game treats <i>cops</i> as generally legitimate entities) and life is only cheap if you don&#x27;t have a custom face mesh.<p>I didn&#x27;t really hit <i>any</i> major bugs, so I don&#x27;t have any negative vibes for it there. Some of the set pieces are really nice, though, and I do just like driving around the city. And some of the character work on the major characters is quite good. But conceptually? From the big-ideas perspective--and cyberpunk, and punk movements generally, is a big-ideas genre--it feels like &quot;dimly remembered ideas of the future of the 80&#x27;s, mostly misunderstood and viewed through a modern and very non-radical lens&quot;.')
