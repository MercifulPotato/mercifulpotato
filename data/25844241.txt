It&#x27;s <i>baseline</i>.<p>The &quot;catches&quot; to everything being free:\n- Cannot save any money whatsoever. As with all government budgets, what you don&#x27;t spend is deducted from the next check.\n- Can receive a maximum of around $50&#x2F;month from anywhere else. Anything above that is deducted from the next check.\n- Cannot own much property. They want you to sell everything and live off that first.\n- Have to report all your assets and provide bank statements to all accounts.\n- Have to be prepared to fight the bureaucracy. They make mistakes, and usually against your interest (we won&#x27;t pay because X). Complaining has always solved all issues for me, but it takes two weeks minimum to get an answer. If you didn&#x27;t file everything correctly two weeks <i>before you needed it</i>, you might go half a month with no money until it resolves. Unless you show up at the office crying. Then they&#x27;ll help you on the spot. Information doesn&#x27;t flow between departments; <i>You</i> have to provide everything any department asks regardless if they have your info elsewhere in the system. Often they require you apply for a different benefit first, even if everybody knows you don&#x27;t qualify; They <i>require</i> the rejection to proceed. Add another two weeks.<p>And the real bummer:\n- If you work, everything stops. So you can&#x27;t work part-time. You <i>have to earn at least as much</i> as the welfare for working to make any economic sense. It&#x27;s annoying. I&#x27;d like to work occasionally, but there&#x27;s no point. The choice is between doing nothing and getting X, or spending all your time and energy working 8 hours a day, five days a week and getting X+1. Some people go crazy without jobs; I&#x27;m creative and self-driven so I make all kinds of stuff by myself. It&#x27;s pretty neat.<p>And there&#x27;s always cash. What they can&#x27;t track they can&#x27;t take away... Gifts best given in cash. Unused budget best withdrawn from an ATM and stashed in the matress. God UBI would do so much good here. People stuck in this &quot;welfare trap&quot; could actually work a little to improve their standing.')
