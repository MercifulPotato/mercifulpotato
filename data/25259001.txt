The idea of &#x27;human DNA&#x27; vs &#x27;non-human DNA&#x27; seems suspect to me, as in some trivial sense, anything that is in the genome of a human being is by definition human DNA, and on the other hand, you can find large swaths of human DNA that are identical to most mammals, and probably a few that are common to virtually all eukaryotes. I also know that viruses can leave long-lasting changes to your DNA, that may even be heritable I think.<p>Still, related to the importance of bacteria, while I don&#x27;t doubt that, as we learn more, we will discover that they have a bigger role than even dreamed 50 years ago, you still can&#x27;t compare it to the basic roles of human organs. We have actually created microorganism-free mice and other organisms, and while they are not very healthy, they are fully functional (with bad digestion and big immune problems): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Germ-free_animal" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Germ-free_animal</a>')
