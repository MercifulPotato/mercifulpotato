In the recent years I always dumped the photos from my mobile phone onto some external hd every few months.<p>But I notice that things get complicated because they are not really accessible anymore.<p>Further more, if you have a family, how do you join the photos taken from different smart phones of your family members?<p>Do you burry them in WhatsApp?<p>Do you choose a cloud solution, dropbox or google photos?<p>Do you care about privacy and self host something, or do you not care at all and just print them into photo albums on paper?')
