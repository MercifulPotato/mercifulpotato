The web is a kind of meta-OS with a very minimal and simple API, and as far as the web is concerned everything in userland operates as a thin-client. The OS is only of interest locally.<p>By the mid-90s I was <i>furious</i> with both Microsoft and Apple for setting computing back by at least a decade.<p>You could - with extreme effort - make an Atari ST multitask. And of course with the Amiga it was built in.<p>So why did we throw that away and go backwards to DOS and then single-process Windows - which eventually reinvented multitasking nearly a decade later and sold it as if it was the most astounding development in the history of computing?<p>Of course there were technical challenges - protected memory, protected processes, and so on. But the earliest versions of Windows didn&#x27;t have those either.<p>So it was a disappointing and frustrating time - an alienating difference of philosophy between consumer computing designed for creativity and exploration, and box-shifting commodity computing designed for form-filling and bureaucracy, which <i>might</i> allow you to have some fun after hours if you behaved yourself and the machine didn&#x27;t crash.<p>Considering how smart the Amiga team were, it would have been very interesting to see what they could have done with ubiquitous fast networking, high-res graphics and video, and pocketability.<p>I suspect the result would have been far more open and inspiring than the corporate sand trap we have today.')
