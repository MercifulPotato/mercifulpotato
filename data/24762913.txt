(among other things) MBTI is not consistent, The thing Adam Grant did [1] I tried myself: Take the SAME test twice(or more) with about 3 weeks in-between. Hilariously enough, on one test I got that I were &quot;entrepreneurial&quot; and &quot;social&quot; while the second time I got &quot;introverted&quot; and &quot;analytic&#x2F;cautious&quot;. Not by itself contradictory but inconsistent nevertheless.<p>&gt;but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily follow that MBTI cannot be used to make useful predictions.<p>The problem is that it does follow that! Especially when it is used in HR practice! I have seen HR people construct &quot;project groups&quot; based on the members MBTI score!<p>When you take in to account these &quot;personality tests&quot; you have to consider the false classification too; If you base your judgement on <i>false</i> classification the test have now done damage to whatever process you used it for.<p>Would you be willing to follow &amp; trust a medical diagnosis test that have NO scientific backing, not consistency, have a lot of false diagnostics, and based on that test, conduct life-endangering surgery?<p>It&#x27;s fun for personal recreation, but MBTI is used in more than that, and have lasting effects to the individual and organizations when practiced. And that&#x27;s why the fad has to die.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologytoday.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;give-and-take&#x2F;201309&#x2F;goodbye-mbti-the-fad-won-t-die" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologytoday.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;blog&#x2F;give-and-take&#x2F;201309...</a>')
