After Trump sprayed WD-40 on in it and loosened up those voters, Democrats cried foul in unison solely because they lost.<p>If Clinton had been elected in 2016, she&#x27;d have gotten at least two SCOTUS picks and they&#x27;d all be loving the electoral college. But she didn&#x27;t so here we are. Elections have consequences.')
