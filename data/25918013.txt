The former would be semweb as intended, or at least a subset thereof, but the latter could easily end up somewhere between simple brand abuse and almost comical cargo culting.<p>Well, at least that&#x27;s how I feel as someone who never had to face the realities of the vast unmapped territories between plain old database applications and fascinating yet entirely impractical academic mind games of DL (old school symbolic AI ivory tower that suddenly happened to find itself in the center of the hottest w3c spec right before w3c specs kind of stopped being a thing, with WHATWG usurping html and Crockford almost accidentally killing XML)<p>(also, when has &quot;assumption&quot; turned into &quot;interpretation&quot;?
