But neither do I think things are in balance or in some kind of imaginary mirror image of each other. I wrote my comment imaging a progressive audience. If I wanted to speak to a conservative audience I&#x27;d have to make entirely different points (such as reserving skepticism for ideas coming from the other political camp, instead of being skepitcal of all ideas) and my comment is already too long.<p>Most insitutions of public influence lean left by a large amount, and that lean is getting more and more extreme according to the researchers I&#x27;ve paid atttention to. Conservatives prefer roles in business and industry which are quite a bit less about influence. Conservative news media is an exception here, but the situation is not symmetrical: right-wing media has been utterly rejected by progressives right from the start and so nobody on the left feels betrayed by the news media like the right does. But is right wing media complicit in leading their own further astray? Absolutely.<p>Science is hopefully mostly populated by people much less tribal and much more skeptical than the average person. But few people get their science from scientists directly. The mostly leftwing media stands in between scientists and the populous. Science coming through a media that conservatives don&#x27;t trust gets automatically binned along with everything else coming through that media. But rather than ignore it, they go hard opposite... I think it&#x27;s actually to the point where reverse psychology would work very well.')
