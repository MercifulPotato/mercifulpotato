Item(by='bhl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605305031, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25080426, text='ProseMirror is more of a framework for building text editor libraries; Slate and Draft are drop-in, easier-to-integrate text editors.<p>In addition, ProseMirror is built with JavaScript, and would require writing custom code to adapt to Vue or React. \nSlate and Draft are both built with React, which has it pros and cons. For example, using React means on each key press it’s going to run it’s whole virtual dom diff algorithm resulting in a higher input latency [1]. ProseMirror is more performant in this case by not using React and managing its own editor state. But Slate and Draft, by using React, gets easy server side rendering.<p>If I were to build a clone of Typora or Bear, I’d use Slate because 1. those editors are close to what Discord has as its chat editor and Discord uses Slate 2. Slate has better markdown support out of the box.<p>However if I were to build a Notion clone more focused on WYSIWYG, then I’d go with ProseMirror.<p>I wouldn’t go with Draft in any scenario since the community seems smaller and the library is less maintained, although twitter uses it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;juretriglav.si&#x2F;what-happens-when-you-type-a-single-letter&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;juretriglav.si&#x2F;what-happens-when-you-type-a-single-l...</a>')
