It can replay it eventually (even that shortly, depending on timeframe of your access token which is usually minutes) but you can protect against it.<p>&gt; This would require UA token to contain audience claim of every single internal service, this is unlikely to pass security review.<p>I have penetration tests on my main service. Sub-services are not accessible and can be secured to desired level on the internal network. I never had security inspections on internal services (I work on highly critical gov systems). Maybe in some domains its like you say but I believe its generally not a problem. Furthermore, we need to have some perspective on this - there are multiple easier ways to hack a service and there probably exists big number of other exploits that are easier to achieve.')
