Some of my conclusions so far:<p>* When I am sleep-deprived I am less productive. So I spend more time doing &quot;work&quot;. Then I have less time for everything else I want to do (family, cooking, sport). So I take more time away from sleep. And the cycle repeats. Sleep deprivation is self-perpetuating.<p>* What I do at night, when I am exhausted, in 2 hours can be done in the morning in half an hour.<p>* I get angrier and negative much more easily when I am sleep deprived.<p>For my particular case: limit the time dedicated to &quot;work&quot; and do the other things in the time it is usually dedicated to it. Stay away from screens past 11. Listen to ebooks for falling asleep. Use the good sleep energy to finish work stuff earlier, do more exercise, etc. Break out of the vicious cycle and start a virtuous one.<p>I still fail at doing it from time to time. I think this must feel similar to what relapsing alcoholics feel. I try to not be too hard on myself and keep trying.')
