Item(by='MrsPeaches', descendants=None, kids=[25165870], score=None, time=1605906097, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25164660, text='I am a MechEng by background and taught myself how to design PCBs.<p>Disclaimer I am not a pro but have put a couple of boards into production and have worked closely with pros.<p>&gt; Do professionals do a lot of breadboarding?<p>Depends on the complexity but yes there is often a fair bit of breadboarding, usually differnt parts of the circuit in isolation.<p>So first step is (if you haven&#x27;t already) to get familiar with the basics of electronics and the best place to start with that is The Art of Electronics[1]<p>I would then recommmend checking out DigiKey&#x27;s guide to KiCAD [2] which gives you everything you need to get started with a good software package that is user by pros. It has it&#x27;s quirks but at least you don&#x27;t have to pay for it (or get involved with Autodesk in anyway).<p>Choose a simple project to get started. Breadboard it with a development board (e.g. ESP32 DevKit[3]) and then make a schematic of that using you CAD. You can then turn that into a PCB (again using the DigiKey guide) or you cna just try to recreate the dev board. Arduinos are pretty easy to recreate using through hole components.<p>Also don&#x27;t be afraid to just straight copy things and tweak them to your needs.<p>From there you can find a vendor to get your PCBs on PCB shopper [4]. You can easily get 5 boards delivered to you in under a week for $40 including shipping.<p>Also if you can afford it the going rate of a top EE in the UK is around £500 a day (you can probably find some decent ones for £250). Get in touch with them and ask if they could review your designs. You&#x27;ll get loads of valuable feedback and it won&#x27;t cost too much for a couple of hours of their time.<p>Anyway hope some of this is helpful and good luck!<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;artofelectronics.net&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;artofelectronics.net&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vaCVh2SAZY4" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=vaCVh2SAZY4</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.espressif.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;esp-idf&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;esp32&#x2F;hw-reference&#x2F;esp32&#x2F;get-started-devkitc.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.espressif.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;esp-idf&#x2F;en&#x2F;latest&#x2F;esp32&#x2F;...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pcbshopper.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pcbshopper.com&#x2F;</a>')
