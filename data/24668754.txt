The rationale is that Arise cannot dictate independent contractor hours directly, so by overbooking they can ensure sufficient labor for their clients at all hours. However, independent contractors are asked to pay for training material and complete unpaid training to be eligible for each client project. As a result, independent contractors may be getting systematically underpaid by holding the reasonable expectation of recouping their initial investment')
