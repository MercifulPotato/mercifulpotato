Not sure there&#x27;s really a citation for it but I doubt anyone would dispute.<p>I wrote about the impact on optimising Ruby.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrisseaton.com&#x2F;truffleruby&#x2F;pushing-pixels&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrisseaton.com&#x2F;truffleruby&#x2F;pushing-pixels&#x2F;</a>')
