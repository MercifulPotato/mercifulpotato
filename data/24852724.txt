The AdBlocking works well enough, and I don&#x27;t really log into anything from Safari.  I also use it for Twitch streaming since it&#x27;s so much more stable.  For those use cases, it is superior to both Chrome and Firefox.<p>I use Chrome for Google apps.  Gmail, GCal, etc.<p>I use Firefox for work and isolation.  So I use containers to keep all my AWS logins&#x2F;consoles separate, I use it for Github, I use it for my own internal apps and dev (and all the dev tools).  If for some reason I need to do Facebook or Insta I do it in FF, and it&#x27;s isolated into its own container.<p>Firefox is also my default browser, so if I click a link in another app, it&#x27;ll open in a container in Firefox.')
