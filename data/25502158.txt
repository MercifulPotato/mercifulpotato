When typing on the phone, you&#x27;re looking at the phone. You&#x27;re usually (hopefully) not driving.<p>Driving, on the other hand, is demanding on the senses; on at least three of them.

It feels safer. (But then, I also prefer crank windows instead of automatic, so maybe I&#x27;m just a nut.)<p>It&#x27;s like my Macbook touchbar. It stinks.
