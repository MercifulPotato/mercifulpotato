In 1995, they wanted a faster network, to play video games, and upgrade from their Token Ring network.<p>The Univ did not want to pay so they went to see partners, and one said &quot;put the satellite feed on your network to justify the need for a better network. We&#x27;ll pay for it, instead of having 2000 dishes and decoders.&quot;. This PoC &quot;Network 2000&quot; was a success. Some students restarted the project in 1998 and called it VideoLAN.<p>In 2001, VideoLAN and all the software projects (Server, Client, network, libraries) became GPL. VideoLan Client became VLC. Community added Windows, macOS support.<p>In 2008, I created the VideoLAN non-profit to escape the university and make VLC grow.')
