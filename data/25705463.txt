It&#x27;s a constraint of the type that can spark innovation and creativity. It encourages people to be brief, or else go to extra trouble to not be brief. It encourages individual messages to be quickly consumable. When interacting with Twitter, the character limit isn&#x27;t just about the length of <i>your</i> messages, it&#x27;s about the length of <i>other people&#x27;s</i> messages.<p>This is part of why the emergent property that &quot;languages that express more in fewer characters tend to use characters that count as more than 1&#x2F;240&quot; was not removed, and was instead seen as desirable. The real limit is a rough &quot;how long does it take to process one tweet&quot;.<p>&quot;get rid of character limits&quot;, in the context of Twitter, would not be product innovation, nor an especially good marketing move. It would substantially change the nature and character of Twitter. At the very least, it isn&#x27;t obvious that it&#x27;d be a net positive. It would also remove a major point of differentiation.<p>This announced improvement is the net result of &quot;how do we solve this problem while still having a character limit&quot;. It&#x27;s a natural evolution, rather than a massive change to the landscape.')
