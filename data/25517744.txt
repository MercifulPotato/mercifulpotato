Item(by='coldtea', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608732519, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25516985, text='&gt;<i>considering that I expressly noted the existence of fast food steak houses like your example in my parent comment</i><p>My point was to highlight that these are high-end places that go for the $100&#x2F;head, not the common steakhouse experience, and hardly required to get a steak, as the parent makes it seem:<p>&quot;If you&#x27;re going out, a decent steak would cost you over $100&quot;<p>Well, no, a fancy high-end steakhouse will cost you that. You can have a decent steak for much less.<p>&gt;<i>Those steakhouses you are referencing are McDonalds equivalent</i><p>No except in the eyes of $200K&#x2F;year FAANG engineer types or Paris Hilton-caricatures saying you can only get a &quot;decent froyo&quot; at some $50&#x2F;cup high end place.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t consider Outback, or Longhorn for that matter, as &quot;fast food&quot;. They&#x27;re just chain restaurants that also serve steaks.<p>They&#x27;re not McDonalds or whatever, however, nor the &quot;McDonalds of steaks&quot;, to be considered &quot;fast food&quot;. And there are tons of non-chain places serving steaks with similar prices.<p>I&#x27;ve eaten at lots of Michelin-star restaurants in Europe and around the globe, and had $300&#x2F;head bills at times, but I don&#x27;t consider restaurants with $30&#x2F;$40 steaks or places like Outlook beneath me or &quot;fast food&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s just the rampant US-version of classism (if one think it&#x27;s bad in the UK, have them wait till they talk to some upper-middle class US people).')
