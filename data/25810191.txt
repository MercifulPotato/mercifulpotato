Is it that the team size for a modern AAA title is <i>required</i> to be so large, or is it just that they <i>are</i> so large? The diminishing returning from making teams ever bigger makes me wonder if having such large teams are just a sign of low-level, dragging general incompetence somewhere in the chain of people running the whole thing.<p>I don&#x27;t have any hard evidence either way, but every so often when I see a small, well-run team of competent people turn out something really good, I wonder.')
