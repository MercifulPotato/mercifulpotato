It&#x27;s great that people are picking up the good idea once again.<p>Most of the time the Promise&#x2F;Future or async&#x2F;await add mental overhead to code just for the sake of performance (because the monadic operations are only for sequential operations, it only make sense for applicative&#x2F;parallel operations to use async&#x2F;await if we don&#x27;t care about performance). And with the Actor model, you don&#x27;t need to use Promise or async 9 out of 10 times as you would in most languages without sacrifice performance.')
