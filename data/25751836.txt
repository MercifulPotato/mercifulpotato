As a developer I would <i>love</i> having generics in Go. I can think of a few places in my code I can greatly simplify if they were implemented now.<p>However, as someone who reads <i>other people&#x27;s</i> Go code, I&#x27;m not a huge fan. One of the greatest things about Go is that a developer can usually one-shot read and understand almost anybody&#x27;s code because there&#x27;s a simplicity &quot;forcing-function&quot; applied to everything. To lose that would be a shame.')
