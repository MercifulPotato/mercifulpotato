And he&#x27;s working really hard.<p>He is <i>tweeting</i>. That means his goal is to portray a certain image. Given your impression, that is part of his intended image and he almost certainly does not work as hard as his social media makes out.<p>(And, if he is that well-known, he might employ people to take care of his social media)')
