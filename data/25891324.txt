Instead I have a “web” docker network where my nginx reverse proxy runs, and a “services” docker network where I run the stuff I proxy.<p>Databases and other containers needed for the backend services run on another network as well, so if you make it inside nginx you will (of course) be able to access my already exposed backend services, but no direct access to databases and other services.<p>Before shutting down Nextcloud I used to have a resilio container running, and I would mount the data from that inside Nextcloud, so no direct contact between the two.<p>But then again, I just need access to files through a browser, and don’t need any of the advanced features of Nextcloud, so I’m still trying to find a better match. Looking at seafile if I ever find the time.')
