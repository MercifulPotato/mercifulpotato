Item(by='nordsieck', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607733862, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25388063, text='&gt; I think we&#x27;d be in awe of the average health&#x2F;fitness of a 30 year old hunter gatherer from 100,000 years ago, compared with the average corresponding human in modern times.<p>They&#x27;re different, not really better.<p>Hunter gatherers definitely got more involuntary exercise. But modern people can choose to get better (more specialized&#x2F;effective) and safer exercise than ancient people ever could have.<p>Hunter gatherers had to eat what was around them, and would involuntarily periodically fast. It&#x27;s much easier and cheaper for modern people to have a varied diet. Many modern people also periodically fast. But you have to choose to do so.<p>Ancient people typically struggled with parasites and various diseases. That is largely not a factor in modern life. Modern people sometimes are affected by serious pollution issues - modern air quality from burning fossil fuels may be such a crisis. Airborne lead from leaded gasoline was almost certainly one. It&#x27;s difficult to compare the effects of such problems.<p>There&#x27;s also a pretty strong selection effect going on here: lots of people 100,000 years ago used to die. People would die in childhood, people would die in adulthood. This mean that women had to have lots of babies, which means women died in childbirth a lot.<p>So, I think it&#x27;s true that, left to their own devices, modern people tend to be somewhat unhealthy. Mostly due to laziness. But modern people also pretty clearly have the opportunity to be much more healthy than ancient people.')
