I&#x27;ve suffered a total frozen house disaster in a past place - most of the plumbing wrecked - because of a heat failure during the Christmas break (gas valve in that case though; a mechanical thermostat wouldn&#x27;t have helped).  That&#x27;s what started the obsession with remote temperature monitoring - I was into DS18B20s before they were cool - and from there it was only a little bit more hacking to just take control as well (so I can control it over the internet the way I like it - ssh!)')
