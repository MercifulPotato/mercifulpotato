There&#x27;s no sense beating around the bush. Chances are someone on the team might have the same question and didn&#x27;t ask it. That&#x27;s what my peers have told me at least.<p>If you ask alot of &quot;dumb&quot; questions (e.g. junior level questions while in a senior-position role), you might not be the best for that company. Someone made a mistake down the line in hiring you, likewise you oversold yourself. If a company does not support you learning and getting up to speed with what you should know, it might also not be a great fit for you either. That&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing either.<p>Assuming you did your research on the company, and were a good fit for the company, there is no &quot;dumb&quot; questions. It&#x27;s the company&#x27;s responsibility to hire the right person for the right seat.<p>Many times you have to ask a question because implementing solutions can be complex. There&#x27;s multiple solution paths, each with its own pros&#x2F;cons. You also may not have all the contextual information you need to make a well informed decision. You need to know who to ask for what information, so fire away with questions.<p>Sometimes you get stuck on a problem, but if you know someone already has solved something similar on your team, just ask how they did it. Likewise if someone asks you in return. Knowledge gating doesn&#x27;t benefit anyone, especially in this industry')
