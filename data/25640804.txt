You will argue that Google is just a product, that you choose to use, but the users of the author&#x27;s site do not <i>choose</i> to use Google, it&#x27;s the only alternative (Google pay big money to platforms&#x2F;browsers to make sure any search goes via them). Google has the power to kill any business, so it would be fair if they where required to tell you exactly why a site was unSERPed.')
