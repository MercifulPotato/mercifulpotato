I do think that File::metadata and Path::metadata make a nice API together (better than lstat, stat, and fstat).<p>As for C not allowing two functions with the same name, sure, but then it doesn&#x27;t have namespaces. In a nicely designed C library for file handling, these functions might well be called std_path_metadata and std_file_metadata, which boils down to the same thing.')
