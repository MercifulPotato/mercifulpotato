Since we have modern society, or capitalist markets the world population has doubled over and over again, while overall consumption has actually increased and absolute poverty decreased.<p>Non of it is unsustainable we have not run out of anything, ironically outside of few renewable resources those can actually run out. Things that used to be worthless rocks are now valuable things. Other things that are now rocks will be valuable in the future. The difference between a resource and dirt is technology, more humans in our system leads to more technology.<p>In fact, the total amount of resources we have and no about now is probably 1000x more then 100 years ago.<p>Rising of sea level happens slowly, not in one big wave and can be mitigated in many ways as well. The same goes for climate in general.<p>Technology has been replacing workers from their job with the same speed for 100s of years, the tractor replaced far more jobs then anything we are inventing now.<p>But I guess this inherent pessimism counter to all evidence we have about similar predictions over the last 250 years, is somewhat systemic.<p>I just hope to convince people to not take it as far as the &#x27;population growth is bad&#x27; people in the 60s when they said the US shouldn&#x27;t help India so fewer of them can starve now, rather then more later as mass starvation in India was of course inevitable in their minds. Just one of their many brilliant plans for population control.')
