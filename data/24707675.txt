So if you select last 2 weeks, you see the graphs, but it doesn&#x27;t show the total visitors in those last 2 weeks (unless you go to the main domains list). If I implemented the interval comparison and the display of visitor totals, it could also show +24% (compared to last interval) for stats like visitors, conversions, etc.<p>I am planning to implement both of those features really soon (this month), but I am currently working on releasing a simpler analytics platform for WordPress, based on userTrack (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wplytic.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wplytic.com</a>), as the current pricing might be a bit too high for some WordPress users and they might also not need all the advances features of userTrack (heatmaps, session recordings, multi-user, multi-domains, A&#x2F;B tests, etc).')
