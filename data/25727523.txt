The title you chose has a significantly different meaning than the title and content of the WSJ article, though. The WSJ article says that these banks are pausing all political funding to PACs, which is much different than pausing only funding of specific Republicans. Not funding any PACs means that the banks don’t want to be involved in party politics at all right now. On the other hand, not funding specific candidates or a specific party would be a statement about those entities.<p>The WSJ’s word choice also conveys that these banks are halting their own donations, not refusing to process all donations.<p>I hope that explains why the WSJ’s “all PAC donations” is much different than this submission’s “funding the Republicans who objected.”')
