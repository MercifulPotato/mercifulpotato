Professors know cheating is rampant, so have to change the questions every semester.<p>Some courses at Caltech had almost identical exams for at least a decade when I went through. The professors <i>knew</i> cheating like the above simply would not be tolerated by undergrads.<p>I sat on and helped run the Board of Control, which handled academic honor code violations, for several years and professors who had been at other universities would absolutely rave about how much more they could trust Caltech students. And that was while reporting a suspected cheating case to me.')
