It&#x27;s just a few years ago it was my father-in-law (also cancer).   And a three other family member within the last ten years.  Definitely was the case for the most recent three that it was discovered much much too late.  I cannot advise strongly enough to have even the minor thing check and checked again.<p>In the case of my MIL, the biopsy first came back as a fungus which we _now_ know was an impossibility.<p>Like so many other commenters, I had my scheduled colonoscopy and it was a walk in the part except drinking that horribly disgusting prep liquid.  That was gross, but I&#x27;ve probably had worse in my young and very stupid years.')
