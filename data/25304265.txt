The society doesn&#x27;t have role models for them, of people who do cycle regularly in a variety of weathers.<p>In heavy bike using cultures, people have gear ready to go. Spending a minute to put it on is not really a barrier, an inconvenience. If there is a practice. If your environment supports it, by having plowed routes for bikes, bike parking.<p>I think we overrate the convenience &amp; comfort factor. Don&#x27;t knock it till you be tried it. You might like it! There is some real difficulty when your society self selects to only support &amp; assist one mode of transit, doesn&#x27;t have bike parking readily available, doesn&#x27;t have safe paths for biking. And trying to embrace biking on your own, learn how to do it comfortably &amp; safely, when few others do, that&#x27;s hard. But I think the inherent comfort g convenience of cars is somewhat&#x2F;greatly overrated. The mindset is that biking is inconvenient, but so many who successfully live it will tell you, it&#x27;s easy &amp; it feels great.')
