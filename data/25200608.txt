France is the junior partner in the Franco-German hegemony that is the EU, even if they are a bit of a Fredo of the pair. You have to be a &quot;second tier&quot; subordinate member before the &quot;EU&quot; will say anything, and not really because any freedoms are being restricted necessarily, but because it messes with the tight grip of the German hegemonic power structure. If you were a neoimperialist, would you want your de facto colonies getting &quot;uppity&quot;? Heck no. In dictatorships, you use the baton. In democratic republics, you use the media to shape opinion and &quot;soft&quot; political coercion. You don&#x27;t want people to know you&#x27;re an imperialist, after all.')
