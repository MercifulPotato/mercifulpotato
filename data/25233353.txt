To this day, it has been really doing well (Our trading volume of yesterday was 1.6B usd).<p>When it started doing well, around June, we started thinking about going somewhere else: we wanted a change of lifestyle and lower taxes. After arguing for a long time, we ended up choosing Budapest, and we moved there about two weeks ago. We signed a lease here, and we are in the process of moving the funds from an existing french company to a Hungarian company, yet to be created. This process involves two teams of lawyers (we spent around 20k in lawyers fees so far). The lawyers are currently reviewing what is the best way to transfert. To our surprise, this is really complicated.\nWe are now a team of 5, my partner and I moved from France to Budapest, and a 3rd guy plans to join us &quot;on-site&quot; next Feb. The plan is that 3 of us work from our apartment in Budapest, 2 remotely.<p>My issue is that I don&#x27;t like it here and I don&#x27;t feel good. I though there would be meetups &amp; a tech&#x2F;ML scene here, and there isn&#x27;t, at least not a big one. Starting from day 2 of arriving in Budapest, I had a constant headache of varying intensity (I never had that in my entire life before). I sleep ok but not great, and I feel depressed. I think I miss exercice, but gyms &amp; pools are closed, and don&#x27;t want to run everyday because the pollution is high in this period.<p>The issue is that starting a process to go somewhere else is quite complicated. It would involve cancelling the lease and changing the lawyers plans &amp; work so far. It&#x27;s mostly my partner who did the work of coordinating with the lawyers, and he likes life here.\nNot committing here would also delay the process of moving the company out of France, and I estimate this cost to be around 100-300k per month of additional taxes.<p>Should we move again?')
