Weâ€™re revising much of our core threading and thread pooling architecture to handle the distinction better, improve efficiency, and eventually be able to schedule less performance-critical tasks on the efficiency cores.<p>I found this bit interesting.  Likely more prevalent in mobile apps, but perhaps shifting desktop code to Big.Little approach and using core affinity will result in a lot less wasted energy.')
