What if now all of sudden you want to post json as a filter? You will have to start thinking of new arbitrary ways to handle this query etc. You have to both parse this new deep nested filter you thought of in backend and also you have to stringify it in the frontend. You add so much extra overhead to try to convert the query into some form of string URI that would adhere to URL rules.<p>Let&#x27;s say you now want to add a filter for frontend where you can choose multiple dynamic fields and their conditions can be either greater than, equal, or IN some values, I think you get the gist.<p>You then will have to do it something like that tasks?status=in:todo,progress<p>Or status=todo&amp;status=done\nBut then you suddenly need greaterThan query. Are you going to do tasks?priority=gt:5 for example?<p>Or things like that. And you have to worry if this even adheres to URL standards. Things eventually get so messy. And you are very constrained in everything you do.<p>And how do you typecheck all of that? Also all of this is just error prune, you have to write documentation for it and every REST api is a little bit different, people often mess up when naming the urls etc.')
