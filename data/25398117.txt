Item(by='nottorp', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607779803, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25397537, text='&gt;There are free to play Multiplayer games, where microtransactions are for skins and other cosmetic stuff. Thats fine by me.<p>Actually no, it&#x27;s not fine. Because if the cosmetic stuff would have been obtainable just through game play, it would have been easier to obtain. If it&#x27;s available for real money, they have an incentive to make it more grindy to obtain otherwise. Consciously or not.<p>And if you think the availability of those cosmetic items doesn&#x27;t affect you - consciously or not - you&#x27;re deluding yourself.<p>No matter how they&#x27;re implemented, microtransactions are a burden on either your wallet or your time.')
