If it&#x27;s non-acute, you can go to a private clinic which is highly subsidized but does costs some money. But nothing like in the US.<p>&gt; And is the wait similar for major things like cancer, brain tutor, or heart surgery<p>If you have serious acute illness, you will not be stuck in a queue. Such a situation would probably be grounds to a lawsuit.')
