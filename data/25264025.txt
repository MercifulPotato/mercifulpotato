The first application of fusion reactors will presumably not be naval ships.<p>Anyway, assuming your 4000 ton figure is correct, that works out to 125 kW&#x2F;ton. For comparison, a quick googling suggests a wind power plant is around 3 kW&#x2F;ton, excluding the rather massive foundation of the tower.')
