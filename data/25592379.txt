While tcc does do most of c99, I do not think Nim requires anything past c89.  libc-wise, it doesn&#x27;t use even all of standard C.  Minimal stdio&#x2F;string stuff.  You can easily access any C libs, though.  So, a given program may have more dependency, but that is up to you (or to your Nim package deps).<p>Full disclosure, not everything works - different backends tend to have slightly different bugs&#x2F;coverage, but this also applies to c++ and js backends.  But I use tcc as my default backend (in my nim.cfg file) every day and only run into problems like a time or two per year.')
