A couple of publicly visible engineers that do have experience are on record as saying that cell-phone-class competitive x86 was absolutely possible.  Intel and AMD chose not to pursue those markets.<p>The expensive parts of a high-end CPU aren&#x27;t normally in the instruction decode part.  They are in the branch prediction, branch mispredict recovery, forwarding networks, memory re-ordering, and so on.  Anything short of a dataflow ISA has little impact on those structures.')
