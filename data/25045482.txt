Last I checked they&#x27;re in the process of getting their country back.<p>The &quot;but they have tanks and nukes&quot; argument has been long debunked.  To actually run an oppressive nation you need boots on the ground which requires very strong support from a very sizeable minority (e.g South Africa, Northern Ireland).  The less firepower the peasants have the smaller the minority you need is.  You can&#x27;t fight a insurgency with tanks and bombs without destroying the things you seek to protect.  If you&#x27;re England crapping all over Ireland or if you&#x27;re the US crapping all over Iraq you can kind of make it work as long as you have political will and keep the death tolls low because your supply lines and political support are isolated from the violence (notice how quickly the Troubles wrapped up once the bombs started going off in England).  It&#x27;s much harder to fight an insurgency when people are sabotaging your supply chains.  See the 4chan copypasta someone else posted for other details.')
