Windows defaults to 64kb to start. On your local LAN (which TCP was built for), no big deal, but going across a distance. Then add in one lost packet or one out of order packet and TCP has to ask for it again and delay the whole thing. Its why HTTP&#x2F;2 has higher latency on spotty 4g networks. The TLS handshake suffers from the same distance issue ACK packets have which with TLS 1.3 there is 0-rtt which removes the handshake as part of the first TCP packet.<p>QUIC puts everything in UDP, so theoretically its a never ending firehose of data for a download with the occasional &quot;hey, I missing packet 3, 12, 18, please resend&quot;. Mimicking TCP but putting the app in control versus the kernel.')
