Despite that I still think this (namely deplatforming Parler in this moment) is a better outcome for us.<p>Amazon had to choose between appointing itself a censor or being complicit in fomenting violence via offering their services. Both choices suck, but that&#x27;s sometimes the way cards lie.<p>&gt; once people who are plotting bad things all move to end-to-end encrypted platforms like Signal it will be that much more difficult to figure out who the bad people are.<p>I think society&#x27;s main problem here is the normalization of conspiratorial thinking and the radicalization that ensues. People have always been able to plot in secret and I&#x27;m not worried about law enforcement hypothetically being unable to monitor all wrong-thinkers thoughts in real time.<p>In some respects I think this recent spate of censorious actions (Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter) could be the ideal outcome in that they&#x27;ve always had the implicit power to censor and the public has pretty much shrugged. If society is now forced to reckon with how much of public life it has ceded to Mr. Zuckerberg&#x27;s whims all the better. If decentralization comes to the web, and tech monopolies and oligopolies are cracked open to competition I will shed no tears.')
