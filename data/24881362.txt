Hell, it&#x27;s the <i>one</i> thing I can side with the current administration on.<p>To me China is not much different than pre-WWII Germany: over-the-top authoritarian, has ambitions to influence the direction of things at the world stage, and is currently scapegoating an ethnic minority and putting them in concentration camps.<p>That wasn&#x27;t the first time I tried bringing those things up in a group setting. In other occasions I was only met with awkward silence too. Feels like there&#x27;s some subtle but insane denial going on.')
