The PhD gave me a lot of free education (and not having to worry much about getting W&#x27;s on classes, so less fear of failure), free travel to conferences, and learning things the hard way.  Learning to program helped me get a job after graduation.  I wasn&#x27;t planning to get back into academia but two years ago I got a teaching job somewhat out of the blue, which wouldn&#x27;t have been possible without the degree (it&#x27;s not a research university like my alma mater--I don&#x27;t think I would have wanted to get back into that world). The jobs in industry after the PhD helped me pay off my undergrad student loans.  I don&#x27;t know if you can think of it as being a rewarding experience in it&#x27;s own right but it is something of intangible value and opportunity.  My Grandma always said that no one can take your education away from you.')
