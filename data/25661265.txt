After 8 months of back and forth and dozens of multi-hour-long phone calls insurance finally covered it all.<p>I don&#x27;t really care whose fault it is, I shouldn&#x27;t have to play phone tag with two powerful entities over the course of 8 months as they try to figure out if they&#x27;re going to fuck me over or not.
