He got two complete Next Gen sets and was considering selling one of them for a few thousand pounds (UK) to fund a trip to Gen Con. I advised him to go for it, but he felt if he kept them they would become even more valuable. A year or two later the trading card games bubble burst, taking down several companies with it. We lost touch, but I sometimes wonder if those sets are worth anything these days.')
