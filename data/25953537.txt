Usually it take ~~3 full turns lock to lock, with 1&#x2F;2 a turn you are making a bumper car. In addition, he is correct about the yoke not being upgradeable to a ~~3 turn lock to lock ratio, as there will be lack of hands-on tactile continuity.\nSome one has some sort of aircraft mindset where the degree of rotary control is linked to fore and back as well as left to right, with rotation as well as foot motion in air, versus sticky ground friction.After over 100 years, the yoke never gained ground.\nNeeds to be abandoned completely.')
