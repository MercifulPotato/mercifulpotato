To the degree that many, myself included, were willing to overlook a rather uneven Season One.<p>I assume that&#x27;s been less the case for the newer Star Trek universe series. I don&#x27;t actually know the numbers but the TV landscape is too different to really compare anyway.<p>Added: As someone who remembers watching TNG when it first came out, my recollection is that the reaction to &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; (S1E1) was along the lines of a bit disappointing but certainly has promise. And it&#x27;s new Star Trek on TV!')
