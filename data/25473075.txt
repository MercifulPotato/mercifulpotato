If you don&#x27;t like dem apples, you can get a great education at the library and online for free, but education isn&#x27;t the only (and possibly not even the primary) benefit of the university - it&#x27;s the resources and connections that surround it.<p>The other big thing universities have going for them is status signaling - I went to Stanford, and because of that, my resume will get looked at&#x2F;people will listen when I open my mouth&#x2F;etc. Whether or not that&#x27;s good is a separate question, but it&#x27;s true. If you get an education of equivalent value at a place nobody&#x27;s ever heard of, you don&#x27;t get those benefits. As the number of resumes&#x2F;people speaking&#x2F;etc. goes up, the ability to quickly filter becomes more important, and thus my Stanford degree has more value.')
