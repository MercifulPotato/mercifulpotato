The 13th says &quot;except as punishment for a crime.&quot; Folks may want to mince words about it because prisoners are <i>technically</i> paid (pennies per hour), if they are even getting paid in the first place. It was major news that prisoners were sent to fight fires in California for little to no pay. Plus, prisoners are on the hook financially for a lot of their sentence, so that money is basically spent before they even get it.')
