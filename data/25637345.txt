Item(by='SavannahJS', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609791872, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25636416, text='First off - cool project, nice work!<p>Just riffing off some ideas for the &#x27;coworkers and collaborators&#x27; section as well since I agree that I wouldn&#x27;t find it useful as a sometimes-recruiter in its current state.<p>I think the section could do with some more structure or information given. E.g. instead of just loose association with other folks who work at the same company, break associations into &#x27;reports to&#x27;, &#x27;close teammates&#x27;, &#x27;manages&#x27; (or make that information visible on hover or something). There&#x27;s probably a pretty cool hierarchical way to show this information but maybe people would find that too invasive. As someone who conducts interviews pretty often, understanding a person&#x27;s team structure would definitely be useful, and would still serve the &#x27;social proof&#x27; function you&#x27;ve described.<p>The collaborator&#x27;s title while they were involved with that specific project might also make it easier to parse what the working relationship was between the CV owner and the collaborator as well.')
