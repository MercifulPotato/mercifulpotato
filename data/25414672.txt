Same for IPFS. Softwares like limewire or kazaa thrived because they were simple enough to use. Same goes for protocols.<p>In my view, decentralization requires:<p>* a client that runs on user&#x27;s hardware<p>* a p2p database and filesystem, with this kind of append-only log and verification, that runs on the client<p>* server can still accelerate access access time<p>Generally with this kind of system, the goal is that each user can publish data&#x2F;content either in a public&#x2F;private manner, without being dependent on servers.<p>The only problem is being able to attract users and compete with popular platforms. If such a protocol+software can attract users who want a &quot;privacy-aware&quot; alternative to platforms like facebook, I could see it work.<p>Sometimes I wonder why there isn&#x27;t more money invested to build such platforms, because the p2p internet seems to be the only viable solution to fight privacy issues.')
