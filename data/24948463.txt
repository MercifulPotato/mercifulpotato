Thrust implies acceleration, not just velocity.<p>Yes.  The simpler answer is that even if you shoot a laser straight up the light can&#x27;t get out, and the corollary is that you can&#x27;t get out yourself even with arbitrarily high thrust.<p>No matter how much thrust you have to fight against gravity, light will always beat you, because light cannot be slowed down by gravity.  If light is trapped then you are trapped.<p>&gt; You&#x27;re traveling outward at a velocity of .95c.<p>Let&#x27;s make it simpler, and calculate what it takes for the outside observer sees you moving away from the black hole <i>at all</i>, even 1mph.<p>The closer you get to the black hole, the higher your local speed has to be.  If you&#x27;re 10 meters outside the event horizon, you have to get up to 99.999etc. percent of light speed (locally measured) just to slowly inch away from it (as measured by the outside observer), or even just to stay still.  Once you fall inside the event horizon, you would have to go <i>faster</i> then light locally for the outside observer to measure you as moving upward.')
