I remember dealing with some of the C++ interop layers in Common Lisp back about 10 years ago. All around an awful experience, and not really because of either CL or the interop layers themselves. It&#x27;s just a boatload of complexity and the bigger the C++ library you want to target, the more likely it becomes that you have to deal with essentially all of the language.<p>Compare that to C, where the story is often as good as &quot;import the header and you&#x27;re done&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a good path to a long-term solution, but I&#x27;ve been pushing to get nice C APIs in all the libraries I&#x27;m invested in, specifically because of this issue.')
