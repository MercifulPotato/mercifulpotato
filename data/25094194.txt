A certain bearded German economist warned that in such an economy, the state is just another apparatus of the bourgeoisie.<p>Turning the old clich√© on its head, pure capitalism only works in theory, never in practice. In the real world, disparities in money are disparities in power, which ensure things such as bailouts and more fundamentally, banking laws that are effectively a license (for some) to print free money for themselves.')
