Item(by='tylerhou', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612153532, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25985242, text='&gt; To take a ludicrous example my utility function for eating a sandwich is has a sharp discontinuity as a function of how much Polonium is in the sandwich.<p>Well, in the real world, every sandwich likely has a <i>little</i> bit of polonium in it; maybe an atom or two. If that increased to three or four, you would be slightly unhappier, but not sharply so. Every little increase in polonium slightly decreases your utility until you reach a point where you do not derive any utility from your polonium-laced sandwich, and so you would not eat it. Therefore, I argue that your utility function is still continuous wrt. polonium in your sandwich.<p>(In economics this isn&#x27;t <i>really</i> how you&#x27;d model utility because the assumption is that you always have the option to throw away the sandwich; therefore, having the polonium sandwich gives you more utility than not having it.)<p>Same with money. Imagine you had a &quot;life changing amount of money,&quot; whatever number that means to you. Call that number $X. Now imagine that you instead had $X - $1. And then $X - $2. Even $X - $1000. How much less happy do you feel in those imagined scenarios? A lot less happy? I bet you feel marginally less happy and not sharply. Which implies a &quot;smooth&quot; utility function.<p>I believe that non-continuous utility functions <i>can</i> exist -- suppose someone says that they will kill you unless you give them $50,000 -- but for most people that&#x27;s not a real scenario.<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think this is an experiment that a real economist (TM) has ever performed on an individual to discover what the true utility function is (happy to be wrong though).<p>I don&#x27;t think ever with polonium, but here&#x27;s a short video about revealed preference theory. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kPXov3D1tfA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=kPXov3D1tfA</a>. In practice, applications of revealed preference theory happen all the time.<p>But your example did make me think more about &quot;continuity&quot; and &quot;sharpness&quot; and I now think that continuity is not strong enough to support my original claim. Continuous does not mean &quot;smooth&quot; [1]. To define &quot;smooth,&quot; I would instead say that most people have utility functions that have positive first derivatives and negative second derivatives; that is, their marginal increase in utility for a good is positive but diminishing.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Weierstrass_function" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Weierstrass_function</a>')
