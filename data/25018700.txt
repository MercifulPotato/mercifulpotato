Sure, the president gets more say that anybody else, but I&#x27;m skeptical you can ascribe too much blame (or glory) to the outcomes here; at best you can look at the details, and see if in a given situation (ideally in retrospect) a president made the right choices.<p>I don&#x27;t think Trump was tested in this area, and I don&#x27;t think most wars were trivially the fault of the presidencies they were started in (sure, some exceptions like the most recent iraq may jump to mind). I mean, &quot;just don&#x27;t participate&quot; is also equivalent to ceding influence to whoever feels like a bit of shelling would do them good, so that&#x27;s not always a good choice - under the assumption that the US (and world) was well served by some measure of imposed order.<p>Course, maybe I&#x27;m misinterpreting who had agency in those situations - do you think it&#x27;s largely presidents&#x27; at fault for for the post-WWII military engagements?')
