If you&#x27;re setting up your own, it&#x27;s easy to enable though.<p>Also a problem is iOS clients. Developing on iOS requires lock-in into the Apple ecosystem and most XMPP folks are free-software people so nobody will bother to buy Apple hardware&#x2F;software specifically to develop for their closed ecosystem (i.e. unpaid labor for a multi-billion corporation), although i&#x27;m sure a lot of folks would be happy to do just that if that was sponsored work (donations, grants).<p>On Android, Conversations (or its forks Quicksy&#x2F;Snikket) is the best. ChatSecure on iOS has been buggy for years (every time i tried with someone with an iPhone), but nowadays Siskin appears to be a good iOS client, though i haven&#x27;t had the hardware&#x2F;system to try it myself.')
