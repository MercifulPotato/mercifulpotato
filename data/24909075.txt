Not especially because of bad-habit but because it&#x27;s hard to manage on day-to-day and you will face a lot of issues.<p>One of the issues I got recently is the time required to switch between branches (if LFS-tracked files are changing). It is due to the &quot;checkout&quot; and how git-lfs works (see the Github issue). Actually it copies the file... This operation takes time... Instead it could use hard-link or symbolic-link.')
