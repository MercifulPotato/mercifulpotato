For example, if you go to the wikipedia article on Kessler syndrome, you will see an image where centimeters long debris are symbolised by kilometers wide dots.<p>&gt; This might effectively lock use of Earth orbit away for centuries.<p>It would make exiting earth orbit and placing an object there significantly more complicated because you would need to take into account debris, probably detect them from the object and manoeuvre a lot more but it wouldn&#x27;t entirely lock up use of Earth orbit.
