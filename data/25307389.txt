I don&#x27;t see how this would change by birth order as all the kids are likely wrestling before they walk.<p>For kids with parents new to the sport, I see a couple possible reasons.  First and foremost I would say that having an bigger&#x2F;stronger sibling to spar with benefits the younger child more than the other. I can also assure you that at least with wrestling, this happens throughout the day, anywhere in the house.  Even for other sports, I can see this happening.  Show up a bit early and pass the ball around, or warmup with techniques.  The younger child will be be exposed to someone with slightly better technique on a regular basis.<p>The other factor I see is that the parents just have a better idea of how it works.  Which tournaments&#x2F;camps&#x2F;clubs to sign up for outside the regular scholastic season.<p>Also, the younger sibling may just start earlier.  You&#x27;re already dragging them along  to all the tournaments and clubs anyway, may as well sign them up, too.  So they end up starting a couple years earlier.')
