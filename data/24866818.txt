I see it going in a direction where it is no longer PHP, but trying to be something else it will never be (Java? C#?), so I may continue using it as long as it is backward compatible and that&#x27;s it: good bye PHP, I am the same but you are not. I am not resistant to change, just the reasons I picked PHP versus something else are going away.')
