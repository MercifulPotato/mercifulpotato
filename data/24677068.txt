I love trying out stuff like this, especially in these days of trying to whiteboard remotely. As it is getting late, I may just make this a brief test right now.<p>A minor point to note is that the URL with the www does not work - you may want to fix this:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.browserboard.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.browserboard.com</a><p>Also I love this bit of humbleness:<p>&gt; <i>A pretty good online whiteboard</i><p>So on to the handwriting test. Yes! You are much closer to the Ziteboard experience. Pen input works very well on both the ThinkPad Yoga and the Note 8 and it renders my writing nicely.<p>You seem to be doing a similar kind of smoothing that Ziteboard does? When I write on Ziteboard I see a bit of angularity as I write, which gets smoothed out when I&#x27;m done. Yours seems to do this more in real time.<p>One thing I got confused on: trying it on the Note 8, I wanted to scroll the view to get some blank space to write on. I found the four headed arrow icon which did exactly what I wanted - I can now scroll the view with the pen or finger. But now I can&#x27;t figure out how to get out of this mode and write again?<p>More later as I experiment with it...')
