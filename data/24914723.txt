The only way either could incur brain damage would be through either heat or mechanical stress, both of which would be readily apparent.<p>If this is a genuine issue then the mechanism is almost assuredly completely different, and personally I don&#x27;t think it is some scary communist death ray that they would, for some reason, use on US and Canadian diplomats.<p>Unless the diplomats are all actually covert staff, in which case there would be a motive, but then some kind of chemical is much likelier.<p>This is IMO so implausible as to put the entire story into question. There is no way this is a microwave or sonic weapon. A microwave or sonic weapon could not cause occipital nerve damage so specific and without leaving any obvious traces of mechanical trauma and&#x2F;or heat damage. It would also very probably be <i>quite</i> notioeable.')
