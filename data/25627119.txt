The first experience, beyond the wait-list, was a little strange. You were required to meet with a Superhuman rep to guide you through the app. This was strange because I&#x27;ve bought more expensive software and was never &quot;guided&quot;, but perhaps I should have been, so I was open to the process.<p>The woman I met was very friendly and consumer focused. After the walk through I felt this might be a great product until I stopped and considered what I just had been taught: keyboard shortcuts. Almost the exact same one you can turn on in Gmail.<p>For the next two months I tried liking Superhuman - partially the hyper, partially I want better email. Superhuman is pretty, has a few nice macros, email open tracking, and of course shortcuts. At the end I dropped it because of the price. $30&#x2F;mo. for what it does just didn&#x27;t make sense. If it were $5, easy sell. $10, perhaps.<p>I know they are trying to make email better, and perhaps they did - a bit. I believe over time email will continue to be made incrementally better, but Superhuman&#x27;s underlying claim is they have tectonically shifted email, thus the price.<p>Unfortunately, they haven&#x27;t.')
