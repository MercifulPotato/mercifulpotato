You only have to remember that it is a model and thus has serious limitations. Take it out of context of the application is has been designed for and turns to nonsense immediately. So you must be careful to strictly limit model usage. But the same limitations also make it possible to attack any concept with solipsism &#x2F; deconstructionism - which is a mistake in the opposite direction imo. Guess this is enlightenment vs postmodernism.<p>Also see: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Map%E2%80%93territory_relation" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Map%E2%80%93territory_relation</a>')
