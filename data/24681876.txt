There would be precious few who would deny narcotics to those who really need them.  They are often the only effective line of pain relief for severe pain and they are on WHO&#x27;s list of essential drugs!<p>You seem to have not considered these points:<p>(a) The intrinsic nature of narcotics requires them to be managed with great care. This means the dose has to be accurately titrated sufficient to kill pain and no more or addiction results.  These facts have been known by the medical and pharmaceutical industries for over 100 years, also the FDA knew this but seems to have forgotten when it was lobbied.  (I&#x27;m oversimplifying the facts here but it&#x27;ll have to do.)<p>(b) Sacklers&#x2F;Purdue were fully aware that intrinsic nature of narcotics requires them to be managed with great care.  As this info is in almost every medical text on the planet that deals with the subject, similarly every pharmacopeia text on the subject.  (Check for yourself.)<p>(c) Sacklers&#x2F;Purdue <i>deliberately</i> ignored these well established medical facts about narcotic addiction so as to proffer from drug sales.  They willfully pushed OxyContin use to levels well in excess of that recommended by medical best practice.  Thus, it hugely increased the numbers of opiate addicts than there would otherwise have been.<p>(d)  As I&#x27;ve said above, many medicos were complicit with Purdue and deserve to lose their license to practice.<p>(e) As I also said above <i>&#x27;before OxyContin, there were any number of narcotic painkilling drugs from those that have to be injected to ones that can be swallowed as a tablet or capsule that are made by more reputable drug companies (and have been for decades). OxyContin didn&#x27;t offer anything over these earlier drugs.&#x27;</i>  Doctors, pharmacists and the FDA knew this too, yet they deliberately threw away their Hippocratic Oath and &#x27;mistreated&#x27; their patients for a few cheap shekels.')
