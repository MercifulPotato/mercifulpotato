It&#x27;s one of the rare open source projects that I cannot imagine being replaced by a proprietary solution. I&#x27;m definitely not using it in its full capacity, just for a fairly limited amount of integrations (Philips Hue, some smart plugs, various stuff I&#x27;ve installed alongside Home Assistant on my Intel NUC).<p>I <i>really</i> like its scripting feature. It allows me to, for example, dim the lights between 11 and midnight if tomorrow&#x27;s a weekday, giving me a visual cue that it&#x27;s time to go to bed. There&#x27;s also some smart plug that automatically boils me some water when I wake up in the morning, providing me with coffee about 2 min earlier in the morning. I also have an NFC tag next to my door. If I hover my phone over it when I leave the house, it shuts off my TV and any lights that are turned on.<p>That being said, it&#x27;s definitely still raw. I use a fairly basic amount of integrations, but I still have to fix something every few versions, and if I don&#x27;t touch the configuration for a couple of months, a fair amount of things will either break or look out-of-order in my interface.<p>Overall, I consider &quot;smart home&quot; to be a fairly expensive and time-consuming hobby that saves me maybe 10 min per day. There&#x27;s also a fairly limited amount of stuff you can do without making modifications to your home, making its use limited if you&#x27;re renting a home.')
