There&#x27;s OpenAI&#x27;s humanoid walker, that taught itself bi-pedal motion. But as far as I know there is no MeshNet or ShaderNet, analogous to Imagenet. The research data sets like ShapeNet consist of CAD models for object detection and scene understanding.<p>Chimera Painter demo itself is unbelievably fun. When AI Dungeon and GPT-3 launched the observation was made that we are all &quot;prompt engineers&quot; now. It&#x27;s the quality of the input that differentiates final results ;)')
