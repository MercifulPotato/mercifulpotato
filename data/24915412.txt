It&#x27;s a separate area of research from most other fields of mathematics, it&#x27;s not relevant to what most of them are researching, and they just don&#x27;t have any interest in it. And unlike category theory more broadly, they don&#x27;t particularly benefit by studying foundations deeply. It doesn&#x27;t provide any improvement to their own area of study.<p>Everything I&#x27;ve just said is completely uncontroversial among mathematicians, for what it&#x27;s worth. The comment I just wrote has probably been expressed on r&#x2F;math dozens of times at this point.')
