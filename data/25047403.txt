Thanks for the feedback. We wanted to provide the same security pattern that iPhone&#x27;s provide - 4 digit, 6 digit and alphanumeric. This gives the user the power to determine their own security depending on the type of information they are planning to store. Also, based on the overwhelming feedback here on security details, I think we will publish a white paper soon to make it more clear :)')
