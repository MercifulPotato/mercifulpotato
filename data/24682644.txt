They don&#x27;t cause other stores to be less restrictive, if that&#x27;s what the users want, because having an exclusive on a garbage app the users don&#x27;t want would fail to get anyone to use the store, and getting users to buy anything other than the non-garbage exclusive app from the other store is only done by getting the users to trust the store, by not having it be full of garbage apps.')
