(In the context of a browser, think flash plugins, JS canvas and the like) Those have to be pixel sized, which means practically you are forced to 1x, 2x, 3x... It is unfortunately a special case that is incredibly common, and it has to be handled. Solving this by snapping everything to the pixel grid is another form of rounding that has its own set of artifacts with elements jittering around when the window gets resized, and it breaks down again if you try to have surfaces within those subsurfaces. (e.g. You decide to display a cached buffer within your flash app or JS canvas) These problems are exacerbated further when you have mixed DPI, it actually makes it much worse, and you still have one screen that is going to be scaled down and blurry.<p>At some point maybe I&#x27;ll put together a post to illustrate this, I know it seems easy when you think about it but if you try to implement it you&#x27;ll see it causes a huge number of problems. They are not unsolvable but the amount of clients that are going to care enough to solve them all is very small. (Fundamentally this cannot really be solved in a browser either for the reasons I described above)<p>If you want to work on this, please do it, but don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t warn you that it&#x27;s a rabbit hole. I&#x27;ve actually done everything you&#x27;re suggesting before in other projects, and honestly we&#x27;ve really only scratched the surface of why trying to do this kind of scaling is problematic.')
