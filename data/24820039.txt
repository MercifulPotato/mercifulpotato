Don&#x27;t buy memory foam, it doesn&#x27;t breathe well, makes you sweat and if its a thick layer of memory foam will make it impossible to turn on at night (you will sink into a stupid, sealed hole). A little layer of memory foam is bearable, but what would be the point then? The only reason they add it is marketing. A good breathable mattress is far better.')
