His point, which I agree with, is that he is (somewhat, but noticeably) softer on the Republican side than on the Franco side than in <i>Homage</i>. After reading that book the only way to come away with being substantially more sympathetic to the Republican side than Franco&#x27;s is because Orwell, the protagonist, fights for the former. It&#x27;s clear that Orwell believes that had the Republicans won, there would inevitably have been another war between POUM, Communists, socialists, and anarchists. In particular, it seems to me that he substantially softens here the odds of a Soviet victory in said struggle versus what he writes in <i>Homage</i>.<p>Is it because by 1942 the USSR was ally to the West&#x27;s life-or-death struggle against fascism? I don&#x27;t know.')
