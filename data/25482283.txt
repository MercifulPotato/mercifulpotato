Interesting to read period ATM deployment costs (USD$100K) vs. bank branch rollout costs (USD$1M): I see modern parallels to our space (fully automated contactless food preparation and retail). Also interesting to see frank admission of extreme SPOFs: <i>There are over 300 banks in Texas on CIRRUS, but they&#x27;re all connected to a single node.</i> Interesting how ridiculously inertia driven the whole banking industry is, when you compare modern ATM interfaces to statements like <i>We support withdrawls and balance inquiry from checking, savings and line-of-credit accounts.

Oh how the mighty have fallen...<p>Also amazing: they only targeted 95% uptime (excluding 12 Federal Reserve bank holidays when they were down anyway) and many banks were unable to even reach that level of service! The switch itself was above 98%. This is horrific by today&#x27;s standards, as was the maximum processing time (45 seconds) and suggested transmission latency allowances (4 seconds). Team size: &lt;1 full time programmer. Code length: 9K lines.
