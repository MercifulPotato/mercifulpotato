I sometimes modify the user chrome to hide the tab bar - although it is problematic.<p>Currently, I have the hn comments in one window, and the article in another window, and hn front page in another window on a &quot;smaller&quot; 2K monitor.  Customized for compact density, os tab bar moved to the right, menu bar off (the default) and still the 30 links on the hn front page don&#x27;t fit on the page. Why can&#x27;t the tab bar be hidden when there is only one tab? I don&#x27;t need to see a tab with a truncated title that already appears in the title bar. I guess I am supposed to hide the title bar, and learn to love a Lotus Notes era &quot;Tab&quot; interface. In my opinion, tabs are not cool.')
