It is just a shade lighter than the surrounding skin but otherwise unnoticeable. I of course can see the ever so slight difference since I know where to look and it was basically bleach white before, especially as the surrounding area got sun tanned.\nI have heard one of the causes of Vitiligo might be the liver and if this is the case then maybe fasting restored my liver health which promoted the healing? Just my guess....')
