Facebook has more than 6000 patents. Spin those and all other intellectual properties owned by Facebook into its own company who will then license them back to Facebook and anyone else who wants to get them at the same cost that Facebook does. Spin off everything not related to the product at facebook.com. Instagram, Oculus, etc. Also require Facebook to enter into a consent decree on many of its uglier activities.<p>On the issue of censorship, take that out of their hands entirely. No faux outside counsel that is appointed by Facebook. Instead allow outside service providers to provide users filtering services of their choice. If a user doesn&#x27;t like Christians, they can use a filtering service that removes Christian posts. If a user doesn&#x27;t like conspiracy theories, they use a filtering service that provides filtering for that type of content. Let the users decide what it is they want to filter out and have it done by independent entities not under the control of Facebook.')
