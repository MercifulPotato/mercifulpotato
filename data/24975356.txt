Liability is just one of the consequences of doing business.<p>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t suggest that Github should be ignoring DMCA complaints as a general practice (though plenty of providers sure seem to do so), but in this case I think they could make a calculation that the risk might be worth it: I know quite a few parties that have moved off github as a result of this incident.')
