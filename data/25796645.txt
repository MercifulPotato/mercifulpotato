Most of their money is invested, so the tax will not affect them too much. It will only affect people that have some extra money, but not too much.<p>What if I just use my 1.000.000 to buy gold, and keep the gold and enjoy my free monthly 10.000? If I ever need some extra money, I can sell the gold. If a month I have some remainder money, I buy more gold.<p>More importantly, who would sold me the gold? It will be difficult to offload all the cash, and it will be hit by the monthly 1% discount. So people with gold will prefer something else, like dollars.')
