The cancer bit is sad, but getting treated by the best medical doctors in the entire universe would probably help a bit with that! (instead of being fired, losing your health insurance, and bankrupting your entire family, like every normal working person in this country).<p>Now, he&#x27;s making a &quot;big transition&quot; to being a retired millionaire.<p>I really do appreciate the candor. It helps me to understand how people who are so wholly and tremendously disconnected from regular people justify their own existence.<p>Whoops, did I say all that out loud?')
