They advertised at you and it worked. It&#x27;s worked so well that you&#x27;re even parroting their marketing messages for them, including the myth that they don&#x27;t advertise.<p>&gt; <i>Why would Tesla spend the minimum tens of millions of dollars to get into what is at best a side diversion from their main business?</i><p>Formula E doesn&#x27;t cost <i>tens</i> of millions of dollars. Team budgets in Formula E are $10 million. And Tesla doesn&#x27;t need to own a team. They can be a powertrain supplier just like other car companies are suppliers and not team owners.')
