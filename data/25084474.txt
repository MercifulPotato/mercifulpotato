The racists who latched on to that conspiracy theory had their favored candidate a full 8 years before he launched his bid for president.<p>Of course opposition to Obama is much deeper than racism. I opposed Obama after regretfully voting for him in his first term, and then refused voting for him in his second term, for a multitude of executive policy decisions. But there is a huge quantity of criticism of Obama that can very easily be boiled down to racism, either because it is explicit, or so culturally entrenched as dog-whistle racism that it is undeniable. Hell, Hillary&#x27;s dog-whistle racism when running against Obama in 2008 was a primary reason she lost the black vote in 2016! Racist opposition to Obama was, and still is, everywhere.')
