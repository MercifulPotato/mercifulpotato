Item(by='2-tpg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606738891, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25236029, text='&gt; Anything to avoid admitting that a cop killed a black man in cold blood by kneeling on his neck for eight minutes, even after he said &quot;I can&#x27;t breathe&quot; repeatedly.<p>This shows how you view me. You judged me as a racism denialist, for having an opposing interpretation. It is like I won&#x27;t accept the Truth of your rendition of that scene, but maybe evil enough to be aware of it.<p>It would be absolutely horrible if a cop killed a civilian by maliciously kneeling on his neck arteries! That the cop did it, mainly because the civilian was Black and he was white! You sound like you want that horrible reality to be the truth! You already spray-painted his face on a banner with political talking points! Maybe you even got your company Twitter to pay their respects to Floyd.<p>&gt; even after he said &quot;I can&#x27;t breathe&quot; repeatedly<p>He was saying that when he got out of the car. He was under enormous stress from the arrest and prospect of possible jail, with a drug that already increases heart rate. The single cop had to restrain, because ambulance (not arrest car) was called, after it was clear from the &quot;I can&#x27;t breathe&quot; that he needed medical attention for OD. The other cops did crowd control, because the frantic yelling of Floyd attracted attention. &quot;Hey, man, let him go, he is just saying he can&#x27;t breathe&quot;. Like Philando Castile, that single video footage then went viral, and the cop acquitted on ALL charges, after companies such as Google send out PR condemning police brutality and systemic racism, because capitalism is a tool which employees can play as well (ideally, aligned with -- not damaging -- the company mission!), and now we are here, with you suggesting I think cops are snowflakes.<p>Give me a court case, a light symbolic punishment to avoid a second protest&#x2F;riot, while allowing for the possibility that racism exists, and did not play even a minor role in the case of the death of Floyd. That cop looked like a nonchalant fool enough to mess this up. Not foolish enough to kill a black man out of racist motives, while your Asian and Hispanic colleagues are keeping Social Media away from reality.')
