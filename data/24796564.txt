There&#x27;s rotisserie chickens, they seem free to experiment with the menu, some locations have beer, and it easily still competes and is often times better than the rise of &quot;fast casual&quot; places like five guys.<p>I was genuinely surprised when I went to college further up the east coast and found out the hate on tv shows was a real opinion.  It definitely wasn&#x27;t as good up north but not that bad. I&#x27;d heard the further from the east coast, and for some reason Richmond, the worse it gets, with California friends despising it.')
