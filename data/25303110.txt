If you get rejected, it&#x27;s with the expectation that you make whatever changes you see fit and then submit anew to a different conference. In addition, there is generally no way to update a submitted paper after the submission deadline in such a way that the changes can still be taken into account in the single round of reviews, and making major changes <i>after</i> the accepting venue&#x27;s review stage is very much frowned upon (as those changes would then not be reviewed). So her options would have been:<p>1. retract the paper;<p>2. get the paper rejected from the conference, and resubmit it later;<p>3. get the paper accepted and have it published without the major changes requested by Google, thus violating Google&#x27;s policy&#x2F;interests;<p>4. get the paper accepted and perform the major changes requested by Google at the camera-ready stage, thus violating academic convention and possibly even specific rules set out by the accepting conference.<p>2 is mostly 1 with more of everyone&#x27;s time wasted, and 3 and 4 both violate some obligation or another. From Google&#x27;s point of view, she might also well have gone for 3 without keeping them in the loop to present them with a fait accompli, and her enormous amount of social capital may have made it easy to get away with. Demanding 1 therefore seems like the most reasonable choice if they want to retain a credible norm of subjecting publications of people who work for them to prior review.')
