Probably not.  Does it take into account that many left leaning states like NJ have completely bankrupt pension systems that will need to be rescued at the federal level?  Probably not.  Also looks like NY scores 38th on gov dependency out of 50 which isnt exactly great.  And going back to national highway system assistance, Cali has got to be #1 in receiving federal funds.')
