The paper only talks about a particular subclass of learning algorithms in supervised learning domain within PAC framework.<p>Specially they talk about learning algorithms that minimize some error function from training examples. That&#x27;s not how learning happens in living organisms.  Therefore calling it &#x27;universal&#x27; is an unwarranted generalization, kind of like &#x27;theory of everything&#x27;.<p>A more appropriate name would be &#x27;Distribution-dependent Supervised PAC Learning&#x27; or something along those lines. It&#x27;s a solid work which addresses a particular niche of a particular  theory.')
