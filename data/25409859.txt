You acknowledge this, I think, with the phrase &quot;each device is in some ways more capable than one brain cell&quot;. That may be true, but the devices are not linked (and I would suggest, are not likely ever to be linked) in ways that would make them powerful the way neurons are.<p>They are not children. The do not develop. Individual instances are semantically prototypes which are destroyed or powered down, and the information gained from their existence is used <i>by humans</i> to create new ones. There is no &quot;evolution&quot; because there is no mechanism for variation beyond that which we, as humans, introduce. These machines are the perfect material for an intelligent design argument (one to which I do not subscribe). I do not see them as counterparts to, let alone examples of, biological evolution and development.<p>I do not subscribe to these attempts to find correspondences between whatever our current understanding of life&#x2F;the brain&#x2F;consciousness is and whatever current technology we have on hand. In the 1800s, people were doing this with hydraulics and gearing. Today, we&#x27;re doing it with computers. It&#x27;s so transparently parochial.<p>I don&#x27;t doubt the theoretical potential for life as well as consciousness to exist on a non-biological substrate. I do very much doubt that the IoT is that substrate, and ditto for AlphaFoobar, GPT-N or whatever other computational marvel one might point to.')
