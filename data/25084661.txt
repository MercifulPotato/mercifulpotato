You are going to find very very little sympathy for an argument that, if you are an unarmed civilian being killed in a genocide, then really its really your own fault for not keeping your house in order, and allowing your family to not be murdered by letting them leave would only disincentivize them from investing in their community to stop the violence somehow. Surely there is a better analogy for doordash drivers than that?')
