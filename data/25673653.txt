It&#x27;s either&#x2F;or, but not neither&#x2F;nor.<p>If I say to you, &quot;please shoot john smith&quot;, and you do - I should either be held responsible for saying thus, or accomplice in the result.  I can&#x27;t imagine anyone would claim I was without fault or responsibility.  To my mind, free-speech maximalism should hold me innocent of saying it, but has no bearing on my being accomplice to the result.')
