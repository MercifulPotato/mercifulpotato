But it is also the smallest of the current complaints.<p>It&#x27;s not &quot;additional&quot; means of purchases many companies are pushing for. They want to be able to avoid offering Apple&#x27;s IAP whatsoever.<p>I mean, ProtonMail did not have IAP in their app at all, but offered options to pay for their service on their website. Apple insisted, as you suggest, that they &quot;at least offer the platform&#x27;s own payment service as initial and preferred choice,&quot; and now ProtonMail is saying that is &quot;Mafia extortion.&quot;')
