I&#x27;ve lived in 3rd world countries and the standard of living even for a minimum wage worker is so beyond that of a poor person in a third world country (like Tanzania or Kenya, for example). People in the US are <i>lucky</i>, and yet, all everyone does is complain and bitch all the time. I think most Americans lack perspective and are ungrateful for what they have.')
