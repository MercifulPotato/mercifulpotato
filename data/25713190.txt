My issue is that I don&#x27;t trust Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey and other SV CEOs to decide what should be deplatformed. We see a lot of media around why white people are racist, bad and immoral people. Why don&#x27;t we see that much media around how the wealthy class are greedy, bad and immoral? My guess is because while BLM, antifa and the like are promoted by most of the major media channels, groups like occupy wall street are being quieted.')
