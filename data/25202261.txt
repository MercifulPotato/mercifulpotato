This results in women getting dozens to hundreds of extremely low quality matches for every quality match. If this somehow doesn&#x27;t cause the woman to just give up immediately, then she&#x27;s at most going to only look at most at a dozen or so of those matches before she gives up, and they&#x27;re almost all going to all be garbage.<p>This means that there at best only a 1-10% chance of a woman even seeing a quality message directed at her, given the sheer volume of garbage being directed at them.<p>It&#x27;s the same reason why you don&#x27;t notice the genuinely good deals in the massive amounts of advertisements you&#x27;re bombarded with every day. The sheer volume of noise just makes the whole system far more useless than you would expect.')
