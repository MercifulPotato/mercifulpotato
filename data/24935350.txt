In fact, the only &#x27;recording&#x27; that has been presented is of a third party warning Bobulinski that him making a scandal out of that would affect them all (it&#x27;s not Hunter Biden in the recording)<p>3) Tucker Carlson&#x27;s dog conveniently ate his homework last night<p>4) The source of the story - Rudy Giuliani - seems to be severely detached from reality, to the point that he somehow fell for the simplest prank in the book and got himself into a Sacha Baron Cohen film<p>5) There&#x27;s been so many contortions to this story - from accusations of child pornography, to all kinds of evidence that would be &#x27;presented&#x27; but never materialized - that it&#x27;s very hard to believe anything these messengers are saying anymore<p>This story stinks to high heaven. Did Hunter Biden benefit from his dad&#x27;s position? Possibly, but the people trying to push the narrative have shat the bed so many times already I find it very hard to believe they are motivated by anything other than politics.')
