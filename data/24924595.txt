I do not pretend there are no problems with systemd but it serves my (quite common) needs. And the way distributions shows some people were burnt out.<p>If you need X.Org (and I do), speak how to help X.Org.<p>Some people needs covered by Wayland. It is not their fault.<p>Distributions default may be questionable, it is distributions problem not Waylands.
