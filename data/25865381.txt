But assuming the page is already in RAM, there&#x27;s no reason any of the memory accesses actually need to go through the CPU. (hardware can already raise interrupts; if the MMU can raise a page fault indicator, then you might be able to bypass CPU entirely until a new page needs to be loaded)<p>moreover, if we have support for mmap at the MMU level, we can cut the CPU bottleneck for disk access entirely. the disk controller can already handle DMA, but there&#x27;s simply no way for things that aren&#x27;t the CPU to trigger it. DirectStorage is an effort for GPUs to trigger it, but what if we could also trigger it by other means?')
