If so, that&#x27;s untrue, but maybe you&#x27;re saying Dylan doesn&#x27;t have parameterized types? It&#x27;s a little unclear in the text.<p>&gt; The parameterising complicates the subtyping relationships needed to specify how multiple dispatch works.<p>I don&#x27;t think it adds all that much complication actually, and it adds a ton of extra expressive power. For instance, our arrays are parameterized by their element type and their dimensionality, so<p><pre><code>    Array{Int, 1}\n</code></pre>\nis a 1D (vector) array of Ints whereas<p><pre><code>    Array{Complex{Float64}, 2}\n</code></pre>\nis a 2D (matrix) of Complex Float64s. This is really important for making the most of multiple dispatch imo because I can write methods which take advantage of as much type information as possible. This isn&#x27;t just helpful for performance, but also helpful for just expressing your algorithm in a clear and general way.')
