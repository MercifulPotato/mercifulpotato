But I must so you are little incorrect here. You have clearly not seen how world lies, how society lies. So let me explain it to you.<p>First when you grow you drink mom&#x27;s milk and you are under impression drinking milk is good for health which indeed is. So people start consuming milk everywhere.<p>And there are advertisements which shows happy cows, chocolates made from milk. Vegetarians are under impression that its ethical. And many farmers advertises as if their cows are happy they are grass fed etc. In some religion they even worship cows etc giving impression that cows are respected etc.<p>And the other thing you often hear is cows babies get enough milk and farmers only sell excess milk. So from religion, society people are brain washed so much they don&#x27;t even see how animals are tortured, left on road after buffalo&#x2F;cows stops giving milk.<p>I wish media would cover this subject more especially in India which is probably top 3 vegetarian country in the world.')
