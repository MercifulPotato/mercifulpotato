Like I said, we can always introduce new ad-hoc hypotheses, but good science isn&#x27;t done willy nilly, it&#x27;s done with background knowledge of how the systems might plausibly work. The two hypotheses are:<p>(1) smoking → tar → cancer<p>(2) smoking ← genes → cancer<p>Note that (1) contains the sub-hypothesis (A) smoking → tar, which is also compatible with (2).<p>The super-graph containing both graphs is:<p><pre><code>     ————genes————\n     ↓           ↓</code></pre>\nsmoking → tar → cancer<p>In that super-graph, there is only one possible explanation for a correlation between smoking and tar: smoking causing tar. So if we see that correlation, then barring alternative hypotheses, we know the causation smoking → tar is true. (Again, we could always hypothesize other causal explanations, but we&#x27;re presuming no one has yet submitted a plausible alternative explanation.)<p>Now once smoking → tar is established, we are still left with two possible explanations for the observed correlation between smoking and cancer:<p>(1) smoking → tar → cancer<p>(2+A) tar ← smoking ← genes → cancer<p>This is where controlling for smoking behavior comes in. Once we do that, we&#x27;ve severed the indirect statistical link between tar and cancer in graph (2+A). Thus if a correlation still persists between tar and cancer after this statistical control, we&#x27;ve ruled out (2+A), leaving only (1).')
