People having more money doesn&#x27;t generate value, it just drives inflation.<p>But the quote you are replying to makes no sense anyway. It doesn&#x27;t &quot;cost the economy&quot;. This is that same old fallacy that says if the economy has &quot;grown&quot; and there&#x27;s more bits of paper moving around that we are somehow better off. If anything a bigger economy just means we spend too much of our finite lives trying to make sure others don&#x27;t get more than we do. It doesn&#x27;t correlate to a better way of life at all.')
