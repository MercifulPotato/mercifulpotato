If I want to order a single pizza I have to click through like 12+ pages. They have a page for each question!<p>- I want to order pizza<p>- Delivery or checkout?<p>- Which pizza?<p>- Extra chesse?<p>- Modify ingredients?<p>- Go to checkout or order more stuff?<p>- But wouldn&#x27;t you like one of these desserts?<p>- How about soda?<p>- Here&#x27;s your order, click to continue<p>- Would you like to donate?<p>- Oh you wanna pay now? Input your password again. We&#x27;ll silently screw the whole process if you type it wrong.<p>- Now you can finally click to continue<p>- Want SMS? Click one last time.<p>They could just, you know, put safe defaults on everything and let me change them if I want. I am less likely to order pizza form them again just because it takes so long on their website. Compare that to how easy it is to buy something from Amazon. Heck, even Grubhub is miles easier.<p>Edit: formatting.')
