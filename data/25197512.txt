Item(by='noneeeed', descendants=None, kids=[25197630], score=None, time=1606217586, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25196971, text='Something to consider in these kinds of cases is that you&#x27;re not just paying for a more complex physical product, but the the cost of actually designing and certifying the device.<p>The market for the basic stick is massive, so the cost of design and product development is spread across many, many units.<p>The market for the FIPS stick will be tiny in comparison. That means that the cost of design and development will be both higher (more complex product) and spread across many fewer units. Now add on the cost of going through the certification, which will involve massive amoounts of paperwork, box-ticking and bureaucracy and the cost of development really shoots up compared with slapping some memory cells and an interface into a plastic box.<p>I used to work on safety critical software, and the amount of time that was actually spent writing code was really quite small compared to the effort required to demonstrate both to ourselve, but also to the certifying authorities that the software was safe. The Verifcation and Validation teams would often be far larger than the original development teams.<p>Having said that, I am absolutely sure there will also be some price gouging going on because there will be only a small number of companies that make FIPS certified devices and so competition is lower.')
