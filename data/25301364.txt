From my experience people wear masks and visors to protect themselves. I honestly do not think the average person view wearing a mask as something they do to protect others. It&#x27;s a little weird, because at the same time people seem very conscious about the risk when people around them can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t wear a mask.<p>At least in Denmark I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s communicated very well why you should wear a mask. The government says &quot;wear a mask&quot; so the majority wears a mask. It&#x27;s great that we have that level of trust in government, but it also sometimes mean that things are communicated as well as they should be.')
