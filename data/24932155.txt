People using outdoor spaces (like parks) may be riskier than everyone staying locked in a hermetically-sealed room, but wind and ventilation reduces the risk of aerosol transmission drastically. Restricting the chance of disease spread is vitally important, but we can and should do so in a way that (1) informs the public about how risk changes in different scenarios, and (2) helps people reason about their own risk in various situations. I wish we had less fear-mongering and more reasoned compassion as part of the campaigns to enforce restrictions.')
