There are a finite number of viable social interactions to be discovered. Once discovered, network effects push towards consolidation to one platform offering that experience.<p>If you consider “social media” as a market, it has healthy competitive landscape. If you consider different styles of social interaction as separate markets, they’ve cornered markets. I don’t see competition in these spaces. Facebook != Twitter, and I feel that is why both can exist.  Behemoths in neighboring spaces opt to buy a social experience instead of trying to compete with their own.<p>The missing piece, IMO, isn’t regulation around “censorship” for these platforms. It’s regulation that results in a rich market of products around a single style of social interaction. Example: regulation around interoperability.')
