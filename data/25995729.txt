I&#x27;ve had a lot of amusing &quot;Western&quot; (by which they mostly mean American) food on these trips. The last time few times I was there I went to a vegan place that specializes in Western food. Some of the stuff was what you&#x27;d expect, like a burger and fries, but there was also some oddities.<p>My favorite was the mashed potato sub, which was room temperature mashed potatoes mixed with bits of chopped vegan ham and carrots, served in a hot dog roll, topped with ketchup and mustard. It was really good, though it cracked me up that this was what they might think we eat in the US.<p>I&#x27;ve also noticed that many of the vegan Western food places serve dishes that they call &quot;risotto&quot; which are basically just cooked rice with sauce on top. I understand how they settled on risotto, but it can be a bit of disappointment if you&#x27;re expecting actual risotto.<p>Overall, I have a lot of fun trying the Taiwanese interpretations of American food. The food quality there is just really high in general. Even if it&#x27;s weird, it&#x27;s weird with good ingredients and flavors, so you never end up with something inedible, just surprising in a fun way.')
