Parler tried to make a new service that plays by a new set of rules. And they were crushed, because it turns out that you actually can&#x27;t have your own rules unless you are already at the scale of Apple, AWS, etc.<p>That&#x27;s not at all true.  If I recall the same thing happened to 8chan&#x2F;8kun.  Yet somehow they live on.  If Parler has a market, they&#x27;ll find a way.<p>That said, it sucks but, well, that&#x27;s capitalism for ya.<p>What else would you suggest?  Regulating these various companies such that the government gets to decide who can use their services?<p>Because if so, a) that would require new laws, b) it&#x27;d probably fall afoul of the first amendment, and c) it doesn&#x27;t seem to align well with free market conservative ideology, and so should be opposed by the very users of Parler that are being affected by this.')
