It is not about making transactions at market rates. It is about having the power to define market rates through the operations of the company (trust) and its close associates. All the characteristics of trusts appear in Google&#x27;s behavior when they buy competitors and pay their buddies (FF) to deal with them. When they say that people &quot;chose&quot; to use Google properties, this is clearly false in the moment that they buy would be competitors and pay FF and Apple prices that cannot be replicated by others.')
