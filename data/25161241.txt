So if you&#x27;re talking about multidimensional arrays that have such operations defined, it&#x27;s useful to communicate that distinction by using the name &quot;tensor&quot;.\nIn the same way that it&#x27;s useful to talk about coordinates rather than &quot;1-dimensional array of length &lt;base size&gt; that respects certain invariants&quot;.')
