Buying in major cities in Canada simply does not make any financial sense <i>unless</i> you were counting on continued insane growth (fueled by local speculation as much or more than foreign).<p>Most people are unaware of the specific bet they are making, and buy just because Canada has a crazy cult of home ownership. From my own experience, it is far more intense than anywhere else. Paying anything other than a mortgage is widely seen as &quot;throwing your money away&quot;, even with the above financial realities.<p>Unfortunately, although people are unaware of the nature of the bet they are making (unbridled speculation fueling price growth), they have been right for a long time, even through the housing collapse in the US. But the music&#x27;s gotta stop at some point.<p>Though locals may talk about how young Canadians are &quot;screwed&quot; or that no one can afford a house anymore, the reality is that home ownership in Canada is higher than it has ever been in history. Young Canadians simply need to accept that, for now, owning a house  shouldn&#x27;t be their one goal in life: they should opt-out of the cult of home ownership, and just wait until buying makes financial sense (i.e. the bubble bursts or deflates).')
