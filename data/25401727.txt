I want to believe TiDB is a good product but the sleazy marketing campaigns leave me questioning.<p>They&#x27;re always &quot;the first&quot;, &quot;the best&quot; or &quot;the fastest&quot;. So I tried TiDB on our real life workload and it was 5x slower than a single MySQL instance when running 3 shards. This doesn&#x27;t jive with any of the blog posts they release.<p>I really think they&#x27;re running a marketing racket with a bunch of sockpuppets on various social media platforms. Such speculation on here usually summons Dang but I don&#x27;t see how they can otherwise get to front page of HN and other coder forums so regularly. It doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>Having &quot;a paper&quot; that&#x27;s high impact but somewhat plagiarized fits their MO to me. I&#x27;m an admitted conspiracy theorist and I am ever sceptical of their claims')
