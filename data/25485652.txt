Also the big x86 guys have more or less been asleep at the wheel for almost a decade.<p>My go to example: my 2011 x220 sandybridge stinkpad is faster than my 2017 kaby lake mbp. 2005 machines (I dunno, Lakeport?) aren&#x27;t even in the same ballpark as modern machines. Had that pace continued up to current year, the M1 chip would be a stinker. As it is, AMD is close and could smoke M1 in next generation 5nm chips, restoring order to the universe.')
