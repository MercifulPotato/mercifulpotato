Poverty is a trap and it is hard to move somewhere cheaper when you don’t have enough money to buy a car. You can say “don’t spend your money” all you want but when money is tight you make concessions on things, and it usually leads to higher costs down the road. Cheaper products have to be bought more frequently. Bad cars bought break down sooner. This leads to debt trouble as you borrow from your future to pay for expensive costs now, leading to more fees later. The best money management still can’t predict the unexpected and when you’re barely making it month to month even the slightest setback can have rippling consequences that roll you deeper into debt.<p>It’s really easy to say “just move and stop spending your money lol” but it really is often more complicated than that.')
