I know of at least &#x27;DeepBach&#x27;, Feynman Liang et al.&#x27;s (2016) &#x27;BachBot&#x27; and Daniel Johnson&#x27;s (2015) &#x27;biaxial-rnn&#x27; as algorithmic music systems that could all be described as &#x27;quirky&#x27; in many ways, but definitely not &#x27;off&#x27;.  And they&#x27;re not limited to &#x27;simplistic&#x27; music styles - all of them deal with Western music of the common practice period, which is quite non-trivial. Their main limitation is modeling structure beyond the &#x27;short musical phrase&#x27; level, but that&#x27;s to be expected.')
