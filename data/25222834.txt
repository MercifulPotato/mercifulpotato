Doesn&#x27;t conventional coasting mean that the ICE still <i>is</i> driving the wheels â€” at idle RPM? So if instead the clutch decouples, the electric motor has to make up the difference, right? That&#x27;s not nothing when you consider that diesels (such as your Audi) output significantly more power at idle RPM (and also use more fuel, I&#x27;d guess?) than petrol engines (relative to max power).')
