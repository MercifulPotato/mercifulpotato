Item(by='acoard', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609867847, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25641400, text='Disney originally got rich from animating public domain stories, like Cinderella and Snow White.  These were the popular stories of the day that people grew up with.   Now after nearly a century of Disney, who has bought Star Wars and Marvel,  Disney owns all the stories people grow up with.  They built up their IP moat using public domain stories, and have used IP law to maintain their incumbency.<p>To me, the  solution is to  let the  cycle repeat.   Let the next animation company start making  stories about Spidier-Man or Luke Skywalker.  Sure, keep the trademarks so you can&#x27;t say &quot;Marvelsâ„¢ Spidier-Man&quot;, but John Smith should be able to take a crack at his version of Spider-Man just like Walt got his version of Cinderella.')
