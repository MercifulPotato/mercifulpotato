But if you want to understand the world, be able to do things... SR can&#x27;t help you.</i><p>Yes, merely memorizing a lot of facts is not very useful. But unfortunately, burning a lookup table to your head is often a crucial step for actually using many types of knowledge, and it&#x27;s a real headache for beginners. I find it&#x27;s entirely possible to fully understand a result, yet unable to clearly remember it. When you need to use the result, having to pause and think (even for a few seconds), creates a significant cognitive overhead. Being able to recall some results mechanically is often advantageous.<p>For example, a long time ago, it was lifechanging after I had discovered &quot;man 7 units&quot; and eventually remembered that 1 kilo = 1&#x2F;(1 milli) = 1e3, 1 mega = 1&#x2F;(1 micro) = 1e6, 1 giga = 1&#x2F;(1 nano) = 1e9, 1 tera = 1&#x2F;(1 pico) = 1e12, I was able to calculate much faster, and to say &quot;The CPU is clocked at 1 GHz, which means it ticks every 1 nanosecond&quot; without thinking. Previously, I fully understood what a SI prefix is, but I simply couldn&#x27;t build a lookup table in my brain to map words to the number of zeros, and always needed to pause a moment to count. The man page allowed me to instantly check it while making calculation without leaving the commandline, effectively it was spaced repetition without software, and I finally remembered them...<p>This is when spaced repetition is useful - burning some lookup tables to your brain. It cannot help you to understand things, but it has its place. Just be aware of its limitation.')
