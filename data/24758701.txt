If they don’t value their reputation, fine, but these bad researchers are only getting press because they are attaching the univerity’s name to their ideas. That’s not something to blame readers for. And if there are researchers at these universities that oppose them, it’s up to the university and other researchers at Stanford to stop their name being use if they disagree with its use.')
