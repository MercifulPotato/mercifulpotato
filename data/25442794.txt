Yes, it should absolutely be free to the recepient.<p>I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s such a strange concept to you - afer all, Americans are also used to receiving certain services for free - you don&#x27;t have to pay the police for coming to help you, or the fire brigade for that matter. To me it&#x27;s the same thing - if your house on fire, the fire brigade will come and help, free of charge - that&#x27;s what taxes are for. So if I&#x27;m ill, I will be given any and all help needed - also free of charge, after all, that&#x27;s what taxes are for.<p>&gt;&gt;They are also exorbitantly expensive because of the absurd moral hazard they create.<p>Like, sometimes I think Americans live literally on a different planet. Do you think that in countries where healthcare is free to use people have medical procedures without any reason and simply because they don&#x27;t have to pay for it?<p>In general, it&#x27;s simple - if a country wants to have healthy, productive citizens, it should pay for their healthcare, I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s such a divisive concept. The crown example of how crazy the US system is, is the fact that you have to pay to give birth. Like.....so US cares so little for its citizens that literally the very act of giving birth to new ones is not covered by the government? That&#x27;s....beyond mind boggling.')
