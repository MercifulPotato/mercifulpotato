It&#x27;s comical, but also you come to realise that the deadline isn&#x27;t for you anyway. It&#x27;s for everyone around you so they can plan their tasks. When the deadline is once again pushed due to reasons outside of your control, just rest assured that everyone saw it coming and the blame probably isn&#x27;t on you.')
