Jumping from general distrust of the world to full-on conspiracy is... well, it&#x27;s a jump, not a simple step. I don&#x27;t think everyone in QAnon is there just because they&#x27;re not rational enough, I think there are multiple issues at play.<p>I suspect there is no single unified cause for conspiracy theories that we can point to, even though I do agree with people like Doctorow that actual rampant corruption in our institutions both isn&#x27;t helping with the problem and is understated as a potential contributing factor.')
