It assumes that the breakages are man-made (or restricts itself to only talking about those that are man-made) and then goes on to explain the breakages through that lens. Of course the explanations of those breakages are in turn at least some evidence that those breakages are indeed man-made, but the article doesn&#x27;t go into explaining what proportion of damage is man-made.<p>I too am curious to what extent natural breakage plays a role which unfortunately the article doesn&#x27;t really get into.<p>I&#x27;ve seen broken noses on a lot of very diverse sculptures from across the world (Mesoamerican sculptures, Easter Island Moai heads, Greco-Roman busts, Chinese Buddhist sculptures, etc.) so I&#x27;m inclined to think at least <i>some</i> of the broken noses on Egyptian sculptures can be attributed to natural damage.<p>I would&#x27;ve appreciated if the article explained the ratio of natural damage to man-made damage on these noses.<p>As it stands I&#x27;m still not sure whether Egyptian sculptures have an outsized number of broken noses or whether it&#x27;s the same ratio as all other ancient sculptures.')
