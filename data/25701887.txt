On another device he did a Google search for &quot;apple contact number canada&quot;.  The first hit is an ad for a scam firm with a link to consultnow546.8b.io.  The site provided a phone number 1-888-308-4423 which a quick search turned up on scammer.info.<p>If I do the same search on my own account, the results returned are the actual contact number for Apple.  Any idea why he is getting this search result instead of the correct phone number I get when performing the same search?  It&#x27;s kind of scary that non-technically savvy people are getting this kind of result for a fairly innocuous search.  Thoughts?  This is the sort of thing that I wish I could call Google support and get them to remove the content for.')
