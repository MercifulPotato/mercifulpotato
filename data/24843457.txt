A team of guys with consumer drones and a half a kg of C4 each ought to be enough I&#x27;d guess. That&#x27;s only &quot;criminal gang&quot; grade opponents, not even close to state level. (Or, you know, a bunch of random conspiracy nut QAnons or ProudBoys wound up on social media to believe the ground stations cause Covid or are part of a Jewish global banking conspiracy...)')
