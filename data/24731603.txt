Item(by='weinzierl', descendants=None, kids=[24732014], score=None, time=1602261176, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24731277, text='<i>Not</i> depependin on OpenSSL is kind of the point of the original post if I understand it correctly.<p>Also I find the dependency on OpenSSL one major pain in my Rust projects. When you want to build a statically linked binary you need to supply a statically built OpenSSL and if your distro doesn&#x27;t come with one (like Ubuntu) you are on your own. Yes, there is a Docker container that comes with all the prerequisites but I think that&#x27;s a bit heavy for my purposes.<p>I wish there was a single switch in Cargo.toml and every dependency would automagically use <i>rustls</i>.')
