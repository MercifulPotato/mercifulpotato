And quite often there aren&#x27;t many physical differences between the drives in some of the lower end models there are no differences at all and in some cases non-NAS drives might actually be &quot;better&quot; than their lower-end NAS counterparts.<p>What you are paying for when buying a WD RED isn&#x27;t necessarily a more durable drive, you are essentially paying a premium for future warranty claims, it&#x27;s essentially an insurance scheme in which WD RED NAS drives are defined as higher risk than say their Black or Blue series.')
