Item(by='xyzelement', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608847812, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25531751, text='LeonB, I appreciate this discourse and let me explain why I see maturity as a factor here.<p>Let&#x27;s assume that phishing is a real threat, and testing like this moves the needle on people&#x27;s vigilance (as it has for me when I failed something like it last year.) Let&#x27;s also assume that if this was a real phish, there would be really bad emotional and financial consequences. EG: imagine being the one who fell for a real phish and actually caused a huge data leak that ended up in the news and put your company out of business.<p>Regardless of how we feel about it, the above threats are real. So we can either chose to be &quot;nice&quot; but increase people&#x27;s vulnerability to real painful consequences , or we can chose to be &quot;tough&quot; because we realize that in the long run it creates greater actual security for everyone. To me that&#x27;s &quot;tough love&quot; - harsher short term decisions to help everyone in the long run.<p>It indeed feels adult and mature to take the tough and unpopular decision that aims to address the real risk, and conversely irresponsible to say &quot;we can&#x27;t deal with the problem because it&#x27;ll be unpopular and someone may get upset.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s maturity on the flip side too. When I failed the phishing test, it was a wakeup call. In retrospect I should have caught it but I wasn&#x27;t careful enough. So I am grateful the company did it because it taught me a valuable lesson that will keep me safer in the future. If my response was instead &quot;those fuckers tricked me&quot; or whatever, it would have been childish, because it ignores that the risk is real and that it&#x27;s really I who has the power to do better.')
