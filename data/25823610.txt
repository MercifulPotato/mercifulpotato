The medical education costs upwards of $800K if you include the cost of lost opportunity had you gone into a different field and worked those years instead. So doctors need higher salaries. That, combined with idiotic market dynamics around medical supplies, means that all medical costs are higher. That in turn means everyone absolutely needs insurance or risk personal bankruptcy.')
