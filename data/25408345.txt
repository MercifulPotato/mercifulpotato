Itâ€™s not guaranteed that Steve Jobs would have another hit.<p>And many would say the M1 and Silicon Macs are a considerable step up, and so is the slow but steady March of wearables via Apple Watch and Air Pods.<p>I do agree with you that there is a higher chance of innovation with Steve at the helm, but again he is a generational talent so is it fair to paint the MBA Tim Cook in a bad light when he has been reasonably successful in not just business but also innovation.<p>My overall point is smart people are smart people and generational talents are generational talents. They can be MBAs or engineers or any other profession. Creative MBAs will be creative and dull engineer will be dull.')
