Amazon makes more sales, their stock price goes up, those with Amazon stock get richer (which they can often leverage into things like loans, without ever selling the stock), and at no point is some of that money taken to help fund general government.<p>When the rules were set up this wasn&#x27;t the intention, and there might have to be changes. To be fair to Amazon, their problems are not as serious as many other companies which make it look like they make zero profit in some countries by &quot;paying&quot; themselves in another.')
