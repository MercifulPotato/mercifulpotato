And that&#x27;s a good thing.<p>There&#x27;s only so many bullshit paper-pushing jobs and useless over-budget infrastructure projects we can create to make up for the lack of work.<p>A better way to deal with too much labor on the market would be setting government-mandated maximum work-hours, so as to spread the amount of available work evenly among the entire populace.<p>Secondly - for those countries where this isn&#x27;t a reality yet - school and university should be free and you should receive government aid while attending them, to allow those out of a job to learn new skills or just pursue their interests.')
