It doesn&#x27;t scale, wastes energy, encourages fraud, has buggy&#x2F;immutable &quot;smart&quot; contracts, is &quot;anonymous&quot; yet a public blockchain, etc etc.<p>It&#x27;s been a &quot;startup&quot; for 10 years and the only product-market fit so far is for speculators, darknet sellers, tax evaders, betting&#x2F;gambling sites, and straight-up Ponzi fraud. However, it&#x27;s like catnip to a certain section of libertarians and get-rich-quick types - who want to replace the Fed with an early-adopter oligarchy.')
