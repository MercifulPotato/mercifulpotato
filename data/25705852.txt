How can the average person tell?<p>It&#x27;s pretty obnoxious and exhausting to read about &quot;Oh yeah, I know that&#x27;s X, because...&quot; on Twitter. Like the whole &quot;It&#x27;s Antifa ambushing the Capitol&quot;, because &quot;the Antifa sign is to wear your hat backwards&quot;, &quot;those are Antifa helmets&quot;, or just a screenshot of a photo of some guy with the text &quot;phillyantifa.org&quot; next to the picture is enough to convince some people that, &quot;Yeah, it&#x27;s Antifa&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s a cheap grasping for evidence to reaffirm your views&#x2F;world belief though, to fix your cognitive dissonance. Because trying to find the whole truth would mean confronting yourself and maybe figuring out you&#x27;ve been dumb enough to be lied to. That your &quot;team&quot; are the ones who are ready to be violent towards members of the government.

[...] Nobody likes looking like a chump, and most people will go to great lengths to convince themselves that they weren’t.<p>&gt; Now think about someone who has been supporting Trump since the summer. For the Trump bubble to burst, many people like that would have to slap their foreheads and say, “Wow, he’s not a serious person! What was I thinking?”<p>&gt; And very few people ever do that sort of thing. Someone who has spent months supporting Trump despite establishment denunciations — which means something like a third of Republicans — will go to great lengths to avoid conceding that he has been foolish. At this point such people will insist that any negative reports about Trump are the product of hostile mainstream media; Trump’s very durability so far is likely to make him highly resilient looking forward.')
