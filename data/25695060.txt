He didn&#x27;t plan the thing, and it&#x27;s unclear what his role was.<p>Is this goalpost moving? Your prior comment was:<p>&gt;It&#x27;s highly unlikely that there were any members of Antifa among the rioters, and there is also no evidence of same.<p>My response was simply that it&#x27;s confirmed that there were antifa people present in the capitol and the evidence is their very own stream. He later went on national TV and admitted to being present.<p>It&#x27;s irrelevant what he claims. At a minimum he riled up the mob, such action being viewed on his stream.<p>If you want to make the argument that storming the capitol building wasn&#x27;t an antifa action, I won&#x27;t argue with you. If you want to say there were no antifa people present and there is no evidence of the same, then I&#x27;ll correct you as you are objectively wrong.')
