You have to choose between freedom and convenience, but you can choose. I&#x27;m saying that as a person who used 4 linux phones as daily drivers for last 10 years (n900, n9, jolla, xperia with sailfish).<p>&gt; There are other choices but are they mainstream<p>Well there are. Maybe they are not mainstream because people value convenience over freedom, which is unfortunate to me, but who am I to dictate them my values.<p>At least there are always some linux phones to choose from, and hopefully fabless&#x2F;new open platforms would even increase the amount of such. I mean, 10 years ago it was nokia or nothing, today there are pinephone, fairphone, librem')
