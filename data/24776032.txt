Linux good because package manager!&quot; Microsoft offering a &quot;store&quot; (most software on it is free anyway) and allowing signed installers that won&#x27;t trigger warnings - also bad!<p>So which is it? And more importantly, how is this any way worse than the common practise in Linux to install 3rd party software via some variation of &quot;wget -O <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;some.totally.trustworthy.website&#x2F;install" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;some.totally.trustworthy.website&#x2F;install</a> | sudo bash&quot; that won&#x27;t show any warning whatsoever?<p>TL;DR There totally IS a reason to scare users away from installing random crap from the internet. And that reason is independent from operating systems or companies!')
