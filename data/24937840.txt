To ask for otherwise would be asking for AMD drivers to work for an Nvidia graphics card.<p>If what you&#x27;re saying is that on ARM there are 15,000 different kinds of USB controller that all need their own driver, that&#x27;s one thing. But if all you&#x27;re saying is that there are 25 different USB controllers and 25 different drive controllers and 25 different network controllers and that means you get 15,000 different possible combinations, the fact that every <i>combination</i> needs its own separate drivers is the bug. Even if various controllers are combined into one SoC.<p>&gt;  They paper over it with ACPI which is based around a VM that has to be run in the kernel that&#x27;s basically a giant binary blob, in contrast to device tree&#x27;s description of the components and how they&#x27;re connected.<p>It seems to be doing a useful thing in abstracting away the various binary blobs into a stable interface that allows them to continue operating with newer kernel versions.<p>Getting rid of the binary blobs entirely is a separate fight, presumably related to getting open source <i>firmware</i> (rather than drivers).')
