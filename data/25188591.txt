Every single time I search for what I know is a false friend, Google Translate systematically returns the obviously wrong translation.<p>The last examples I have are the followings:<p>- I searched &quot;faux-ami&quot; in English, and Google Translate returned &quot;fake friend&quot; instead of &quot;false friend&quot;<p>- I searched &quot;en deux temps&quot;, knowing that &quot;in two times&quot; was not correct, and it obviously returned the wrong translation again.<p>All of this while proudly displaying a &quot;Validated by contributors&quot; badge with a shield.<p>I don&#x27;t remember Google Translate being so bad in the past, what has happened? It has switched from a reliable translator for phrases and idioms to an unusable piece of garbage. Do we have insights on this?')
