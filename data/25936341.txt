As a reader of libertarian stuff for 30 years, the usual answers are some combination of:<p><pre><code>   1) independent rating agency for med schools\n   2) independent rating agency for doctors (i.e. med school was irrelevant)\n   3) patient reviews for doctors\n</code></pre>\n25 years of amzn have helped established serious questions about (3)<p>(1) and (2) have the usual &quot;who watches the watchers?&quot; problems, which are fairly isomorphous to the problems with (3). And even without those issues, who wants to have do this level of research? Yeah, I know, libertarian nerds (meant with all possible respect). But almost nobody else.<p>Part of the point (not all of it, to be sure) of things like the AMA, the FDA and other governmental regulation is to make people&#x27;s lives simpler. Stop worrying about whether the doctor you&#x27;re going to see has even met a basic level of medical qualification, and focus on whether you like their personality and approach, for example.')
