This is about removing political opposition.<p>The WalkAway campaign&#x27;s FB page was removed, despite no violent content.<p>The Articles of Unity project has been deplatformed from Twitter (and I believe FB) for a while with no justification and absolutely no hateful content whatsoever.<p>Yes, there are many high-profile targets that seem easy to justify, but a much larger swath of those affected are completely unjustifiable.')
