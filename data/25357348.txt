Not all package managers come with signing keys or actually check them.<p>Seems like a very big problem with those package manager... \nUbuntu as far as I&#x27;m aware does proper signing. (as any sane distro and hell, microsoft too)<p>I would not be using those package managers.<p>&gt; 2. &quot;Sooner or later&quot; - weasel words.<p>What&#x27;s your point?, I trust Ubuntu&#x2F;Red Hat to keep their keys safe. I trust that google project zero and others would notice anything spooky.<p>I do not trust a random distro with only a few users to keep their keys safe and I do not use that.<p>It&#x27;s also hard to do a proper attack when you have:<p>ubuntu -&gt; (n) mirrors -&gt; me<p>Ubuntu can&#x27;t push a malicious package directed at me (I go via mirrors which can be picked at random)<p>Mirrors can&#x27;t push a malicious package directed at me (they would need ubuntu signing keys, and someone would need to own all of them or be very lucky)<p>And if someone does compromise Ubuntu&#x27;s keys, they&#x27;re not going to go after me and risk getting detected that way.<p>There is a lot more security built into package managers then what I said compared to 0 you get on curl|bash.')
