Say linear or quadratic (the most obvious alternative choices)?<p><i>&gt; it&#x27;s non-sensical when you look further back in time</i><p>Of course, because the factors that are at work in producing the data are not constant in time. So there is no reason to expect a single curve fit with a single set of parameters to be applicable for all times.')
