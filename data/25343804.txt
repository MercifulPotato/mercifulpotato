Can I say I&#x27;m free? Can someone in the same circumstances as me say they&#x27;re free? To me it&#x27;s a matter of perception. When we are free (&quot;given&quot; the freedom) to do something, we are possibly starting to infringe on the freedom of someone else.<p>Whose freedom should be valued as the &quot;true&quot; one, or above the other? Can both coexist? If everyone can be free only up to a certain extent, so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with anyone else&#x27;s freedom, is anyone actually free?<p>This brings to mind the discussions happening here regarding centralising the internet so censorship is easier, vs owning our own internet infrastructure.<p>I don&#x27;t have an answer, and I just wish people would be excellent towards each other')
