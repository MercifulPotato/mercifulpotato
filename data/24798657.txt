However - I&#x27;d argue that a polymath is someone with expertise in multiple domains. And the real value of the generalist is the ability to join the dots between specialties. We can argue if polymaths exist - or who might be one - but I think the definition stands. My background is medicine and I&#x27;ve seen first and the different contributions that generalists make vs specialists.')
