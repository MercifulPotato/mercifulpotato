Input switching on one &quot;smart&quot; TV in particular (I&#x27;m pretty sure it was a Visio) was like a four step process instead of a simple button press.  It was really eye opening just how bad designers could screw up something that should literally be a one button press.  You can&#x27;t assume anything with new electronics - some of the UI designs are stupendously horrible.')
