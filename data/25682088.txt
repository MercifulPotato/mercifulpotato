Item(by='nucleardog', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610086839, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25679251, text='Yeah, I&#x27;ve only got experience with one Credit Union so I could just have a particularly good one or something, but I imagine given that they _don&#x27;t_ have branches everywhere probably requires them to invest a little more heavily in figuring out how to do things without people being there in person.<p>My wife&#x27;s still with one of the &quot;big banks&quot; and more than a few times has been required to go in for basic signatures and stuff (not even for new services, just like &quot;we updated this thing you need to come sign it&quot;). Last time I did something major with my Credit Union was to get a loan from them, and it was shooting them an email, they called me up and we hashed out the details, then they sent me over an approval and a docusign link and I signed it and the money showed up in my account.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say that I can &quot;transact online&quot; as such (like, it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s a &quot;loan&quot; flow on their website) but they&#x27;re certainly capable of figuring out how to get things done without me being there in person. I can only imagine with so many staff going remote and people being more hesitant to go places this past year they&#x27;ve only gotten better at it.<p>Only downside over the years has been that there&#x27;s never been (and never will be) any sort of integration with any of the budgeting&#x2F;etc services like Mint. No company is really gonna invest the effort to pick up the 100,000 members my CU has.')
