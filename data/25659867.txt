Collectivizing challenges (rather than individualizing them) is what pretty much all societal progress is built on...<p>But that process will always look like people saying &quot;this isn&#x27;t my fault&quot; and focussing on &quot;something they can&#x27;t change [by themselves]&quot;.<p>Anyhow, not saying your intuition are wrong (there are degrees I agree with), but just noting it has some fuzzy edges that point toward some weird truisms')
