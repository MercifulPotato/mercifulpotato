The Snoqualmie tunnel was a trip, especially with 90s era incandescent flashlights, where you can only see the walls of the tunnel if you stare straight ahead and use your peripheral vision.<p>Coincidentally, I took COVID WFH as an opportunity to spend a week in Idaho. While there, I rode both the Trail of the Coeur D&#x27;Alenes (30mi out and back for me), as well as the Hiawatha Trail which is another rail-to-trail (probably not on this proposed route, though?) which includes a 1.6 mi tunnel that&#x27;s not even straight, so you can&#x27;t see the light at the end.<p>It&#x27;s amazing to me how each mode of travel has its own cadence. I&#x27;ve cycled along paths I&#x27;ve driven, and seen far more on the bike than in the car. And then I&#x27;ve run or walked the same path, and still seen more. It never feels like you&#x27;re &#x27;wasting time&#x27; when you&#x27;re going slower.<p>I will probably never through-hike the AT or PCT, but I&#x27;ve motorcycled from California to Alaska, and will probably make it a point to take a sabbatical some day in the future to bike tour cross country with my wife when this trail is near completion. We&#x27;ve never done any bikepacking, but can you think of a better reason to start?')
