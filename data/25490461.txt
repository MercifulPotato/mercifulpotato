Item(by='johnsimer', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608505594, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25486869, text='&gt; The Peter Principle is wrong for the simple reason that executives aren’t that stupid, and because there isn’t that much room in an upward-narrowing pyramid. They know what it takes for a promotion candidate to perform at the to level. So if they are promoting people beyond their competence anyway, under conditions of opportunity scarcity, there must be a good reason.<p>^ His argument assumes there is opportunity scarcity. IMO there is opportunity abundance. A well functioning company does not have an &quot;upward-narrowing pyramid&quot; practically speaking, because the pyramid is growing, ostensibly because each team is helping each other grow the company, increasing opportunity for all.<p>Arguably opportunity scarcity could exist in a Gervaisian sense if you are part of a company being disrupted (e.g. being a paper company in the digital age).')
