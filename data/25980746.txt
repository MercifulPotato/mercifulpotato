It is not because of volatility of the price movement, but volatility of whether the trade will clear.<p>The reason the trade might not clear is because of hedge funds or market makers that might go bankrupt, and not have the capital to pay for the shorts that they need to buy back. The collateral is there so that if the hedge fund can&#x27;t pay, the clearing house or broker must pay. What seems to have happened is somewhere along the line a broker did not margin call the hedge funds fast enough, and DTCC with their collateral requirements has spread the risk from that one broker or clearing house to all of the brokers. In essence, the hedge funds losses are in a way &quot;too big to fail&quot; now because of the way the risk was spread.<p>In this system, everyone is working to protect themselves (thus not conspiracy), which in turn happens to be screwing over retail. The big issue is the broker somewhere or risk management team that did not force the short sellers to buy back their shares when it was still possible to do so without affecting the brokerages. They missed the time and now the losses might be too large to absorb.<p>Meanwhile, they have no problem margin calling retail. Robinhood might be faced with an impossible situation they didn&#x27;t cause, but they also aren&#x27;t pointing the finger at the culprits and where the problem started, which is some entity allowing the hedge funds to be over leveraged and then not de-risking from that leverage fast enough when the trade went against them.<p>A lot of this is explained by the webull ceo in this video: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4RS4JIEVyXM&amp;feature=youtu.be" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4RS4JIEVyXM&amp;feature=youtu.be</a>')
