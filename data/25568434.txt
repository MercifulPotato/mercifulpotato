Item(by='Dylan16807', descendants=None, kids=[25568528], score=None, time=1609236928, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25568220, text='&gt; LTO-9 should be hitting the market very soon and supports up to 45TB per tape (compressed capacity, 18TB raw).<p>LTO is cool and all but is the &quot;compressed capacity&quot; number really something to repeat with a straight face?  The tape holds 18TB, we don&#x27;t need to pretend it&#x27;s anything else.<p>&gt; But certainly tape has continued to progress much faster than most people would have imagined.<p>Mostly it has.  But I&#x27;m somewhat worried about the future after the sudden late-game announcement that LTO-9 would have a 50% capacity improvement instead of the usual doubling.')
