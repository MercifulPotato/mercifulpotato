Come on now.<p>&gt;  I have nothing to prove to them, unlike you.<p>Says the person who just yelled <i>&#x27;I have first hand experience&#x27;</i> and then immediately bails out when challenged to apply <i>said</i> experience after &#x27;daring&#x27; someone to create another competing open source messaging app using Erlang for free. Ha.<p>Sounds like it would have just been better to not even mention you have said <i>&#x27;experience&#x27;</i> after all.')
