That&#x27;s even a feature ; for instance when an emergency evacuation happens (e.g. fire alarm), the system can tell you if there&#x27;s still someone in there (assuming the fire has not destroyed parts of the system).<p>Although one should assume nowadays that a public network is the same thing as a public street, and that using the LAN of a school is the same thing as walking on its campus, it is indeed disturbing that some people within those org (and the org itself) have some of the possibilities as police has - except that police would need a judge and a mandate in some cases.<p>So as always there are pros and cons. Good uses and evil uses. In Europe, GDPR laws mandate that not every admin or user of the system have access to this type of data, and that&#x27;s a good start IMO.')
