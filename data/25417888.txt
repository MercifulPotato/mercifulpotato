One one hand, I use ublock origin and privacy badger but on the other hand, last year facebook suggested I join a group for progressive asian christians. (I am not asian or religious) and although I&#x27;ve had an Amazon account for years, their recommendations to me are still terrible (I have turned off adblocking on facebook and amazon because I&#x27;ve ran into issues using them with it enables so I just gave in). So all the data they have on me doesn&#x27;t seem to have done them much good.')
