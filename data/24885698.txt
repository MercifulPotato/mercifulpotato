I&#x27;ve been using Wayland for a few months now (wayfire which I switched to from bspwm) and overall it&#x27;s seemed like a huge improvement in terms of smoothness and I have yet to run into any issues. Input seems to work fine even with things like multitouch gestures. I&#x27;ve never tried remoting into my machine graphically but there seem to be working vnc servers for Wayland.')
