Especially in the U.S. and E.U., the media oligopoly has had enormous success in transforming (<i>cough</i> perverting) copyright into a mechanism that benefits the copyright holder to the detriment of anyone else.<p>But we see that copyright can also be an effective tool for protection of the arts and sciences; see copyleft. Here we have an ingenious way of turning copyright on it&#x27;s head, by protecting the rights of all involved parties. (Stallman might be a nutcase, but if that&#x27;s the case, he&#x27;s a genius nutcase.)<p>So I think it&#x27;s fair to have &#x27;longer&#x27; copyright periods. Longer than a year, I mean. The duration we have in patent law (~20 years) seems rather fair to me. Enough to turn (some) profit, not enough to rob four generations of the stories and characters that were an important part of their childhood&#x27;s culture.')
