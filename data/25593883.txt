This increases commute times, stress in employees, more wear and tear on roads, and of course increases staff costs (for those staff with valuable skills).  Yet cities don&#x27;t build houses, everyone seems to want them magically to be built in someone else&#x27;s city.<p>Another big contributor is ridiculous property taxes where two adjacent identical homes might pay 4x different rates because of when they bought the house.  Making it harder for cities to have predictable taxes and requires higher property taxes (but only for those that have bought recently), which makes home owners less mobile and the real estate market less efficient.  Just seems insane that when house prices spike (see problem #1) that cities are often on the verge of bankruptcy.')
