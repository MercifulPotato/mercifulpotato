What I mean by this is a specific type of DI that I view as effective and a type of meta-programming. Such a DI system does more than just auto-instantiate objects. It also provides a DSL that allows for configuration and ordering of the object instantiation during different phases of system execution.<p>fx doesn&#x27;t do that. It is primarily just a convenience way for tying things together in the single intended way. You can provide some configuration but it is not via a DSL; it is by making calls to the fx library.<p>Realistically to do the sort of DI I am referring to with Golang there would need to be a preprocessing step during compilation that generates Golang code.')
