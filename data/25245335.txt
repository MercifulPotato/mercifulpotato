Independent of the content of the video and who it happened to offend, the deceptive practice of shadow banning is reprehensible.<p>Tar-pitting spammers is one thing, deceiving creators, especially ones who are politically engaged as to the impact of their work discredits the legitimacy of the platforms, and the agencies. Are the government agencies &quot;persons,&quot; deserving protection in this case?<p>A major part of the problem is the language platforms use in their alerts, which is patronizing, gaslighting, and from what I have read in posts like these, basically enraging (which is what their business does best, so no surprises there).<p>If platforms would use language that made it clear they owned their role as referees it would go a lot more smoothly, and mitigate the effects of this &quot;for your own good,&quot; deception bit. Of course I see it as the effect of platform employees who culturally reject the idea of binding principles in favour of exercising arbitrary power, but if that&#x27;s not going to change, they can&#x27;t reasonably complain about explosive reactions to their &quot;dynamic choices&quot; either.')
