Case in point - the Neostoicism movement of the 16th century combining Stoic ethics with Christian theology. I think the main kernel of what&#x27;s attractive in Stoicism is quite easily compatible with different theologies (or none).<p>Sure, some core axioms traditionally did follow from their physics, but I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s reasonably easy to build a different foundation for those axioms.')
