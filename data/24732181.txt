Rationally, you would expect productivity gains to be captured disproportionately at the point where the gain occurs, on the assembly line, not back up through the hierarchy. But because of the rich-get-richer mathematics of capital, those gains tend to get sucked up to the wealthiest tier in the corporate structure.')
