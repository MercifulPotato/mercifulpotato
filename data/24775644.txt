This has both cut down on bikeshedding, and helped me save my energy and attention for things I care about.<p>Of course, this isn&#x27;t going to work for everyone. The way I thought of it was in terms of the Gervais principle[1], particularly this section:<p>&gt; The Losers like to feel good about their lives. They are the happiness seekers, rather than will-to-power players, and enter and exit reactively, in response to the meta-Darwinian trends in the economy. But they have no more loyalty to the firm than the Sociopaths. They do have a loyalty to individual people, and a commitment to finding fulfillment through work when they can, and coasting when they cannot.<p>Feels odd to admit you&#x27;re a loser, but hey, it works for me.<p>1: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ribbonfarm.com&#x2F;2009&#x2F;10&#x2F;07&#x2F;the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ribbonfarm.com&#x2F;2009&#x2F;10&#x2F;07&#x2F;the-gervais-principle-...</a>')
