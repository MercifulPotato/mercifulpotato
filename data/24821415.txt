Spacetime is nearly flat, so how can a straight line become such a steep parabola?&quot;<p>I&#x27;ll answer this question as I understand it, but I only took four lectures of General Relativity before I gave it up in favour of computability and logic, so if there is a more intuitive and&#x2F;or less wrong answer out there, please correct me.<p>Intuitive answer: the curve is indeed very gentle, and (e.g.) light will be deflected only very slightly by the curvature; but the ball is moving for a couple of seconds, and that&#x27;s an <i>eternity</i>. On human scales, the time dimension is much &quot;bigger&quot; than the space dimensions (we&#x27;re quite big in the time dimension and quite small in the spatial dimensions); the ball moves only a small distance through space but a very large distance through time, amounting to a big distance in spacetime, and so the slight curvature has a bigger effect than you might expect.')
