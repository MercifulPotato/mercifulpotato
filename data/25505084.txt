PEG is used all over the place: taken internally in several OTC laxatives, applied externally in cosmetics and personal lubricant, vaporized and inhaled in electronic cigarettes, and as a solvent in many industrial processes. If PEG allergies were a serious concern, it would have risen about the noise floor a long time ago since it causes an acute reaction.<p>It&#x27;s definitely not worth stopping clinical trials for <i>five total</i> confirmed cases in the medical literature, especially if those trials target a global emergency like COVID. For comparison: you&#x27;d get at least five confirmed cases of peanut allergies just by spraying down a single decent sized elementary school with peanut dust.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S2213219820310072" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencedirect.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;article&#x2F;pii&#x2F;S221321982...</a>')
