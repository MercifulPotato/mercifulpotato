So, if the person who is concerned about technical debt is senior enough they will have some ability to see the business tradeoff and thus can completely avoid the phrase. They&#x27;d say instead something like &quot;I was thinking that if we changed X we would get value Y.&quot;<p>A person who uses the phrase Technical Debt is signaling that they aren&#x27;t capable of saying something that direct.<p>That&#x27;s one issue.<p>And then the other issue is that a huge amount of technical debt is just code that a more senior engineer would refactor as they went. It&#x27;s a junior engineer who says, &quot;this is a huge mess and I need a full stop of my contributions to the business so that I can focus on untangling it.&quot;<p>But the problem with junior engineers doing refactoring&#x2F;rewriting is that they end up creating a different mess of code and bugs.<p>Am I right 100% of the time about this? No. But I&#x27;d love to raise for engineers here that although the phrase technical debt caries a lot of emotional weight, it also brings a lot of baggage from all the times management has heard the phrase from someone that didn&#x27;t understand the bigger picture. With a little bit of work you could understand the business implications and then end up completely avoiding the use of the phrase.')
