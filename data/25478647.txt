Item(by='threepio', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608396377, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25472641, text='I have bought Apple refurbished machines. I always understood them to be more-or-less unused returns. IIRC Apple cannot legally advertise returned machines as &quot;new&quot;, hence the &quot;refurbished&quot; designation.<p>Moreover Apple has an essentially unlimited supply of machines. I can&#x27;t imagine it would be worth it to actually take in machines and repair them (not least because it would undermine confidence in the refurb store if it was a gamble about whether you&#x27;d get a basically-new machine or beat-up machine.)')
