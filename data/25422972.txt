You misconfigure the onprem software, making it more insecure than the alternatives. This does not occur with SaaS products.<p>2. The software delivery system is tampered with, and you download and run malicious code on your systems with high privileges. If you don&#x27;t run it, this can&#x27;t happen.<p>Cloud deployments aren&#x27;t obviously safer, but they have clear advantages unless you are willing to pay top people to work on and secure each onprem deployment full-time.<p>NB: I don&#x27;t actually believe &quot;the cloud&quot; is fundamentally more or less secure than onprem deployments.\nRather, I frequently hear people argue that a website being hacked - or the potential for it - justifies a movement to onprem, and I think this is (usually) false.')
