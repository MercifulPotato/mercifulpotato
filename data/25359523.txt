The devices are black boxes of mystery, possibly likely to fail nearly simultaneously (at least in terms of being unable to write). Early on we left 20% if capacity unformatted to allow more wear leveling, but running them in RAID1 seemed both necessary and likely to cause synchronous errors. RAIDZ1 over three disks might be okay. Obviously huge R&#x2F;W bandwidth so resilvering doesn&#x27;t take long.<p>Also, it isn&#x27;t mentioned, but having the ZIL on battery backed flash can give huge improvements in IOPS to anything, and is far more valuable than extra TB or spindles.')
