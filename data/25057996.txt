Oh and it&#x27;s soldered so you have to buy the beefed up version today, cannot upgrade the RAM 6 months from now.<p>Go look at a non-techie webbrowsing habits alone: they have 50 tabs open in chrome, some of which are months old. And they install all sorts of other crappy software, anti-virus, browser extensions. Some of them use Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer at the same time. And&#x2F;Or if they use Slack&#x2F;Steam&#x2F;Spotify&#x2F;VS Code&#x2F;etc they are running another 300MB RAM per app.<p>If you are a programmer, try all that, with Visual Studio or Eclipse running, sometimes at the same time as Android Studio with an emulator running, maybe with a local postgres or sql server etc... it easily eats up that 16Gb. Oh lets sprinkle some docker&#x2F;vagrant ontop..<p>Good luck if you are into video&#x2F;image editing, 3d modeling, illustrating, CAD etc... then MacBook Pro&#x27;s are basically the wrong tool for the job today, where it became <i>very</i> famous for being the right tool for the job in ~2010.<p>Same problem with Intel CPU&#x27;s...they&#x27;ve been riding the wave of success of their initial chip redesign for 10 years and now AMD seems to be wrecking them every 6 months.<p>My problem with the RAM situation is that we&#x27;ve been paying ~$100 for 16GB for 5 years now.. instead of getting scale up to ~$100 to 64GB and down to ~$25 for a 16GB dim. The RAM companies riding the wave too at the moment. Luckily SSD&#x27;s forced HDD manufacturers to up their game else we would&#x27;ve still paid ~$200 for 500GB hdd with 8mb cache, so now we at least have 10TB+ drives avail for consumers.')
