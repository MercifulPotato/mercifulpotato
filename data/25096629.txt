I&#x27;m getting a deja vu.<p>This all started when I bought a bunch of Apple stock around $2 and for the past 20 years I&#x27;ve been trying to make that play again. I guess I&#x27;ll have to admit this position in GE is similarly worthless.<p>I gotta stop making these gambles of faith, Intel has ceded nearly everything and is defending their remaining kingdom poorly. Unless there&#x27;s a major overhaul, things aren&#x27;t looking good.<p>They&#x27;ve also been bleeding talent for years. I need to stop second guessing what I find obvious. Nvidia, Arm and AMD have already stormed the castle and have been pillaging the kingdom for years now. Once you see companies like TI and Marvell start to take significant pieces away then you&#x27;ll know they&#x27;re done for it.')
