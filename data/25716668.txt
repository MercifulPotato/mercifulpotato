The error stayed on the login screen no matter what I tried, and it did not offer any debug info or help, and I just couldn&#x27;t get past it.<p>I&#x27;ve been developing software for 20 years so I know something about buggy software and different stages of completeness so I usually give open source projects more slack but after 30 minutes I just gave up and uninstalled the app.<p>I really hope these kind of projects get more funding and wind behind them to get a bit more mature so there would be serious alternatives for the likes of Whatsapp.')
