Assign identifiers once and bobâ€™s your uncle, if you want to surveil economic activity.<p>That seems a lot more useful if people were using it like a bank account. Once you figure out that a given address belongs to Alice, if that address starts paying for hotels and cloud services, now you know what Alice is up to.<p>But anybody who would be <i>interesting</i> to surveil would know not to do that. So you get an address that keeps receiving transfers and then sending it to an unregulated foreign exchange because they&#x27;re using the cryptocurrency to buy their local currency. From there the cryptocurrency goes into the hands of various uninteresting randos with no connection to the original party.')
