That&#x27;s basically been Trump&#x27;s exact MO since forever; any real story concerning him just gets instantly dismissed. &quot;It&#x27;s locker room talk&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s fake news&quot;, etc. Trump and his White House have held far fewer press conferences than past presidents. And at his press conferences, he refuses many questions and dismisses others with either non-answers or just his typical bullshit salesman-speak.<p>I do think this is probably the &quot;Trumpiest&quot; Biden has acted so far, but I think I&#x27;d probably do the same thing if I were in his position, honestly. At least until the election is over. It&#x27;s politics. He doesn&#x27;t want to throw too much gasoline on the fire. It&#x27;s just the media&#x27;s and Twitter&#x27;s behavior that I just mind-boggling and gross, and the irrational way so much of the left is treating it.')
