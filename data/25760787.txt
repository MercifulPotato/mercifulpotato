Donald Trump has ample opportunities to communicate his message. What he no longer has is his preferred communication method.<p>He is not entitled to use his preferred communication method because he’s abused it to to the degree that he’s created reputational risks for the platforms that carry it. That’s on him and his message.<p>I’m under no delusion that these platforms are acting nobly. I think they’re acting in shareholder’s interests by moving to mitigate a risk to themselves.<p>The fact of the matter is that Trump enjoyed tremendous leeway to violate the TOS of the platforms because of his position. Anyone else can and has been turfed out for much less than what he did.')
