Higher energy efficiency is just a competition among miners. Less efficient ones have to stop mining.<p>If anything that is contributing more to energy waste because you have to periodically replace old miners and not every miner managed to break even on their less efficient hardware by the time the latest hardware became available. It&#x27;s probably less significant over the long term though because eventually there is a limit to how efficient bitcoin miners can be.')
