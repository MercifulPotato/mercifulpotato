There are some particularly egregious examples such as cheap LCD replacements for OLED iPhone displays. Someone getting their iPhone fixed or buying one from the secondary market would likely be quite unhappy to end up with such a display on their expensive phone.<p>It would be nice if Apple made genuine replacement parts more generally available, but that&#x27;s kind of an orthogonal issue - a shady repair shop might still go with the aftermarket LCD for $40 rather than the genuine replacement for $100.')
