First, they create another bubble based on their perception of me. Second, their personalization is so poor I sometimes wonder how come advertisers believe them.<p>And this is all assuming you actually <i>want</i> to see ads. I don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s only when I need to buy something I enter the buying mode: I disable adblockers and start doing research - this is the only small window when ads are allowed to bother me.')
