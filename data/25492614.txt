We have the technology, and we have the ability.<p>And you miss my point too. I keep reading &quot;we&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;we&quot; in replies here, but who&#x27;s that &quot;we&quot;? I for one this year was able to produce following food: a few stems of mint, and 5 centimeter diameter watermelon on my balcony.<p>So let me tell you - &quot;they&quot; are able to produce food. &quot;They&quot; have technology and ability. And that&#x27;s exactly what people keep saying here: They should collect our garbage. They should turn cities into more suitable for automated vehicles. They should automate agriculture. For I don&#x27;t see a great desire among participants here to grow their own potato crop (automated or not).<p>But what if they decided that we want too much from them? What if they decided it would be &quot;easier&quot; or maybe even &quot;better&quot; to just kill us?<p>&gt; This reminds me a bit of members of the House of Commons wondering if the poor would become too lazy if we decrease the working day from 16 hours to a mere eight.<p>And they did become too lazy, ain&#x27;t it? At least they don&#x27;t die like flies (smells bad) and don&#x27;t run revolts that often.')
