However I don&#x27;t mind at all. Not having to commute more than makes up for it.<p>In fact, if I&#x27;d be allowed to work remotely, I&#x27;d gladly work extra hours. I see that as a win-win. I don&#x27;t have to waste time and energy commuting. I arrive at the office already exhausted. That wasted time and energy can benefit my employer if I spend it on working - not just in time, but in efficiency too.')
