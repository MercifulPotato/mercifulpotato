People there still buy a lot, even at expensive prices.<p>2. I have never seen so much heavy consumption and problems in Southern Europe than what I saw living in Finland.<p>3. I had never seen people brewing their own wine in their flat in my country (not counting real wine in farms when I was a kid, of course). Youngsters wouldn&#x27;t even use berries like their elders, but just sugar &amp; yeast (bearing the suiting name of &#x27;kilju&#x27;).<p>4. You could sometimes illicitly buy moonshine alcohol from a car trunk on a car park, in plastic water bottles. Classy.<p>5. Anecdote: I remember vodka was smuggled from Russia in timber lorries (trunks were hollowed out and filled with bottles) :-D')
