As others have mentioned, don&#x27;t use it.<p>I tried that. After years of not using FB at all, I missed out on some important news that was only posted there.<p>I decided to get back on FB, <i>on my own terms</i>. I created Bubble [1] and now I can visit FB with most tracking disabled, no ads, I only see posts from my friends, and even then only posts that do not link to news websites or contain political keywords.<p>My signal&#x2F;noise ratio is usually about 50%. I love my clean feed. Works on LinkedIn, Twitter, others.<p>But the root problem goes deeper -- clearly not everyone <i>cares</i> or has the motivation to filter their own social media feeds. Some people <i>like</i> reading echo-chamber&#x2F;fake news posts, truth is far down on their list of priorities.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the big-picture answer is.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getbubblenow.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getbubblenow.com</a> (currently in beta)')
