If so, why not spin up a website on that subject?<p>Django is pretty easy to learn. Model view Etc in Python instead of Ruby. Not rocket science.<p>Building something you care about will force you to dig into the details and become enough of an expert in a few weeks to get in the door somewhere where your skills will be appreciated.<p>That probably won&#x27;t be Facebook, Google, or the next Silicon Valley unicorn.
