So if I look at these docs[0], this tool, not only does it do translate&#x2F;rotate&#x2F;scale, which are the most fundamental image transformations in 2D editing, but it also does shearing and perspective transformations which are rarely used by comparison.  This tool was clearly designed from an implementation-driven perspective (just put all the affine transformations in one place) rather than a UX driven perspective (no designer places these tools together conceptually).<p>On top of that, this tool still sits along side other single purpose tools for scaling and rotating, which are the first results if you search &quot;how to rotate in GIMP&quot;, so why should I even expect this tool to exist?<p>This is not intuitive UX which is &quot;trivially different&quot; to PS, this is a mess which can only be learned through laborious trial and error, or reading the documentation like a book.<p>[0]:<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.gimp.org&#x2F;2.10&#x2F;en&#x2F;gimp-tool-unified-transform.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.gimp.org&#x2F;2.10&#x2F;en&#x2F;gimp-tool-unified-transform.ht...</a>')
