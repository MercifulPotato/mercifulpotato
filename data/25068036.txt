Tens of thousands of songs, 500gb hard drive entirely filled with music. It had everything and I downloaded every new thing that looked remotely interesting.<p>It was wonderful until that hard drive failed. I didn&#x27;t have a backup (because of course I didn&#x27;t, that hard drive was expensive and the cloud didn&#x27;t exist). After that, I never did amass another massive collection of music like that.<p>So in a sense, yes, I kind of do now treat most media as ephemeral and don&#x27;t place too much value on maintaining copies of them. There&#x27;s always interesting music to listen to and books to read and video games to play. Having a physical or digital copy of it hoarded away in a hard disk locally simply isn&#x27;t that important to me.')
