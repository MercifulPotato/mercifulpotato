What exceptions to that general prohibition exist is a topic of great controversy, and different countries take different positions.<p>Exceptions for commercial cases–when a foreign government directly engages in international trade or commerce–are widely accepted. This case falls into that category, so Canada was not being particularly exceptional in allowing it.<p>Exceptions for human rights abuses, torture, terrorism, etc, are much more controversial. The US legal system is actually a bit of an outlier here (albeit not uniquely one) in being willing to entertain lawsuits against foreign governments on the later bases when most legal systems will not permit them.')
