The place I worked was in a HCOL city, but nowhere close to SF. Our general rule was that items should sell for about 4x the cost of ingredients to cover all overhead.<p>I&#x27;m a salaried employ with no expectation of overtime, so my opportunity cost to cook for myself is essentially $0&#x2F;hr, but even if I factor in a fairly reasonable $15&#x2F;hr for my own labor, I&#x27;m still easily under 4x raw input cost for most dishes, which makes sense since I don&#x27;t have to pay (or already pay regardless) other overheads like rent, taxes and FOH staff.')
