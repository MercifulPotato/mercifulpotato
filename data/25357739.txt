Or about how the US car industry is a cartel and we need new innovators to break into the industry?<p>Its easy to call them luxury cars <i>now</i>, in hindsight, now that Elon Musk started the tech revolution that brought us full electric cars and a disrupted auto industry.<p>That&#x27;s not to point out that &quot;a payment processing website&quot; made the lives of millions of people easier, as will global wireless high speed internet and cheap, civilian access to space.<p>I think you have an axe to grind, and it is clouding your ability to think rationally. There&#x27;s a rule on this site that you&#x27;re supposed to add to the discussion. I kindly request that you follow it.')
