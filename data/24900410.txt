The current censorship at hand is a mainstream news outlet being blocked from releasing a damaging political story less than 2 weeks before the election. This is banana republic-type corruption.<p>Secondly, Twitter primarily serves content to those people who want it. It&#x27;s what their algorithms are trained to do. The argument that the New York Post&#x27;s article is disturbing and thus should be removed is easily used to justify any amount of authoritarian social manipulation. After all, everyone&#x27;s actions eventually affect me, so I should be able to control all aspects of how they think, right?')
