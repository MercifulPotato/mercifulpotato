The one I took didn&#x27;t cover much on the actual writing of proofs.  The professor accepted reasonable essays with high-school level notation.  Instead, he gave us a toolbox for proving things: pairing terms in a series to find the sum, rewriting recursive equations, etc.  It was mostly to show that clever tricks are how mathematicians prove new things.  But that might&#x27;ve been because the professor was a guy who reveled in clever solutions.')
