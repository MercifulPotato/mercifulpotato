It is pumped to surface, power generated, then injected back into the earth at a sufficient distance, so that by the time it flows back to the extraction well it will have been re-heated to the original temperature.<p>So no, the subsurface will not cool over time (except with some crackpot &quot;technologies&quot; like one mentioned towards the end of the article that rhymes with &quot;never&quot;). It&#x27;s actually harnessing the radiation of the earth&#x27;s geology.<p>There are some places where power is extracted faster than the geology can support. In those cases electrical generation tapers off. This is happening in Turkey for example. But it&#x27;s because of greed, not because of anything inherent in the technology.')
