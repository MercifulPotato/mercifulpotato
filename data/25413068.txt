Is peer discovery different, or did hyperdrive change...or...?<p>(I am very confused about dat&#x2F;hyper efforts, as I&#x27;ve been following it a bit over the last year)<p>I&#x27;ve seen that beaker changed to hypercore&#x2F;hyperdrive...so my current assumption is that the hyper protocol is the web browser effort, rather than the other parts of infrastructure.<p>Are there incompatibilities in both protocols, or is hypercore trying to refactor its codebase in order to say, remove legacy dependencies that might not be necessary anymore?')
