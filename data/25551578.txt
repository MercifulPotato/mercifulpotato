However, no one in my social circles has kids in their 20s and barely anyone is married by 30 so we also may have been socially isolated if we had chosen to do that.<p>But I try to think back to what I did in my 25 to 30 range that I thought was worth delaying starting a family and I canâ€™t come up with anything, other than being a little bit further ahead in the rat race.  But all the other rats are thinking the same thing, so who is really benefiting?')
