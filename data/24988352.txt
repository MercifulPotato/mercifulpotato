I&#x27;ve read about the use of autorotation but only in the case of emergencies. I had no idea there were entire aircraft based around the concept.<p>Since the rotary wings are unpowered, the autogyro loses many of the properties that make the helicopter so valuable. It requires forward motion in order to move air through the unpowered rotary wings and maintain lift. Looks like they have propellers providing forward thrust just like fixed wing aircraft. The article also states that they&#x27;re not capable of vertical take off and landing. They need a runway to accelerate just like fixed wing aircraft.')
