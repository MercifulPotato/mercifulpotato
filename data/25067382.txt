My player is Winamp and it still works just fine after all these years.<p>If someone want&#x27;s to talk to me I just press ctrl+shift+E to pause, don&#x27;t need to find a window on the computer. Tired of the song playing? Press ctrl+shift+b for next song in whatever program&#x2F;game I&#x27;m in at the moment.
