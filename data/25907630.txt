Thankfully China does not allow them to operate there. It gives us some hope that new players will form and become competitive with the likes of evil corps like Google and Facebook. They are only beholden to their stock holders.<p>Google and Facebook destroy competitors. And make sure new entrants cannot gain traction. They are about as anti-competitive as they can be.<p>Tech was still very new back then. New tech should hopefully displace them but odds are they will just get their hands on the new tech or buy it out before new players gain traction.')
