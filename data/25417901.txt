I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more about speaking the same language as your audience.<p>Part of the issue is (for example): Do most people care about how many cores there are? That speaks to your point about benefits vs features.<p>But the other issue is: Do most people know what a core is?<p>This is often referred to as dumbing things down, but that&#x27;s pretty condescending. The person you&#x27;re &quot;dumbing things down&quot; for may be a chief surgeon at a major hospital, someone who is probably smarter and more accomplished than most of us. They just might not care to spend their mental energy on understanding computer technology, in much the same way that I don&#x27;t much care to understand biology or medicine.<p>So when I say it&#x27;s about &quot;speaking the same language as your audience&quot;, I mean speaking in terms that relate to what&#x27;s important to them. If you&#x27;re selling to a mass audience, you have to speak in such a way that doesn&#x27;t assume any expertise or interest in technology. You have to give them a reason to care.<p>Most people don&#x27;t care about the thermal performance of their laptop. But they can probably relate to being annoyed by how loud the fan gets or how hot the machine gets on their lap. They can relate to having the battery die, waiting for apps to load, closing apps because the machine can&#x27;t handle having so many things open, etc.<p>But you also have to provide justification for those benefits. It&#x27;s not enough to say &quot;it&#x27;s quiet&quot; or &quot;never gets hot&quot;, because for a sizeable portion of your audience, they need to understand WHY it&#x27;s quiet. Which means you still need to talk about the features.<p>All of which is to say that a better axiom than &quot;sell the benefits, not the features&quot;, in my arrogant opinion, is &quot;Meet people where they&#x27;re at.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s what makes good copywriting so hard. You have to write in such a way that meets your audience where they&#x27;re at, without actually knowing where they&#x27;re at, and without being so simplistic that you insult their intelligence.')
