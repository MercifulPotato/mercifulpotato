By that metric, literally every single complex online service in existence is rotten. Given how rare those outages are, and how they are all not happening at the same time across different brokerages, I wager to say it is normal with nothing nefarious going on. Unless you expect a complex online service to have zero downtime ever, which is just unrealistic.')
