In fact, some applications (also proved correct by Ziv) use the compressed datastream statistics to estimate source entropy, because it&#x27;s much easier to implement than any direct measurement.<p>Both Ziv and Lempel did a lot of other things; However, Lempel did more in the area of switching systems and his other contributions are numerous and interesting, but were less profound in any specific field -- Whereas Ziv&#x27;s contribution to Information Theory through the last 60 years or so has been much more profound.')
