Item(by='1000units', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608619655, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25502647, text='If you&#x27;re such a champion of insurance companies, there are literally hundreds of personal injury attorneys (read: serial fraudsters) and their pet &quot;doctors&quot; who deserve to be sentenced to lifetimes of forced labor before Shkreli deserves to serve a <i>second</i> in prison (for securities fraud, btw). Where&#x27;s the passion against ambulance chasers? Not enough bloggers writing hit pieces on 2nd rate bug-souled parasites? Why not? Why&#x27;s the gifted Brooklyn immigrant from a war-torn country you&#x27;ve never heard of get all the heat?<p>Because these scams have been going on forever. They&#x27;re built into the system by the parasitizers whom it protects. It&#x27;s &quot;the way things work&quot;. If you catch onto the grift, if you even come close to it as an outsider, that&#x27;s when they start making trouble for you. That&#x27;s what happened with Shkreli. Send him to prison on some unrelated charge, drag him through the mud, then celebrate the defeat of your &quot;villain&quot;. And totally miss the point. You changed nothing. You took out a scapegoat for people who are effectively real life caricatures of the imaginary villain they built up for you to strike down. You don&#x27;t have a problem with Shkreli, you have a problem with our clown-world healthcare system. The real world doesn&#x27;t run on warm sentiments you for whatever reason don&#x27;t associate with Shkreli&#x27;s face. It runs on THE RULE OF LAW, and you haven&#x27;t even <i>engaged</i> it except in some contorted vengeful fashion against a wholly lawful (and might I say lofty-spirited) young man. Shkreli should be living free right now, and your complaints should be directed to your legislator.')
