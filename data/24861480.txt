That&#x27;s one of the reasons I ended up with the HS70, as it is wireless without being too expensive, more mid-range. A lot of the other recommended wireless ones I&#x27;ve seen, like the SteelSeries Arctis, are mostly on the more expensive side. Not sure how they stack up on the listening quality, but for that money I&#x27;d be looking at the higher end headphones (non gamer headsets) anyway.')
