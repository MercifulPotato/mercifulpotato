I think one interesting point from the article is that CVS is from the 80s, SVN from the 90s, and git from the 2000s.<p>The past decade had no major VCS show up, but rather was characterized by the success story of git replacing everything else. Gcc&#x27;s and LLVM&#x27;s migration to git isn&#x27;t that far in the past at all. So I wonder, as the last decade lacked a major leap in VCS technology, can VCS be considered a solved problem now?<p>I recently read on hn a comment saying that Linux will be the last OS. Is git the last VCS?')
