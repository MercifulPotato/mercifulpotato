Humans are the direct causal link.<p>There isn&#x27;t going to be some single silver bullet explaining everything further than that, it is an ecosystem collapse.<p>Humans impact everything in small ways, these in turn impact everything else in its network.<p>Sometimes positively but more usually negatively via various strains.<p>It&#x27;s not always pollution, sometimes it&#x27;s disease, sometimes it&#x27;s habitat sometimes it&#x27;s climate, sometimes food chain, sometimes it&#x27;s noise pollution, sometimes it&#x27;s even more complicated than that for example you might knock out a predator but then create more disease or remove an ecological pressure that kept a species behaviour in line with its environment.')
