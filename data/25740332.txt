E2EE in particular relies on application-level crypto, and any password manager or &quot;secret server&quot; that relies <i>only</i> on TLS is highly suspect, in my opinion.<p>I attended a talk at QCon SF 2019 where the speaker advocated use of application-level encryption (even in web apps) by default as a form of defense-in-depth. I was skeptical, especially since client code itself has to be delivered using TLS only (and thus a successful TLS attack renders further defenses worthless).<p>But it does seem that application-level crypto allows a lot of networked devices (besides the application servers themselves) to be rendered zero-knowledge concerning most application and user data. This allows us to trust those devices <i>less</i>.')
