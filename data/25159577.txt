The problem with early-stage high risk investments is that investors take a lot of assumptions from the public markets and project them on to private markets where the same rules don&#x27;t apply.<p>I have seen many very wealthy investors lose a lot of money on private investments because they haven&#x27;t understood their share rights relative to other investors. These companies often need to raise further capital at pretty low valuations so they end up being significantly diluted.<p>However the most important thing is that wealthy investors can afford these losses, other investors much less so. Only after building up significant pension savings and owning a home would I ever advise someone to invest in a higher risk opportunity.')
