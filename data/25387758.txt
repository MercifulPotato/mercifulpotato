It misses the trees for the forest (personal vs tribal).  To me, it feels like being at a party where I only know a handful of people and I have to shout to communicate with the people I do know.  But, technology can connect people with shared interests and activities and facilitate one-on-one communication.  People who are into baseball cards or bird watching can find each other.
