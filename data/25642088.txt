If an user randomly jumps between two map cells you know they live at the boundary. Generally there is often noise in GPS signals so it&#x27;s likely that person will jump around.<p>Furthermore, if a person uses multiple services, and each service has its own cell layout, you can check all services a user is member of and then find the intersection. Ideally services would standardize to one single cell layout. So Apple&#x27;s idea of doing this cell partitioning at the OS level is really good.<p>I think the boundary concern can be resolved by some inertia system, so a person doesn&#x27;t switch cells unless they are deeply enough in the new cell, at which point they won&#x27;t switch back unless they have moved back deeply enough.')
