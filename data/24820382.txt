The author asserts that choosing the right server is essential to your experience of Mastadon, is that not the case?<p>Also the author says that I should choose a community between 500 and 5000 people, which fosstodon exceeds.<p>All in all, my point is, there are so many choices and decisions to make <i>before</i> I can even create an account and experience it.<p>It’s fairly common knowledge that people actually don’t like choice. When you go to a restaurant and see a menu with 100 choices, people actually enjoy their meal less than when there would be little choice; they have this nagging feeling of “was that other choice perhaps better?”<p>For me, Mastadon has the same problem.
