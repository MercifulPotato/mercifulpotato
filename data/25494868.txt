Companies go public to drink at the capitalisation trough of public markets, but the cost is regulation and increased transparency. Companies that stay private are rarely bound by significant rules in terms of board or management decisions redefining structure, equity, terms and so forth. There are <i>at least</i> four key firewalls (exercise, issue, share class, transfer) between &quot;options&quot; as issued or promised and meaningful equity value extraction for an employee. Good lawyers can probably name five more, and definitely dream up or deploy tens more at any time without breaking laws.')
