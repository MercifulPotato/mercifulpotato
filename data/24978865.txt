Item(by='disgruntledphd2', descendants=None, kids=[24979310, 24979972], score=None, time=1604405168, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24967369, text='OK, so I didn&#x27;t look at every trial (as I do have a job), but I examined two of the studies for pre-exposure (for which most of the studies appear to be about).<p>The first one I looked at Arleo, hasn&#x27;t been published, which is pretty concerning given that any CV paper with any kind of insight is getting published right now.<p>The second (chosen by sample(1:31, 1) from the 31 papers) was this one: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;academic.oup.com&#x2F;cid&#x2F;advance-article&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1093&#x2F;cid&#x2F;ciaa1571&#x2F;5929230" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;academic.oup.com&#x2F;cid&#x2F;advance-article&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1093&#x2F;cid...</a> which shows no significant effect of HCQ in a really large trial.<p>Note that this trial actually seems pretty well run as it&#x27;s an RCT with a large sample size. I find it difficult to believe that if there&#x27;s a non-significant result here then NCQ is effective in pre-exposure terms.<p>Additionally, there are standards for meta-analyses and systematic reviews, and the  hcqmeta.com link doesn&#x27;t mention them, which is very concerning (and lowers my prior that these results are correct).<p>Like actually, given that there&#x27;s no search strategy for papers (making it impossible for anyone to check if they are actually including all papers, or just a biased sampling), I am gonna again reduce my prior on HCQ being correct.<p>Just as a final note, the likelihood of doctors not using the best available treatment during a global pandemic is <i>incredibly</i> low, and you do a disservice to medical professionals by suggesting that this is the case.')
