While trying to get it unlocked, I faced one of the worst experiences with Amazon customer team. I even reached to Jeff&#x27;s email, but no reply. Finally, I have to file an official complaint in the consumer court to get my account unlock. All of these event took around 14-15 days. During these days, I was suddenly unable to use my Echo, Prime video, Kindle books, readwise, and prime now services. I never really tried any other competitor service before, and was solely reliant on Amazon&#x27;s offering. That time I realized the amount of power such single sign-in yielded. I can only imagine what happens when you use it for every service via a third party and use it daily, only to suddenly see it lock you out. I hope there&#x27;s a better way to login in the future, maybe something like trusona or magic<p>PS: I did not do anything wrong but still suffered lot of psychological pain due to this mistake by Amazon&#x27;s internal security.')
