I think the activity + music combo does drain the battery quite a bit, but it’ll still get through the rest of the day. Pretty low bar I know.. I have thought about using it for sleep tracking and just charging it in the morning because it definitely doesn’t need a whole night to charge. But yea, battery is definitely a weakness of Apple Watch.')
