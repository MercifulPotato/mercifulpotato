A Mars base is like that, but it needs <i>flying to Mars</i> and landing from orbit and constructing in a spacesuit with almost no local materials and no supply chain and few people, and you can&#x27;t come back when the dust settles, and that makes it orders of magnitude more expensive and difficult.<p>&gt; The risk of staying on a single planet is crazy.<p>Unless you plan to clone yourself, you are staying on a single planet whatever happens. \nIf you think disaster is coming any time soon, you&#x27;d save more people trying to avert or survive it on Earth. To prioritise saving a, what, 50 person research base on Mars that doesn&#x27;t exist yet over billions of people who exist right now on Earth by spending your resources on a research base on Mars instead of an asteroid detection and diversion system for Earth is crazy.<p>If your priority was saving the most people, Mars wouldn&#x27;t be on the list. Orbital space stations are closer. The Moon is closer. Under-ocean habitats are closer. Underground habitats are closer. Self-contained arcologies are closer. (Wearing a mask is closer).')
