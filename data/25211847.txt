Sure, perhaps most people will only remember him as a great footballer without talking about the wrong actions he has done during his life, but a) most of them wouldn&#x27;t have cared anyway and b) one can still see both sides of the coin and admit one&#x27;s wrongdoing despite one&#x27;s good performance or results.<p>I&#x27;m far from being a connoisseur about football and sports in general though, so I don&#x27;t exactly know what this guy has done, but this can be applied to any man on this Earth.')
