The United States has always been a free country and  the right to bear arms is one of our core freedoms, alongside the first amendment rights to freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and free exercise of religion. I would never want to see any of those rights taken away.<p>The societal costs of gun violence are just a price we pay for that freedom, and I think it&#x27;s worth it.<p>Edit: To answer the question about what happens if the U.S. were to ban guns, I&#x27;d say that we would lose one of the core freedoms that made us great.')
