It is a single Bash script with minimal dependencies and is installable via Homebrew with `brew install wcarhart&#x2F;tools&#x2F;lurker`. In addition to reading submission threads, lurker can also summarize text articles so you don&#x27;t have to open the link in a web browser. It&#x27;s just a passion project, but I figured others on HN might like to use it - let me know if you have any feedback!')
