Recently, I have been interested in how some stocks perform, and how some traders perform their decision making. I have seen some papers regarding this question, but I found that a surprising amount of the authors never bet themselves anything.<p>So, as to really understand their thinking process, I decided to start investing a pocketful amount of money (let&#x27;s say 100$).<p>How should I do it? Where should I start? Of course it would be nice to earn a little bit of cash in the process, but it is not a realist goal.<p>Thank you all.')
