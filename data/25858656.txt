Considering that it refers to the gender differences when it comes to seeing the value in it (and even including race), Why did they not include the type of major people go to college for? Maybe since I&#x27;m not american it would be more natural for me to include that, but if someone puts that much emphasis on the &#x27;input&#x27; (gender, race) why not consider the &#x27;output&#x27; (stem, humanities)?')
