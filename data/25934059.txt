The types themselves are immutable value types, carrying no state and reacting to no messages, and they don&#x27;t exploit a class hierarchy beyond having a common &quot;Number&quot; class. The &quot;methods&quot; don&#x27;t even behave like methods, e.g. __add__(self, other) has special wiring so it obscures which side of the addition is &quot;self&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s very different than a classic OO scheme like a UI toolkit.')
