Item(by='nl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604895403, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25031351, text='&gt; The top four states have roughly a third of the national population; if federal policy were enacted purely by population, why shouldn&#x27;t they allocate all federal funds to themselves and deprive other states entirely? The Senate and the electoral college give enough of an advantage to small states that, even though no one or two small states are liable to flip an election by themselves, they are still able to have a voice in federal policy by coalition-building.<p>I think this explains my point very well.
