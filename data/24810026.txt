The point of right to repair is for manufacturers to simply stop being hostile to repairing. Using screws with special&#x2F;custom heads, forcing authentication of spare parts, etc., are all hostile. One could argue more about the use of glue in everything, but thatâ€™s more about the limitations of a specific design and not necessarily intentionally hostile (though in some cases it is).<p>The cost of labor has absolutely nothing to do with this. A single person who wants to fix their own phone or tractor should be able to do it without having to jump through ridiculous hurdles or being outright blocked from doing so by the manufacturer.')
