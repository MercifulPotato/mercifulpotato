That much is tautological.  A single instance of a dead person voting proves the statement true.  To say, &quot;fraud didn&#x27;t occur,&quot; is an outright lie.<p>The debate is over (1) how much fraud occurred and (2) whether it affected the results.<p>Someone else posted the &quot;Here is the Evidence&quot; link.  Too many videos of (R) election judges being denied access to counts done in secret, organizers paying for votes, postal workers diverting ballots from their intended destinations, chain of custody violations, Dominion machines sending ballots to be &quot;adjudicated&quot; in foreign countries, etc.<p>Thus far, the answer to the question of whether this mountain of fraud affected the results seems to depend entirely on the political views of the person examining said mountain.')
