Why dangerous?  I travel on the London underground regularly, masks are mandatory but that is not universally observed; a large number of those with masks are constantly adjusting them, touching their faces, then touching the seats and the hand-rails.  Those without generally don&#x27;t touch their faces.  Which behaviour is more harmful? I don&#x27;t know, and until we get some hard numbers of the actual effects of real people&#x27;s behaviour (rather than hamster-in-a-box studies), nor does anyone else.')
