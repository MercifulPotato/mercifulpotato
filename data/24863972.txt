Here now enter the 2000&#x27;s of Gemini.. startups begin to grow stronger most of them mediating and selling the content of others that they get for free.<p>The individual gemini sites begin to fade, the startups create Gemini clients with a lot of new features starting to turn impossible for new implementations.<p>(Now its the time we start to ask ourselves, where did we see that movie?)<p>So whats the point of a new protocol or standard, if it doesnt solve the real issues we are facing nowadays, and the only solution it provides its to manipulate people emotions that we should get back to that romantic era of the internet, the &#x27;belle epoque&#x27;.<p>&quot;Its hard to solve the modern issues? get your time machine pal, lets get to the nineties and start everything again without solving the core issues, and if by chance we happen to thrive, just let those big problems to be solved by your grandson&quot;<p>There is only one thing we should be doing right now: Decentralize the internet, making &quot;blue seas&quot; for new things to thrive making the moves of FAANGS to centralize and control data, information and computation futile by getting people out of a game they control.<p>A solution like Gemini would reset the game, yes, but only to have the same problems later, giving the creators were not trying to solve them in the first place.<p>Gemini is trying to solve a problem by using denial, and as we know, it doesnt actually solve the problems. It just make them disappear temporarily to hit us again in a near future.<p>You can make a Gemini client in two weeks? thats great, this is probably what you would take to make browsers in the nineties..')
