They can&#x27;t even figure out that I put my bike on the roof of the car and drove away. My heart rate goes down, yet I&#x27;m going 40-60 miles per hour... and Strava still thinks I&#x27;m riding my bike. They rely on other users to flag my activity as bogus because I busted some random KOM.<p>It should be reasonably straight forward to suggest auto-cropping, particularly when I start and stop a ride in the same place. This is one of the reasons I gave up Strava, they were solving for issues I don&#x27;t have (I don&#x27;t need a bike&#x2F; social network), and ignoring the big obvious ones I do.')
