For instance, in the UK a bill has at least a first, second and third reading.<p>In a direct democracy, where voters take on the role of legislators, voters are certainly expected to vote on the same subject more than once.<p>Of course, the UK isn&#x27;t a direct democracy. And that is exactly the problem. People in the UK generally don&#x27;t understand how direct democracies work, and forgivably so since there&#x27;s no constitutional law regulating direct democracy in the UK, only subjective feelings.')
