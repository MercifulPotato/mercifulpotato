The PS3 took away the ability to install Linux in an update and lost the resulting lawsuit, the Oculus isn&#x27;t the same situation, but it&#x27;s close enough that I think a lawsuit would have a good chance.<p>It&#x27;s one thing if they just required you to make a login, but it sounds like you cant &quot;just make a login&quot;. You have to give them your name, there&#x27;s a good chance you&#x27;ll get banned if you name is unusual or if you don&#x27;t immediately make &quot;friends&quot;, etc, etc.')
