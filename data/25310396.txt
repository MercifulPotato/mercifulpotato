All Apple really needs to do is get their M1 + AMD GPU (NAVI 2x is looking decent), and they&#x27;re set. (Rumor has it that Apple is pissed off at NVidia for some reason, so Apple x NVidia solution seems unlikely)<p>I&#x27;m not sure if the M1 has enough PCIe lanes. But hypothetically, a future design would include good I&#x2F;O capabilities and start to scale upwards.')
