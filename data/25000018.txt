When thinking about “energy containers” - Having iron powder doesn’t have the same requirements of alternatives I’ve heard, and seems like it could be the easiest to scale. Physically storing heat requires very large well insulated structures (rocks underground I’ve seen), hydrogen requires compressed gas cylinders, pumped hydro and compressed air needs specific geology (large valleys or large sealed underground caves).<p>Iron powder? An oxygen free warehouse Amazon sized. Helped that many winter applications ultimately only need heat, this seems like a good candidate that could be rapidly deployed given how on a relative basis - capital light and material accessible this is.')
