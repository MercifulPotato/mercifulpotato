Pinterest breaks the 2 signals I would assume Google search to use:<p>1. Often, the image I&#x27;m looking for isn&#x27;t the main image on the page, just one of the small thumbnails and very hard to find on the page<p>2. Almost every single time I click on a pinterest result, I end up going back because it doesn&#x27;t help me, i assume others do the same.')
