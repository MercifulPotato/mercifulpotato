Item(by='jude-', descendants=None, kids=[25842427], score=None, time=1611014425, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25826005, text='The task of relaying blocks falls to every node; you are correct there (and I never claimed otherwise).  But, if a miner produces a block that the vast majority of nodes reject, then the network effectively splits into two parts -- one part where the block was never &quot;seen&quot; and the other part where it was.  If the part that never &quot;sees&quot; the block represents more economic activity -- e.g. the majority of exchanges&#x27; nodes, the majority of wallets&#x27; nodes, etc. -- then it doesn&#x27;t matter how much mining PoW gets sunk into that block and its descendants because they will never be processed.  Downstream, that means that the miner&#x27;s coins never materialize on these nodes, which makes mining non-relayed blocks unprofitable.  Miners need other nodes to recognize their blocks in order for those other nodes&#x27; operators to recognize the existence of their coins.<p>For example, consider what would happen if a miner produced a block that tried to spend a Segwit output without consideration of the witness.  Under the Bitcoin protocol, this is technically allowed -- a Segwit output looks like an anyone-can-spend output.  But due to the extra Segwit rules, only pre-Segwit nodes would accept and relay this block.  Considering that nearly all exchanges, wallets, custodians, etc. apply the Segwit rules, this would mean that this block would be treated as invalid and its coinbase rendered effectively unspendable.  Even if 100% of the Bitcoin miners tried to build on top of this Bitcoin-valid but Segwit-invalid block, all their blocks would be similarly rejected.  Only pre-Segwit Bitcoin nodes would accept these blocks, but hardly anyone runs them [1] (note that Segwit support first appeared in version 0.16; there are indeed still some people running pre-Segwit nodes).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;luke.dashjr.org&#x2F;programs&#x2F;bitcoin&#x2F;files&#x2F;charts&#x2F;software.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;luke.dashjr.org&#x2F;programs&#x2F;bitcoin&#x2F;files&#x2F;charts&#x2F;softwa...</a>')
