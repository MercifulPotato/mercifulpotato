People who are very interested in race and race relations. These people skew extremely left wing.<p>And people who are interested in technology, ai and machine learning who are probably center left.<p>The machine learning subreddit and hacker news are both part of this second group and only look like it&#x27;s skews right leaning because the other discussion skew so far left leaning.')
