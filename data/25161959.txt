The entire Bill Gates &#x2F; 5G causes COVID discussion from a few months back was fabricated; their current playbooks should be more sophisticated and target also outside the big social networks, perhaps even on this very site.<p>Also, that governments will show little patience for anti-vax talk of its citizens. They&#x27;ll have to switch talking points from avoiding panic (It&#x27;s harmless for young people!) to accepting the vaccine (There are many long-term effects of infection!). A Herculean effort in balancing propaganda with allowing free speech.<p>If nothing else, it is going to be interesting watching the next months unfold. Saying you are refusing the vaccine may simply put you on a list, but openly detracting from the vaccination efforts, should see some actual (and scary) pushback.<p>Public health will be an increasingly difficult thing to manage, when individuals get the information for their decisions online (however wrong).')
