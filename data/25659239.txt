I also agree with you that talking and knowing people you work with is important.<p>Where we disagree is the point that I don&#x27;t think that gifs are helping you to know who your coworkers are. And more importantly I think it is not helping anyone to better understand themselves, which is one of the values of having conversations with people in the first place - that&#x27;s kinda what philosophy schools were for. Gifs seem to serve some sort of emotional regulation function, but I&#x27;ve never investigated more deeply into that.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not trying to make a point here that you should only have serious conversations all the time, and definitely see the humour value of well timed gif, but I&#x27;ve found out that in general the trend is to shallow out the discussions and keep them within very narrow window of discourse.')
