When people see a search result from Pinterest, they tend to click on it more than on the results from competing publishers.<p>2. After they click on it, they tend to engage with the content more than they do with the content from other publishers.<p>This is not specific to Pinterest, it&#x27;s how modern SEO works. You&#x27;ll notice that Pinterest doesn&#x27;t dominate every search result in the world, but predominantly the ones where the user&#x27;s search intent is more aligned with Pinterest&#x27;s strengths (product discovery, visual stimulation, pet&#x2F;animal pictures, art direction, etc.).<p>I think what people find confusing is how can Pinterest compete with other search results that have far more text? Well, it&#x27;s not about the amount of text at all, it&#x27;s about satisfying the search intent. And when someone types in: &quot;what should I wear for my wedding,&quot; images are better in answering that question than text (a picture is worth...).
