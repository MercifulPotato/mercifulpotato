Many people like to believe that the market is self-regulating and &quot;natural,&quot; but that&#x27;s not the case.  It was created via government policy (hundreds of years ago), and depends on government in such fundamental ways that it&#x27;s inseparable from it.<p>The market would destroy itself (and much else) without government interference, and to claim otherwise is akin to denying the mountain because you&#x27;re standing on top of it.')
