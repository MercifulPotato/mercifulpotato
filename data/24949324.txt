Item(by='morpheuskafka', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604121632, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24947490, text='Apple&#x27;s official issue description:<p>&gt; <i>Crackling or static sounds that increase in loud environments, with exercise or while talking on the phone.</i><p>&gt; <i>Active Noise Cancellation not working as expected, such as a loss of bass sound, or an increase in background sounds, such as street or airplane noise.</i><p>In my experience and most posts I&#x27;ve read about it, the issue is tied to any head or airpod movement (perhaps that is what they are hinting at with exercise and talking). Interesting, I previously thought it was a solely microphone issue as it appeared equally and exclusively in ANC and Transparency mode. But lately, I have noticed a much less obnoxious rattle in Off mode with loud bass. So I wonder if there is something physically in there rattling, that is being amplified but not completely created by the mic.<p>Also interesting that this is released exactly 1 year after launch, which is the day the first warranties expire. However, the description seems to hint at an actual manufacturing change this month, so it may be coincidental. Would be curious to see what was actually fixed.')
