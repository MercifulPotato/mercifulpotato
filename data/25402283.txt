For example, if the other language has the same set of wovels, except some of them sound slightly different. As a foreign learner, you are likely to pronounce (and probably also hear) it as exactly the same as in your native language.<p>That is, just like it is difficult to distinguish between &quot;their X&quot; and &quot;their Y&quot;, it is also difficult to distinguish between &quot;your X&quot; and &quot;their X&quot;. Maybe even more difficult, because no one tells you that the difference exists.<p>&gt; For example, Japanese learners of English tend to perceive English &#x2F;l&#x2F; and &#x2F;r&#x2F; as the same sound and cannot discriminate them reliably in perception experiments.<p>I wonder what would happen if you took a group of Japanese people, taught them how to make the &#x2F;l&#x2F; and &#x2F;r&#x2F; sounds, by telling them how to place the toungue etc., and them told one of them to choose and make one of these sounds, and the other one to guess which one it was.<p>I mean, just like it is easier for one non-native English speaker to understand another non-native English speaker, because they speak more slowly and carefully, maybe it would be easier for one Japanese person to understand another Japanese person&#x27;s pronounciation of &#x2F;l&#x2F; and &#x2F;r&#x2F;, because it would be more exaggerated.')
