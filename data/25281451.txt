That&#x27;s why plant toxins are good in small amounts and bad in large at once. It&#x27;s always about weighing benefits and negative effects, not looking at things one-sidedly! I would never have vodka, cocktails, and other pure poison products, but I will have a glass of good red wine or a bottle of real beer! Pure ethanol is bad! Ethanol is metabolised as fructose! Sugary alcoholic drinks are the worst! So, let&#x27;s not put all types of &quot;alcohol&quot; in the same bucket! With red wine and beer, you get benefits, which might outweigh the negative sides - even when not considering the hormetic effect of small amounts of ethanol!')
