Your car has x range. Let&#x27;s say 200 mi. or 321 km. And takes 1 hr. to charge. (Just for reference, my current car gets refilled with gas every 400 km. and takes 10ish minutes to do the task).<p>2. How long does it take you to travel that range in everyday life. For me, it would take about 2 weeks. But lets assume that its winter or I&#x27;m driving a lot and my time is cut in half, so I need a full charge every week.<p>3. Now I ask myself if there is anywhere in my driving schedule where I consistently spend about an hour in a place where there are chargers. The answer is, of course, I might go to Costco, the grocery store, home depot and the library In the course of a week. Of course partial charging is also an option, so two 30 min stays at any of the above also solves the issue.<p>So I&#x27;m covered for my average use case if charging at home isn&#x27;t an option.<p>It is a smart question to ask, but it is actually pretty easy to answer if you think it through. Obviously there are a million and one use cases for a personal vehicle, but me and all my friends would be fine.<p>Even thinking back over the past year, including lots of outdoor activities into the backcountry in Canada, I have a hard time thinking of more than one trip that would have been different with an electric car (towing on backroads in the mountains. A corner case if ever there was one).<p>My theory is that charging infrastructure will all of a sudden become as necessary a commodity as parking. A restaurant that has a few chargers in the parking lot will attract more business, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it also became a revenue stream as well.')
