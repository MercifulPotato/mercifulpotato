I&#x27;ve built a couple small apps that use it.<p>A couple things come to mind:\n1. I&#x27;m amazed at how much data they make available (mainly, from a technical POV; for example, they have an open search API that you can use with JavaScript that can do real time searches)\n2. The API is pretty tricky to navigate. It&#x27;s doable, but boy oh boy, there are a lot of gotchas and the documentation is pretty lacking.<p>Would love to check out some other projects that make use of the Wikipedia API that people here may have made :)')
