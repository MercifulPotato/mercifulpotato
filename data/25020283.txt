Can you just state the fact? You can even add some qualifying statements like I did. But for christ&#x27;s sake just say it first! No need to go out of your way to find a subset that is (no doubt) excepted from the average. It&#x27;s politically inconvenient, yes. But it&#x27;s also the truth, and one that might help explain why african americans are more likely to have interactions with police (a group I have no love for, tbh).<p>My own mother can&#x27;t do this. She goes on about how the fbi crime statistics are probably &quot;biased&quot; in some way, though has no interest in finding out if or how that&#x27;s the case. &quot;It&#x27;s obvious&quot; she says. This greatly upsets me. How can we deal with problems if we can&#x27;t look them straight in the face?')
