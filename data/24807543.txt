Since he&#x27;s already sold the Chrome extension to some shady developers, why is he somehow also nice enough to help out? Gorhill did something similar with the original uBlock, but at least they weren&#x27;t shady right from the start. What in the world is going on here? Why didn&#x27;t jspenguin2017 just abandon the project?<p>[1]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LiCybora&#x2F;NanoDefenderFirefox&#x2F;issues&#x2F;187" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;LiCybora&#x2F;NanoDefenderFirefox&#x2F;issues&#x2F;187</a>')
