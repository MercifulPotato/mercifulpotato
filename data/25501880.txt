I don&#x27;t memorize a lot, because it&#x27;s so well-structured and intuitive for the most part that once you get the basic structure it&#x27;s easy to hack around with the docs.<p>Three commands that are useful to memorize, though, (particularly if you&#x27;re having trouble remembering names) are Get-Command, Get-Alias (also with -Definition), and Get-Member. Get-Command gets you info about a command, like if it&#x27;s an alias or not, and the path if it&#x27;s a unix command. Get-Alias shows you all the active aliases, and Get-Alias -Definition shows you the active aliases for a given command. Get-Member shows you all the members of an object which can help you with Select-Object and Where-Object and so on.')
