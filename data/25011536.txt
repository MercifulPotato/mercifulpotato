Just as effective CBT asks a lot of the patient, Stoicism is not a quick fix.<p>For me the primary barrier is that I don&#x27;t see how they actually apply to me. Their explanations start from places that I don&#x27;t recognize, let alone know how to reach. As far as I can tell, they simply don&#x27;t talk about the sorts of experiences that I regularly struggle with (basically a bunch of stuff that sort of looks like a cross between a neurodevelopmental condition and a depressive disorder, but without any specific diagnosis or treatment really sticking).<p>Have you ever run into a problem with some software and gone to its tech support site, only to find that the knowledge base is just a bunch of descriptions of how the software is <i>supposed</i> to work, written for people who are using the software wrong? Click the X button, it says, and then when Y happens you can do Z. But you went looking for support because the X button was disabled, so you couldn&#x27;t really click it in the first place. To me, CBT and Stoic explanations of the human experience hit a lot like that.')
