Focusing more on reading instead of just flash cards.<p>I&#x27;ve also set a five-year goal to get a creative work published.  The first two years will be dedicated to reading more good works and writing more (likely terrible) things.  Not planning beyond the first two, because that&#x27;ll likely change when I understand more about how one goes about getting published.<p>Even if I give up after a year, I&#x27;ll have enjoyed the prep work.')
