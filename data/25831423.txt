How would you - even theoretically - make that case without drawing comparisons?<p>There is little room to argue that if <i>any</i> figure associated with the right was waving a mock severed head around that would be cause for extreme social, business or potentially legal consequences and&#x2F;or people losing faith in basic civil liberties.
