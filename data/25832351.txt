But not because I don&#x27;t want to pay. I have been paying Google for services for several years. I am moving away because Google services are lame.<p>For example Google Music was closed. Google moved my playlist to Google YouTube Music without keeping order of songs and loosing a lots of them in the process. Replacing my songs with completely different ones. I was paying for that &quot;service&quot; and got screwed by Google.<p>Another example is Google Photos. It does not have basic functionalities expected from a service to store photos. I can not easily organize my photos in folders because of whatever reason Google decided. But the thing that me decide is that after carefully choosing 1500 photos to move to a &quot;separate&quot; folder, it told me I can not move that many photos at once.<p>Google services are lame. I&#x27;d rather pay companies who care about my data and provide what I need.')
