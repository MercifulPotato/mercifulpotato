If you value your precious spare time, part with some of your money. Pay someone to fix this for you. Ask your employer to pay someone so that your &quot;tool&quot; works. Whatever.<p>&gt; In any case, a non-kernel developer fixing it in a day of coding is IMHO wildly unrealistic.<p>Please... at least read the linked issue to see what the problem really is. This isn&#x27;t kernel development. This is a userspace library, and the problem in question is isolated to a single C function that spans one or two screens. This really isn&#x27;t rocket science. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to ask students to fix an issue like this in a followup programming course.')
