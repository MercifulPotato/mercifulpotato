It is not because they can&#x27;t create those labels, mammals are really good at a lot of tasks, it is because we can&#x27;t make mammals sit and repeatedly do a task all day even when rewarded. They just lack the reasoning capacity to override their intuition to do it.<p>We can. There are chimpanzees in neuroscience laboratories that perform repetitive tasks all day, every day, while they have electrodes hooked in their brain. It&#x27;s actually disturbing that we submit them to this.<p>Here is an example: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;srep34685" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;srep34685</a><p>&gt; Procedure<p>&gt; The experiment consisted of training and test sessions. We used ten versions of the pictures described above. Five pairs (1 and 32, 2 and 27, 3 and 23, 5 and 19, 8 and 15 hours) were used in the training sessions. When the chimpanzees touched the start key at the centre of the touchscreen monitor, images from one of the pairs were displayed side by side. The chimpanzeesâ€™ task was to touch the image of the fresher cabbage out of the two alternatives. Once the chimpanzees had chosen one of the two images, the stimuli disappeared. A food reward and chime were given for the correct response. A buzzer sounded when the chimpanzee made an error. Following a trial where the chimpanzee made an error, a correction trial, where only the correct image was presented, took place. The correction trials were included in the methodology to keep the chimpanzees motivated.<p>We could absolutely use chimpanzees to perform labeling of data for ML. But we shouldn&#x27;t.')
