The gist was that the US Constitution isn&#x27;t very good compared to a lot of countries&#x27; equivalent document. For example, the Soviet&#x27;s Bill of Rights was undoubtedly better.<p>I am assuming Scalia would have been referring to the 1977 Soviet Constitution [0], which has no &quot;Bill of Rights&quot;, but does have Chapter 6 (concerning equality) and Chapter 7 (concerning basic rights and duties of citizens). Taken together, are Chapter 6 &amp; 7 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution &quot;undoubtedly better&quot; than the US Constitutions &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; (Amendments I-X, possibly also XXVII, which was one of the original 12 articles proposed as the Bill of Rights)? I&#x27;m going to say most Americans would say &quot;no&quot;.<p>I mean, sure, lots of people would say that Article 34-35, in Chapter 6, are more explicit and complete on their face than the protections in the US Constitution (which have been mostly read into the Bill of Rights against the federal government by way of the Due Process Clause of the 5th Amendment, and against the states through the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the 14th, but aren&#x27;t very explicit in either case.) But I think many people who start out liking where Article 36 seems headed in the first sentence (though they might wonder why it is reiterating what is already explicit in Article 34) would be worried by the turn it takes after that: &quot;Citizens of the USSR of different races and nationalities have equal rights. Exercise of these rights is ensured by a policy of all-round development and drawing together of all the nations and nationalities of the USSR, by educating citizens in the spirit of Soviet patriotism and socialist internationalism, and by the possibility to use their native language and the languages of other peoples in The USSR. Any direct or indirect limitation of the rights of citizens or establishment of direct or indirect privileges on grounds of race or nationality, and any advocacy of racial or national exclusiveness, hostility, or contempt, are punishable by law.&quot;)<p>And I think many in the US (especially left of center) would like <i>most of</i> the first part of Chapter 7, say Articles 39-58, with the exception of the last sentence of Article 39 (&quot;Enjoyment by citizens of their rights and freedoms must not be to the detriment of the interests of society or the state, or infringe the rights of other citizens&quot;) which would raise a lot of alarm bells, and the introduction to Article 51 (&quot;In accordance with the aims of building communism&quot;) which pretty much everyone not a Communist would have problems with.<p>But then things take a <i>big</i> turn starting at Article 59 (&quot;Citizens&#x27; exercise of their rights and freedoms is inseparable from the performance of their duties and obligations. Citizens of the USSR are obliged to observe the Constitution of the USSR and Soviet laws, comply with the standards of socialist conduct, and uphold the honour and dignity of Soviet citizenship&quot;) which raises the same alarm bells that were probably going off from Article 39.<p>There are people who make arguments that something liek Article 60 (&quot;It is the duty of, and matter of honour for, every able-bodied citizen of the USSR to work conscientiously in his chosen, socially useful occupation, and strictly to observe labour discipline. Evasion of socially useful work is incompatible with the principles of socialist society&quot;) <i>ought</i> to be a rule in the US, but they tend to be exactly the people that would find the positive rights earlier in Chapter 7 unacceptable, and vice versa.<p>I think, left to right (even if they express something similar as a social expectation) most Americans would recoil at the first sentence of Article 62 as a Constitutional mandate: &quot;Citizens of the USSR are obliged to safeguard the interests of the Soviet state, and to enhance its power and prestige.&quot;<p>And, while there might be broad support for the idea that the duties of citizenship articulated in the rest of Articles 60-69 are legitimate duties of citizenship, or at least virtues of citizenship, at least if you stripped the explicit references to socialism, I don&#x27;t think most Americans would accept them as <i>Constitutional mandates tied to the express relationship between freedom and duties in Article 59</i>.<p>Ask yourself, would you <i>really</i> accept the base US Constitution and its structure of separation of powers, with the Bill of Rights and similar amendments that deal with rights of people and not primarily structure of government (say, Amendments I-X, XIII-XV, XIX, XXIV, and XXVI) replaced by Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution (even with removal of by-name references to socialism&#x2F;communism)?<p>I&#x27;m going to say that while most Americans might like some aspects of Chapter 6&#x2F;7, they&#x27;d reject that idea and the concept that the Soviet &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; was &quot;undoubtedly better&quot;, even if they didn&#x27;t know the source was the 1977 Soviet Constitution.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikisource.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Constitution_of_the_Soviet_Union_(1977,_Unamended)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikisource.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Constitution_of_the_Soviet_Un...</a>')
