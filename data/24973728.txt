I have a fairly large tinker shop with 20-30 different machines and initially bet on the Pi platform to do CNC&#x2F;Octoprint&#x2F;robotics&#x2F;etc controls, thinking I should standardize. Most of the Pis failed with storage issues eventually; be it eMMC, microSD or USB flash drives. Since then I&#x27;ve moved on to x86 based industrial motherboards which ended up costing about the same when you include everything. Zero problems since then. And boot times are now measured in seconds, not minutes.')
