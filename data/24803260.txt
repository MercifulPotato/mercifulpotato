It&#x27;s the entire reason Southern California is what it is. Anywhere the weather&#x27;s nice, people flock. If location becomes irrelevant, that will just make people flock even faster. Everywhere the weather sucks, ask around and you&#x27;ll find the cheap place people go all the time for vacation, and wish they could live, if they could but afford it. For Atlanta where I live, it&#x27;s nearby Destin, or Savannah. Nice weather is a primary determinant of where people choose to retire. It pumps land values up 10x or more.<p>I&#x27;ll turn your argument around and say that the only truly location-dependent industries are extraction based. Everything else moves where the people are. And people will pay through the nose to live where it&#x27;s nice.')
