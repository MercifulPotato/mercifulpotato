I&#x27;ve encountered my share of opposition for pointing this out, in fact.  What&#x27;s more is that this conversation is happening in a <i>context</i>â€”and it&#x27;s a context where I explicitly made a reference to &quot;twtxt[&#x27;s] target audience&quot;.  In comparison to setting up a Mastodon server, or getting Twitter to add support for ActivityPub, dropping a file somewhere <i>is</i> easy.  So I don&#x27;t really like quips like this.  They&#x27;re glib.  As a person actually working on trying to fix the problem of computing being needlessly esoteric, I consider it to probably be harmful to that end, not helpful.')
