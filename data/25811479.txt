In some cases these people had more money than me, or they had more academic achievements, etc., so their feelings can&#x27;t just be described as &quot;envy&quot; or &quot;jealousy&quot;.<p>I think it&#x27;s a more complex emotion that has to do with knowing both your status in society and what your future looks like - none of these people went on to achieve much in their career, and in a couple of cases they weren&#x27;t even able to land a job in the industry in the first place, while I was already working on exciting projects when I was a student.<p>Some people are allergic to the success and hard work of others, but when it comes to working hard themselves they just &quot;can&#x27;t be arsed&quot; for whatever reason.')
