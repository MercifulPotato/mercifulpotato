I&#x27;m really happy with it and I wish I had done it years ago. Many features. The web interface and apps feel a lot faster than Gmail.<p>Pro-tip: use a custom domain so that you can easily switch e-mail providers in the future without vendor lock-in. It&#x27;s also very easy to add aliases in Fastmail.<p>&gt; Plus after the import is finished, it will still periodically bring over any new emails received to the Gmail account.<p>Another option is to let Gmail forward your email to the new address.')
