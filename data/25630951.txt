If I invest resources from the beginning for &quot;I want to relicense and open all the code&quot; then there is no problem. However for most companies the priority is &quot;get this out before our competitor releases their product&quot; and many things fall under and often neither developers nor managers have the legal knowledge (and don&#x27;t care)<p>And btw. I fully support this on a different level: For instance for devices like (home) routers I support a scheme where a company is required to publish the software once they cancel support, so one doesn&#x27;t have to throw away fine working devices only since the vendor stops fixing security issues.  But that won&#x27;t happen quickly, as it goes through the supply chain: You need the device drivers for the chipsets etc.')
