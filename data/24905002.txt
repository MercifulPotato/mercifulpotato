Monica has been around for a while and well known so we appreciate the comparison.<p>Monica is fully manual. You have to add every interaction manually and open their web app if you want to add a note. We&#x27;re much more integrated and proactive: you&#x27;ll receive an email before every meeting with all the notes about the person you&#x27;ll meet in that meeting for example.<p>Our main app also tells you who you&#x27;re losing touch with based on your data.
