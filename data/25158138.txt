It has degenerated into being only browsable in its entirety by Chrome, with all other &quot;browser vendors&quot; except Apple having given up due to sheer complexity and infeasibility to keep up - Opera, Microsoft, and now Firefox. That&#x27;s what you get by putting Google (ie WHATWG, consisting of Chrome devs) into the role of defining so-called &quot;web standards&quot;, with W3C (a self-declared &quot;standardization body&quot;) depending on Google&#x27;s and other big player&#x27;s money having done nothing meaningful for years except brittling and foobaring CSS.')
