Every product&#x2F;startup has a different set of requirements, priorities, opportunities. What has worked for a company may be a recipe for disaster for another.<p>I remember reading on signal vs noise (basecamp blog) that they didn&#x27;t hire their first server admin type employee till they&#x27;ve spent some months working on the servers themselves, and experiencing and learning the problem space.<p>What you need is experience, and it&#x27;s not something that can be gained with checklist. If you don&#x27;t already know what needs to be done from experience, you need to learn it by doing it. You will make mistakes, and hopefully won&#x27;t repeat them again.<p>To lower the cost of this process, best thing you can do is find a mentor that has the knowledge that you seek. One that is willing to work with you to help you find solutions to your specific set of problems.')
