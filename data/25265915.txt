They&#x27;ve become the new IE in terms of typical web programming that works everywhere except that platform.  In the past year, every browser-based support issue we&#x27;ve had to deal with across multiple projects is due to Safari not handling things the way the rest of the browsers do.<p>Worse, there&#x27;s issues that are specific to Apple devices (iPad rendering of certain CSS, works everywhere else, including Mac&#x27;s own emulators, but renders fubar on the actual iPad), leaving the debugging&#x2F;fixing process a trial and error issue.  It&#x27;s horrible.<p>And even worse, this can&#x27;t be debugged on anything but a Mac anymore, so if you don&#x27;t use Mac as your primary dev platform, you&#x27;re near-screwed when it comes to trying to resolve web app issues that only arise on their platform.<p>Then there&#x27;s mobile app management, which is just as bad in it&#x27;s own way.  We had an app on the App Store for three years, then all of a sudden during one minor maintenance update they decided it wasn&#x27;t allowed on the store any more and immediately pulled it.  Thousands of business users affected, and two months to get the app propped back up on a custom business distribution channel, thousands of dollars worth of process re-development, etc.<p>Apple is the absolute worst platform for business-productivity programming. They screw the developers with a far stiffer rod than any other company has ever done.')
