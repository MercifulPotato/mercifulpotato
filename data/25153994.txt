Item(by='gurkendoktor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605817884, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25148926, text='I feel the discussion about consistency is moot because, in my experience, linters often have a different idea about consistency than humans.<p>Let&#x27;s say I have the following three methods:<p><pre><code>    def foo\n      if broken?\n        :error\n      else\n        @x\n      end\n    end\n\n    def bar\n      if broken?\n        5\n      else\n        @y\n      end\n    end\n\n    def qux\n      if broken?\n        nil\n      else\n        @z\n      end\n    end\n</code></pre>\nIf Rubocop forces me to reformat the last method as a one-liner because nil is returned implicitly, is this really more consistent (because it follows Rubocop&#x27;s predictable rules)? Or is it less consistent (because these functions lose their common structure)?')
