Unlike Software Development, These certifications are very crucial, They are more or less like a &quot;Get out of jail free&quot; Card.&quot;<p>This is terrible advice. You don&#x27;t need lots of BS certs to get into security.<p>The only cert here worth doing is OSCP, and even that has lost respect&#x2F;value in recent years to rampant cheating and answer sharing.')
