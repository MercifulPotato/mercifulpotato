You&#x27;re in a race to get enough victory point cards before they poison your deck into impotence.  An action combo uses more money and buys to get online than a handful of gold, and is more succecptible to be poisoned by green.  Missing even one turn to a bad hand hurts a lot, in about half of my most recent games the winner was decided by turn order (they went first so they grabbed the last province on turn 14, when another player who only had 13 turns was ready to buy that province).')
