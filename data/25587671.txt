Japanese &#x2F; SKorea success in tech are from massive conglomerates that function effectively the same as Chinese SEOs, see Chaebol, Zaibatsu.<p>That&#x27;s only part of the picture. I&#x27;m talking more lower level ie. artists, engineers and scientists<p>Sure, you need the infrastructure for investment and manufacturing but that doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of nationally, stunted creativity<p>&gt; Free speech doesn&#x27;t matter when building electronics or military hardware<p>It does matter if you want to build something original and innovative, instead of yet another cheap copy. That requires creativity, which is dependent on free speech. I mean just take a look at mainland entertainment. Most of it consists of movies and shows about the distant past. It&#x27;s not even close to what could have been done like what you see in Japan or SK. Maybe if China had a more individualist society, you&#x27;d have a better argument or even proof beyond one off exceptions like DJI<p>&gt; China under Xi is going in the right direction for global dominance for the simple reason that he&#x27;s one of the first leader since Mao to take military modernization seriously... Now China has a massively expanding Navy with growing blue water capabilities, SCS bases, space infrastructure and enough indigenous weapons that even belligerent US under Pompeo doesn&#x27;t have the guts to sail carrier through the Taiwan strait anymore.<p>What does this matter when everyone important already has global, ballistic nuclear missiles? One could argue that it&#x27;s a drain on GDP when it could be spent elsewhere. Most of the US deficit is due to wasteful, military spending.<p>&gt; The alternative to Xi was Bo Xilai who would never have reformed the corrupt and ineffective military old guard.<p>How do you even know there are actual reforms vs Xi just having a good excuse for rounding up his enemies like Putin, when there&#x27;s no free press?')
