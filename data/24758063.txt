There are a lot of things that one can reasonably think <i>could</i> happen in America.  Do we need to prepare every police department in the country for all those situations regardless of the odds of the worst happening?  Do the costs, both literal monetary costs and the harder to measure societal costs, of militarizing our police departments outweigh the potential that an increase in police firepower will allow them to save lives in this extremely remote possibility actually happens?  Maybe we are just better off leaving some of these extreme outliers as something to be dealt with by the military if it ever happens here.')
