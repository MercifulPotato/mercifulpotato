(Is this the party to whom I am speaking?) I was in installation, but hung out with a lot of the ops crew, and they LOVED interesting problems. The trouble was getting such problems to the ops people in the first place. Good people, bad process.<p>The most memorable one:<p>Customer service had been getting calls all morning with a peculiar complaint: A customer&#x27;s phone would ring, and when they answered, the party on the other end didn&#x27;t seem to hear them. They seemed to be talking to _someone_, but not the party they were connected to. Eventually they hung up. Sometimes, a customer would place a call, and be on the other end of the same situation -- whoever answered would say hello, but the two parties didn&#x27;t seem to be talking to each other. Off into the void. They&#x27;d try again, and it would work, usually, but repeats weren&#x27;t uncommon.<p>So everyone&#x27;s looking at system logs and status alarms and stuff, and what else changed? There were two new racks of echo-cancellers placed in service last night, could that cause this? Not by any obvious means, I mean e-cans are symmetrical and they were all tested ahead of time. There was a fiber cut out by the railroad but everything switched over to the protect side of the ring OK, didn&#x27;t it? Let&#x27;s check on that. Everyone&#x27;s checking into whatever hunch they can synthesize, and turning up bupkus.<p>Finally around lunchtime, one of the techs bursts into the ops center, going &quot;TIM! I GOT ONE I GOT ONE IT&#x27;S HAPPENING TO ME, PATH ME! okay look I don&#x27;t know if you can hear me, but please don&#x27;t hang up, I work for the phone company and we&#x27;ve got a problem with the network and I need you to stick on the line for a few minutes while we diagnose this. I know I&#x27;m not who you expected to be talking to, and if you&#x27;re saying anything right now, someone else might be hearing it, but that&#x27;s why this is so weird and why it&#x27;s so important YEAH IT CAME INTO MY PERSONAL LINE and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so important that you don&#x27;t hang up okay? I really appreciate it, just hang out for a few, we&#x27;ll get this figured out...&quot;<p>Office chairs whiz up to terminals and in moments, they&#x27;ve looked up his DN and resolved it to a call path display, including all the ephemera that would be forgotten when the call disconnects. Sure enough, it&#x27;s going over one of the new e-cans. Okay, that&#x27;s a smoking gun!<p>So they place the whole set of new equipment, two whole racks of 672 channels each, out-of-service. What happens when you do that is the calls-in-process remain up, but new calls aren&#x27;t established across the OOS element. Then you watch as those standing calls run their course and disconnect, and finally when the count is zero, you can work on it. (If you&#x27;re doing work during the overnight maintenance window, you&#x27;re allowed to forcibly terminate calls that don&#x27;t wrap up after a few minutes, but that&#x27;s verboten for daytime work. A single long ragchew is the bane of many a network tech!) The second rack was empty of calls in _seconds_, and everyone quickly pieced together what that implied -- every single call that had been thus routed was one of these problem calls where people hang up very quickly. This thing had been frustrating hundreds of callers a minute, all morning.<p>With the focus thus narrowed, the investigation proceeded furiously. Finally someone pulls up the individual crossconnects in the DACS (a sort of automated patch panel, not entirely unlike VLANs) where the switch itself is connected to the echo-cancellation equipment. And there it is. (It&#x27;s been too long since I spoke TL1 so I won&#x27;t attempt to fake a message here, but it goes something like this:) Circuit 1-1 transmit is connected to circuit 29-1 receive, 29-1 transmit isn&#x27;t connected to anything at all. 1-2 transmit to 29-2 receive, 29-2 transmit to 1-1 receive. Alright, we&#x27;ve got our lopsided connection, and we can fix it, but how did it happen in the first place?<p>If all those lines had been hand-entered, the tech would&#x27;ve used 2-way crossconnects, which by their nature are symmetrical. A 2-way is logically equivalent to a pair of 1-ways though, and apparently this was built by a script which found it easier to think in 1-ways. Furthermore, for a reason I don&#x27;t remember the specifics of, it was using some sort of automatic &quot;first available&quot; numbering. There&#x27;d been a hiccup early on in the process, where one of the entries failed, but the script didn&#x27;t trap it and proceeded merrily along. From that point on, the &quot;next available&quot; was off by one, in one direction.<p>Rebuilding it was super simple, but this time they did it all by hand, and double-checked it. Then force-routed a few test calls over it, just to be sure. And in a very rare move, placed it back into service during the day. Because, you see, without those racks of hastily-installed hardware, the network was bumping up against capacity limits, and customers were getting &quot;all circuits busy&quot; instead. (Apparently minutes had just gotten cheaper or something, and customers quickly took advantage of it!)')
