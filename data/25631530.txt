Like it or not, a long term leader does have the benefit of seeing through long term ideas to the fullest. There is a lot of value in that, however that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m fully convinced that winnie the pooh over there knows a good long term investment even if it threw honey in his face. A lot of their foreign infrastructure investments have been... either great genius we cant comprehend or they&#x27;re complete idiots. There could be background plays that we&#x27;ll never know about that actually do make them good maneuvers. As they stand, er, as they crumble from lack of use and maintenance, they dont seem good on the surface.<p>Now, the long term taking stake in foreign entities, that one... that seems smart on the surface. As to what end, dont know and without a long form of discussion isnt practical to talk about here.<p>House of lies...  eh, barn full of horseshit if you ask me... but even horseshit has its uses... and flies. So many fucking flies. I hate horses.<p>That and dude yea, the mass stabbings are insane over there.')
