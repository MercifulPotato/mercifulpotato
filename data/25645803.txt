Simply because Government Web Site <i>needs</i> to be accessible by everyone. That means there are certain fancy things and colour scheme they cant do.<p>I wonder if the stack for Gov.UK are the same as their Petition Site [3] or was it based on something else?  They have an Open Source Github account [4] for Government Digital Service which list everything they have open sourced.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;guidance&#x2F;government-design-principles" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;guidance&#x2F;government-design-principles</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;design-system.service.gov.uk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;design-system.service.gov.uk</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;petition.parliament.uk" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;petition.parliament.uk</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alphagov" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;alphagov</a>')
