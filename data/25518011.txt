Am I still wrong in my understanding?<p>Edit 2: with the interfence evaluation from [1], almost all evaluated guard bands result in -20dBm interference which would make proper k_spurious=0.01. My understanding remains that the aviation industry report used overzealous assumptions and overestimated the interference emission power by at least 100x.<p>[1] E. Memisoglu, A. B. Kihero, E.
