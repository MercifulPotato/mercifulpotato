How you feel about the emotional or moral content of a medical procedure is separate from what is done.<p>To take a less emotional example - I think genetically modified organisms are basically a bad thing, but that doesn’t make the term wrong - calling them monsterplants would make me happy but it’s not more accurate and it linguistically enforces a viewpoint that is not “correct” just because i happen to hold it (for many nuanced reasons i won’t go into here)')
