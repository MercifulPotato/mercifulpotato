Maybe the PRIME or G3-PLC industry alliances will change this and come up with something useful. This is also needed for smart grids. It would eliminate the need to run parallel wiring for automation or use wireless tech. Separation could be done at the circuit breakers with lowpass filters and cable runs could use shielded cables with the shield connected to earth in order to eliminate crosstalk and prevent the power network become an antenna and pollute the radio spectrum with RF noise. Today&#x27;s network tech for smart homes is immature and relies heavily on WiFi and industry standards designed for computer networking when in reality what is needed is something like a powerline bus for flipping switches, reading meters, remote controled power factor correction and so on.')
