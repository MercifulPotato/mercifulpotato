As soon as I step outside I can easily smell the difference in air quality, even when websites report that the air quality should be fine.<p>I&#x27;ve been taking sulforaphane supplements to help protect myself from air pollution as well. Here&#x27;s a reference [0] to support the claim that sulforaphane helps protect against air pollution:<p>&gt; Sulforaphane optimizes glutathione, serving as a nutritional &quot;seatbelt&quot;<p>&gt; But consumption of this non-nutrient appears to be important – even essential – for optimal health. Sulforaphane promotes the production of glutathione, a powerful antioxidant that facilitates the body&#x27;s excretion of a wide range of toxic substances, including pesticides, aflatoxin, and air pollutants. Glutathione binds with many of these toxins and forms mercapturic acids, which can be excreted and measured in urine.<p>&gt; Robust clinical evidence has demonstrated that sulforaphane is beneficial for people who live in areas where air quality is poor due to pollution levels. An intervention study in Qidong, China, an area known for its high levels of air pollution, found that sulforaphane markedly increased the production of mercapturic acid metabolites of benzene and acrolein, known carcinogens present in air pollution. These effects manifested within 24 hours of sulforaphane administration in a dose-dependent manner.<p>&gt; More importantly, however, these effects were sustained – even after several months – demonstrating that sulforaphane did not exhaust the body&#x27;s capacity to protect itself from environmental threats and suggesting that regular consumption of sulforaphane in foods or dietary supplements provides a kind of nutritional &quot;seatbelt&quot; that protects against future toxic exposures. These findings have relevance for people living in the western part of the United States, where forest fires, which are sources of many airborne pollutants, are common.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foundmyfitness.com&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;jed-fahey-q-a" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.foundmyfitness.com&#x2F;episodes&#x2F;jed-fahey-q-a</a>')
