Why should they be forced to continue to do business with you?<p>Do you really not see how saying, &quot;businesses should be allowed to sever ties with people who say mean things&quot; is different from saying, &quot;the courts will decide whether or not you committed libel&quot;?<p>&gt; For example, no competent court is going to allow anyone to use an escape clause to terminate a contract with someone because of their race, age, or gender.<p>Do you think there&#x27;s a difference between a court saying, &quot;we&#x27;re not going to allow you to sever a business relationship because of a protected characteristic&quot;, and &quot;we&#x27;re going to regulate what does and doesn&#x27;t count as disparagement&quot;?<p>Can you point me at an example of a business fighting a disparagement clause in a contract with language like this and winning, based on a court deciding that what they said didn&#x27;t count as disparagement?<p>This is like the people who say they&#x27;re going to sue Facebook for taking down posts because their definition of &quot;misleading information&quot; isn&#x27;t specific enough. You can sue anyone for anything, but you&#x27;re not going to win that case. Companies with contract language like this have broad leverage to wield their power in whatever way they see fit -- because for the most part courts have not ruled that escape clauses boiling down to &quot;we can decide to ban you at any time for any reason&quot; are illegal or unenforceable.')
