Now I take drug occasionally and don&#x27;t eat meat every day (its like once few months, maybe I could call my self vegetarian). Another good practice to lower acids that induce gout is exercises, and drinking water is ok, like 3 liters a 100kg person or so. Same good is limiting coffee and tea. Really just settle in place where there is drinking water strait from the tap, that helps to limit littering with plastic bottles')
