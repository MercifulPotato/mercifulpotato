I find it quite enjoyably humbling how quickly a newly minted fuzzer finds bugs.<p>I use a seeded random number generator. During development I seed it randomly. When crashes happen I output both the seed and iteration so I can hardcode that seed and reproduce the problem. And then in the CI I’ll often fix the seed so the test suite is stable.<p>But it’s also good practice to run fuzzers outside the context of a CI. You want your CI tests to be fast and stable. Fuzzer tests can also be slow and thorough. Foundationdb has dedicated hardware that runs their fuzzer 24&#x2F;7 and spits out any errors it finds. If that fuzzer finds problems it doesn’t break the build. But someone will take a look, reproduce the problem, hopefully convert the bug into a unit test and fix the issue.')
