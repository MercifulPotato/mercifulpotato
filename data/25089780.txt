Apologizing without further explanation can imply that you don&#x27;t know what went wrong but that you accept responsibility anyway. You&#x27;ve literally volunteered for the role of scapegoat.<p>Your latter statement implies an observation of a cause and effect relationship. &quot;It was wrong&quot;, especially if followed by &quot;because...&quot; shows that you know _why_ it was a mistake and that you&#x27;ll be able to rectify it in the future.<p>It truly is a thing for people to feel anxious and upset and apologize without understanding what they did wrong, and it is an admission of weakness. In a better world, it wouldn&#x27;t be pounced upon. But in this world, I&#x27;d recommend that people keep a cool head and focus on observations of consequences, not acceptance of blame.')
