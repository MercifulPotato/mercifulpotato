There is tremendous regulation, encouraged by incumbants, to keep away the competition.<p>You should look at historical healthcare expenditure by the US.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t providing healthcare for all... it is the method and the cost. Universal payer is one way. It is not the best way and in fact Medicare is one reason costs are currently high. It is a bit like a car that used to get 30MPG and now gets 15MPG, and getting worse, and the solution being offered is for all of us to collectively chip in and buy gas for those who can&#x27;t -- which is not tenable in the longterm because you&#x27;re spending more and more of the GDP on transportation.<p>There are other ways of giving everyone coverage. One scheme, would be giving people money. Enough to cover average cost of healthcare plans and say education plans. The individual is then responsible for their own healthcare and has the funds to purchase health insurance. Then you have a healthy market and have mechanisms for the costs to come down.')
