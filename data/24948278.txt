However, what I&#x27;d love to see is: What the property taxes are and what they would be if the property was purchased today. I&#x27;m not sure if an absolute amount or a percentage would be more impactful when comparing the two. I&#x27;m sure it hits hard to see your neighbors paying 10% of what you pay - but probably just as much seeing $2,000 vs $20,000 in assortments.')
