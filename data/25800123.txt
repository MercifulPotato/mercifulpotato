Unfortunately, there isn&#x27;t a good way to short Tether. You can short the Kraken USDT&#x2F;USD pair on margin, but the margin rates are ~20% a year. You can borrow tethers on compound.finance, but the rates are ~15% a year. I think part of the reason we haven&#x27;t seen the unwind of tether is simply because it&#x27;s too expensive to short.<p>Also, no one will loan you their tether if you tell them you&#x27;re going to break the peg and give them back a worthless token.<p>(I actually had a kraken short on for a while in ~2018 but gave up because it&#x27;s just too expensive.)')
