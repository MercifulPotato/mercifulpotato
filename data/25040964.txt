The only reason we have to doubt this is happening now is that there&#x27;s no incentive to do it, since Amazon seems to be turning a blind eye.<p>It&#x27;s a hard problem.  The solutions most likely to work are also expensive.  Amazon could create internal product review teams staffed by employees instead of letting users do it all for free, but it&#x27;s hard to make that scale.  It&#x27;s also less transparent; one of the big appeals of Amazon early on was the novelty that you could go to a retailer and if you don&#x27;t like one of their products you can say so for the world to see.  Now most other retailers do the same thing and we sort of take it for granted now.')
