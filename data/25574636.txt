This is one of the tragedies of modern insurgency warfare... Since nobody&#x27;s in uniform, how can one be sure that the person in civilian clothing crawling through the operation is trying  to escape or going for a concealed weapon?<p>I&#x27;m personally inclined to agree with Mark Taylor that &quot;...what this video shows is really a case that challenges whether the laws of war are strict enough.&quot;<p>Within the US, there is a similar broad cultural argument ongoing on whether laws protecting police officers err too far on the side of assuming the cops&#x27; in-the-field interpretation of what happened should guide how the law understands what happened.')
