There are lots of companies that are looking to do this because they are knee deep into legacy infrastructure that they can&#x27;t shut down overnight because it would kill them.<p>However, continuing improvements in pricing for renewable energy (wind&#x2F;solar + storage) make most such propositions increasingly less viable from both a carbon footprint point (you release more than you capture) of view and an economical perspective (spending money to make an already expensive solution less damaging).<p>Mostly it&#x27;s a strategy pursued by companies that are protecting a sunk cost in the form of existing infrastructure to stretch its economic life a little bit longer. It&#x27;s also a strategy for green-washing things that really aren&#x27;t that green. Ultimately it&#x27;s cheaper to not bother putting CO2 in the atmosphere thus removing the need to add cost by compensating for that elsewhere. Long term, most carbon capture schemes will end up on the wrong side of a cost equation.<p>The long term perspective for most gas and coal plants is basically extremely grim with or without carbon capture. Investors are actively divesting for this reason for most of the last decade already.<p>There are of course still a few countries building coal plants but most are in the process of actively shutting them down and on a clear path to getting rid of them completely. IMHO, most remaining ones will not make it to their current planned retirement dates for the simple reason of it ultimately becoming unsustainable economically to keep them going. To some extent that has already played out for most coal plants. Germany went against the trend here by opening a new one recently (probably for political reasons, the brown coal lobby runs strong in parts of Germany). But it&#x27;s an anomaly in a market otherwise dominated by premature closures of plants.<p>Likewise gas plants are converting to being peaker-plants in a lot of markets that have fluctuating supply of increasing amounts of solar and wind. This vastly reduces the appeal of building new ones; but the reality is that the more renewable energy hits the market the less attractive it gets to operate gas plants. In some markets batteries form a perfectly adequate and cheaper substitute for having lots of gas peaker plants. I&#x27;d say investing in a new gas plant that supposedly will run for a few decades is at this point extremely misguided as an investment strategy.<p>It only makes sense if there&#x27;s lots of stupid money (i.e. tax payer money) involved. Put bluntly, that&#x27;s what most carbon capture schemes boil down to: stupid money. It&#x27;s basically tax payers paying for the privilege of paying too much for electricity and corporations helping themselves to this cash on the basis of empty promises and a green-washing strategy.<p>We&#x27;re decades away from having fossil free energy production world wide; but several countries are looking to get there in 10-15 years nevertheless.')
