It clearly works well enough for some and not for others.<p>My desktop (custom built) refuses to go to sleep when I&#x27;m booted into Linux. Straight up just wakes itself immediately.<p>Over in Windows land I&#x27;ve had this issue on a regular basis with a Thinkpad that keeps waking itself up. I&#x27;ve had this issue occasionally on a Surface Book 2, I suspect due to a finicky monitor attached to the dock.
