It&#x27;s worrying when the interpreter starts to favor shipping quickly over being functional.<p>But nevermind, the 3.9 release was 15 days ago and the bug was identified 8 days ago. I guess there has to be a release before people will start using it and find bugs&#x2F;regressions.<p>There&#x27;s a saying to always wait for the .1 release, this is a good illustration of why.')
