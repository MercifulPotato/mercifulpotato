You do run into thermal limits, but you can control how much power you draw by adjusting voltage and clock speed. Somethings are more &quot;transistor&quot; hungry than &quot;cycle&quot; hungry.<p>That said, I expect the early uses might be in mixed mode (linear and digital devices in the same package) and things that benefit from a huge cache or pre-programmed ROM.<p>There are also things like diamond substrates that improve the thermal transfer characteristics as well which helps you to draw more heat from the package than just silicon. This was a feature of &quot;silicon on sapphire&quot; processes and perhaps we will see some &quot;silicon on diamond&quot; parts.')
