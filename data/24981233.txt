After all, the OS manages to pre-emptively schedule any non-cooperating processes, right?<p>So, leaving aside the problem of interacting with the OS for I&#x2F;O, you can do interleaved CPU-bound in a single thread, by instrumenting your code with basically an instruction counter. When it grows a bit too large, stop, reset it, and switch to another task. Erlang does this, although being a functional language, it counts only function calls (no other way to make a loop than to (tail-)call itself). No CPS needed.')
