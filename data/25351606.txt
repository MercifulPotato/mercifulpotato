IBM&#x2F;RedHat is really shooting themselves in the foot here. Stable CentOS versions have always been my go-to for VPS services. Install it once and you&#x27;re good -- plus no Ubuntu snap stuff... I have 5+ CentOS 8 installs and I was really banking on the LTS timeline. I wish they would have kept that going alongside their CentOS 7 support.<p>I&#x27;m debating whether or not to downgrade to CentOS 7 to at least keep going until 2024, instead of 2021 with CentOS 8.<p>Hopefully, some other player steps up and creates a similar offering.<p>Also, I&#x27;ve been irked lately about them deprecating virt-manager and pushing podman. I don&#x27;t mind alternatives, just keep the feature parity when you switch. Cockpit is fairly limited compared to virt-manager.')
