And that might be enough to stop some people from leaking.<p>That said, if you don’t work for a three letter government agency, in finance (especially at an investment bank) or at a corporation with tens of thousands of employees (and ideally, a tech company), there are plenty of non-technical reasons that leaking can be considered a relatively low-risk activity. The biggest reason is that the IT person tasked with finding a leaker, assuming it was from a meeting that many people attended, often isn’t paid enough and has a lot more valuable things to do than to try to play audio forensics. I know of several instances where companies have threatened to release the hounds, so to speak, to find a leaker, only for those hounds to be people who are either about to be laid odd or who have just lost a sizable portion of their team. Not a lot of motivation for those people to really care, so they just tell the angry executive they tried but couldn’t figure it out, the executive is placated by trying, and everyone moves on to another crisis.<p>And of course, many of these leaks only matter if the recording itself is widely shared or published. If something is recorded but given to a news organization who is instructed (or does their own due diligence and decides not to publish the audio&#x2F;video&#x2F;document) not to publish the recording but to use it as a source, well, good luck. In the US, shield laws typically prevent a news organization from turning over their sources.<p>It’s like with screeners for the Oscars. The screeners will be watermarked with your name and that’s usually enough to keep them off of torrent sites, but that doesn’t mean you don’t have a Dropbox or Plex account full of them that you share with your close friends and family. Like, sharing my WGA screeners with my mom is about as low-risk as it gets.')
