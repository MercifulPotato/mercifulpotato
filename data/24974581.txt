Then, I&#x27;d do my best to create a brand associated with some such trendy buzzwords. Ideally I&#x27;d have some friends, or friends who have friends; friends who feel like investing and&#x2F;or shilling hard to other investors, and who can also shill hard to potential users. If all goes well, after a couple years or so of heavy shilling and growth hacking and whatnot, me and my friends get our accountant and lawyer friends to do some sort of equity&#x2F;legal sleight of hand, we the founders make a nice exit just before or just as our grassroots, cool, hip new product degenerates into some spurious incarnation of what it claimed it wouldn&#x27;t become, and we the founders live happily ever after. Somewhere in that plan we build a search engine or whatever, but that&#x27;s not really important.')
