On the whole, GDPR is pretty sensible.<p>There is an older law called the ePrivacy Directive that regulates cookies. Under this law, cookies require consent even if they are not used for tracking, unless they are strictly necessary for technical reasons. This law is a big pain the butt because many reasonable and legitimate uses for cookies aren&#x27;t &quot;strictly necessary.&quot;<p>The ePrivacy Directive technically applies to reading or writing data from a browser, so it will equally apply to any fingerprinting method you care to think of.')
