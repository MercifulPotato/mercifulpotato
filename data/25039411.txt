Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604953290, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25038269, text='&gt; Citizenship is something that ought to be earned and given to people who show that they want to live in and contribute to a country.<p>But, by buying the citizenship, they are not just showing in some vague indirect way that they &quot;want to&quot; contribute to the country, they are <i>actually, directly, palpably</i> contributing to the country.<p>&gt; People like Schmidt purchase themselves a tax excemption or freedom of movement in a world where ordinary people right now lose their jobs and are locked into their country.<p>I&#x27;m confused, is your complaint that Schmidt hasn&#x27;t done enough to &quot;earn&quot; citizenship, or that people that don&#x27;t have less capacity to contribute should <i>also</i> enjoy what Schmidt does.')
