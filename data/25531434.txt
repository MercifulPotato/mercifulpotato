Typically they are able to give me some insight into the process that I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to guess. In &quot;no offer&quot; situations, it&#x27;s often &quot;the hiring manager was looking for someone with more experience in X&quot; or something like that. This works best over the phone, since they are apt to tell you more than they would be willing to put into writing.<p>For that matter, the recruiter is often an underutilized resource before the interview too. There&#x27;s no rule that the nature of interview questions need be a complete surprise. The recruiter is often able to shed light on who will ask what sort of questions, which can be reassuring and narrow down what you might review before the interview.')
