All they have to go on is what HP tells them. Anyway this could have nothing to do with key security.<p>Apple gets certificate revocation requests all the time, to disable test builds, disabled badly bugged software versions, to disable software for licensing reasons. It’s the developer’s choice when or if they revoke a cert. Do you have any evidence this request was different enough to require escalated investigation compared to any other routine request? HP doesn’t seem to think it was.')
