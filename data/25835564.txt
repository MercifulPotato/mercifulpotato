It didn&#x27;t help that I had just started with the office 2 months prior to the lockdowns and WFH situation. I was not properly integrated into the team yet, and they were not prepared to actually get anything done with remote work so the first 2 months of the lockdown were very idle times (a <i>lot</i> Pluralsight training because my C# was rusty and I couldn&#x27;t access the codebase anyways).<p>It&#x27;s gotten better with some structural changes at the office as they&#x27;ve adapted to the situation.')
