You don&#x27;t even need an email for reddit and it&#x27;s mostly browsed by Americans. You&#x27;d have to have your head in the sand to not think it&#x27;s manipulated like crazy. They&#x27;re huge juicy targets with incredibly low barriers.<p>Anytime I&#x27;d try to bring the conversation back toward civility I&#x27;d be downvoted to oblivion.<p>I find it&#x27;s best to separate news from social.')
