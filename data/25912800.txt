Seriously?  There is no question a service like this will be abused (Let&#x27;s ask Erdogan this question).  No serious criminal is going to NOT consider using Signal as a comms medium.  People who need to evade snooping will use it.  People who need privacy will use it.<p>As for the other.  For this product, either you believe in your principles or you don&#x27;t.  It was the whole premise of the product.  Without it, there is no need for it.  There are &quot;better&quot; (easier) alternatives.<p>It&#x27;s like building a back-up product and saying, you know, we could save costs by not always reliably having the expected data.  Yes, true.  But why have your product in the first place?')
