My family and friends are primarily Americans or are in the process of becoming Americans.  I want them to have satisfying employment.  That is more important than long-term personal gains.  I’ve got mine and I want them to get theirs.  Gilt-edged bonds make lousy winding sheets.<p>(This is a projected rationale and not personal behavior.  Helping China out of the Mao morass was worth outside investment to dramatically improve the well-being of 1.4B people, for example.  Chinese are people too.)<p>Haven’t seen many bread lines in Tokyo.  Mrs. Watanabe seems pretty happy.')
