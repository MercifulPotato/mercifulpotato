If you assume that packet loss can only mean congestion, you back off rather than re-transmit, as your re-transmission is likely to make the problem worse, not better.<p>In the case of wireless comms though, that may just increase lag, as the packet may have been lost just because of physical issues and a swift re-trnasmit could be the best option.')
