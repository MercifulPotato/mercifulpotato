No one expects single story house to support 4 extra levels or for internal walls to be resistant to hammer blows. \nImagine what civil engineering would produce if you were building a bridge from a to b and then 3&#x2F;4 way through you were required to add two extra exits c and d that were miles apart from a and b and another 4 lanes and extra level for train traffic...all in the same time frame and for no extra cost.\nCivil engineers would not be able to do it and no-one would even expect them to but this is regular occurrence for software developers and most of them actually manage to deliver.\nSure there are bugs but bridges need constant maintenance too, some quite substantial and that is expected.\nFor some reason, lots of non-software engineers expect software to be perfect when their own products are not, not even close.')
