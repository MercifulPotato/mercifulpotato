There are so many cities that want to be the next &quot;tech hubs&quot;, and many of them have been promoting that label (with or without merit) for years. I can&#x27;t tell you how many articles like this one [0] I&#x27;ve read.<p>But in reality, many of these cities are making an honest effort to live up to that label by attracting talent, corporate HQs and investment to make these claims real. Texas&#x27; tax policies are one example [1]<p>In contrast, I see SF and the broader Bay Area making moves in the opposite direction. One such example is the new CEO wealth tax [2], along with others that make SF seem hostile rather than welcoming. It&#x27;s no surprise that companies want to leave.<p>Do other people see it this way too? Has SF or the Bay Area enacted policies to attract or retain tech talent, investment and innovation? Or is the valley&#x27;s success due to a strong network effect that has been self reinforcing (more talent means more investment means more talent, etc). Have California, SF or Bay Area policies in the last 20 years truly encouraged the flourishing of the tech industry, or has it happened despite these governments? Really curious to hear what people think.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;sponsored&#x2F;jpmc-2018&#x2F;are-these-cities-americas-new-tech-hubs&#x2F;1820&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theatlantic.com&#x2F;sponsored&#x2F;jpmc-2018&#x2F;are-these-ci...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;personal-finance&#x2F;101415&#x2F;taxes-texas-small-business-basics.asp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.investopedia.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;personal-finance&#x2F;10141...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;san-francisco-approves-taxes-on-ceos-9dbf9e764220830dcfabeed96b45a63d" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apnews.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;san-francisco-approves-taxes-on-c...</a>')
