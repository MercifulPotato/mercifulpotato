This would prohibit spammers from sending massive amounts of email, since the required proof of work would scale linearly with the number of recipients.<p>For example let the sender search for a hash that must satisfy following condition: hash(recipient-email-address+message-content+nonce) % 42 == 0<p>If the hash does not match this condition, proof of work is missing and the email likely spam.<p>Another parameter could be the amount of work done by choosing different hash functions or hash functions that have parameters that tweak their run time.')
