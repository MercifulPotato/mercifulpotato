They are there for the eye candy, the comment section, or information.<p>An advertisement is none of these. I can&#x27;t imagine how difficult it would be to funnel someone who is barely interested in the content they are subscribed to, to buy something from an Ad.<p>But hey Nike figures out a way to turn this into profit.')
