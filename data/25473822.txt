They usually work with high-level garbage-collected languages on powerful machines and reliable LANs.<p>I am not a hiring manager, but if I saw a resume with only &quot;data science&quot; roles, I would assume (unless indicated otherwise) that they don&#x27;t know C, can&#x27;t read ASM, can&#x27;t understand a wireshark trace, etc.<p>If you are not getting to the interview stage for roles that include this kind of work, it may be because your resume fails to disprove this hypothesis.')
