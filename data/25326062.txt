The cost is a no-brainer. We&#x27;d probably pay 2x or 3x more compared to the value we&#x27;re getting. The independence from the Cloud services (ECR, ACR, GCR) makes it a better option. Also, for now, there isnt any funny-math on multi-factor egress costs -- which become tricky to compute in real life.<p>We use it for containers to be run on k8s. As long as there are not super-low latency requirements for startup, I&#x27;d prefer an independent single private repo over multiple in-zone repos.')
