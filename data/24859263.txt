(Apparently one of the reasons that it&#x27;s sluggish is because the comms between Emacs and the corresponding language server are done in JSON, and previously Emacs&#x27; JSON parsing was a bit slow--libjansson was incorporated to speed that up).  I have not used JetBrains so I don&#x27;t have that comparison, but I use this Emacs arrangement with C# and have been very happy with its autocomplete&#x2F;jump-to-definition&#x2F;etc. capabilities.  (I have used it with Python and JavaScript as well with a bit less success, but I think that is mainly because I haven&#x27;t managed to get my environment configured quite right for it to be able to find everything, so that&#x27;s my own shortcoming and I&#x27;d expect to have similar issues in any other editor ;) )')
