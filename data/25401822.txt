Item(by='detaro', descendants=None, kids=[25401934, 25402147, 25402594], score=None, time=1607808114, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25401693, text='A &quot;market&quot; needs a bit more than &quot;is worth something&quot;.<p>What multiplier of the $7500 bounty would you want for the trouble of committing a crime? Who&#x27;s the buyer (FB afaik doesn&#x27;t buy a whole lot of publicly traded companies, so it probably needs to be someone who can get into the deals, and quickly)? How do you find them? How do you convince that buyer that your deal is worth the money and the hassle of committing a crime? How do you trust the buyer? How do you handle it if the hole gets closed before the buyer can profit? How do you value the risk it gets closed before you got your deal? Does all that work out in a way that you really don&#x27;t want to take the bounty?<p>People buying backdoor access into companies probably happens occasionally, but it&#x27;s probably not the easy high-profit thing compared to bounties many people think, but rather on the level of selling account information by the dozen for a few bucks - and for something like that you&#x27;ll burn them quickly.')
