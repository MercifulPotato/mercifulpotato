But I don&#x27;t buy it, because 1) lying is equally available to all, but censorship is available only to the powerful 2) the powerful are as flawed as anyone else, except with power 3) historically the powerful who dabbled in censorship have also lied a lot, and censorship has helped them lie more easily. So the &quot;censorship as antidote to lies&quot; theory is just total bunk from every angle.')
