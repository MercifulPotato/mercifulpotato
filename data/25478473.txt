Ad fraud wouldn&#x27;t be an issue if the only money that mattered was a Facebook coin (Libra?) and can be recalled or made invalid remotely. Election interference wouldn&#x27;t be an issue if the only government you can elect is a Facebook-sponsored one. Etc.<p>It&#x27;s an insane idea, but maybe not that insane if you look at it from the aforementioned sociopaths&#x27; points of view?')
