Yet, I find it curious how cities provide water and sewage, yet power utilities are private. Solid waste also tends to be private. There are a few cities that provide power. Burbank, CA is one that I have personally had an account. I would include gas in that, but if you have power &amp; water, you can do with out gas.<p>In today&#x27;s age, I think a basic internet connection (5mbps down&#x2F;1Mbps up) should be required at all addresses, and then premium packages with higher speeds could be purchased. But that&#x27;s a can I&#x27;d be happy to kick down the road if we could get power&amp;water guaranteed to all first.')
