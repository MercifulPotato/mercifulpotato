The arguments based around complacency can&#x27;t count because each countries&#x27; response is different. There is no global preparation against the virus so all the additional deaths that can be attributed to local lockdowns not being sufficient cannot be attributed to a global cause. Each of them would be attributed to the individual countries&#x27; politicians.<p>10000 politicians each causing 100 deaths is not the same as an incompetent or malicious researcher leaking the virus on his own.')
