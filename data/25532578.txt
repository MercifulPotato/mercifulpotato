(Physics: the max pressure difference from room to vacuum is about 1 bar. Given a certain gap between the vacuum and the floor, the marginal benefit of a 3kW vacuum over a 1kW one is small)<p>But buying psychology just promotes inefficient vacuums at that point, so it could make sense for the regulator to try and fix that. (From an environmental perspective I agree with this one)<p>Note: I’m not even sure if the EU even legislated this at all. Turns out, a lot of so called EU regulations bashed by the UK tabloids were represented overly simplified to fit a desired narrative.<p>E.g. here is Wikipedia on how both sides used the regulation on food to ridicule and defense the EU:<p>&gt; This regulation requires that bananas as a minimum standard must not have &quot;abnormal curvature&quot;,[5] although no definition or guidance was given about the degree of curvature that would be regarded as &quot;abnormal&quot;. This led to various stories about an EU ban on curved bananas.[6] This has been frequently repeated by pro-Europeans and Euro-sceptics alike; the former tending to regard it as an apocryphal or misleading Euromyth[6] and the latter regarding it as an example of needless European bureaucracy.<p>Link: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Commission_Regulation_(EC)_No._2257&#x2F;94" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Commission_Regulation_(EC)_N...</a>')
