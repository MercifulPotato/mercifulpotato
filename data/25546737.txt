There are 195 countries in the world. They can&#x27;t even agree on whether women have the same rights as men or whether it is legal to draw images of the Muslim prophet (So, depending on what you mean by the term, &quot;Islamism&quot; might just be the legal system of some countries, as 35 of them apply more or less the Sharia).<p>Or another example : the USA is supposed to be a single country, yet in some of its states sex between full blown adults and teenagers of a certain age is legal, while in others a teenager becomes a sex offender by merely owning photos of him&#x2F;herself naked !<p>(And how would you deal with potential new countries that might not agree to the previous &#x27;common ground&#x27; ?)')
