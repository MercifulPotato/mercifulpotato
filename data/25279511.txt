I now have found what you&#x27;re talking about.<p>On December 21st, a 2018 European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) directive goes live on 21st of December 2020.<p>It&#x27;s a directive to consolidate and reform the framework for the regulation of electronic communications services and networks in the EEA.<p>&gt; Under the EECC, the scope of electronic communication services will be expanded to include over-the-top&#x2F;online communication services. Therefore, providers of VoIP services and other online communication apps (video, chat, messaging) will be subject to telecoms regulation and by extension the ePrivacy Directive.<p>&gt; For the foreseeable future, those caught by the provisions of the ePD will continue to need to comply, taking into account the interplay with the ever-evolving guidance and case law on the GDPR (e.g. on consent, notice, etc.), which will often apply in the context of the application of the ePD. The ePD rules have not been kept up to date with the latest technological developments and are also not well aligned to the enhanced protections of the GDPR.<p>I was wrong, the changes are influenced by ePD, but indirectly because of the broadening definition of electronic communication services. Finally we&#x27;re there. I&#x27;m surprised no one else commented about this earlier and it took so much time to understand why this is happening.')
