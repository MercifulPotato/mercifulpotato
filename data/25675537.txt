You would love a big house in Majorca if you were from the area and had a big family -or plans for it- and you would love to be with the person you&#x27;d love to be. Those are just examples. There may be a thousand more reasons why you&#x27;d love those.<p>The fact that you don&#x27;t like Bentleys, big houses in Majorca or a specific lady does not make them vacuous or meaningless; not to mention it would be 100% rewarding if those were your dreams and you&#x27;ve accomplished them.<p>That guy may or may not like those, but appeals to people that would love -or they think they would- those. The same goes for any other dreams we have.')
