There may be things that money can’t capture, or are too complex for financial calculation, or rely too much on hyper-rationalism in everyday interactions.<p>It seems that the human neocortex has evolved mostly for social group formation, and the theory of money is that an economic actor can be nearly basal in their pursuit of it and still produce a functional society. This is a remarkable starting point toward higher levels of organization, but fundamentally proven incorrect. Money does not produce positive results when introduced to cultures without pre-existing large-scale social cooperation based on things like morality. Even in these groups money creates prosperity but makes them vulnerable to extremely profitable forms of parasitism, which ultimately lead to collapse.<p>Money is a good thing, but it has failure modes that exploit the human emotions it was meant to replace, and we haven’t evolved past that point. When I look at the economy, I don’t see hard-nosed rationality maximizing progress toward human achievement. I see 99.99% irrational human emotions or rational exploit of the same, with maybe a few people out there spending a bit of their time on progress.')
