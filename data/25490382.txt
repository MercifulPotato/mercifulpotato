Item(by='ingvul', descendants=None, kids=[25490774], score=None, time=1608504922, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25490292, text='&gt; It sucks that people keep using gross salary instead of net because it really makes a difference.<p>Gross is better because what every individual takes home after taxes varies (if you are single, married, have kids, church taxes?, solidarity taxes, etc.).<p>&gt; In Germany, you would take home £52,911 &#x2F; €58,117 &#x2F; $71,102.<p>Based on what tax group? You see, it&#x27;s not that simple. Those numbers could be true for people who are single and are living in the east of Germany... but they could be false if they are married and living in the west while paying church taxes.')
