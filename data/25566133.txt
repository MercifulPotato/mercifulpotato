I already loathe the fact that I need to constantly recharge my phone, my watch, my mouse, my kindle, my headphones, my camera, my doorbell, my torchlight, my tire inflator, my tv remote... some of these will be used so sparingly that the batteries might leak in the meantime, or they might just die, so now every time you want to use X you have to wait for the batteries to charge, from a few minutes to a few hours.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m more annoyed by the fact that electrical systems in buildings are still too hard to modify. As you say, you cannot really tweak much once the wall is done. In a day and age where electrical devices continue to multiply, it&#x27;s sadistic to bang on about extender-cords being &quot;fire hazards&quot; while not providing alternatives. You don&#x27;t want fire hazards? Give me a way to safely upgrade the energy distribution of my home that is as easy as plugging in an extender cord.')
