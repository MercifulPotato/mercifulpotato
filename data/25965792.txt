Item(by='slow_donkey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611978194, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25963556, text='There&#x27;s a more practical but relevant cooking problem that I haven&#x27;t seen discussed - when extracting recipes from websites it&#x27;s tricky to parse the actual ingredients and quantities.<p>For example, &quot;1&#x2F;2 cup of diced tomatoes or a can of tomatoes (preferably san marzano)&quot;. This sort of freeform text doesn&#x27;t suit regex very well but also lacks substantial context clues. You&#x27;d most likely use named entity recognition which could recognize that &quot;1&#x2F;2&quot; is a quantity, &quot;cup&quot; is the unit, etc. but I haven&#x27;t gotten very good results yet.<p>Maybe I&#x27;ll write up a post when I land on a solution.')
