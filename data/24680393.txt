This is quite common.<p>If a program depends on a specific version of a library that&#x27;s not provided by the distro (because it&#x27;s obsolete, vulnerable, too specific etc), it still can be installed by the package manager, if the vendor provides a suitable version within the package. The nice way of doing this is to avoid colliding with the system-provided package either by using a different name or by installing it under a different path. Many vendors do precisely this when offering their packages.<p>In both cases, it&#x27;s easy to uninstall the no-longer used dependency - on the first case, it&#x27;ll be marked as automatically installed and can be removed with a cleanup command. On the second case, uninstalling the package should also remove the library.')
