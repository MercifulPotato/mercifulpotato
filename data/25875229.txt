Know that you&#x27;re not pushing yourself - you&#x27;re fucking yourself over. You won&#x27;t remember anything. A couple days will feel like a week. Things that happened a few days ago feel ancient. You&#x27;ll be living the life of Sisyphus because you will have to redo things because you will inevitably have forgotten what you did.<p>If you get sick (and you will get sick), you will take months to recover from a simple cold. Your body will eventually shut you down and put you in bed from the stress and simple cold you got. The stress will compound because you are not able to do your basic duties due to the sickness and now you&#x27;re even more stressed. Stress begets stress - in my experience. It&#x27;s easy to find your stress levels on a runaway train.<p>So, now, ask yourself - is it worth it? Is it worth being unable to stay healthy, unable to sleep, unable to even remember anything, and constantly being miserable as fuck just to think you&#x27;re gonna turn Super Saiyan or some crazy shit if you just push yourself further? (Pro-tip: You won&#x27;t ever have some anime level breakthrough - those don&#x27;t happen in real life. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s anime!)<p>You likely won&#x27;t. I haven&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had a single breakthrough or meaningful change in my life that came from putting myself through incredibly stressful times. So, IMO, avoid highly stressful situations. They don&#x27;t really prepare you for anything - they just deal out trauma and set you back.<p>Some stress can be nice - but if you&#x27;re like me - your daily stress levels are way higher than most people&#x27;s. So, your idea of what a &quot;normal&quot; amount of stress is very likely highly distorted. You&#x27;re probably living - like I am - just one bad day from getting riddled with sickness, insomnia, and amnesia but you don&#x27;t even realize it because you&#x27;ve thought for so long that this is &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;healthy&quot; or what you should be doing to break through. After all - life is a game... More stress means more XP, right? More XP means higher levels. Higher levels means I can do more. Doing more means more $$$. More $$$ means that house in Palo Alto finally. That house in Palo Alto means someone will finally notice me. Someone finally noticing me means I&#x27;ll have happiness. Something like that I guess - for the typical HN crowd.')
