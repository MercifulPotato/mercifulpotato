Unfortunately ADF has cancer, needs the money now, and may not be alive to collect even should he prevail. It&#x27;s not uncommon for such suits to be indefinitely delayed for years &amp; years through any number of tactics. A lawyer willing to take on this case in courts would have a lot of expenses, and probably require a significant contingency. The amount of money involved here, when going up against one of the largest companies on Earth, may not be enough to cover the costs that would be incurred, in which case no lawyer would take the case. Even if they do, and ADF prevails, he&#x27;s looking at the prospect of receiving half, maybe less, than what he is owed.')
