Can’t edit now, though. 25% is the planet-wide average for day-night and seasonal variation because that’s the ratio of the surface area of the Earth to the area of a disk intersecting the same flux of sunlight at 1AU (4πr^2 : πr^2).<p>With that correction, that’s 400 watts <i>average over 24 hours</i> (as in: no not merely the peak at noon); which means 24 h * 400 W = 9.6 kWh per day.<p>If you drive 60 miles <i>per day</i>, and each mile consumes 241 Wh of energy, then you consume 14.41 kWh of energy <i>per day</i>.')
