What I&#x27;m finding is I spend a relatively long amount of time at this, but even without writing code, I&#x27;m finding issues with my solutions on paper.<p>Yup. In my last project, I spent 6 <i>months</i> designing and redesigning a solution, with small experiments as PoCs, and ultimately built the solution in about a month. It was a complex project and a distributed application. However, I faced surprisingly few hurdles during the actual coding part.<p>I realized that, apart from programming competition level problems, for day to day applications that get work done, programming is 80% mind work and 20% coding, debugging, testing, etc.')
