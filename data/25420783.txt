I used to live a mile or two from an organic sheep farm in Oregon. On overcast days and the wind went my direction, it wasn&#x27;t that bad. I wouldn&#x27;t say pleasant. But it was just the strong smell of cut grass with odd components to manure that weren&#x27;t that bad.<p>However, on a clear, hot summer day and the wind came my direction... no. Add in where it rained a lot the day before... those were the days when I felt like it was time to have a massive lamb and mutton BBQ party to make sure I don&#x27;t smell it again.<p>Though, still better than smelling your average public toilet. So yea. Somewhat agree.')
