We had macs that were locked down and I think it was something the system did vs third-party software but I could be mistaken. Pretty much you could only launch certain applications and you couldn&#x27;t edit and preferences&#x2F;settings for the system. Being kids we wanted to play Starcraft so I brought in a bunch of copies to play during our free period. Unfortunately you couldn&#x27;t launch the Starcraft app. I still don&#x27;t remember how we even figured it out but you could go into Safari and change the default browser to Terminal, then you could open up a word doc, type a link, and click it (or anything that would cause the system to open a link when you weren&#x27;t already in a browser). That would launch Terminal but with a level of permissions that you couldn&#x27;t get by launching it directly (or maybe it was that we couldn&#x27;t even open Terminal directly, it&#x27;s been a while). Once you had this &quot;system-permissions-Terminal&quot; launched you could type &quot;open &#x2F;path&#x2F;to&#x2F;Starcraft&#x2F;launcher&quot; and boom, Starcraft would launch and it was off the races.<p>Good times. Our teacher questioned how we could play games and if it was allowed but was placated with the explanation &quot;The computers are all locked down so the ability to play this game means it must be ok to play&quot;. A bit of circular-logic and misdirection but this was still in period where all the teachers were woefully behind on technology and how it worked.')
