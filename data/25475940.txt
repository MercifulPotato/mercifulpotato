If the title were &quot;What I hate about Spring&quot;, it&#x27;d be fine, but hating on an entire language because of one framework just misses the point.<p>&gt; Javaâ€™s focus still appears to be on silly rules that dictate what class names should be, what packages they should be in, and if variables should be private or protected. Seriously, who cares?<p>This is the one thing that I like about Java. I can easily <i>guess</i> the names of classes&#x2F;methods. Private variables are private so that they don&#x27;t leak into the public API (ie. encapsulation). The &quot;seriously, who cares?&quot; at the end just discredits the entire article for me.')
