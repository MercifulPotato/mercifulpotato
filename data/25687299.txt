The reason electric cars use it is because of energy density (weight savings). For home use, weight is completely irrelevant. You could use much safer lead acid batteries (sealed&#x2F;AGM) and rig your own inverter setup. This is also a lot easier to maintain over time, as you can scale up&#x2F;down and swap individual batteries as required.')
