How about 20?<p>I have seen 17&#x2F;20 year olds in tv (I think, I don&#x27;t double check actress ages, but I&#x27;m sure at least in porn there are 18 year old ones) and I WOULD NEVER expect to see a show&#x2F;movie about 11 year olds emulating that.<p>And you are basically saying (because it is in tv) we should accept the same behaviour from an 11 year old as an 17 year old, which I strongly oppose. there is 6 years difference and A LOT of things in between for me to find it ok. I don&#x27;t mind a 17&#x2F;18 old to be naked on tv, I don&#x27;t think it is ok for an 11 year old. I think it is ok for 17&#x2F;18 year old to emulate sex&#x2F;erotic things on tv, I don&#x27;t think it is for a 11 year old.<p>There is also the concept of consent, which I don&#x27;t think an 11 year old should be able to give to spread her legs on tv, while a 17 year old should (maybe not all but hey...).')
