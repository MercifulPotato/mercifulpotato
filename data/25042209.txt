But you don’t need to have as much memorized as we’re were tested on when I was in school (90s-early 2000s). And you need a lot more than just memorization to reach real understanding.<p>Every few years I need the quadratic formula for something, and I just derive the thing instead of remembering or looking it up. I’ve essentially traded some memorization for some understanding. We’re surely going to do it wrong, so I’d err on the side of too much understanding and too little memorizing. If you have a real feel for how a thing works, it’ll stick with you longer than the date of such and such battle.')
