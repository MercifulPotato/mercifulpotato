I generalised to these other cases when I said:<p>&gt; I&#x27;d probably count inspecting stack traces, or running a debugger on ourselves, in this category.<p>I would put such things in the &quot;unreliable&quot; category, since it&#x27;s the sort of thing that may vary between compilers (including future versions), and may depend on internal details of dependencies which are subject to change.<p>I certainly wouldn&#x27;t let them through code review; it can be hard trying to understand &#x27;foo(bar)&#x27; in terms of &#x27;the function &quot;foo&quot; applied to the input &quot;bar&quot;&#x27;, I&#x27;d rather avoid the extra complications of having to think about &#x27;pushing a fresh stack frame, clearing registers A, setting the instruction pointer to B, adding C instructions to the ALU&#x27;s adder pipeline, forcing a flush of D cache lines, ...&#x27;')
