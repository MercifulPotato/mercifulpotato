That is what a racist would do. On the contrary, he delivered an additional $1.4 Billion through the CARES Act:<p>&quot;This Administration is committed to the success of HBCUs, Minority Serving Institutions, and the students they serve. Each institution is unique and is an important part of this country&#x27;s educational fabric,&quot; said Secretary DeVos. &quot;By providing additional support to these important institutions, we can help ensure they emerge from this crisis stronger than before. I encourage these institutions, like all others, to use these funds to provide emergency grants to students during this challenging time, and to expand remote learning programs and build IT capacity. These are challenging times, but if we take this opportunity to transform higher education to meet the demands of the 21st century, our nation&#x27;s students and higher education as a whole will be better for it.&quot;<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ed.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;secretary-devos-delivers-nearly-14-billion-additional-cares-act-relief-funds-hbcus-minority-serving-institutions-and-colleges-and-universities-serving-low-income-students" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ed.gov&#x2F;news&#x2F;press-releases&#x2F;secretary-devos-deliv...</a>')
