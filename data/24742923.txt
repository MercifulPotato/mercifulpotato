The remote console crashes frequently and is generally pretty unreliable.  I&#x27;m disappointed that Supermicro doesn&#x27;t have any Ryzen AM4 server boards.  AMD getting ignored by many of the server vendors is just a repeat of what happened when the Opteron series was first introduced.  At least there are a number of Epyc server boards available.')
