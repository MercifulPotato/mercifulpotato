You can read a bit about the motivation for doing it that way on that website.<p>The title is a reference to a somewhat well-known book, <i>Linear Algebra Done Right</i>, which avoids using determinants to develop the theory (resulting in a somewhat novel&#x2F;cleaner presentation). It&#x27;s unfortunately not freely available online (published by Springer â€“ I would suspect most university students can get it freely through their library&#x27;s website, however).')
