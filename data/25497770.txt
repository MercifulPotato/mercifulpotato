But as a practical matter, small ISVs would be much better off hiring professionals.<p>I think this more of a matter of ensuring that an employee&#x27;s objectives are in line with the company in a harmonious way. Rather than blaming a hacker for not falling in line with company practices as being &quot;unprofessional&quot;, I would approach this as seeing any employee as a business entity within itself. Some business entities are flexible &amp; willing to work withing your framework. Some business entities already have their own framework, which may or may not be compatible with your framework.<p>A hacker has a brand, a product, &amp; is otherwise also a professional with discipline &amp; ethics. The problem that Eric seems to have had was that his company&#x27;s framework was not compatible with his employee&#x27;s framework. Treating a hacker as a business with the many of same considerations of which businesses to partner with or rely on would lead to a more logic based discussion where all considerations are more likely to be articulated without the need to denigrate a person who is incompatible with the company.')
