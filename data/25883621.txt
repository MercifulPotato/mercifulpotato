Perhaps you meant $500 console can perform moderately well compared to a $1500 PC? If a game runs better on a console then its PC counterpart, then it usually the developer not optimizing the game properly.<p>&gt; Also would a console be any good as a PC if you could get a common OS running on it?<p>PS2 OS was based on Linux. It was not impossible to get a Linux disto running. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Linux_for_PlayStation_2?wprov=" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Linux_for_PlayStation_2?wprov=</a>...')
