The only sources I&#x27;ve found on it so far are far-left political websites.<p>I hesitate to trust e.g. Fox News when reporting on the size of Trump&#x27;s inauguration; likewise, I am skeptical to trust far-left websites reporting on the size of a far-left rally (as pics of hammer-and-sickle flags seem to indicate). An independent report on the size of these strikes would be helpful.')
