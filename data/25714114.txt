They wouldn&#x27;t have to compromise on the drivetrain because It&#x27;s cheap to build a reliable single speed transmission that can handle &lt;insert newton here&gt;, and 3 phase motors are cheap and easy to mass manufacture too.<p>I just don&#x27;t see any justification in worse quality than a 1995-ish SAAB because It&#x27;s got a touch screen.')
