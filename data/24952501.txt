Given that real-world distribution of positive&#x2F;negative COVID cases is hugely imbalanced, having a balanced dataset would seem to be a form of random undersampling from the majority class. (undersampling potentially discards useful data from the majority class, unless we can somehow determine that the discarded data adds no new information. In this case, there&#x27;s a lack of homogeneity in the majority class, which the paper points out i.e. &quot;there  are  cultural  and  age  differences  in  coughs,  future  work could focus on tailoring the model to different age groups and regions of the world &quot;)<p>2. In the abstract, the claim is:<p>&quot;When  validated  with  subjects  diagnosed  using  an official test, the model achieves COVID-19 sensitivity of 98.5% with  a  specificity  of  94.2%  (AUC:  0.97).  For  asymptomatic subjects it achieves sensitivity of 100% with a specificity of 83.2%.&quot; [Reminder: sensitivity = True Positive Rate = TP&#x2F;P, specificity = True Negative Rate = TN&#x2F;N]<p>If you look at Table 1, the breakdown is 59% self-reported, 28% doctor&#x27;s assessment, 13% official test.<p>3. 5320 patient data points is something (the train&#x2F;test breakdown is 4256&#x2F;1064, so the model was built on 4256 data points). It would depend on the assumptions, but on first glance (based on sample size calculators), it doesn&#x27;t seem underpowered. That said, this assumes a homogeneous population. The dataset is likely (unintentionally but) systematically undersampling certain populations due to lack of reach.')
