If you buy mid-priced furniture from a big box furniture store, it costs more and very marginally much better. It does move better assembled though.<p>High quality furniture requires skilled labor and is very expensive.<p>I would say that having built an Ikea kitchen and dealing with a few relatively minor issues, their customer support sucks. The employees are great, but the friction in getting to them is awful. Maybe the NY&#x2F;NJ&#x2F;CT Ikeas are worse with this.')
