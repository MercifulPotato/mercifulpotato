The trap-door is JavaScript.<p>So, the more things you can move over into CSS, the more things exist in this beautiful pure context that&#x27;s highly debuggable thanks to modern browser tooling (and that&#x27;s not even getting into the performance advantages vs doing things in JS).<p>Put simply: it&#x27;s really exciting every time CSS gets a new &quot;real programming language&quot; feature, even if these things are basic and familiar in other programming contexts. In this case we&#x27;re not really getting a &quot;new&quot; feature, but people are used to thinking of CSS variables as like, a theming mechanism. I for one had never thought to use them as an API data format. The author is probing the boundaries of what&#x27;s possible to do with them, and that&#x27;s exciting and interesting.<p>As an aside: there&#x27;s also a huge community that loves to just push and abuse HTML&#x2F;CSS as far as they can for the sport of it. CSS-Tricks and its sibling-site CodePen are at the center of that community. To people like that, the idea of an API endpoint that uses a stylesheet to relay raw data for arbitrary usage is pretty cool.')
