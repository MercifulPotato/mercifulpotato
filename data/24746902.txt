A lot of time the funds available to choose from are the &quot;institutional&quot; kind that us mere mortals can&#x27;t buy, only large vendors. So our money is pool-leveraged at scale using techniques and funds we individuals cannot access.<p>When you leave that employer, you <i>can</i> leave your 401k at that vendor but after awhile the old company starts to bug you about moving it as it&#x27;s costing them money to maintain an account for an ex-employee. I missed that subtle point you noted - most companies (? all?) only match contributions to their vendor 401k, so there&#x27;s our internal-company incentive to get you onto their plan to get those sweet, sweet matching dollars.')
