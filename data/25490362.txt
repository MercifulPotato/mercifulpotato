Employees don&#x27;t have to be naive, they&#x27;re on the ground with an understanding of the technology and are likely to see first hand what works and what doesn&#x27;t.<p>Obviously not everyone will succeed, but there&#x27;s no reason employees can&#x27;t do a better job than investors (and many do).')
