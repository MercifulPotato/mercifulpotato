Item(by='jabl', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608230853, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25458080, text='&gt; Related, and I&#x27;ve mentioned this before—the Zotero app is built on XULRunner&#x2F;Gecko, but XULRunner was killed by the big brained folks who had the power to do so in an attempt to free up resources for their totally successful designs for the future. Rather than throwing Zotero contributors under the bus and into a potential quagmire of dealing with C++ and Rust compiler output that they don&#x27;t care about on failed builds, and costing them hours for successful builds (if a successful build is even possible for the hardware), the Zotero build scripts instead download Firefox and then repack it, et voilà—when you open it you&#x27;re running Zotero.<p>IIRC the plan was for Zotero to rebase on Electron, though I haven&#x27;t followed how this project has proceeded.')
