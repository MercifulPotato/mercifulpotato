I don&#x27;t think many Calgarians could be convinced to buy a vehicle which makes a one-day distance to Vancouver into a two-day distance. I know this is counter to what any logistics expert would suggest, but people rarely buy based on average, they buy based on peak. So sure, if an average person in an average year makes 250 short trips (daily commute), 30 medium trips (weekends), and 10 long trips (visiting family in another province for Christmas and Thanksgiving, going on a vacation, long weekend trip, etc.), they will probably buy the vehicle that they can use for all of the above, not just the 250 short commutes. Case in point: sale of small cars and sedans in North America has been in decline compared with trucks and SUVs. People want an everything car, not a most-things car.<p>Also, wile a large percentage of the population of Canada lives in Toronto and Montreal regions, where cities are closer together, this does not mean that is 95% of the population. Calgary alone has a population of more than 1.3 million people. It is very common to need to make a short trip to Edmonton [0], which is considered close by Canadian standards. But even then, it is a 600 km round-trip in a road that tends to be snowy quite often. Population distribution in Western Canada is much more spread out than the East. And the cumulative population is way more than 5%.<p>[0] For example for concerts. Calgary and Edmonton are big enough to get good musical acts. But they are not big or far away enough for touring musicians to visit both cities. If You live in Calgary and your favourite musician is having their concert in Edmonton, that&#x27;s a day trip you will most likely take.')
