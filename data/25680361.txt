Porting an open-source player for your particular situation might cost more in developer time than simply licensing Bink.</i><p>This sounds like an artifact of the past. Today there aren&#x27;t that many hardware platforms that free codecs don&#x27;t already cover properly. And I expect with something like push by AOM this will become even less and less of an issue in the future. Codecs are becoming more of a commodity in this sense so something like Bink I expect will be less and less relevant.')
