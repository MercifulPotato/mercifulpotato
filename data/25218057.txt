Part of the problem (from my POV) w&#x2F; Blender is that it tries to do a bit of everything and understandably ends up coming up short on those other things it tries to do. Sure, it&#x27;s somewhat convenient to have it bundled with a video editor, but besides some really basic functionality what purpose&#x2F;segment does it really serve? Before the release of 2.80 it even shipped with a built in game engine which very few people ever really used so why devote valuable engineer resources for such a small niche user base? Why not focus on improving its core features rather than try to compete w&#x2F; specialized tools such as Solidworks or Catia when their core user base is not interested in modeling planes or rockets which can actually fly?')
