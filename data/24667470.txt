Whereas according to [1] aviation produced 915 million metric tonnes of CO2 in 2019 and estimates globally 43 billion tonnes of CO2 produced. Basically, the carbon offset from glass manufacturing by using transparent wood is a rounding error in the grand scheme of things and doesn&#x27;t even mention the carbon cost of the procedure to create transparent wood, which likely negates the aforementioned offset. Smells like a classic academic attempt to hype the importance of their research. The far more compelling case for this transparent wood seems like the improved insulation. What kind of carbon savings would we see in terms of heating &#x2F; cooling if we weatherized homes using it? Now you&#x27;re talking about year after year carbon savings! That&#x27;s the kind of numbers I would have liked to see in this article, not some paltry appeal to 0.00005% emission savings in glass manufacturing.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atag.org&#x2F;facts-figures.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.atag.org&#x2F;facts-figures.html</a>')
