I&#x27;d agree it ate into the market share, yes of course it did. And the blurring of commodity server and desktop hardware ate further.<p>What Linux didn&#x27;t replace was accountability: there were plenty of shops which needed  hardware vendor supplied and supported OS. It wasn&#x27;t a technical decision, but a checkbox their customers demanded as some sort of due diligence checkbox. Then Redhat arrived on cheap hardware and ate into that share further, because they checked some of the boxes.<p>Sparc and Solaris was still technically superior for some things and still had all the throats to choke.<p>What changed for Sun was Oracle buying them: jacking prices; buying all the competitors to control them like Sleepycat, TimesTen, and MySQL; suing customers; suing security researchers; suing benchmarkers; and charging triple (not an exaggeration) to reinstate lapsed support contracts etc etc.<p>&quot;We&#x27;re a Sun Shop&quot; was not longer the appeal it once was on the server, and of course nobody would need a desktop Sun with those downsides.')
