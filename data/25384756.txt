Item(by='croon', descendants=None, kids=[25385077], score=None, time=1607687825, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25384057, text='&gt; What kind of evidence would you expect to see?<p>That any person in the long chain of people required for the type of conspiracy suggested would slip up and leave any tangible trace, have a change of heart, leak something, or that hundreds of people noticing their names had been used to vote already when they tried to, or any number of other possible evidence.<p>&gt; What evidence would you expect to see if YouTube had deleted a good faith video?<p>I don&#x27;t expect any Youtube video to provide evidence to begin with, I expect it in court, where over 50 cases have failed to produce a single piece of evidence.<p>&gt; Wouldn&#x27;t you want to have some evidence in support of your statement before you make sweeping claims? I&#x27;m trying to see how you can reconcile the part where you think these other people are bad because they make statements about reality without evidence, but you&#x27;re fine with making statements about reality yourself without evidence.<p>I make statements about the reality that santa and big foot don&#x27;t exist because there&#x27;s never been any evidence showing they do. I accept that this is not 100% certainty, but it&#x27;s absolutely reliable enough to base reality around until further notice.<p>I&#x27;m opposing your suggestion that videos stating something very provable without any kind of evidence is the same thing as what I&#x27;m doing, and I&#x27;ve explained that stark difference.')
