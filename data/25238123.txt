Suppose you ask for the shortest length of the description of a PTIME machine which output the N bits of an RNG versus that which outputs the  first N bits of PI. Complexity theorists believe that the first will be longer. Proving that conclusively might possibly have a bearing on P=BPP.<p>When you go all the way down to finite-state machines, KC becomes something equivalent to finite-state information-lossless compression, like Lempel-Ziv compressibility.<p>Long story short: by restricting the resources available for the computation, it is possible to discriminate among some such examples as you point out.')
