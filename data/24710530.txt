This suggests to me that they&#x27;re more in favor of Google&#x27;s position, and are querying how to arrive at that decision from a legal basis.<p>* Some of the questions suggest to me that the justices agree with Google&#x27;s view that declaring code is categorically distinct from implementation code, and perhaps that copyright for the former doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>* Thomas had an interesting question that went unanswered: &quot;the four factors to determine fair use are not exhaustive, can you think of any other factors?&quot; (paraphrased).')
