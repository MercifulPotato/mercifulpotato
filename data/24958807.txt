IMO assignments of globally re-routable addresses should be actively discouraged and you shouldn&#x27;t get one unless you&#x27;re an ISP. Not defending current payment arrangements.<p>Roaming should be done at or close to the endpoints - imagine if all internet routers had to keep <i>and synchronize</i> ~12G entries, usually in special CAM memory (currently at ~800K) - that does not scale, at all.')
