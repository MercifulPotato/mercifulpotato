You never have positive feelings towards objects? For example when you see a beautiful sunset, or enjoy a great tool that allows you to easily get your job done? That would be very unusual... the human internal universe is immerse in feelings, we even humanize objects sometimes.<p>Those positive feelings are not addressed to the &quot;nation&quot; itself though, they&#x27;re addressed to the group of people to which a person feels like they belong to, it&#x27;s addressed to the culture and traditions which one feels connected to and which they enjoy with other people. Everywhere I go I see people treating their fellow citizens differently and more affectionately compared to foreigners.')
