Item(by='jlokier', descendants=None, kids=[24677101], score=None, time=1601778366, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24674871, text='I agree with some of your observations and ideas, btw.  But I have to wipe the antagonism off my screen with a strong disinfectant to appreciate them.<p>This comes to mind: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24674099" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24674099</a><p>&gt; There is no &quot;may&quot; when we&#x27;re discussing _actual_, _concrete_ events and not hypotheticals<p>We&#x27;re not.<p>I replied to the comment I replied to, nothing else, and it describes a hypothetical, so the reply does too.<p>&gt; counterfactuals are not an argument unless the argument it opposes employs the universal quantifier; failure to understand this is a failure to understand the difference between what it means to say &quot;∃x&quot; and what it means to say &quot;∀x&quot;.<p>:eye-roll:  My job is with theorem-proving software.  You can show off knowledge of quantifiers but it&#x27;s unlikely to impress.<p>The specific comment I replied to (not the main discussion topic as you assumed) has the informal discourse equivalent of an implicit universal quantifier.<p>&gt; Netscape&#x27;s corporate stratgy [...] I don&#x27;t know why you focused on it [...] as if you can talk your way into it being the thing that I was referring to.<p>You hand-waved vaguely about &quot;Netscape&quot; and &quot;lessons&quot;, giving no direction as to what you meant while insinuating we should all know them.  The lack of clue sounded like a communication choice, thus intentional shorthand for &quot;you know what I mean&quot;.<p>That leads a good-faith correspondent naturally to a speculative reply, to which you could politely respond with &quot;no that&#x27;s not what I meant, sorry for the ambiguity&quot;.  I think it&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;ll see that as rational, but it&#x27;s how informal language works, otherwise it&#x27;s questions all the way down.')
