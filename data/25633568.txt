That&#x27;s a subjective term, but it&#x27;s like the supreme court ruling on pornography, you&#x27;ll know it when you see it.<p>These guys most likely &quot;skirt the line&quot; to just operate as a mediocre and crappy content distribution network, that at scale, makes a lot of money because there is a certain subset of the population that will eat up any content at any quality level.<p>Facebook decided they don&#x27;t want to be a part of this type of content distribution, and they made a conscious business decision to not to engage with it&#x27;s owners and operators because it will simply result in an exercise of splitting hairs and a reduction to the ridiculous.  They just aren&#x27;t going to bring themselves down to the level... and I don&#x27;t blame them.')
