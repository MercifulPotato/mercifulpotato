Turning a laser on, and off, on nanoseconds scale, is not that easy, or smart thing to do.<p>So, why would you do a CW modulation of the laser to modulate another laser, if you can modulate that second laser directly?<p>MZI modulators are extremely simple, small in comparison to just any existing optical computing devices, and, most importantly, already on the way to mass manufacturing for use in a single beam 100G ethernet.')
