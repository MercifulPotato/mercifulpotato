The &quot;common subset&quot; of C and C++ is both a subset of C, and a subset of C++, e.g. C++ has forked C and turned its C subset into a non-standard dialect.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that the other C descendant Objective-C has decided to &quot;respect&quot; its C subset instead of messing with it, with the result that new C standards are automatically supported in ObjC.')
