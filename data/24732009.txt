I&#x27;d expect that most American Southern Blacks (outside the South the parties were quite different and the issue is more complicated) that identified with a major party between the founding of the Republican Party and the Republican Southern Strategy of the late 1960s and beyond, which King was murdered too soon to be influenced by, were Republicans.<p>The parties of today, despite sharing the same names, aren&#x27;t ideologically the same parties as when King was alive (or, <i>a fortiori</i>, any earlier time), though.')
