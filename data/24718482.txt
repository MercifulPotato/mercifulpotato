I&#x27;m from Castelo Branco and coffee is not $0.15... not even a &quot;carioca de lim√£o&quot;. Needle exchange program started 1993 along with other programs like &quot;metadoda&quot; to help addiction. With a needle they also provided condoms and an open door if you wanted help. During the 80&#x27;s you could find needles everywhere, people stealing from their own parents, houses, business, everyone knew someone with drug problems. Was a mess. And even worst in big cities. The government also start ending slums.\nDecriminalization was not the start of this &quot;war&quot;!<p>The situation is not perfect, and will never be, but is a LOT better than before!\nPortugal is a lot safer. \nThe crime that you talk about is probably not drug related and probably not local people. \nJust read the news. Did you find any place to sell used things? No except for gold.<p>And if you find someone &quot;drunk&quot; at 9am you bet he is drunk lol &quot;evita a ressaca, mantente bebado&quot; something like &quot;void hangover, stay drunk&quot; every village has a chronic drunk!\nMaybe now the biggest problem is alcool, not heavy drugs.\nWhy do you think police stop people at 9am and force them to do an alcohol test?\nThey are drinking since 6am!<p>Regarding your ISP. Your target is people in a rural area? \nIn one of the most less dense population area in Portugal?\nI will be waiting for the pricing. Good Luck.')
