But,<p>&gt; …a bunch of lazy network admins in NA and the EU that don&#x27;t want to learn the new tech…<p>That’s a cheap shot, and it’s not called for.<p>Network admins are paid to make the networks run. Anything else is less important. If your IPv6 network experiences some small problems, well, you’re going to hold on to IPv4 because small network problems can mean big inefficiencies or lost sales.<p>Just a few weeks ago I was on the phone with my WiFi router’s vendor for a couple hours or more because IPv6 traffic wasn’t working through it. I had narrowed the problem down to the router itself. It’s not necessarily that IPv6 is poorly tested or has technical problems, it’s that there’s a long tail of devices&#x2F;configurations&#x2F;software out there which screw it up, and it’s often cheaper to just use IPv4 rather than suffer even the <i>minor</i> inconveniences and troubleshooting sessions necessary to run IPv6.<p>It’s moving forward but it’s slow progress, and it’s not because network admins are lazy or stupid. It’s because there’s a lot of work to be done and not everyone has much of an incentive to do it at all.')
