The section about the &quot;Norway problem&quot; is not quite accurate. Some YAML loaders do in fact load no as false. These are usually YAML 1.1 loaders. YAML 1.2&#x27;s default schema is the same as JSON&#x27;s (only true, false, &#x27;null and numbers are non-strings).</i><p>&gt; <i>Any YAML loader is free to use any schema it wants. That is, no loader is required to to load no as false. Good loaders should support multiple schemas and custom schemas. The Norway problem isn&#x27;t technically a YAML problem but a schema problem.</i><p>&gt; <i>imho, YAML&#x27;s biggest failing to date is not making things like this clear enough to the community.</i><p>&gt; <i>Note: PyYAML has a BaseLoader schema that loads all scalar values as strings.</i>')
