Item(by='hootbootscoot', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608267645, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25459167, text='thank you!<p>Despite all the defenses of such by progammers who claim hardware always improving and code cosmetics&#x2F;organizational trends obviate software performance concerns, I can attest to the reality that I composed electronic music with completely software instruments and effects on 512mb ram on earlier versions of certain unnamed DAW&#x27;s with all the &quot;latest&quot; plugins at the time. My last Macbook pro 2011 with 4gb ram on Snow Leopard was sufficient, but once I updated it to Yosemite and went from Cubase 5 to Cubase 9, from Ableton 5.5 to Ableton 10, that it went from &quot;performing just fine&quot; to basically running the fan the entire time and glitching at basic playback of sessions I was previously working on no problem. (same plugins).\nThe Steinberg Cubase one being the biggest noticable turd, and I blame their acquisition by Yamaha, as the customer-service also went down the tubes, as I waited months to get a reply on a replacement USB dongle (also a sucky thing for a laptop with 2 USB ports, but I digress)<p>Software bloat kills. It&#x27;s not all deliberate, but if our values don&#x27;t change from &quot;who cares&quot; to &quot;we care&quot;, we can&#x27;t expect any change.\nIs uncaring mega-corp structure the cause? (programmer wants to go home, project is badly managed, bugs outnumber features, let&#x27;s start a new project, etc?)\nI&#x27;m curious what folks think is the cause of poor-quality buggy bloated &quot;modern&quot; software that is demonstrably worse than older software.<p>It&#x27;s not an improvement in technology, it&#x27;s simply that our modern world cares more about superficial animated menu openings than about performance.<p>Mind you, not ALL software follows this trend. Reaper still kicks A, but that&#x27;s because Mr. Frankl has a vision, integrity, and still maintains control lol<p>anyway, about chips and processes, it&#x27;s not about getting tinier and tinier, it&#x27;s about an intelligent design.\nAll the efficiency improvements in the process are wasted if the goal is to make a mega-poo-renderer that renders  0.1 turds per KW of power expended.<p>Controversial thought of the day:\nI will reckon that a simple interrupt driven event-loop on a microcontroller running all HID input is a million times more efficient than the convoluted way a context switching multitasking operating system handles the same under full load with full memory saturation.')
