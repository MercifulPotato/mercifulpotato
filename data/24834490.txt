But the main case for understanding churn to me is historical.<p>Last month we had 10 customers paying us $10 each. Two of them cancelled. I have gross churn of $20. That&#x27;s not a model, just a historical fact. What&#x27;s &quot;wrong&quot; with that calculation that these models solve?<p>I will definitely get different churn numbers if I look at groups of customers in cohorts based on when they first signed up, or enterprise-vs-SMB, or whatever. So I have reports to create all of those cohorts and show me the churn for each. I look at that data - with all the historical context - and make a decision about what to do next in the business. &quot;Selling to SMB&#x27;s was a good idea, but wow they churn a lot more. Let&#x27;s focus our marketing on enterprises this month.&quot;<p>To me the churn calculation at the top of the article is plenty useful. I&#x27;m not sure what value I&#x27;d get from these advanced models. If they just exist to predict future churn or LTV, that doesn&#x27;t seem particularly useful.')
