So I only have myself to worry about. Given COVID&#x27;s characteristics, I obviously don&#x27;t want to get it... but its more important for my parents to not get it.<p>The good news is I&#x27;m not entirely alone: only about half my family are on that thinking. I can lean with my younger-sister, who is a medical doctor, for the shock-and-awe strategy. She&#x27;s seen the issues first hand and can describe them in more detail than I ever could.<p>But these family COVID19 talks are non-trivial to talk about, and require strategy and preparation. Maybe others don&#x27;t care what happens to their family and just ignore it, but I lack that level of apathy.')
