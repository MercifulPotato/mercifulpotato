First off, you won&#x27;t silence them, you&#x27;ll just drive them to another platform or underground and in fact, likely give them even more credence (similar to the Streisand effect) - big tech just created a bunch of martyrs and &quot;forbidden speech&quot; and we all know how well it goes when things are &quot;forbidden&quot;, it just attracts more people who want to be martyrs as well.')
