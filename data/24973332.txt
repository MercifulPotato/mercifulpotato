Item(by='Supermancho', descendants=None, kids=[24974076], score=None, time=1604351043, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24972737, text='&gt; I happen to think total body count is a perfectly reasonable metric (one of many) for evaluating the risks inherent in various styles of thinking (or not thinking, as the case may be)<p>No. It cannot be used to evaluate &quot;risk&quot;, without quantifying what you mean by &quot;risk&quot; or even having something like full information. How much was (bad)luck? How much was inevitable, regardless if it was March 20 or 21 where the SEALs had cameras on the beach, waiting for them to appear? We will never have full information to understand what was going on, but the  stated reasonings behind the Iraq War, outside of the shoot-first Bush Doctrine^, were lies of convenience^^, at best. The thinking was not simple, nor were the <i>initial</i> motivations strictly good or bad. I would argue the outcome was bad.<p>^ If you don&#x27;t help us find the terrorists that ran into your country, you&#x27;re against US<p>^^ Knowing Iraq has used chemical weapons in the past, it was a bet that old weapons or evidence of them could be found...making a claim of WMDs convenient.')
