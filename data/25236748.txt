I was comparing it with the leetcode style format for junior-mid level engineers and system design for senior level. I would much rather prefer that over contract thing; and also my social bubble. Maybe I am biased.<p>Although, I do agree that sometimes engineers ask questions that they don&#x27;t expect to work on at the company. When I interview I ask questions (leetcode style because of the nature of systems involved) based on what problems we typically solve. I never go into advanced graph etc. But good understanding of basic data structures, understanding time complexity, testing is utmost important.')
