I think they&#x27;re two different things but they both sound the same.<p>If a person only likes the music of their generation then they don&#x27;t like music, they like nostalgia.<p>There&#x27;s music I liked as I was growing up, loved in fact, but listening to it now is like listening to myself talking about &quot;what I want to be when I grow up&quot;; it&#x27;s a child&#x27;s narrow perspective of the world.  Some music that I liked I&#x27;m embarrassed by, although I understand it was a journey to my musical appreciation of today, and so I&#x27;m deeply thankful for its part in that journey.<p>I&#x27;m not a particularly nostalgic person, so I&#x27;m immune to that effect of music, so I think I can offer a somewhat more objective viewpoint.')
