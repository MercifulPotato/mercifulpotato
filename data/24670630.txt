You enter your credentials -&gt; these are now in possession of the attacker. If you have 2FA enabled AND you use a security key, the key digitally signs the hostname of the site you&#x27;re browsing. This second factor won&#x27;t be valid on the real google.com site because it was created on the phishing site.<p>Phishing protection is a core feature unique to security keys, and it&#x27;s completely independent whether you keep the key in your laptop or you bring it with you.')
