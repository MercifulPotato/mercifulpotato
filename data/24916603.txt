One thing I donâ€™t understand in these comparisons is that Hitler was openly antisemitic very early on (as this article points out). Who is Trump openly against?<p>Immigrants and &quot;leftists&quot;, socially acceptable targets. As far as anti-semitism goes, politicians have learned not to be <i>so</i> open about it, although Trump has had his fair share of slip-ups in that regard[0], he&#x27;s never so overt that people can&#x27;t talk themselves out of believing he&#x27;s saying what they think he&#x27;s saying.<p>&gt;If Trump is Hitler 2.0, who are the Jews?<p>Again, immigrants and &quot;leftists,&quot; which thanks to the demonization of BLM as a violent &quot;neo-marxist&quot; organization, now includes any African Americans who openly object to systemic racism, although that&#x27;s just part of a long American tradition of delegitimizing black activism.<p>Also still the Jews. It&#x27;s always going to still be the Jews, but you&#x27;ll have to read between the lines when modern politicians complain about &quot;globalist bankers&quot; and &quot;New York liberals&quot; and &quot;cultural Marxists&quot; to get it.<p>[0]<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vanityfair.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;donald-trump-anti-semitic-remarks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vanityfair.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;donald-trump-anti-se...</a>')
