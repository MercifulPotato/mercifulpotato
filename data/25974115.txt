This would seem to have the nice side effect of setting a monetary value in IP lawsuits. If you declare that your property is worth $X when you file taxes, you couldn’t really argue that it’s worth $10X when suing over violations of it.<p>And frankly, I think IP <i>should</i> be taxed since holders rely on the government to protect it. If I have a house, it’s at least hypothetically possible that I can defend it myself. That’s not possible with intellectual property. So if holders are relying on that government to uphold its value, they should be expected to contribute proportionally to that value for the service.')
