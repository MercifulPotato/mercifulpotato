But many employers instead see my empty employment registry (in Brazil theoretically everyone has one) to interpret I never worked so they refuse to hire me in first place because I might lack experience.<p>Interviews don&#x27;t go much better, for example Amazon interview all of the interviewers asked questions about conflict resolution in large teams I worked with in the past. I suspect the reason I was not hired was this question, since was the only one I couldn&#x27;t answer at all.')
