Nations gave away sovereign, constitutional powers literally after their populations boldly rejected the terms, in a fair and open democratic processes.<p>Other European nations, verging on &#x27;voting no&#x27; were denied the chance precisely because the EU apparatus knew what the outcome would be.<p>There&#x27;s basically no defence of that issue, and the patronizing arguments defending &#x27;indirect&#x27; nature of democracy of the EU wear thin -  voters have no material impact on the EU, which is how it was designed, very much on purpose.<p>The limitation that MEPs have no ability to introduce legislation or frankly drive any of the real legislative process is by design.<p>It&#x27;s mesmerizing to watch legions of young people defend an undemocratic system that their ancestors literally fought for 2000 years to overcome, with literally millions dead. &#x27;Reason&#x27; lasted only one generation, before ostensibly well meaning actors took away the rights of the plebes before their eyes, and convinced them that it was in their best interest.<p>There is obvious need for reform, and if there was, I&#x27;ll bet Norway and UK would be part of it, and possibly even Switzerland.')
