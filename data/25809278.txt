Hell I was offered a role as a CTO. I turned that shit down. Babysitting others is not my forte, nor is spending my time running a business instead of learning more tech.<p>Am I supposed to be impressed by earning money coding at 12? I&#x27;m not. At all.<p>I assume this is what you are referring to ( Blastar for Spectravideo 318&#x2F;328 ): <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ia803005.us.archive.org&#x2F;4&#x2F;items&#x2F;blastar-elon-musk-spectravideo&#x2F;Blastar%20Elon%20Musk%20Spectravideo%20%28minus%20red%29.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ia803005.us.archive.org&#x2F;4&#x2F;items&#x2F;blastar-elon-musk-sp...</a><p>Link to source code instead of image: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;undone.se&#x2F;misc&#x2F;blastar.txt" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;undone.se&#x2F;misc&#x2F;blastar.txt</a><p>Some discussion about whether he is good at programming. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;How-good-is-Elon-Musk-at-programming" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.quora.com&#x2F;How-good-is-Elon-Musk-at-programming</a><p>It seems to amount to &quot;he wrote some basic and assembly language a long time ago.&quot;<p>I call nonsense. I&#x27;ve written over 3 million lines of code over my career spread across 8 different languages. If what exists of Musk&#x27;s code publicly means he is a programming genius then I must be a programming god.<p>By the way: I also wrote code at the age of 9. I was writing assembly language at 10. Despite this, what I did when I was a kid, or even middle age, doesn&#x27;t mean squat. What matters is consistently writing high quality code over your entire career. Being a manager is not being a coder. They are very different.<p>Also, he doesn&#x27;t have knowledge of what Signal services are doing internally so his comment is simply speculation.<p>You seem to hate my condemnation of his coding skills, but my condemnation of his twitter comment is no worse than his own mockery of Signal; a free service serving the community.<p>Elon Musk, afaiac is a rich asshole who doesn&#x27;t do shit to contribute. If he is so great, where is his free replacement for Signal that is far better hmm? He can certainly afford to hire some people who actually know how to code to write it for him.')
