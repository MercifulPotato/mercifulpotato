I expect them to get much longer.  I also expect this will free directors to cover topics and material that might not be appropriate for theatres.  What people are willing to watch when in public is different than what people may be willing to watch in their own homes.  I expect that Disney will have to run parallel focus groups, possible resulting in slightly different versioning between the streaming and in-theatre content.<p>Dune is a good example.  Dune has for decades been viewed as the quintessential impossible story to ever put on screen.  It was done best as a miniseries, and even then it wasn&#x27;t complete.  But an open-ended streaming option not subject to theatre&#x2F;TV time or content constraints?  There is potential for very interesting content.')
