Building on that, you can paint a picture they can understand.<p>I like the example of telling a person they need to keep eight words in their head all day long with no notes. Then they&#x27;ll be quizzed about those words randomly throughout the day. If they fail, they have to sit quietly in a chair for the next hour.<p>Then I ask them how pissed off they&#x27;d be if they were interrupted in the middle of a task by me asking them to list the words in reverse alphabetical order by the fifth letter. Repeat several times an hour with different sorting and filtering criteria.')
