Item(by='rayiner', descendants=None, kids=[25634564], score=None, time=1609744585, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25625570, text='I&#x27;m not &quot;equivocating&quot; I&#x27;m pointing out the two things are necessarily related. The executive&#x27;s primacy in making decisions about military strikes on a foreign battlefield may involve civilian decisions made in the U.S. But evidentiary privileges exist to protect those civilian decisions, because disclosure could undermine the military effort. The plaintiff is asking the government to disclose how it selects the people it chooses to attack on the battlefield. There is a clear military interest in not disclosing that. It may be the case that the military interest doesn&#x27;t outweigh the interest in allowing civilian litigation to proceed. But it&#x27;s an entirely legitimate think for the government to try and protect that decision making process from public scrutiny.<p>The Constitution describes a separation of powers. The executive has primacy when it comes to waging war. Courts have primacy in protecting the rights of individuals domestically. The Supreme Court has held that U.S. citizens outside the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S. have certain constitutional protections, which can be adjudicated by U.S. courts. That puts those spheres of power into conflict. On one hand, courts generally don&#x27;t get to second-guess the military&#x27;s targeting decisions. On the other hand, if a U.S. citizen alleges that the military is targeting strikes in a battlefield in an effort to kill him, that&#x27;s exactly what the court has to do.<p>Other developed countries also distinguish executive from judicial power, and domestic from foreign theaters. How they address this tension is illuminating, I think.')
