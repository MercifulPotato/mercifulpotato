The warrant will only be granted after presenting substantive evidence that the person they are wishing to arrest has committed serious crime i.e. possession &#x2F; distribution of indecent images of children, drugs, money laundering etc which required rapid entry to secure evidence.  They don&#x27;t get to enter your property for minor offences or on a whim.')
