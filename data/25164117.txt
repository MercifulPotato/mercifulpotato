Keeping up with mac OS and the trackpad was already quite hard, but CPU could be the killing blow.<p>Which could lead us in a few years to a situation where mac developers will face the same fate as ios developers : forced to buy hardware to sign their app, forced to push them on the mac app store, forced to give 15&#x2F;30% cut, forced to be removed whenever an app doesn&#x27;t feel &quot;right&quot; to apple, or a government strong enough to force Apple.\nAnd competitors will probably follow the trend, because Apple will have proven that it&#x27;s doable and profitable.<p>That future looks extremely scary. What can we do, now, as developers ?')
