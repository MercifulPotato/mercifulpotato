It&#x27;s a self-coup because they were told to go there by Trump, after Mike Pence told Trump he couldn&#x27;t do what Trump asked him to do, which was to just declare Trump the winner. i.e. ignore the state ascertained Electoral votes.<p>This is an autocratic movement. The legislature is an impediment to that. Maybe they envision a principate to give it the veneer of authenticity that an outright autocracy would not. That worked for the Roman Empire for ~250 years, people bought that it was still a Republic when it&#x27;s plain to history it was ruled by an emperor during this time.<p>Of course had it succeeded, no matter how it had, Trump would have accepted it happily. He doesn&#x27;t care about the Constitution or even the veneer of legitimacy. He just wants to win. Doesn&#x27;t matter how.')
