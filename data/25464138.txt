People were always complaining that the compiler was broken when the bug was in their code.<p>That being said we also got lots of <i>real</i> bug reports and sometimes you&#x27;d look at them and say &quot;how the hell does anybody compile code when this happens?&quot;  Of course really those cases were indeed bad but only infrequently triggered.<p>But they are codebases like any other and code has bugs.  I still find bugs every few months in various compilers.  Usually they are already known.<p>And code quality bugs are lower priority than conformance (accuracy) bugs.')
