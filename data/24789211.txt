I appear to have kicked a hornets nest, but as you say downvoting to show disagreement is just how things work here. For what it is worth, I did not down vote you either :-)<p>Your son reminds me a bit of me. I hated middle school, I went on in high school to to be a 3 sport varsity player and ultimately got into and through university as a D1 athlete. Post graduation I as a military dog handler. I hated middle school with a passion but that did not seem to hamper my career at all.<p>Your son sounds great, I was in the Army as well and I know and respect what he had to do to overcome the challenges of the Ranger crucible. Your son has already achieved far more than most could even dare.')
