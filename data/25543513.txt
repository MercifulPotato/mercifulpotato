There are several different approaches to bundle data files with a single executable, as the author probably knows it. My favorite one is AppImage. Even though, I&#x27;ve also looked into using alternative approaches to software distribution in the recent past, and ended up creating an extra section in the ELF file to store ancillary data. `objcopy --add-section &lt;params&gt; --set-section-flags &lt;params&gt;` appends the payload to the executable, and libelf can be used at some later point to retrieve the data back. Works like a charm, as long as you don&#x27;t let `strip` remove unneeded sections from that executable file.')
