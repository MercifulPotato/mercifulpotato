When Robert Wilson rang Paul Milgrom&#x27;s doorbell at 2:15 this morning, Milgrom&#x27;s wife, who&#x27;s in Stockholm, received a security-camera notification on her phone. She got to watch live as Wilson told Milgrom he&#x27;d won the #NobelPrize.<p>The most funny comment on it, in my opinion is:<p>- Knock, knock<p>- Who’s there?<p>- Nobel<p>- Nobel who?<p>- No bell - that’s why I knocked.')
