Opt in, opt out, switch it, change it, make it yours. Itâ€™s 100% digital, you know exactly what is covered and what is not, and you pay only for what you need when you need it.<p>Our tech stack is React&#x2F;React Native and Ruby&#x2F;Rails running on Heroku. We&#x27;re looking for engineers to help us build a more scalable frontend and backend so we can keep expanding to new insurance products and markets (we recently went live with car insurance in Germany among others). Insurance is one of those things a lot of people look at as boring, but we&#x27;re looking to make it easy and fun for people.<p>More info at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hellogetsafe.com&#x2F;career" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hellogetsafe.com&#x2F;career</a>')
