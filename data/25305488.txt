If the most you ever do is &quot;occasionally advocate against unfair policies,&quot; you certainly don&#x27;t get to pat yourself on the back much for helping anything or anybody.<p>If you replace the word fault with &quot;responsibility&quot; or even a more neutral &quot;influence&quot; it&#x27;s much more obvious, I think. You would clearly have less responsibility than the person advocating for said policies, but more than the person fighting them more vigorously or more effectively.<p>Nobody looks back and says &quot;boy, I&#x27;m glad there were all those people who occasionally complained about Windows in the late 90s,&quot; they look back and respect and value the people who built alternatives instead.')
