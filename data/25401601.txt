I&#x27;m not suggesting you should approve that, but it is categorically different.<p>As for your question, it makes a huge difference. While any weapon can be used to inflict harm (by definition), some make that significantly easier than others. It&#x27;s facile to ignore this and pretend all harms are equivalent.')
