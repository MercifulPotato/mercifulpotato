He says:<p>&quot;For example, we should care less if a proposed mobile chip or compiler optimization slows down SPEC, and care more if it speeds up Python or JavaScript!&quot;<p>But anything that impacts SPEC benchmarks (and the others we use for C code) is also going to impact Python performance. If you could find a new instruction that offers a boost to the Python interpreter performance that&#x27;d be nice, but it&#x27;s not going to change the bigger picture of where the language fit in.')
