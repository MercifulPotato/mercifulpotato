Having an iOS-style walled garden is a recipe for disaster, as the blessed version can be revoked and made unavailable by either the developer or the distributer, leaving the user out of the cold.  The main issue I run into is the lack of long-term reputation, and that things that scale (e.g. allowing any user to upload files) do so at the expense of trustworthiness.<p>I&#x27;d like to be in a position where I can recommend specific sites as safe and reliable, specifically when giving recommendations to less technically adept family&#x2F;friends.  However, with how quickly those reputations become stale (e.g. Sourceforge being bought out, then immediately burning its reputation by adding malware to downloads), that&#x27;s not something that really can be done without coupling to a hardware ecosystem as well.')
