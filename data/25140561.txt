Not the 5 nm process?<p>Let&#x27;s be real, it&#x27;s just on par with the Zen 3 in single threaded perf which is on a 7nm+ process.  When Zen 4 comes it might be moot.<p>AMD&#x27;s entire market cap is practically on par with Apple&#x27;s cash on hand (so very different companies in terms of size&#x2F;capability) yet they are equal in performance single threaded?  Not only that, in practical terms the AMD chip is very desirable in many situations because it has twice the cores.')
