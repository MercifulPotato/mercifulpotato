On the surface it should be trading well enough given it&#x27;s revenue growth from when it went public to now, however, the narrative of competing with both Microsoft and Google was a tough one to play down.<p>Revenue growth will slow down to below 20% in 2021 which basically starts to take DBX out of the high growth tech stock focus and it is trading at less than 5x 2021 revenue when the median is somewhere closer to the 12-14x range and that&#x27;s for companies below 30% growth.<p>The same was seen with Slack. Though they had great revenue growth, the narrative was that they couldn&#x27;t compete with Microsoft and so their stock never really traded at a comparable revenue multiple compared to others.<p>It could be said that they have a heavy spend on Sales and Marketing but the same could be said of plenty of other Enterprise tech focused companies like MongoDB that still commands a very high forward looking multiple.<p>Unfortunately from the end-user side the experience has suffered somewhat and I&#x27;ve personally switched away from Dropbox so I can&#x27;t really say they are doing great on the product side and the amount of &quot;Growth Hacking for Revenue&quot; that is now part of the product experience is a bit off-putting.<p>Also shows the potential for issues if you end up solely dependent on one product and don&#x27;t diversity, especially if it&#x27;s seen as a commodity.<p>The work force reduction is purely to turn the company profitable on a net basis and the trailing twelve months they&#x27;ve already gotten into the black. That&#x27;s down from a $400MM loss just a couple of years ago.<p>But the belief is that there isn&#x27;t a tremendous amount of profitability internally, because the expenditures are just too high, and cutting further into that theoretically will reduce revenue growth further.')
