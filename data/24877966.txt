A lot of people are harping on the internal podcast&#x2F; learning about how your boss thinks, but I think that&#x27;s actually <i>good</i> advice. Even in places with remarkably flat hierarchies, at the end of the day someone will have to settle ties, and knowing how those people think is a good practice to end unproductive discussions quickly. Besides, this isn&#x27;t any different from having a director with creative vision at the helm of your project: you need to meet that person&#x27;s vision, because that is really what matters. The podcast actually sounds great to me, because I&#x27;d prefer a slightly cringe-y &quot;how do you do, fellow kids?&quot; podcast over having zero or insufficient communication from leadership. It&#x27;s not like people make decisions for no reason, and knowing how they think can help you appreciate what went into one without having a knee-jerk reaction.')
