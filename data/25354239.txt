The reason for this is the basic render that I created is generic, and it is not what you should do to render your JSON. The render should fit perfectly with the JSON. The basic render is just for a quick start.<p>For example, the basic render &quot;# Title&quot; creates an h1 header, but if you created the render, you know the internal schema of the JSON, so you can use the correct HTML element for that without recurring to this hack.<p>But the principle is important: try not to use markup on the JSON, because this would make it difficult for others to consume your website with JSON.')
