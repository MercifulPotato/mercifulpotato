This prediction is even more solid now that we&#x27;ve identified hundreds of extrasolar planets in habitable zones, many of which orbit stars older than ours. We have no good explanation for why we don&#x27;t see aliens already even though we probably should, an observation known as the Fermi paradox.<p>It&#x27;s worth thinking about what effect this might have on culture, philosophy, religion, economy, etc. To give just one example of a huge implication: all of biological and human history would have to be re-evaluated from the perspective that the Earth is not a closed system.<p>Contact by radio should also be considered and is probably more likely, but physical contact either today or in the past would have wider consequences.')
