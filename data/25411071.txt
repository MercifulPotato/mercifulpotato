I get anaphylactic reactions to some food and medicines and carry an EpiPen. There are a few vaccines which have been counterindicated for me due to this so I have always thought it&#x27;s a relatively well-known potential side effect from at least some vaccines (and other medicines of course). As such I would have expected it to be looked&#x2F;checked for during safety trials.')
