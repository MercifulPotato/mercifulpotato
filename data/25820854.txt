That&#x27;s still not substantial enough currently to migrate a whole code base, in particular given that the libraries are also still not mature enough. The research group I&#x27;m working with also have no interest in adopting anything new, In fact most of our code is still in FORTRAN so that is something I would be more interested in migrating to Julia but I don&#x27;t think that is happening anytime in the next 10 years')
