(like we are seeing here)<p>The point I tried to make was - this short was done to drive price down to zero (it can do that with that large of a position) in collusion with negative media reports from friends... That is manipulation. And they got caught with their pants down.<p>I&#x27;m also not convinced on no naked shorts, we&#x27;ll see...<p>As for robinhoods closure of trade, they only disabled buy, not sale... as for reason, are you speculating? I did not see any clearing house comment. This was brought up by Cuomo as well in interview.<p>As for illegal on robinhoods part, we&#x27;ll see, there will likely be an investigation. Especially since they are owned by the company that bailed Melvin Capital out.')
