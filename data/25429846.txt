While it&#x27;s not mathematically inconsistent for the sentence to be redundant&#x2F;superfluous, it would be rather silly and misleading. It&#x27;s reasonable to assume it&#x27;s there for a reason (i.e. it makes a difference whether it&#x27;s there or not). Given they spell out pretty much everything else anyway, it would seem this point is where it would make a difference.<p>Moreover, I have a hard time justifying this on first principles. It seems rather arbitrary to make relational operators UB but make equality operators well-defined for unrelated objects. After all, if you can tell if two pointers to unrelated objects are the same, that means you&#x27;re willing and able to canonicalize them to a common-denominator representation, in which case you already have an ordering based on that same canonicalization too... why forbid that? It would make sense to prevent comparing pointers derived from unrelated objects (due to future performance &amp; extensibility considerations), and it would certainly also make sense to allow it (more convenient&#x2F;intuitive&#x2F;etc.)... but to allow one but not the other just doesn&#x27;t make sense as far as I can see it. You end up with something that&#x27;s both unintuitive for the user <i>and</i> restrictive for the implementation. So it&#x27;s a little tough to swallow that that&#x27;s really what they intended.')
