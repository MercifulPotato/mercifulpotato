Maybe they&#x27;re right. Maybe Elon is.<p>The problem is when you hold someone up on a pedestal and a cult of personality forms. That clouds your judgement and you lose your objectivity. It&#x27;s great if Elon is right, but if he isn&#x27;t I hope the fatalities, injuries, and property damages can be kept to a minimum and it doesn&#x27;t hamper better technologies from being implemented.')
