Everyone voting for Maine&#x27;s congressional election is using ranked choice, but only maine voters are using RCV to vote for president.<p>If they eliminate their states least popular candidates till one candidate has 50% then voters risk electing a federally unpopular candidate, in a winner take all election. In this case voters must vote strategically.<p>It seems Maine would have to wait for federal results and eliminate candidates that are not federally viable. How would this work with multiple states using rcv?<p>We need to abandon first past the pole  (and the electoral college) but how can we do it peicemeal?')
