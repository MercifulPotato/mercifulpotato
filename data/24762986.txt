I don&#x27;t really know what to make of some interesting case reports that some individuals make about being &quot;RF sensitive&quot; on a very rare basis; but I definitely don&#x27;t fall into that camp.<p>However, I have done some reading on the potential long-term health consequences of non-ionizing radiation and a lot of the research is inconclusive. I believe the general consensus from empirical data is that RF has not been shown to cause cancer, but, I feel like that&#x27;s a relatively low bar to meet. Certainly, there are no positive health effects to all of the extra radiation we are creating and exposing each other to; and the consequences may only be known in the future when we have more precise measurement techniques.<p>But yeah, even with that said, I don&#x27;t know if I consider it to be enough of a problem to warrant spending more than a few hundred dollars on.')
