Throw in another day or two for a private boat across the Bering Strait&#x2F;North Pacific.<p>9 days to basically drive around the entire world. 15000 miles. Just for giggles, my 2012 Honda CRV will get around 350-400 miles per tank of gas. We&#x27;ll drive conservatively at 60 mph to hit the full range. Depending on the cost of gasoline, I could drive around the entire world for about $1200. Maybe $1500 once I get into Europe. Insane!<p>Before cars, that same journey would take months moving non stop. A solo trip can now be done in about 2 weeks with an experienced driver.<p>Absolutely insane the cool stuff we can do with modern technology :)')
