Lenovo and Dell sell computers with Ubuntu or Fedora pre-installed, that have been tested and are guaranteed to be fully compatible with Linux.<p>This hasn&#x27;t always been the case.  System76 has been around since 2005.<p>&gt; Why would you go with System76, which is selling rebranded Clevo laptops with a markup, and PopOS, which is an Ubuntu derivative?<p>To support a company whose entire purpose is to provide hardware running Linux, as opposed to one which does it as a small niche within their much larger Windows-based business.')
