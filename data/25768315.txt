For instance, name how Ireland eased their lockdown for Christmas [1], how 45% of new cases are due to the UK-variant [2]. Given that, what could happen, based on data, that a similar event can happen in the US? Don’t just show a chart and say “I predict that there is a non-trivial chance that the same thing will happen in the US.”<p>If anyone went to the comments to see if this article is worth your time; I predict there’s a non-trivial chance you will find that it is not worth your time. Furthermore, I expect you’ll also not find the website worth 200$&#x2F;year.<p>The website looks pretty though.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-europe-55364744" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-europe-55364744</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irishpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;taoiseach-uk-variant-account-for-almost-half-of-all-covid-19-cases-in-ireland-201302" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.irishpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;taoiseach-uk-variant-account-...</a>')
