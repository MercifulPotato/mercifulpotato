They can tell that a speed limit sign for a service road visible from the highway is not the speed limit for the highway. They can guess what a sign covered in rust or sludge might have said based on the road conditions or the speed of other traffic or personal knowledge of the area.<p>And when the machine gets it wrong more often, you don&#x27;t want it to be overriding the human driver by force.')
