One is .net developers really want to work on Blazor, and other is that not many have experience. By &quot;choose boring technology&quot; standards, these are both red flags.<p>However, I wonder if it is more work to implement Vue than Blazor considering my existing stack and that much of app is already developed. Razor pages use the same syntax as Blazor.')
