Item(by='kbelder', descendants=None, kids=[25587863, 25587816], score=None, time=1609370814, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25580637, text='I self-published (through Amazon) a book of hexadecimal sudoku puzzles.  I think I coined the term &#x27;hexadoku&#x27;... there are other similar books now, but I think I was the first.  It&#x27;s made me maybe $100 a year for many years.  I did have the forethought to label it &#x27;volume 1&#x27;, but haven&#x27;t followed up on that.<p>I just realized a week ago that I should have made an app out of it.  I checked and somebody&#x27;s grabbed the name already.')
