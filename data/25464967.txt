(I took that as a reasoning why HN prefers twitter links rather than nitter - suppose that could easily be expanded though).<p>- potential legal reasons (? I can&#x27;t think of any but maybe HN respects the claim of twitter that the data belongs to them etc ...)<p>just speculation but fact is there is no nitter support on HN.')
