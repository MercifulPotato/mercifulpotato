Item(by='Kim_Bruning', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608496888, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25487740, text='Surely, Merit based metrics should be &quot;a part of this complete breakfast&quot;. However, focusing _purely_ on merit based metrics (pure Meritocracy) is not sustainable. It will break down and cease to reward merit almost immediately.  (for reasoning, see my previous post).<p>If you are using modern (western) societies as your example; you will see a sophisticated system of laws, subsidies, taxes, education and health investments, etc... which are all at least in part designed to prevent this breakdown and make sure that people who have something to contribute get a chance to contribute to society, and hopefully get justly rewarded.<p>The counter-intuitive part is that the outcomes are more Merit-based than are possible if you directly institute a merit based system. (It seems that policy outcomes are almost never intuitive)')
