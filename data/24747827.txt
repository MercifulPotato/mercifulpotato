People often ignore the political problems of nuclear power:<p>- Centralization of control encourages corruption and the hiding of incidents<p>- Power stations make excellent targets in case of war. The bigger they are, the bigger the impact<p>- Nuclear power stations also cause social panic if hit, even if the damage is minimal<p>- The last two points apply to war but also to terrorism<p>If we want political stability (aka no wars) we need reasonably decentralized access to food, water, energy and information.')
