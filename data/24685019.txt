Loan sharks, shady mechanics, and bail bondsmen are also extractive everymen.<p>Landlords extract the marginal difference between what people can buy and what people can rent. By participating in real estate markets, they leverage inequality of capital to overcharge renters beyond what the market would clear at without landlords.<p>I know most tax evaders are poor too, paid under the table. I&#x27;m sorry for them but I don&#x27;t forgive their theft from the rest of us. Likewise, I don&#x27;t forgive market-distorting landlords extracting rents from would-be buyers.')
