The UK is a part of our history and we will always have ties. I don&#x27;t think there is any will to give them preferential treatment over other trading partners. We are looking out for ourselves and any mistakes the UK makes they are going to have to wear like adults.<p>We are not getting the Empire band back together. I know modern conservatives have lost the plot but we can&#x27;t turn back time like that. CANZUK as popularly described is a complete fantasy.<p>The reality is as sovereign nations trying to have influence in our own regions, often with countries with their own experiences of colonialism, any signs of subservience to an ex-colonial power is far more of a hindrance than a help.<p>I do support stronger ties between Canada, Australia and NZ though.')
