She has a good number of students from low income families and the school where most of her kids came from before virtual is a Title 1 school. All the students doing the virtual program get a Chromebook and access to an internet connection (meaning they worked with Spectrum to get internet to families who didn&#x27;t have it or they get a wifi hotspot or they have community locations with wifi access). Some of these students are at a daycare, with family, etc. during the day while the parents work.<p>Now there are definitely inequalities in the school system don&#x27;t get me wrong but for my wife at least she cares deeply about that subject and tries her best to make sure each student has everything they need to succeed.')
