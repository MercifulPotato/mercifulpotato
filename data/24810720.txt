So first step is to tell people that you have the potential to solve their problems. So I recommend to start giving talks on (virtual) meetups, start publishing in some way (articles, blogs, podcasts, newsletter, video) either your own and&#x2F;or contributing to others.<p>3) When they start asking, make a 1h free.
