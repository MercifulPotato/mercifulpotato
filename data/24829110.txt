Item(by='rorykoehler', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603131180, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24825895, text='Most of it is new products. Every year during Chinese New Year a significant portion of our neighbours would throw away good but old unwanted furniture and no one would look twice at it. All the valuable stuff was already taken away by specialist &quot;karung guni&quot; (rag and bone men) for spares and stripping for scrap.<p>I did get some good second hand stuff on carousel. Scooter, baby chair, laptop. All super cheap though. My 3.5 year old mbp 13 cost me less than USD$800. Brand new battery and top case too. You&#x27;d never get that in Berlin where I am now but you will find an unending wealth of good secondhand products for sale. Stuff left on the footpath is gone almost immediately too.')
