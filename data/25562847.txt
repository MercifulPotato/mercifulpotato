I&#x27;m sure I might have left one or two hanging accidentally at some point.  OTOH, those 1 or 2 certainly never contacted <i>me</i> again, so I don&#x27;t feel terrible about being imperfect here, as long as I don&#x27;t ghost 99% of the time.  I figure that probably makes me better than most candidates and most recruiters in that respect, anyway.')
