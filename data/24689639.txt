One brother, Lutz Heck, eventually became a Nazi and his program became an official Nazi program. After an attempt to reintroduce some animals into German forests, he and Hermann Goering eventually went on a hunting expedition together for them. Heinz Heck, the other brother was imprisoned at Dachau. The result of his program is the current breed of cattle known as &quot;Heck cattle&quot;[0]. He was also responsible for the reintroduction of European Bison into the wild.<p>There are several other programs [1] that are attempting to reintroduce Aurochs, through a variety of methods.<p>[0] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Heck_cattle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Heck_cattle</a><p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Aurochs#Breeding_of_aurochs-like_cattle" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Aurochs#Breeding_of_aurochs-li...</a>')
