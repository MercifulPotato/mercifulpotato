There is light at the end of the tunnel.<p>FWIW, I&#x27;m also about a decade behind-the-curve because of childhood trauma. I&#x27;m reminded of it every day - peers within my age group have exceeded me in every imaginable way.<p>The cool thing though, is that your CS degree is going to empower you with a lethal skillset, whether or not you graduate. Especially if you keep practicing those social skills as you work on your studies.<p>I know this is a &quot;Tell HN&quot;, and I hesitate to offer unsolicited advice. But I&#x27;ll share with you, what I wish someone would have shared with me:<p>- Delayed career progression isn&#x27;t a big deal. Just frame it as an interesting story.<p>- You can make your story more interesting by learning to love and cultivate your skillset. Maybe reading Atomic Habits inspires you to build a personal habit-tracking application. That sort of thing is a powerful differentiator.<p>- You probably won&#x27;t use most of what you&#x27;re learning in academia. I wish I had supplemented by University studies with a coding bootcamp that taught me how to build real apps for real people.<p>- Interviewing is a total numbers game. It took me ~20 interviews to get an offer that excited me. My GPA was shit - but my side projects were interesting to the people who handled my interview loop.<p>- It sounds cliche, but defining a five-year vision (ie - working for a FAANG corp making $&gt;150k&#x2F;y) can help. You can split those years up into months, and those months up into weeks, and then determine what you should be measuring and working on to meet your targets every week.<p>I also wanted to thank you for the reminder to take care of my body. I&#x27;ve been getting lazy (easy with gyms closed) and your post was great reminder to resume measuring and improving my nutrition&#x2F;exercise habits. Much appreciated.')
