I don&#x27;t believe it any longer; I currently tend to believe that at least some copyright law is probably better for society than no copyright law.</i><p>I&#x27;ve gone back and forth on this as well, though my opinion has never been as extreme and uncompromising as breck&#x27;s.  I believe copyright law has gotten entirely out of hand, but agree with you that we probably should have <i>some</i> kind of copyright law.<p>&gt; <i>But they seem to be espousing it consistently.</i><p>Which is the problem, I think.  It just comes off as naive and foolish, and shows a lack of critical thinking or practical understanding of how the world works and why it works the way it does.<p>Regarding sympathy: Disney uses copyright to fuel its greed.  Foster uses it to make a decent living doing what he loves and believes will delight others.  Having no sympathy for Foster in this situation is heartless and cold; I have zero respect for anyone who would take that position.  Perhaps the other commenter is going overboard on hyperbole to suggest that breck has no sympathy for &quot;anybody&quot;, but a lack of sympathy for Foster in particular says some strongly negative things about breck&#x27;s character.  And there comes that critical thinking again: it is perfectly reasonable -- and desirable, in a healthy society -- to be sympathetic toward Foster while still uncompromisingly believing that IP law is unethical.')
