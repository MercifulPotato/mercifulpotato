Item(by='username90', descendants=None, kids=[25014366, 25014129], score=None, time=1604741294, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25012183, text='&gt; Remember what &quot;RPG&quot; used to mean in the 90s?<p>It meant the same as now. We do have sub genres like &quot;Action RPG&quot; or &quot;with RPG elements&quot;, we don&#x27;t call any game with RPG elements RPG&#x27;s.<p>So instead of calling any game with permadeath &quot;roguelike&quot; why not just say it has permadeath? Would cause less confusion.')
