The version of the paper I read did not feel like an early draft at all, but a final one.  This is just the excuse Emily Bender is using to avoid providing Technology Review with a copy of the paper.  You&#x27;re right; they wouldn&#x27;t have submitted an early rough draft for peer review at a conference (these aren&#x27;t amateurs we&#x27;re talking about here!).<p>The real reason I suspect she didn&#x27;t want the paper published is that the other 4 colleagues are still employees at Google and could get in trouble, seeing as how Google doesn&#x27;t want it published and all.')
