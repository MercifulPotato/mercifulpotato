The effects of being the worst and seeing others like you also being the worst for 4 years throughout college will create a stigma lasting a lifetime. The current system ensures that most black college students will be among the worst in their class. If instead we did race blind admissions then black students would get into less prestigious universities but they would perform just as well as everyone else at those universities, which would let us start working away the stigma against black students.')
