Item(by='jolincost', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610733453, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25790622, text='So what you&#x27;re saying doesn&#x27;t mean humans don&#x27;t go out at night, they just go hunt in packs, like I&#x27;m saying.<p>Why respond to the weakest version of what I&#x27;m saying and pretend like the point I&#x27;m making is wrong? You get that I think. Language is not &quot;rules&quot;, and &quot;pointing out exceptions&quot; is treating what I&#x27;m saying as &quot;containing that exception&quot;, which is an overly literal interpretation, that assumes the weakest version, and seems to lead to bad faith readings of comments as their weakest versions.<p>Don&#x27;t be so literal...this isn&#x27;t programming. Assume the best&#x2F;strongest version of what someone&#x27;s saying. That&#x27;s in the guidelines. I&#x27;m sure you already know (or can figure out) why that&#x27;s a good thing to do.<p>So...if you don&#x27;t care then why did you bring it up? Just to say you don&#x27;t care? I think that&#x27;s might be a problem you have. Not caring. If you&#x27;re going to respond to someone, I think you should care for what they said, otherwise you might say something stupid. Like this case in point.<p>So you respond to that by trying to reframe it and pretend I&#x27;m &quot;venting&quot;, and also that you invite me or &quot;give me permission&quot; to do that. Yeah, like I need your permission, of course I don&#x27;t. And if you don&#x27;t care, why do this reframing where you are like the one &quot;giving permission&quot; ... to give yourself more status? Which is obviously ridiculous, as you&#x27;re of course not ever giving me permission to talk, and I don&#x27;t ever need that from you, and I don&#x27;t need to be &quot;invited&quot; by you in order to reply. You chose to make your comment, and I choose to make mine. Who do you think you are talking like that?<p>So...I&#x27;m not &quot;venting&quot;, I&#x27;m just saying whatever I choose to say, which in this case happens to be a specific metacommentary criticism of you responding to the weakest version. So you (and your reframing) might want to pretend this is entirely about something other than you, and pretend that I must just need to &quot;vent&quot; about something entirely unrelated to you, but in fact what I&#x27;m saying is directly talking about what you did. I understand that might be hard for you  to face, but I think reconsidering your pattern of &quot;trying to point out&quot; exceptions, will lead you to make better, more caring and more high value comments. I&#x27;m sure you can do that.')
