I&#x27;m just giving another data point. There are numerous places for latency to be introduced in game streaming: encoding, decoding, local network, WAN, etc. An extra 15 seconds on your ping is a HUGE deal for playability in game streaming. 20 ms might be an awesome ping for CS:GO, but for something like Stadia you&#x27;re going to feel that negatively.')
