You seem to depict companies that were doing this as &quot;below board&quot;, while you as &quot;above board&quot;. This is certainly true now, but before the changes both would have been a grey area - I don&#x27;t see much of a difference.<p>Would I be correct saying that you&#x27;re happy because in one stroke Apple has moved you from grey area to explicitly permitted, and part of your competition from grey area to explicitly forbidden?<p>For the record in no way I think that Apple took this decision to favor you or anyone else except themselves. It just seems that you won a regulatory lottery.')
