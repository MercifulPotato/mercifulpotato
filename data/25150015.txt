In an environment where a captive portal is active you can ensure that only one DHCP server is running in your segment with no rogue DHCP servers. So telling a client with DHCP that a captive portal is active, and with URL to show it, is sane. This would eliminate a lot of stupid probing done by clients.\nSame goes for announcing DoT&#x2F;DoH servers that way.<p>The same applies for your &quot;home&quot; environment. Since you usually don&#x27;t want to run multiple DHCP servers, this would also work there.')
