My wife is at school teaching right now, they&#x27;ve had exactly 1 day this school year where she didn&#x27;t have to go to work (earlier this week) because 3 students physically cut the internet going into the building and they couldn&#x27;t get repairs done in time to open that day.<p>Edit: I don&#x27;t understand the downvotes... many schools across the country have been open for in-person school for the bulk of covid.
