Item(by='js8', descendants=None, kids=[25441569], score=None, time=1608116443, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25440065, text='Here&#x27;s what I do, for example:<p><pre><code>  import qualified Data.List as DL\n  import qualified Data.Map.Strict as DMS\n</code></pre>\nand then in code, I use DL.foldl&#x27; or DMS.foldl&#x27; as needed. Not sure if that answers your question, though. (I also use classy-prelude, it&#x27;s the best IMHO.)<p>You can also create your own functions as synonyms, if you feel like, it&#x27;s easy and compiler has no issue with that. I often do that for structures (defined with &quot;type&quot;) that I use in a module, to increase legibility.<p>Finally, the record dot syntax is becoming accepted to Haskell, it might help in writing IDEs that suggest methods based on types. (Peyton Jones explained somewhere that it&#x27;s one of the advantages of method syntax, that it helps to show available methods.)')
