If I remember correctly, his observation was that the hardest place to hitchhike was northern Europe, and that by comparison poor and even war-torn places were quite easy. The suggested explanation was that in northern Europe, the expectation is that if you are hitchhiking and relying on strangers, then you&#x27;ve done something weird to fall outside of the normal run of things, and you must be a weirdo. By contrast, in more chaotic places it&#x27;s more plausible that you have just fallen through some cracks that anyone could fall through, and it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to need a lift (or a meal, or some other helping hand).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;conversations-with-tyler&#x2F;tyler-cowen-juan-villarino-travel-hitchhiking-culture-c4e69e38d622" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;conversations-with-tyler&#x2F;tyler-cowen-juan...</a>')
