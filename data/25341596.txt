Item(by='Retric', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607399940, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25341122, text='&gt; But a high peacetime accident rate, even if lower than the accident rat that would be acceptable in wartime, demonstrates an institutional incapacity to operate as directed successfully, which is a severe warfighting liability.<p>Or simply a vastly different set of priorities.  Navy ships are generally supposed to  operate as a unit as their threatened by a host of over the horizon missiles, supersonic aircraft etc.  In a very real way crashing into unknown ships isn&#x27;t something that’s considered as a meaningful risk.<p>The root cause of these safety issues is however deeper. Militaries are constantly cycling both technology and people through positions.  The specific implementation of training and UI where at fault for these crashes which is directly addressable.  However, the institutional approach of using new people and technology has huge upsides in war.  You need to be able to quickly replace losses in warfare so you need to rely on training not experience, and you need to test that this training is effective. Similarly, you can’t rely on proven technology and it’s proven training because new threats are constantly arriving.<p>That&#x27;s directly going to cause accidents and while minimizing them is important, the long term tradeoff is considered worth it.')
