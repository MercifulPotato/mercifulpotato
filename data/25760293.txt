Item(by='Nextgrid', descendants=None, kids=[25761633], score=None, time=1610533668, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25760239, text='&gt; How is all of this supposed to be determined at a return counter in the 2 min interaction between a retail employee and customer?<p>That&#x27;s not a valid reason for introducing yet another data collection scheme that&#x27;s likely to have hidden biases and false positives, not to mention the potential of this data being leaked or exploited for other nefarious purposes (do you really trust a retailer <i>not</i> to secretly use this data for other purposes like marketing).<p>&gt; As a customer, I would not like to buy an item that did not come from the factory. Especially anything electronic, there’s almost no way for me to discern if someone has damaged it otherwise. I also don’t see how manufacturers could be held liable for warranties if they aren’t sure one the chain of custody.<p>Is this currently a major problem at big box stores (excluding Amazon because they intentionally ignore the issue)? I personally can&#x27;t remember a single occurrence of me buying goods in a supermarket that ended up being used&#x2F;damaged in a way I could tell.<p>&gt; If retail businesses had pricing power, they would be asking for more than razor thin profit margins. Retail executives aren’t currently turning away dollars from their pocket, they don’t have access to them in the first place since competing retailers will take their business if they try to.<p>And yet money is still being pissed away in marketing, which means they do have money to spare. Why do you think the savings would trickle down to the consumers instead of just being &quot;invested&quot; into either marketing or something else?<p>Starting a supermarket isn&#x27;t an easy task; the barrier of entry and the upfront costs (for the retail location alone) is insane, so I find it hard that competition would prevent this. Possibly over several decades it <i>could</i> translate to your goods being a few dozen cents cheaper, but I&#x27;d rather not live in a world where you need to &quot;Login with Facebook&quot; to be able to return an item.')
