However, I still don&#x27;t know how.<p>One idea would be to add an .attribute, e.g. if.get - and <i>then</i> have it return a value.<p>Or, use a different function altogether.<p>But then we&#x27;d have, 3-4 if&#x27;s. That sounds like a bit of an overkill, I admit.<p>I&#x27;m absolutely open to ideas :)')
