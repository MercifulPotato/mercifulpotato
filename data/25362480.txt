Choosing means making a choice.<p>Youtube has been called a &quot;radicalisation engine&quot; with some evidence for that (search terms: &quot;youtube radicalization&quot;, &quot;Algorithmic Extremism&quot;). This might just be a terrible consequence of &quot;maximising engagement&quot; rather than pushing a fixed political agenda.  But evidently, they want to do better.')
