But NMF proved more understandable since negative dimensions in PCA are hard to interpret. I didn&#x27;t consider UMAP, but would be interested to see how it performs here.<p>It should be easy, yeah. for NMF, the activations vector is reshaped from (layers, neurons, token position) down into (layers&#x2F;neurons, token position). And we present that to sklearn&#x27;s NMF model. I would assume UMAP would operate on that same matrix. That matrix is called &#x27;merged_act&#x27; and is located here:\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jalammar&#x2F;ecco&#x2F;blob&#x2F;1e957a4c1c9bd49c203993a23ada18b7f2cc0869&#x2F;src&#x2F;ecco&#x2F;output.py#L536" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jalammar&#x2F;ecco&#x2F;blob&#x2F;1e957a4c1c9bd49c203993...</a>')
