Things like mobile legends and pubg all have timed and daily rewards for signing and other tasks. Stuff like upgrading stats 1 time a day, playing a match of each type, spending virtual money on the store each day, playing their roulette games, spending actual money.<p>All of that ends up becoming a daily ritual that keeps you logging into the game whether or not you intend to play it...then well once you&#x27;re there, you might as well just play a quick match, the game&#x27;s open anyway.')
