Item(by='tathougies', descendants=None, kids=[25743200], score=None, time=1610432878, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25742866, text='Fascism is quite literally the merger of corporations with government (see corporatism [1]). In non-Nazi Fascist countries, such as proto-fascist pre-Anschluss Austria and Mussolini&#x27;s Italy, the government was organized such that individuals and &#x27;stakeholders&#x27; (i.e., companies, unions, and guilds) were given a say in government. In interviews with NYT journalists, this is the eventual structure that even Adolf Hitler also had in mind after the revolution was through [3].<p>Yesterday, we saw the American corporate board take actions that used to be the sole purview of a government. They did this at a time while the current administration (the one they harmed) pursues anti-trust lawsuits against them. This is a clear blurring in the distinction between the incoming administration&#x27;s government and corporations. The incoming administration would do best to criticize the banning of their opposition. Not only would it make them look like they&#x27;re taking the &#x27;higher road&#x27;, it would put them in line with other major liberal western powers, such as Germany, France, etc, all of whom have condemned what happened yesterday. However, instead, we have seen the embrace of these corporate actions by the new congress. It is especially concerning when the incoming president took more donations than his opposition from large corporations [2].<p>This is very concerning, and -- unlike the constant doom-predictions of &#x27;fasciscm&#x27; of the last four years, which have been made without any attention paid to the history of fascism -- brings us closer to actual fascism -- that is to say, the merger of corporations, unions, and government -- than any action of the last four years. That is not to say we&#x27;re Nazi Germany by any means (for that we&#x27;d have to start injecting the language of racial superiority into the picture), but I just want to point this out. The number of people cheering uncritically (especially those in government) is incredibly concerning.<p>References:<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fascism#Corporatist_economic_system" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Fascism#Corporatist_economic_s...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;20&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;joe-biden-donors.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;20&#x2F;us&#x2F;politics&#x2F;joe-biden-don...</a>\n[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;timesmachine.nytimes.com&#x2F;timesmachine&#x2F;1933&#x2F;07&#x2F;10&#x2F;119446081.html?pageNumber=6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;timesmachine.nytimes.com&#x2F;timesmachine&#x2F;1933&#x2F;07&#x2F;10&#x2F;119...</a><p>Exact quote since it&#x27;s behind a paywall:<p>&quot;Asked if, after four years or twenty years of dictator ship, he foresaw the resumption of parliamentary government in Germany, the Chancellor [Hitler] paused: &#x27;Yes,&#x27; he said finally, &#x27;but with a Parliament of another and better type, in which representation will be on a technical basis. Such a development is the Italian corporative State.&#x27; (this is what I reference above on Wikipedia)')
