The other half the stability of the standard library, before Java 9 it was very rare to remove anything from it. I recall things like a RCS or SCCS revision tag which was accidentally put in a public static field, and it was kept frozen (with the same value) as a public static field just in case someone was using it for some bizarre reason.<p>Starting with Java 9 things changed, many things were removed (starting with all of J2EE) and other things are going to be removed soon. This is one of the reasons why it takes so long for projects to migrate from Java 8 to Java 9 and beyond.')
