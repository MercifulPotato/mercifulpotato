Intel CPUs have been doing macro fusion for years. And they had to tack that on in hindsight. I don&#x27;t see why RISC-V cannot make this much simpler than Intel since they are deliberately designing their instructions to work well with macro-op fusion, something Intel never did.<p>If Intel is able to do it I have trouble seeing why RISC-V cannot do it when they are even planning for it. I don&#x27;t buy this complexity argument at all. It doesn&#x27;t add up.')
