It tends to assume that you have some understanding of Linux in general I think. You won&#x27;t find app stores or wizards everywhere trying to shepherd you along for basic tasks.<p>Ubuntu&#x2F;Mint will do just fine for those users. They have all of that stuff and online forums to field questions.<p>Once folks have adjusted and decide to use Linux for the long-haul they will start trying various distros on their own and land wherever they like.')
