In my case the TV cable decoder just stopped working for whatever reason a year and a half ago and I never really managed to call the TV cable company to tell them to come and fix it.<p>I can still watch football (soccer) matches by casting from my computer to the TV and we do have a Netflix account (which we don&#x27;t even use that heavily) shared with a close friend but that&#x27;s about it.
