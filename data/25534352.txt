I currently own a early 2011 13 Inch MacBook Pro. Almost a decade old it has been my goto machine. It has served me well for my technical &amp; non-technical workflows. But due to lack of software upgrades it makes sense now to upgrade. In the recent times I have been mainly using it for browsing &amp; other document processing tasks. And, Thatâ€™s where the confusion begins.<p>The new M1 Macbook machines are phenomenal in the public benchmarks. But they are a overkill for the activities that I do. After all the current MBP is still a workhorse except for a sloppy battery and of course the OS can no longer be upgraded.<p>As an alternative I was also looking at iPad Air 4th generation. With the new iPadOS, it has all that I need to replace my MacBook Pro. After assessment I settled for iPad Air 4th generation. Saved a few hundred dollars and an option to upgrade to M2&#x2F;M3 Macbook, and ample time to allow for it to gain support and get stable.<p>So far it appears to be a good decision. Tell me how often do you upgrade and what are your main points on which you decide.')
