Is it just like the ClickHouse benchmark from earlier, where they read from a `CREATE TABLE [...] ENGINE = AggregatingMergeTree`?<p>Post-reading:<p>&quot;faster queries via continuous aggregates&quot;. So is this it? I couldn&#x27;t find how tables &#x2F; materialized views were created in the source though [1].<p>TimescaleDB is probably a very good product (and pg-compatible!), but producing such articles hiding the usage of a magic feature is sort of dishonest. Why not make an article directly on the power of the feature? It&#x27;s hurting their brand reputation a bit.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;timescale&#x2F;tsbs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;timescale&#x2F;tsbs</a>')
