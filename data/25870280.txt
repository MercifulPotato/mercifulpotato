Most recognize that there were legitimate protests and protesters there, but are opposed to the violence that broke out in both cases.<p>I think the main difference between people in the parties is in what percentage of the protesters they believe were peaceful in either case, and perception of who was behind each of the protests. Oddly, I would say both are near mirror images of each other, just holding to &quot;their team&quot;-- but mostly condemning the violence even if they support the wider cause or grievances.')
