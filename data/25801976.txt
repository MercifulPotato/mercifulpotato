How many independent battery tech companies are there, and how many have scaled?<p>Also, maybe different technologies have different rates of patent cost increase - so that way the more expensive to get going sectors for technology dev have a longer runway or grace period.<p>There are lots of ways to make things flexible. Andrew Yang also suggested making government rewards for technology development, so instead of a patent for some type of technology you get say $10,000,000 - or maybe even $1 billion if your tech meets whatever benchmarks spec&#x27;d.')
