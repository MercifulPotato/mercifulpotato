Managing code history in a distributed manner, handling conflicts and allowing cooperative coding is not an easy problem to fix.<p>Having said this, Git doesn&#x27;t make it easy by the terminology and concepts that are used. And also the inconcise UI (you use git reset for a lot of very different actions, some harmless, some very destructive) doesn&#x27;t make it easy for a newcomer. Who will often resort to just remember oneliners or look them up from a manual without knowing what they actually do.<p>What really helped me in understanding Git was to understand the mechanics of the database on an abstract level. Commits and how branches&#x2F;tags relate to them. If you understand that commits (not branches) are the tree and the branches just post-it&#x27;s you put on the commits and can rearrange as you please everything becomes much more malleable. Once you discover commits are hardly ever deleted&#x2F;lost, but just the post-it&#x27;s are moved (which makes the commits invisible), things become easily recoverable and fixable. Also not using code, but cats[1] also seems to greatly reduced the complexity of learning Git for me. Visual tools like Ungit[2], Tig[3], or plain Git log[4] help to see the commit tree and attached branches and gives an idea of how the data is manipulated.<p>There is also the Gitless[0] project which tries to redefine the UI of Git, without changing the data format itself. It offers a different look at the same repository and more clear and dedicated commands&#x2F;concept to perform certain tasks. And since it just uses Git itself underneath you can seamlessly switch between it and Git without issues.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitless.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;gitless.com&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;girliemac.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;12&#x2F;26&#x2F;git-purr&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;girliemac.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2017&#x2F;12&#x2F;26&#x2F;git-purr&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FredrikNoren&#x2F;ungit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;FredrikNoren&#x2F;ungit</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jonas&#x2F;tig" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jonas&#x2F;tig</a><p>[4] git log --oneline --decorate -50 --all --graph --remotes')
