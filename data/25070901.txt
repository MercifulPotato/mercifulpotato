Item(by='at_a_remove', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605195138, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25069644, text='At this one job, we had only two remotely viable candidates for an open position.  I was on the hiring committee, as I often was in those days.<p>Candidate A: Had worked in the industry, had all of the qualifications, already chock-full of some interesting ideas I wanted to hear more of from the interview alone.  Excited at the prospect.<p>Candidate B: Had never worked in the industry, had only a handful of qualifications, barely responsive.  Seemed indifferent to getting the job.  Additionally, not too fluent in English, to the point where it was more than a little difficult to communicate.<p>Candidate A was a white man, Candidate B was a recent immigrant and a woman.  The immediate supervisor for the position -- a woman -- wanted Candidate A, as did most others.  However, the person running the show said, out loud I might add, that our group already had &quot;too many pale males.&quot;  I would like to repeat that: <i>too many pale males</i>.  A significant glance was then cast at me and the guy in the wheelchair on the hiring committee, both being not-particularly-dark men.  Presumably by &quot;virtue&quot; of our disabilities we would automatically be down for the Diversity Squad.<p>Candidate B was hired and turned out exactly as she was in the interview: disinterested in doing the job, lacking even some bare understanding of how to accomplish many things, always trying to find ways to do her grad school homework while on the job and pushing off her duties on someone else, rather than trying to learn her tasks.  Her poor English was a significant barrier.  She remained a leaden weight until she went off to be someone else&#x27;s problem.  She wasn&#x27;t a drag due to her skin color or sex, but she was hired because of those things.<p>My guess is that this kind of discrimination (I use that word specifically) goes on all the time in at least some segments of the industry.')
