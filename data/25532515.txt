My mistake was using LR and never tried something else for long time and wonder why my color grading skill wasn&#x27;t improved that much. Once I import the same photo to Capture One and grading color the same way I do in LR, I was having a stupid face because it&#x27;s so much better in anyway in Capture One. It&#x27;s amazing.<p>It&#x27;s wise that they added the heal and clone tools, many people only use those two in PS.')
