Not whether there Lineage OS or similar is as good as iOS.<p>You can install whatever operating system you want on a Laptop or a PC. You can already run other ROM images on Android (though some phones you have to root the device which is not okay.<p>It isn&#x27;t about an OS already being there. It being able to run whatever OS might be available.<p>&gt; No, it&#x27;s exactly your belief. Apple doesn&#x27;t advertise it to you that way, they doesn&#x27;t say you&#x27;ll be able to run whatever you&#x27;d like on it, so I dunno where did you get this misconception that they should provide you such an ability.<p>There is no misconception on my part. If you look up what makes a general purpose computer, that includes things such as PC, laptops, servers and smartphones. The iPhone has all the properties that make it one.<p><i>So whether you like it or not, it fits all the criteria</i>. It doesn&#x27;t matter what Apple market it as or whether they artifically lock it down. That doesn&#x27;t fundamentally make it a different thing.')
