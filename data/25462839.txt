You created this persona and you promoted it and shared with the world when it suited you and enjoyed the wealth and fame.<p>According to Khalifa she made $12K in porn @ $1000&#x2F;scene, Bangbros claims $178K over two years; in either case not exactly notable wealth. And the fame included wider public death threats, being publicly disowned by her family, etc.<p>Really, it seems more like pursuing what you think is cake and discover fairly quickly is cow dung and regretting and fleeing from it, more than having your cake and eating it to.')
