For example you now need to manage application state which is not a trivial problem on large projects. You also need to replicate native browser UX if you&#x27;re serious about making a good SPA (eg: your forms are filled when going back, the content and scroll position are preserved when going back, etc).<p>As for the duplicate template problem, this is easily solved by doing SSR + hydration. I concede this is generally complex to set up (unless using something like Next.js) but it&#x27;s worth it IMO. It&#x27;s really the best of both worlds (MPA vs SPA). You are still creating components and having a sophisticated interactive UI just like in the SPA world, but front end development is greatly simplified since you&#x27;re only dealing with one page at a time. Also, in many cases, you might not even need an API. How many times have you create an API only to feed your SPA? It&#x27;s a lot of overhead.<p>Also these days I don&#x27;t think the decoupling argument is so strong unless you&#x27;re working on a complex project with multiple teams.')
