I suspect that getting exposed to a forest environment; cold, bacteria&#x2F;molds in the air,  sunshine, and so on might matter too. Even possibly eating gamely animals.<p>I grew up on a farm, so I know that dogs that are kept outdoors, act differently than dogs that are kept indoors.<p>They are more aggressive, appear fitter, and smarter.  I suspect their brains might develop differently from living outdoors.')
