Speaking strictly for Romania (from where I&#x27;m from) the Bucharest underground in the 1980s and almost all of the big hydro-dams projects (which also require extensive tunneling work) were carried with Romanian engineers only (we received the help of the Soviets in the early 1960s for the hydro works, though). And to be honest that question in itself is a little &quot;orientalist&quot;, but I&#x27;ll just pass over that part of the post.<p>&gt; If there are then good for them, but I still don&#x27;t get why qualified people would accept so little<p>Because wages are still pretty low in countries like Romania (and I guess in Poland and Bulgaria too, to give just a few examples), $30 per hour is more than enough. Plus the engineers themselves alone are no good, the project is based on the people who actually have to dig the stuff out, for them $30 per hour is double more than enough.')
