Cobalt is a bigger bottleneck resource.  Without details, it&#x27;s hard to know if this Toyota battery require cobalt (or some other expensive rare-earth mineral).  Most lithium-ion chemistries require cobalt, and a lot of the advances and cost improvements in recent years have been around figuring out how to use less.  LiFePO4 doesn&#x27;t use cobalt at all, but has mediocre energy density.')
