It’s got a soft cotton content and is used to keep wires taped to things like rugs seamlessly so that people walking around your studio&#x2F;tv-station&#x2F;theatre etc don’t accidentally trip on it, potentially damaging the extremely expensive attached equipment in the process. If you’ve ever tried using “duct tape” as gaffers tape, you’d have a bad time, as it wouldn’t be that great at keeping wires down AND it’s likely to leave a residual adhesive on the floor when you take it off.<p>Duck tape is the stuff developed for the US army to waterproof things closed. Post-war, they made it silver instead of green and marketed it for use with ducts (since being waterproof made it also SEEM like a good candidate for the job in heating systems), but its pretty terrible for this purpose since temperature changes degrade the adhesive rapidly.<p>The tape you actually want to use for ducts is foil-backed tape.<p>In short, it was and still is a great marketing gimmick, but Duck Tape was only ever “ok” at keeping things water proof and only <i>looks</i> like gaffers tape or the tape you want to use on ducts.')
