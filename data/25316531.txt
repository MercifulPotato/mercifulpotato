I make slides with graphics, with weird arrows, boxes and call outs, images tiled in a particular way, and many custom things. They&#x27;re more graphical than textual because slides aren&#x27;t about people reading them - they&#x27;re already listening to you and simultaneously listening + reading is difficult for the audience. Slides should show visual relationships of your talking points. Use graphics to show architecture, hierarchy, dependencies, etc. Use images to give context. Can it be done programmatically? Sure, if I spend 4 hours customizing my code. I&#x27;d rather fire up Powerpoint or Google Slides and roll with it. Also, I present once a quarter, I never found these automatic slide generators useful but I presume if you&#x27;re presenting concise&#x2F;textual information often, it can be useful.')
