Schmidt was CEO until 2011. YouTube got out of control with disinformation mostly after 2011. And he probably had almost nothing to do with YouTube in the five years he was CEO after Google purchased YouTube.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t blame Schmidt much for YouTube&#x27;s disinformation problem. I&#x27;d blame the people directly running YouTube (especially people running it recently &#x2F; now).')
