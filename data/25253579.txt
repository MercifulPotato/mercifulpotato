J will  automatically work out the inverse for me, as you can see below:<p><pre><code>       f=:(1+*&amp;2)\n       f 1 2 3 4\n    3 5 7 9\n       (f^:_1)f 1 2 3 4\n    1 2 3 4\n       (f^:_1) 1 2 3 4\n    0 0.5 1 1.5\n</code></pre>\nNow obviously not every function is bijective or even if bijective, trivial to invert -- and J doesn&#x27;t (or at least didn&#x27;t) have a super well specified way of computing those generalized inverses. But still: &quot;under&quot; is actually pretty cool, even just conceptually I find it quite valuable.')
