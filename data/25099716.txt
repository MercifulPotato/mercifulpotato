They seem to have even developed their own &quot;secret language&quot;, calling white people &#x27;mayos&#x27; and &#x27;yts&#x27; - maybe to get around filters? Or just to be extra edgy.<p>I would argue that pushing some justification of murdering fellow citizens because of their net worth is just as dangerous as the insane conspiracies about lizard people... if not more.  Yet, I don&#x27;t think these things are shut down or given the same standards as what you&#x27;re thinking of.<p>I wish for twitter (and everyone else&#x27;s sake) they equally applied their &quot;TOS&quot;. I have no need to go to those sites you mentioned... in fact I can&#x27;t think of anything less productive but on the flip side of the coin, I&#x27;ve pretty much deleted twitter for the same reason.')
