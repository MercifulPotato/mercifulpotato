Item(by='sershe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606936467, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25271972, text='I guess Spokane went downhill, I&#x27;ve last been there several years ago and the comments also seem to say the last couple of years homeless population exploded. Still, they seem to be describing abandoned parts of a shrinking city, not the entire place. In SF it&#x27;s all over (I&#x27;ve lived in SOMA and Inner Richmond, and worked near Union Square). I&#x27;d expect the fact that SF is swimming in money (compared to Spokane) would have an opposite effect. So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that &quot;every city has problems&quot;. Even the cities on the same train line as SF don&#x27;t have the same problems, nor do better run cities with less money with good weather (Texas, Utah, Florida). Same deal with Seattle, quickly going downhill with increasingly progressive City Council and major, while less-progressive cities across the bridge are doing just fine; and even stereo-typically poorer cities to the North and South don&#x27;t look nearly as bad.')
