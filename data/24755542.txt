How many engineers does Microsoft have working on the Windows kernel? A kernel that, from a business standpoint, is adding little value to Microsoft?<p>Obviously Windows isn&#x27;t going away - but how many of Microsoft&#x27;s customers would know that their kernel has been swapped out when the UI and all the applets look identical? As far as they&#x27;re concerned the switch could have already happened! All they care is the look-and-feel is the same and their applications still run. They don&#x27;t care about the kernel.<p>It&#x27;s not a matter of <i>better</i>, it&#x27;s a matter of <i>good enough</i> and saving on expenses. Presumably those engineers could be better utilized somewhere that&#x27;s generating more revenue.<p>That&#x27;s the bottom line.')
