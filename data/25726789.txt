Laptops are, by design, a finished product, and it is a lucky happenstance, if it (and what) can be upgraded for a variety of reasons.<p>My 2008 Sony Vaio VGN-Z17GN laptop is, technically, upgradable. But, the chipset does not support more than 4Gb of RAM, and I already have 4Gb installed. So I do not have the RAM upgrade option. I replaced a HDD with a SDD years back, and it was a fairly risky enterprise with a high chance of the laptop incurring a permanent damage due to how the Vaio keyboard is wired up with the mainboard. The laptop is still very much usable even for moderate development activities since it has been running Linux for years.<p>Other laptops have their own quirks or limitations of sorts. Now, a few random picks amongst contemporary laptops (Lenovo and Acer):<p>Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 5: 8 Gb (i5-10210U CPU) or 16 Gb (i7-10510U CPU) of <i>soldered on</i> RAM and 512 Gb Opal2 NVMe (no information on the SSD upgradability). The 16Gb RAM &#x2F; 512 Gb configuration is AU$1,100+ more expensive than the 16Gb &#x2F; 512 Gb 13&quot; Macbook Pro M1 (AU$1,699).<p>Lenovo ThinkPad X390 Yoga: i7-8565U CPU, 8Gb of <i>soldered on</i> RAM, 256 Gb NVMe (no information on the SSD upgradability). It is AU$400+ more expensive than the 16Gb &#x2F; 512 Gb 13&quot; Macbook Pro M1  (AU$1,699).<p>Lenovo ThinkPad P1: i7-8750H, 1x 16GB <i>SO-DIMM DDR4-2666</i> non-ECC (no information of the max amount RAM supported), 512GB NVMe SSD (no information on the SSD upgradability). It is AU$1,000 more expensive than the 16Gb &#x2F; 512 Gb 13&quot; Macbook Pro M1 (AU$1,699).<p>Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold: i5-L16G7, 8Gb of soldered on RAM, 512GB NVMe SSD (no information on the SSD upgradability), AU$5,799. It is AU$4,000 (four thousand) more expensive than the 16Gb &#x2F; 512 Gb 13&quot; Macbook Pro M1 (AU$1,699). <i>This is 3.411 times more expensive than the M1 laptop</i>.<p>Lenovo ThinkPad T14s: AMD Ryzen™ PRO 4750U CPU, 16GB soldered on DDR4-3200, 512 Gb Opal2 NVMe ((no information on the SSD upgradability). It is nearly AU$500 more expensive that the 16Gb &#x2F; 512 Gb 13&quot; Macbook Pro M1 (AU$1,699).<p>Acer TravelMate P614, Intel Core i7, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, AU$2,299: no information on RAM and SSD upgrade options. The laptop is AU$600 more expensive that the 16Gb &#x2F; 512 Gb 13&quot; Macbook Pro M1 (AU$1,699).<p>Acer Swift 3, AMD Ryzen 7-4700U, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD, AU$1,999: no information on RAM and SSD upgrade options. The laptop is AU$300 more expensive that the 16Gb &#x2F; 512 Gb 13&quot; Macbook Pro M1 (AU$1,699).<p>Other Acer laptops are less capable, use Pentium or Core i3 CPU&#x27;s, slower SSD&#x27;s and are cheaper than M1 laptops; some are twice as cheaper. They are marketed as «student» laptops.<p>Out of 7 PC laptops above, only one has upgradable RAM, and it is a guessing game whether the SSD can or can&#x27;t be upgraded. Every PC laptop above is also <i>more</i> expensive than the latest, stats wise comparable, 13&quot; MacBook Pro M1. A few of those are significantly more expensive.<p>Yes, there are cheaper options, and, yes, some laptops can be upgraded easily or more easily, but that is not the primary market for laptop makers. Wholesale purchasers (corporates) and average consumers do not typically ask whether or not they can later upgrade their laptop.<p>Also, if one wants an ultraporatble or a compact laptop, they had better accept the fact that RAM and&#x2F;or SSD will be soldered on, and they won&#x27;t be able to upgrade them, be it an Apple or a commodity PC laptop. It is a commonplace now.')
