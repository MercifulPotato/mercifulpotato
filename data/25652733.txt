Also FTL gives me a stream of RTP packets which can go directly into WebRTC meaning I have to do 0 processing of the packets where as with RTMP I would have to convert them into RTP packets. Also SRT is interesting however it is wildly complicated and does not use RTP meaning I would have to figure out how it works and then convert whatever it gives me into RTP packets for WebRTC')
