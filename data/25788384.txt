And likewise, the syntax tries to balance terseness (since REPL is a write many read once environment) with readability (to make shell scripts less cryptic).<p>Target audience is basically myself but I think this fits anyone who spends a lot of time in the terminal using sysadmin or developer tools. Particularly DevOps tooling which are often JSON &#x2F; YAML &#x2F; etc heavy.<p>This is a personal project but I&#x27;m very much open to feedback, suggestions, feature requests, pull requests, etc...<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lmorg&#x2F;murex" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;lmorg&#x2F;murex</a>')
