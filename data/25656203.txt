There are always going to be more things to research and develop treatments for. At some point you have to draw a line, because the cost to the system can become enormous.<p>Take some of the gene therapies as an example.[0] Zolgensma costs over $2 million per treatment or Zynteglo[1] that costs $1.8 million per treatment. Maybe US healthcare can afford this, but poorer countries can&#x27;t. The hope is that the existence of these treatments means that they will eventually come down in price. 20-50 years from now I expect these treatments to be part of basic healthcare in most countries. On the other hand, if we limit the existence of treatments like these right now, then maybe 20-50 years from now these treatments simply wouldn&#x27;t exist.<p>Healthcare systems <i>always</i> play with limited resources. We should first start covering dental care, glasses and eyesight surgeries as an example of something that&#x27;s missing in a lot of countries.<p>Furthermore, regardless whether the system had the money or not, some &#x27;treatments&#x27; will still be niche and not considered &#x27;healthcare&#x27;. Traditional medicine can help with some problems, but it might not fall under healthcare. Most things related to diet are basically a pseudo science, but some of them work for some people. You&#x27;ll never cover all of this.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-novartis-genetherapy-idUSKCN1SU1ZP" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reuters.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;us-novartis-genetherapy-idUS...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;new-gene-therapy-priced-at-1-8-million-in-europe-11560529116" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wsj.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;new-gene-therapy-priced-at-1-8-...</a>')
