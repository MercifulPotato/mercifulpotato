Item(by='mdip', descendants=None, kids=[24920451], score=None, time=1603900865, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24919191, text='A little off topic, but thanks for sharing:<p>The age of 13 seems to be a common thread with a lot of developers -- I know of 5 others who will point to that age as &quot;when they started writing software&quot;.  It was age 13 when I started assembling and selling PCs (in the 90s) and began exploring software development and before my 14th birthday that I had re-written a BBS application in PASCAL.<p>Like you, I had been messing around with my (horrible) computer[0] since it arrived in our house and I was presented with an `A&gt;` with no clue how to proceed, but it wasn&#x27;t until I was 13 that my Dad presented me with a plan and a book to fix that problem[1].  I wanted a 386 so I could play Wing Commander (and see more than the 4 colors that my CGA display allowed -- loved the LSD trip that games like Kings Quest would put you through while trying to render decent graphics using practically nothing, but I was ready to be done with that).<p>I remember thinking my dad was insane -- he owned a business selling things to large automotive manufacturers ... nothing event adjacent to computers.  And a computer was easily the most complicated consumer electronics device a person could own.  Having had to fix our 8088 a few times, and being generally the most &quot;handy person&quot; I&#x27;ve ever known, his response was a dismissive &quot;they&#x27;re all just a bunch of parts that you buy and put together&quot;.  And while I&#x27;m pretty sure he helped me build&#x2F;troubleshoot the first couple of them (we had some bad components early on from a vendor in California), I generally built&#x2F;tested&#x2F;assembled all of the few hundred that we sold, myself.  If you want a 13-year-old to behave more like a &quot;Grown Up&quot;, well, when your Dad&#x27;s friends are paying you thousands of dollars to build them a computer, you start to act like someone who&#x27;s worthy of receiving that kind of trust.<p>The best part: we built the first several computers to <i>pay for</i> the one we wanted for ourselves[2].  My dad <i>owned</i> his company.  I&#x27;m willing to wager that he could have afforded to just buy the thing for me and probably <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> have felt all that guilty about spoiling his kid since I was using it 99% of the time to do things other than play games.  But this served as a forcing function -- I got the exact computer with the exact specifications that I wanted without having to think about the cost of those things provided I could sell enough computers to purchase it.  I did.  And I got to buy a convertible for my first car with money I had earned.<p>I&#x27;m seeing it now, in my own kids, two of which turn 13 in the next few months.  They&#x27;re working with Roblox&#x27;s developer tools making new worlds and I&#x27;m staring over their shoulder thinking: this application is easily as complicated to use as any of the design tools I&#x27;ve been exposed to and these kids are just ripping through it like it&#x27;s &quot;not work&quot; (if only they were getting paid!).<p>I&#x27;ve been <i>looking</i> for things to motivate them to step out of the &quot;game world&quot; and realize that the things they&#x27;re doing could be done outside of Roblox -- they could make <i>real applications</i>, but much like I didn&#x27;t believe my dad when he handed me that book, they haven&#x27;t had that &quot;ah ha&quot; moment, yet.<p>[0] My friends all had Commodore 64s and such that played really cool (if slowly loading) games and cost a few hundred dollars. We had a $3,000 IBM 8088 clone with a 10MB hard drive and floppy drive that ... wasn&#x27;t fun.<p>[1] I can&#x27;t remember the title completely but it was something like &quot;Build an 80486 PC and Save A Bundle&quot;<p>[2] My 80486, if memory serves, cost just shy of $10,000.  We went with what would be called &quot;server hardware&quot; these days: SCSI over (very new) IDE or (very old) MFM -- we went SCSI with a full height 360MB drive (40MB drives were huge), a very nice video card and a 18&quot; CRT display (14&quot; was &#x27;normal&#x27; with anything above starting at twice the price of the best 14&quot; display).  And two modems... I ran a multi-node BBS on custom software originally based on Telegard.')
