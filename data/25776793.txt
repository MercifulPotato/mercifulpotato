Of course when it comes to cars, this is actually a critical issue. But the same story has been playing out with all sorts of tech.<p>The motive to reinvent something entirely instead of making gradual improvements is something I cannot understand. It is like rewriting the entire healthcare bill and completely disrespecting the work of the previous generation of lawmakers instead of progressively enhancing it.<p>Maybe this comes out of genuine hate for the previous engineers.
