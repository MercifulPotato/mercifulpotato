Thus the probability of survival waiting isn&#x27;t low to start with.<p>The proper calculation would be probability of infection * probability of death in the intervening months before we collect data on the efficacy of various options vs expected outcome if they just take the oxford vaccine now.<p>The users chance of survival is already quite high in the intervening period and while the benefits of the oxford vaccine are highly hypothetical they are also largely contingent on vaccinating everyone. People are liable to only see IF it works a 30% - 60% effectiveness, lower for some with worse immune systems. The real benefit is decreasing the spread of the virus until it dies out not merely the individuals benefit which will never happen if it turns out it doesn&#x27;t work.<p>Worse it may be most apt to kill or harm those who are also most vulnerable to covid.<p>At worst the patient trades a very good chance of survival for a substantial downside with no upside and a future vaccination with a different vaccine they ought to have waited for.')
