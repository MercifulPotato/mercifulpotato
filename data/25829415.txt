Item(by='_ah', descendants=None, kids=[25831156], score=None, time=1611024413, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25809962, text='First, I&#x27;ll say +1 to the other commenters here encouraging you to develop the idea on your own first before trying to bring in other people.<p>But let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re going to ignore all of that and still try to find a partner first. Your advertisement gives me zero confidence that you have an actual business here. Your idea is: a personal finance budgeting tool, but &quot;fun and easy to use&quot; and based on how <i>you personally</i> manage your finances. I have so many questions! And as a former Product Manager you should have answers:<p>• What <i>specifically</i> is wrong with existing personal finance tools on the market? What is the killer feature that makes yours better? Have you tried <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lunchmoney.app&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lunchmoney.app&#x2F;</a> ?<p>• Let&#x27;s see those wireframes! User journeys! Something! Right now I&#x27;m left with the assumption that you&#x27;ve sketched out some login dialogs and a transaction list but haven&#x27;t thought beyond that.<p>• Where&#x27;s your user research? If you&#x27;re looking for a cofounder, that implies that you have a thing that needs to be built. Do you know what that thing is? Have you validated with real people that this is a real problem they have? How many user interviews have you done? Again, my assumption is that you&#x27;ve done none of this.<p>• What will be your role in the business? How do you propose that you earn your 50% of the equity? Remember that &quot;idea guy&quot; is worth nothing... you need to bring sales chops, key relationships &#x2F; industry credibility, recruiting ability, investment money, or some combination thereof.<p>• If you&#x27;ve actually thought through this stuff and don&#x27;t want to reveal your secrets, why not? No one is going to copy you (probably), and you&#x27;ll get key insight into your market. Before you can ever sell this to a consumer you need to sell it to your early partners.<p>Finally, remember that some of the best cofounder partnerships work because the people involved have prior history working together professionally. Which of your former co-workers could you convince to quit their job and join you? If none of them, why not? What would you need to do to strengthen your pitch? Do that.')
