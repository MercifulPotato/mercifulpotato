Imagine if you could program by rough drafting how your function works on paper. Like with arrows and all sorts of messy things connecting the structure of your code, but entirely understandable to another human what your function was to do without needing to understand a lick of code.<p>Take this example(1) from the R subreddit about how to do matrix math, and the arcane R foo required to actually do something that is pretty simply explained in OPs image(2) to anyone with zero background in R or programming at all. Now, imagine how much more productive the world would be if the computer could take an instruction in a readable form like the OPs image, rather than the R jargon code actually needed by the computer to do the math described in the image. People would be learning to write their own functions right along side learning how to do math on paper. Instead, people today pay six figures and spend four years to learn how to turn the math they learned by hand in high school into something that can be ran on a computer, same as it was 30 years ago.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;rprogramming&#x2F;comments&#x2F;kn2rgb&#x2F;how_do_i_do_this_very_simple_thing_in_r_thanks_in&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;rprogramming&#x2F;comments&#x2F;kn2rgb&#x2F;how_do...</a><p>2. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.redd.it&#x2F;ngxi8665zb861.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.redd.it&#x2F;ngxi8665zb861.jpg</a>')
