I know for certain that it uses pure Python implementation of some modules from <i>somewhere</i>. One program I took great pains to be PyPy compatible ended up being a lot slower in it, and it turned out to be that the built-in sqlite3 module has a C implementation in CPython that&#x27;s faster than the pure-Python version even when runing in PyPy.')
