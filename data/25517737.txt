Now, sure I need the &quot;.secrets&quot; file to exist in my production server... how do I upload it there? Perhaps using sftp is enough as part of my &quot;deploy&quot; script? It would upload the &quot;.secrets&quot; file from my machine to my production server.<p>I also thought about commiting &quot;.secrets&quot; to my git repo: every secret in that file would be encrypted with PGP though (perhaps I could encrypt the whole file)... but then my production server would need my GPG private key to decrypt the secrets. I would need to upload my private key from my machine to my production server as well... I don&#x27;t see much of a difference with the previous approach.<p>I have heard about Vault and similar tools, but honestly these tools seem a bit &quot;too much&quot; for me: I&#x27;m a solo developer building a monolithic service. How do developers in the  same circumstances handle secrets?')
