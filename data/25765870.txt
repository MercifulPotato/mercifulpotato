Strategically, from the FAANG perspective, it makes sense to spend a little money (for them) dipping a toe into every pond &quot;just in case.&quot; On the flip side, it makes bootstrapping a sustainable business extremely difficult. If Google gives away a shitty form of your service for free because the costs are a rounding error to them, people will feel like the service has no value.<p>I don&#x27;t know that I have seen a solution I like for this. Perhaps a new anti-monopoly law that prevents orgs from entering into competition without any potential for profit? At the end of the day, maybe the world as a whole doesn&#x27;t care that they are missing out on small cool tech companies that will never get huge? But, of course, in an environment where small cool tech is unsustainable we&#x27;ll never know if they would eventually get huge.')
