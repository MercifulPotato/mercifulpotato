Yes, the super high calorie foods are <i>always</i> going to taste good. But that does not mean that the less caloric foods will not also taste just as good. My SO has a super restrictive diet (due to some pretty bad health reasons). My SO&#x27;s taste has changed dramatically since being on the diet for some time. In that my SO can taste a single &#x27;no-no&#x27; ingredient in just about any food item. I&#x27;m talking a single pepper-flake in ~4 hour roast. Things you may not think of as &#x27;sweet&#x27;, like broccoli or cabbage, are reported as near candy. It&#x27;s taken a while, but the effects are real.<p>I think that issue is a big deal with the obese: taste. Their tastes have become so desensitized that only the umami bombs of Doritos will elicit a response. Similarly with fats and sugars, only the largest signals are now received.<p>Perhaps a way to deal with this is to just have the obese eat more, but of the &#x27;good&#x27; stuff. To retrain their taste. Have a salad, a good one, and then eat dinner. Have an apple with breakfast, and then all the eggs and butter. Etc.')
