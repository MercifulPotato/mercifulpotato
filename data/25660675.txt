Item(by='mywittyname', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609958149, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25660435, text='&gt; Why would it go to Famous Writer?<p>From the article:<p>&gt; Reames said Amazon refuses to send him a corrected 1099, or to discuss anything about the identity thief.<p>The writer in question received a 1099, which states that he earned the proceeds from this book, and the IRS is going to require him to pay taxes on those earnings.<p>&gt; As for why bother impersonating Famous Writer in the first place?  Probably because an unheard of author selling $500,000 worth of books for $500&#x2F;each would be suspicious,<p>The author says this book made much more than any of his other books:<p>&gt; Reames is a credited author on Amazon by way of several commodity industry books, although none of them made anywhere near the amount Amazon is reporting to the Internal Revenue Service.<p>They (the hackers) impersonated the author because they had access to his information via his publisher.  Thus, they could bypass Amazon&#x27;s normal vetting process for self-published books.<p>This is a terrible money laundering scheme (since it doesn&#x27;t actually result in legitimate money), but it&#x27;s a very good theft scheme.')
