Libraries like `boundaries` can also help you enforce, a-hem, boundaries in your code and making sure that you write less spaghetti code.<p>I personally stick to Dialyzer in personal projects but it&#x27;s an uphill battle to constantly keep it happy while OCaml &#x2F; Rust &#x2F; Haskell will just immediately yell at you with a well-described error (well, Rust anyway, the other two can be vague sometimes).')
