Basically, some models of Philips Android&#x2F;Smart TVs are implied to have had a DRM breech and Netflix looks to be capping streaming to all of them to 480p as a result.<p>What&#x27;s worse than having a smart TV that spies on you and is complicit with BigMedia DRM? A smart TV that has lost its DRM keys, spies on you, and won&#x27;t get a firmware update to let you get content better than 480p.<p>I&#x27;m not a Netflix customer for a reason.')
