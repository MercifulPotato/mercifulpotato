My personal recommendation is IEMs, which can be quite comfortable for long-time wear. They’ll give you a greater reduction in sound than the best ANR technology, and they’ll do so without the weaknesses of ANR (has some weird edge cases where frequencies are not equally lowered).<p>Being fair, ANR technology is fatiguing to my ear; it makes them hurt as if I’ve been listening to loud noises for too long. I’ve heard this from a few others as well, but it definitely drives me towards passive attenuation.')
