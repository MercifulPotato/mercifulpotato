While there are plans for a gc, it seems hard to fit into this model (but I’m sure the team can pull it off).<p>It is basically made so c&#x2F;cpp and other low level languages could be run inside browsers, and I don’t really see the point of it? Like, it is probably good for a video editor running inside a browser, but it will probably mostly entail all sort of mining, unnecessarily usage of cpu and the like. And it won’t magically improve performance, since at the boundary , calling javascript is really expensive, usually much more than writing the whole thing in js. Unless of course if someone does plenty of numerical computations.')
