Like, cool, I can agree it would be great if there was a viable third option—but there&#x27;s not, and there won&#x27;t be until we change how we count votes, and your choice of protest is effectively taking what power you do have and <i>throwing it away</i>.<p>If you want to call that an abusive relationship, I can understand where you&#x27;re coming from—but it is the state of the world. You either work within the system you&#x27;ve been given, or you get crushed. There are more effective ways to advocate for change—you could focus on primary elections, or you could become more involved on Bugzilla.<p>And just like in politics, I think if you actually do a tad of research into the web standards space, you&#x27;ll see there are a <i>ton</i> of differences between what Mozilla and Google advocate for. I don&#x27;t agree with all of Mozilla&#x27;s positions, but I certainly agree with them more often than Google&#x27;s.<p>Edit: Yikes, I really didn&#x27;t intend to completely derail the discussion! I&#x27;m sorry! :(')
