Across multiple cities, government buildings and police stations were vandalized&#x2F;looted.  In an extreme case, in Portland, the federal courthouse was set on fire.<p>Also, the post-George-Floyd looting&#x2F;rioting persisted for far more than a day.  An example is the CHOP zone in Seattle, which lasted for 3 weeks before protesters were forcibly removed.<p>This doesn&#x27;t absolve the Capitol Hill rioters either, but simply describing the BLM looting &quot;looting commercial districts&quot; downplays the amount of damage done.  In my opinion, I think reasonable questions to ask are: over what period of time did the violence persist, what amount of value was destroyed, and how many lives were claimed during the looting.')
