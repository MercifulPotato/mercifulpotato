As you suggest, I often find myself, internally, blaming others for not being able to &quot;see&quot; it or caring enough to understand it, but I can make it dance beautifully when something new&#x2F;strange needs to be incorporated, often &quot;saving the day&quot;.<p>I know that if I left now, it would swiftly collapse, bringing the whole team to a halt. Management has also realized this, resulting in some nice shiny golden handcuffs.<p>The new developer we hired (since I did become The bottleneck) isn&#x27;t the greatest (his performance reviews agree), and is slowly breaking things, but I&#x27;m only half stopping him because I&#x27;m trying to assume my rigidity in the &quot;correctness&quot; must be flawed, and I don&#x27;t want to damage the relationship any more than it has been.<p>Now I&#x27;m in the progress of scaling this 10x, and I don&#x27;t want to be a 10x bottleneck.<p>The only thing that holds back m imposter syndrome, and makes me think it&#x27;s my, as you say, qualities, is that, after nearly 3 years, the churn from many of the other teams are finally converging towards the one implementation that I&#x27;ve had working, stably, in that same time span, for all of the same reasons that I implemented it the way I did.<p>tldr;<p>&gt; It&#x27;s easy to interpret this as being about your qualities instead of your failings<p>This is probably me. So, what&#x27;s the solution? Re-think the whole concept to come up with a different implementation? Simplify?')
