I would have roritharr.worldviewpedia.org and could start writing my drivel down there, and maybe copy something I agree with from schoen.worldviewpedia.org and some other stuff from infowars.worldviewpedia.org.<p>This would allow me to fully rationally work through those topics and connect them to adjacent topics of the global consensus narrative I still believe in.<p>This may push some people into an ever deeper rabbithole, but it might also cure a lot of the &quot;5 min expert&quot; syndrome we&#x27;ve seen.')
