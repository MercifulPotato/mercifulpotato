Once in a great while, someone will be truly wonderful to you because you did that but it&#x27;s usually counterproductive.<p>Doreen, I always find your posts and comments to be very insightful. I&#x27;ve never thought about it this way, but it makes a lot of sense. Fixating on one&#x27;s own desperation is basically a waste of time. One could be doing the things that removes them from desperation instead of fixating on not doing those things. It really does seem counterproductive.')
