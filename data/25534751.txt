Item(by='runnerup', descendants=None, kids=[25534806], score=None, time=1608878566, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25534478, text='&gt; Independently, from what I remember of those parts of the company codebase, my prior would be that this is a bug, not malice.<p>Indeed. I&#x27;m not associated with the company at all but this seems like a pretty typical bug for mailing lists. Anecdotes elsewhere in this thread about people who were referred and&#x2F;or interviewed but who&#x27;ve not received any spam seem to back that up(?).<p>TripleByte did legitimately screw up by planning to make profiles public by default. I was upset with that but also very, very impressed when (after a day of reflection and sleeping on it) they reversed course with a heartfelt apology. To me that&#x27;s the kind of earnestness that I want in companies that I do business with. Some people continue to criticize them for ever imagining the plan in the first place or not immediately reversing course the same day as the initial backlash - but to me, I think the vast majority of humans generally come around the next day after sleeping on it rather than in the moment.<p>TripleByte doesn&#x27;t give me the &quot;sociopathic company vibe&quot; at all.<p>If anything, I&#x27;ve been happy that I can recommend companies like this to colleagues&#x2F;friends&#x2F;old classmates who didn&#x27;t go to top CS schools. A lot of students from the lesser schools have quite a bit of difficulty getting an interview at FAANG companies even after doing the leetcode grind because their resume simply cannot stand out in the online application system -- and without a strong alumni network to help with referrals, they&#x27;re on their own.<p>TripleByte (and similar services) do a pretty good job of at least getting you an interview if you&#x27;ve studied hard enough, regardless of your previous academic&#x2F;professional background. That&#x27;s a really powerful leg up for a lot of passionate and driven people who didn&#x27;t go to the best schools.')
