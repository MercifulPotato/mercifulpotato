But the conservative Liberal government got in power and changed it from fibre to DSL, a move that was universally derided as unfeasible both economically and technologically.<p>It was known to be a waste of tens of billions of dollars - but Rupert Murdoch doesn&#x27;t want poor people to have access to information outside his propaganda network, so he handed the election to the Liberals (the conservatives) in exchange for destroying the network and salting the earth so it was hard for even a future government to fix.<p>Telstra, the big incumbent ISP with a monopoly in many areas, also had alot to do with it. Instead of gigabit fibre, we now have 25mbit DSL, which doesn&#x27;t work when it&#x27;s raining even lightly, or in strong winds.<p>This network was also slower to build, and far more expensive than the fibre.<p>But as long as it&#x27;s built with fibre, it works. New Zealand&#x27;s network is enourmously successful, and now anyone has access to gigabit fibre on their choice of ISP. It works both in theory and in practice, you just must not allow a conservative government to hand it over to monopoly corporations.<p>The common &quot;government can&#x27;t be trusted&quot; rubbish is bunk, the government only screwed it up in Australia because that was their goal, the fibre networks have always been a success.')
