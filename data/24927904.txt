I&#x27;m talking about those &quot;occasional&quot; times the backend-dev needs to do some f.e dev work. Just because they don&#x27;t know the tech as well, best practises and spend as much time with it as a dedicated F.E Dev. jQuery code written by the &quot;occasional front-end dev&quot; is kinda horrific in many cases.<p>Now please internet hear me. I&#x27;m not saying you can&#x27;t write bad code in a JS-Framework. I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s usually less often and less bad - especially for non-dedicated f.e devs<p>Like crossing a street, just looking left and right won&#x27;t guarantee you to be safe in your crossing, but it damn near makes it less probable.<p>If you are a shop with mostly backend-devs and don&#x27;t want to invest in a F.E dev, you definitely should look into a js-framework.<p>*Svelte is always good start very small and bare bones.')
