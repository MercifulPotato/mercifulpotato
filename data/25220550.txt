The only reason I drive it is because it&#x27;s so comfortable to sit higher up, and to have a better view of the road that way. It&#x27;s comfortable to get in and out of (I&#x27;m 40 years old, work out several times a week, no mobility issues whatsoever - I still find it more comfortable). This is the second SUV I have, before that I had a tiny car and thought the same as you do, it was only once I started driving one that I started to see why people like them.<p>I don&#x27;t think for transitioning to EV the form factor will be the problem. BMW will start delivering the first EV versions of my current car (X3) next year. For me, charging it where I live (city center) is the problem. Every time I see my neighbour roll his extension cord across the sidewalk I think &#x27;no way I&#x27;m going to do that&#x27;.')
