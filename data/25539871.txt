We were all imagining flying cars and the like, but in many ways what we have, and so available, is much more incredible.<p>Back on topic though - if the resolution and refresh rate really are as good as shown in the videos, then as a developer, this would genuinely make a huge difference to my working day. My eyes are practically begging for it!<p>Unless there are markets I&#x27;m not seeing, this is undoubtedly a niche product, and I&#x27;m very pleasantly surprised that a company has invested to bring it to fruition. I haven&#x27;t been this existed since NVMe, and I hope this thing ships soon so I can find out how much it costs and read reviews!')
