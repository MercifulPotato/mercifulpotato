While the cyclist does have the right of way, the intent is to signal to automobile drivers to share the roads.  Courtesy from the cyclist would be to share the road with other road users.<p>I do find that cycling on roads with &quot;sharrows&quot; have less aggressive behavior from cars.<p>&#x2F;me: Cycle commuter for 15 years in Tokyo, 20km to 40km each way during the &quot;before&quot; times.
