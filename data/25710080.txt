I know that censorship laws can be dangerous, but it realistically just strikes me as the lesser evil. You evidently can&#x27;t just let that stuff openly fester, but I simply can&#x27;t imagine a situation where the government would suppress &#x27;good&#x27; speech but a company with equal power wouldn&#x27;t.')
