Then the Gnome project started giving the giant middle finger to their users and began removing all the features to use for customization.  I remember the day when a Gnome update decided to change key bindings unannounced.  Xchat flipped from Unix X11 key bindings to Windows bindings.  The argument was that they were going after &quot;Aunt Tilly&quot;, the mythical desktop Linux user who never actually appeared.  This drove those of us who were developers away.  I can&#x27;t stand Gnome these days and use Openbox &#x2F; xfce instead, 2 desktops that don&#x27;t try to drive their users away.  Sadly, Red Hat still funds Gnome primarily rather than the vibrant situation we had back then.')
