My iPhone 7 would still work if I hadn&#x27;t broken it so badly with an unlucky drop (landed wrong, thought of repairing, but found a good 2-for-1 deal on the iPhone X and my wife wanted an upgrade). My 2012 MBP is still in use, my 2011 Mac Mini is still in use, my 2014 iPad (Air 2) is still in use.<p>Disposable devices: Anything from Amazon. Kindle Fire tablets are useful, but cheap. Anything Nexus and (IMHO) Pixel from Google. Everything HP I&#x27;ve ever owned that wasn&#x27;t a calculator made before 2000.')
