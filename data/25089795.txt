That by itself would be fine, except for whatever reason, driving monitors with mismatched resolutions maxes the memory clock on the 5300M and 5500M. This causes a persistent 20W power draw from the GPU, which results in a lot of heat and near-constant fan noise, even while idle. As there isn’t a monitor in the world that matches the resolution of the built-in screen, this means the clocks are always maxed (unless you close the laptop and run in clamshell mode).<p>The 5600M uses HBM2 memory and doesn’t suffer from the issue, but a £600 upgrade to work around the issue is lame, especially when I don’t actually need the GPU, you just can’t buy a 16” without one.<p>Disabling turbo boost does help a little, but it doesn’t come close to solving it.')
