What an amazing article!<p>&gt;He grew up on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side, the son of a pioneering necktie manufacturer, James Lehrer<p>That&#x27;s just hilarious. I can&#x27;t think of anything more appropriate than a necktie manufacturer family.<p>In any case, if anyone is unfamiliar with Tom Lehrer, I encourage you to take a wiki dive and then listen to his music. This guy taught mathematics at Harvard, then accidentally sold 10,000 copies of a vinyl of his songs in a few weeks, then went on to tour the US and the world.<p>His works remain some of the brightest, most convivial, most haunting and poignant works of song to date. He sings clever happy songs of things like pollution, patricide, nuclear holocaust, arson, murder, racism, plagiarism, criminal boy scouts, disease and crime in Mexico and, of course, the eternal desire of the common man to poison pigeons in the park.<p>Like &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic says in that article, Tom Lehrer remains the modern Tom Lehrer today. There&#x27;s just no one like him and the way his songs have remained so <i>relevant</i> up to this day is something I find myself in awe of. He just... took a look at society, grokked it on a primordial level and wrote songs that I will end up teaching my kids and they&#x27;ll go &quot;Wait, they had these things 80 years ago?&quot;<p>EDIT: Also, OP title is wrong, Lehrer simply released his LYRICS to the public domain. My copy of &quot;Too Many Songs by Tom Lehrer&quot; with musical notation remains relevant, yay!')
