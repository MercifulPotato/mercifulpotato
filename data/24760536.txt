Item(by='alpb', descendants=None, kids=[24760705, 24761425], score=None, time=1602543866, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24758772, text='Kind of also surprised I think this author has not heard of Google Cloud Run (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.run&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.run&#x2F;</a>).<p>Cloud Run employs a vendor-neutral container runtime and API (from Knative open source project). It simply accepts any OCI container that can listen on $PORT number.<p>Similarly, the author talks about serverless not being able to run &quot;entire applications&quot;, which again, doesn&#x27;t apply to Cloud Run. Many people run fully-fledged .NET Core or Java apps on it with a single command to deploy.<p>Ditto for the author&#x27;s &quot;Limited Programming Languages&quot; point, Cloud Run is container-based serverless runtime and it runs any language. Furthermore, you don&#x27;t even have to write Dockerfiles anymore to build containers for plenty of languages thanks to Buildpacks <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GoogleCloudPlatform&#x2F;buildpacks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;GoogleCloudPlatform&#x2F;buildpacks</a>.<p>Furthermore, in my opinion, the serverless revolution is still going on with more services adding edge lambdas support or storage support for edge workers like Cloudflare did with Durable Objects Beta or Workers KV and there&#x27;s definitely more to come.<p>Overall I&#x27;m not sure what the author was thinking while writing this. It seems they are aware of the intersection of containers &amp; serverless and note that serverless is not just FaaS, but I note an intentional omission of many products that directly respond to his points in the article.<p>Disclaimer: I work on Cloud Run.')
