For Mastodon I clicked the big &quot;join&quot; button on the website and filtered by technology &gt; foss and fosstodon.org was the largest option and seems to have a great community. For PeerTube trying to do the same thing I found some small technology instance with a few hundred videos. I chose peervideo.club because it&#x27;s the 4th largest (so I&#x27;d be in good company if it&#x27;s taken down) and seemed to be the largest English focused instance. From their about, &quot;Peer Video Club is a chill PeerTube instance most likely just for testing. How long we plan to maintain this instance: ¯\\(ツ)&#x2F;¯. How we will pay for this instance: Owners&#x27;s own funds&quot;. Doesn&#x27;t seem like a pillar of stability.<p>My understanding is I could backup (no plans), and restore to another instance. To take my followers with me I would have to leave peervideo.club in a more planned way and set my account to redirect to another. No idea how long the redirect would have to stay up for most of my subscribers&#x27; instances to get the message. Even with federated you need some degree of trust that you won&#x27;t be kicked off or have you instance shut down with no warning.')
