It&#x27;s a form builder with a built in rules no code rules engine. We&#x27;re launching today, you can create an account for free and try it out.<p>I&#x27;ve used quite a few form builders in the past, and at times they fall a little short. You can&#x27;t do complex calculations, you cannot do conditional validations, you have no control over the order of operations. The goal was to build a form builder that could do those things. This is the MVP.<p>I have a long list of features I&#x27;m hoping to add. The Trello board is nearly 500 items deep. However being a full time developer while building something of this magnitude can be challenging. I&#x27;m hoping to get some feedback as well as answer any questions you might have. The goal is to get it robust enough that I will have paid plans available.<p>You can ask questions here all day, or send me an email at contact@keenforms.com - really looking forward to feedback, maybe even suggestions for features. Thanks for your time.')
