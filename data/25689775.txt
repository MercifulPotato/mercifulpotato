Whenever I talk to a doctor about my symptoms it feels like they&#x27;re just doing triage. I can&#x27;t really blame them for that, but I would happily pay $$$ for an experienced professional who truly cared about my health. I have no idea if such a thing exists though (outside the sphere of the very wealthy, of course).')
