They merely want to continue pretending to want to eventually re-unify with the PRC to maintain good economic relations. Because the PRC accounts for 28% of Taiwan&#x27;s exports and 19% of Taiwan&#x27;s imports (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wto.org&#x2F;english&#x2F;res_e&#x2F;statis_e&#x2F;daily_update_e&#x2F;trade_profiles&#x2F;TW_e.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wto.org&#x2F;english&#x2F;res_e&#x2F;statis_e&#x2F;daily_update_e&#x2F;tr...</a>).<p>Really hardly anyone in Taiwan wants to re-unify with the PRC, they have seen the genocide the fascist CCP is committing against the Uighur people in Xinjiang, if the CCP repeats this in Taiwan and exterminates or sterilizes millions of Taiwanese it would be devastating. Nobody wants to bear witness to genocide, but even more so, nobody wants to be a victim to genocide, so supporting re-unification would be senseless.')
