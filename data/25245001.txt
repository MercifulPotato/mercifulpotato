Item(by='jeroenhd', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606656435, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25244727, text='NTFS is known to allow more fragmentation than ext4 (as long as there is plenty of disk space left; full ext4 volumes will fragment). This is one reason why running Windows from a hard drive requires occasional defragmentation (done automatically in the background without you noticing) while Linux will happily run without any defragmentation at all in most cases.<p>Fragmentation will still happen, of course, but instead of preferring write performance and accepting fragmentation as a consequence, like NTFS, the ext4 system tries to avoid fragmentation where it can.<p>Now, in the age of SSDs and flash storage, fragmentation isn&#x27;t as big a problem as it used to be, but it&#x27;s nice to see the optimizations done for running an OS from a hard drive make it easier to recover byte streams from ext4 than it would be to recover them from NTFS.')
