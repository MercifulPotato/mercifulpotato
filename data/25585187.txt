The primary goal of my work when I started it was to have a project on GitHub which I could use to help leverage me into the world of professional web development. My library helped me land my first full-time gig, so in that sense it achieved its goals 100%<p>&gt; How much time&#x2F;money did you spend building it?<p>18 months full time before I managed to get a job. Since then, maybe 2-3 days a month (if that) on maintenance and feature development. The upside of having an unpopular JS library is that nobody bothers you with questions about how to do stuff.<p>For the past 18 months I&#x27;ve spent a lot more time on the project - approaching full-time in some months - rewriting it from scratch, giving it a new focus, etc. The work has helped me come to terms with all the new Javascript shiny, and the ever-evolving Web API standards<p>&gt; What kind of iterations &#x2F; improvements did you make to try and salvage it?<p>I&#x27;m not in the business of &quot;salvage&quot; - nowadays I work on the library partly to keep my coding skills sharp (next on the to-do list is learning Rust&#x2F;WebAssembly to see if I can make the library run a bit faster), but mainly because it&#x27;s creative and fun[3] and after this year we all need a bit more fun in our lives!<p>[1] Scrawl-canvas GitHub - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;KaliedaRik&#x2F;Scrawl-canvas" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;KaliedaRik&#x2F;Scrawl-canvas</a><p>[2] Scrawl-canvas home page - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scrawl-v8.rikweb.org.uk&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;scrawl-v8.rikweb.org.uk&#x2F;</a><p>[3] My creative coding collection on Codepen - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codepen.io&#x2F;collection&#x2F;DmgxKv" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;codepen.io&#x2F;collection&#x2F;DmgxKv</a>')
