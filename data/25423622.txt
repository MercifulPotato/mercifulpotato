In practice, also no, because real compilers perform escape analysis and there are aggressive optimization passes for eliminating dead loads and dead stores.<p>Just like the compiler can optimize out b and replace it with a reference to a, the compiler can optimize out the value stored in a but <i>keep</i> the reference to it stored in b.<p>&gt; In that case b is useless, and thus it doesn&#x27;t really even exist.<p>I don’t think this notion of “exist” has legs.')
