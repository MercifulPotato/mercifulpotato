Start out by offering your services for a very small fee.  The objective at the beginning is to just get good reviews (if you do a good job, people will come back and give you more work, but that&#x27;s just a bonus).  Once you have a few solid reviews under your belt, winning larger contracts will get easier.<p>5) Stop trying to flip things or doing anything else that doesn&#x27;t reliably pay above $15&#x2F;hr.')
