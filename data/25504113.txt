In the case of the srfi-158 generator (gmap square (gfilter odd? (list-generator big-list))) the overhead for getting one element from the generator would be 3 procedure calls. Without any intermediate steps. The same transducer would have one procedure call less, but would be in the same vicinity.<p>Does clojure&#x27;s sequences not work similarly?
