My position is that bits are not a bug – that we should create communications technologies that allow people to send whatever they like to each other. And when people put their thumbs on the scale and try to say what can and can’t be sent, we should fight back – both politically through protest and technologically through software like Tor...<p>&gt; How is compromising [by a technology company on censorship] supposed to bring greater freedom in the long run? That’s like saying “I’m going to beat you up now so that you don’t have to be hit as much in the long run.” The right answer is to stop beating people up.<p>But I do think that physical violence resulting in part from the <i>amplification</i> of voices by algorithm would have been hard to foresee. I too would be curious if his thinking would have evolved. Sadly, we&#x27;ll never know.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reclaimthenet.org&#x2F;aaron-swartz-reddit-founder&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;reclaimthenet.org&#x2F;aaron-swartz-reddit-founder&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;reddit.com&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1octb&#x2F;reddit_cofounder_aaron_swartz_discusses_how_he&#x2F;c1oewi&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;reddit.com&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1octb&#x2F;reddit_co...</a><p>[2] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogoscoped.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2007-05-07-n78.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogoscoped.com&#x2F;archive&#x2F;2007-05-07-n78.html</a>')
