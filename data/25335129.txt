So in addition to John reviewing Josh&#x27;s torrent of bs, John is always playing catchup, always has to do more rework.<p>Further, it&#x27;s not a balanced relationship. Josh creates urgency to fast track approval for their own PRs. Then will goal tend John&#x27;s work. Pedantry over everything. Let PRs get stale, so John has to remerge, reseting the whole process. Insist the commits are &quot;too big&quot;, &quot;hard to understand&quot;, and therefore need to be broken up.<p>Etc.<p>Individual agility and velocity are evil, rewards dysfunctional behavior.<p>If the whole team isn&#x27;t committed to getting the whole team across the finish line, it&#x27;s not a proper team.<p>PS- Additional dysfunction if John is constitutionally incapable of refactoring, removing dead code, and other good citizenry.')
