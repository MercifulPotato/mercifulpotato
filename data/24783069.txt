Totally agree.<p>For me, the biggest benefit is that I want to be able to refactor the internals of my code and have the tests (which map to business requirements, not implementation details) still pass.<p>It&#x27;s also because a lot of the code I work with is inherently concurrent, and in my estimation, you&#x27;re getting a lot more test coverage with the detroit model because a lot of your threading cases are simply covered if you use real objects and test it black-box style.')
