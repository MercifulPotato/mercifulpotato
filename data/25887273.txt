I’m graduating soon and the only place I have geographic ties to is my home town where I tried very hard to get away from forever. Everyone I know from college is scattering all over the continent. Does anyone have tips for choosing where to live as a remote worker, or how to make friends as a young person in a new city without an office? I’m feeling pretty lost. I don’t think I would ever accept a job that isn’t promising a return to the office as soon as possible')
