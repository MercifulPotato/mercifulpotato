It provides good anecdotes, because many people get vaccinated and many people get randomly sick. So almost everybody knows an anecdote from somebody who got severely sick after vaccination.<p>It takes basic knowledge of statistics to verify that those things are just random correlations, not causation (show that incidence of certain afflictions (like autism) is the same among vaccinated and non-vaccinated people). That is what the memes feed from. I don&#x27;t think censoring would help much here, especially as most people know such stories personally. I don&#x27;t know people directly, but I know people who know people who got sick after vaccination. I suspect many others do, too.<p>Granted, anecdotes spread especially well on Social Media. It works the other way round, too. Have you heard a story of somebody who almost died, or died, from Covid, despite being young and healthy? Such incidents are very rare, but since they get shared a lot, one such personal report may be shared by thousands or even hundreds of thousands of people. every one of them now feels like they &quot;know&quot; somebody who died from Covid despite of being young and healthy.<p>Should such stories also be banned, to ease the psychological burden (fear) on billions of people?')
