I&#x27;d like to see this particular convention change.<p>&gt; Do you view it as ethical for someone to use open source software without payment?<p>Sure, assuming the license says it&#x27;s ok. So I guess technically were talking about FOSS.<p>&gt; Isn&#x27;t that also getting something for nothing?<p>I didn&#x27;t put this well before, but the problem isn&#x27;t in getting something for nothing per se. The difference comes from the cost imposed on the other party involved. If I download your code, the cost we both pay rounds off to 0. But if you implement something for me, you pay a hefty cost in time while my cost remains 0. So all the value produced goes to me, and you get very close to nothing.<p>I see a problem with any situation where you end up worse off and I end up better off. This is the source of much open source project mortality. The core developer(s) give until they give out.<p>&gt; Is it ethical for someone to ask a question on one of my blog posts without offering to pay me for my answer?<p>Depends. If they are profiting off of the response and all you get is the work of answering, then no. You will eventually get bitter and stop blogging unless you are some angelic person.')
