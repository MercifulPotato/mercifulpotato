And not the management?<p>Some people are very good self starters, they set the structure for their own work, find new challenges, and execute. Though these folks often don’t enjoy the day-in-day-out work. Other people thrive in structure, with lots of good process and stand ups where they see how they contribute regularly. They don’t work well in a vacuum.<p>Regardless, a team of all self starters isn’t sustainable. And you will need great people who execute well in a structure. If the structure is in place it’s obvious on a regular basis if they’re meeting expectations.<p>When I was in management, I came close to thinking we should let a colleague go because they weren’t a “self starter” like me. Only to have that person save our company’s bacon once they had a more structured role. They actually wanted more accountability (cause they want to feel their impact). And by giving them more structure, instead of suffocating them, it actually liberated them.')
