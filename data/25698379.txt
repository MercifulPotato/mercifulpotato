In other words, it can be seen as a form of M:N threading.<p>Regarding the parent’s question, tasks cannot be preempted from their threads.  Threads can of course be preempted from their CPU cores by the OS, but if the number of threads equals the number of cores, this will only happen if other processes on the system are competing for CPU time.')
