As an Android developer in Russia who worked on a very popular app when our government changed timezones, and then did it once again a year later, I wasn&#x27;t thrilled. People started doing the silliest thing: instead of picking a timezone with the correct offset, they just set the time to read correctly, thus shifting the unixtime by an hour. They then proceeded to complain that my app doesn&#x27;t show relative dates correctly (I just posted it but it says hour ago). Had to add an ugly workaround involving getting the known-correct current unixtime from the server and using the offset from that in all my time calculations. Fun times.<p>And no, you can&#x27;t update the timezone database yourself. It resides on the system partition which requires root or at least an unlocked bootloader to mount as writable.')
