Otherwise, you are directly damaging a key value proposition provided by Apple and demanded by their users.<p>In the end, the payment processor is a red herring. Apple isn&#x27;t charging 30% for the payment processing -- they probably pay less to run the charge than Stripe does. For example, for $0.99 charges, the app developer pays Apple less for their entire fee than Stripe would charge them just to run charge.<p>The 30% fee is Apple&#x27;s share for creating the entire ecosystem. Everything from the programming language, the platform, the API&#x27;s, the security framework &#x2F; secure enclave, the app review, the distribution model, the billing system, the cloud services for software delivery&#x2F;push notifications&#x2F;updates&#x2F;shared storage, all the way up to Apple&#x27;s customer support lines. Actually running the payment gateway is perhaps the very least of it.')
