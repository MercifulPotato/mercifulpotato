Unfortunately their API doesn&#x27;t support breakout room management yet (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devforum.zoom.us&#x2F;t&#x2F;breakout-rooms-api&#x2F;4255&#x2F;111" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;devforum.zoom.us&#x2F;t&#x2F;breakout-rooms-api&#x2F;4255&#x2F;111</a>) so the idea was to build it entirely separately, get some validation&#x2F;learnings, and then integrate with Zoom when ready.<p>In terms of mingle-naturalness, right now it&#x27;s set so the organizer just says how big the mingles should be and how long they should last. So from a user&#x27;s side, you&#x27;re in a group with two random people (from the company&#x2F;larger group) for 5 minutes, then cycle into a new mingle with two other random people, rinse and repeat. Somewhat like speed dating, you don&#x27;t have any say over who you&#x27;re mingling with, but it is time constricted.')
