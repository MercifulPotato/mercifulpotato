In Ruby, I use [the doctrine of useful objects](<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.eventide-project.org&#x2F;user-guide&#x2F;useful-objects.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.eventide-project.org&#x2F;user-guide&#x2F;useful-objects.h...</a>), which without a gem is very clear, no meta magic and it boils down to just DI with setters and getters. Simple and effective.<p>And it has the power of locality over an IoC container.<p>That being said, please remember that a class and a closure are essentially the same thing with a different syntax.')
