Normally, the purpose of a symlink exploit is to get a privledged process to leak information about a file you don&#x27;t have access to.<p>Here, as the article mentions, part of the attack relies on the fact that the privledged process goes out of its way to defend against such an attack.<p>As far as I can tell, the symlink is not even nessasary. You should be able to get the same effect by making 1TB big. Using sparse files, you don&#x27;t even need much disk space.')
