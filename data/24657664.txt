It&#x27;s just that the people who stand to benefit from <i>not</i> mitigating climate change are both powerful politically and wealthy enough that the effects, even if they happened much sooner than predicted, wouldn&#x27;t likely effect them. Sure, they may lose one of their homes on the coastline. The mass migration away from coastlines will be devastating to humanity, but not to those people or their children. Heck, even worst case scenarios like massive social unrest or resource wars aren&#x27;t likely to effect these people. Their kids certainly won&#x27;t be going off to war!<p>In other words, it&#x27;s not a problem of being able to imagine the effects. I suspect the powerful people resisting climate change mitigation can imagine the effects, they just know those effects won&#x27;t touch them.')
