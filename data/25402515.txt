One example is that people very rarely handle &#x27;\\n&#x27; or spaces in filenames (e.g. using the -0 option from `xargs`). Whatever works is fine as long as one knows the risks.<p>For a one-off thing like the one mentioned in the article I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s almost ok, although I&#x27;d put `git checkout --` in the category of risky commands if you don&#x27;t have any backup.')
