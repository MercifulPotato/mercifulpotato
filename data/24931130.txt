Alice checks in only when there&#x27;s enough noise made either by angry customers, cto or angry SREs.<p>That&#x27;s my 10yrs+ ops experience, at least, and this is hugely exacerbated if Alice is put on such a high pedestal that they don&#x27;t even have to be on-call with Betty at any point of the lifecycle.')
