A less than optimal algorithm implemented in hardware, can be completly dominated by algorithmic improvement. If the improved algorithm is implemented in hardware it would be the new fastest implementation.<p>That said, when you implement specialized algorithms in hardware, it&#x27;s likely because it&#x27;s good enough for the task it&#x27;s designed for.')
