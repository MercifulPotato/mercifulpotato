Well it used to be that five or ten years out rates could be 8-15%, and then you had to compound. And that&#x27;s just the cost of money, you need to think about how likely the income is in the first place.<p>So it shouldn&#x27;t surprise us that when rates collapse, companies with mostly future unknown income gain in value compared to those with current certain income.<p>The big question is whether rates will ever come back to what we used to see.')
