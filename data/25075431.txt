Failing that poetry or if you must venv. (if you&#x27;re being &quot;clever&quot; statically compile everything and ship the whole environment, including the interpreter) its packaging is a joy compared to node. Even better, enforce standard environments, which stops all of this. One version of everything. you want to change it? best upgrade it for everyone else.<p>No, docker doesn&#x27;t solve the fact that some packages just won&#x27;t play nicely together.  NPM actually does this better than the python ecosystem too since it will still work with different versions of the same dependency.  You get larger bundle sizes but that&#x27;s better than the alternative of it just flat not working.')
