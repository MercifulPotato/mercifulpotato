Maybe the message is going to my phone, maybe it&#x27;s going to my phone and my desktop - the sender can&#x27;t tell.<p>Sure, if you are trying to add an entirely <i>new recipient</i> to a conversation, then of course you can&#x27;t send them the entire conversation history - but nobody is asking for that.<p>What people want is the ability to add a <i>new device</i> for an <i>existing recipient</i>, and have the history sync across.<p>With Signal I can already add a new device and continue existing conversations without the other participants being notified that I&#x27;ve added a new device. Adding conversation history doesn&#x27;t diminish anything from a security perspective.')
