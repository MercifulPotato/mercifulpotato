I&#x27;d know, that&#x27;s what kept me from making progress with this for years. But that does not subtract from the fact that to lose weight you need to consume less calories.<p>&gt; If it turns out that in response to hunger that your brain secretes a hormone that makes you much more hungry than the average, the psychological aspect of losing weight has been compromised, even while the physical laws stay the same.<p>I don&#x27;t agree.

So I have to work around my unique limitation. But I don&#x27;t go around saying that doing cardio and working out is not the correct way of getting fit.')
