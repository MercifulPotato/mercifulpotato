Not solar or wind or hydro or geothermal, but a good mix.<p>2: A large grid.   The sun is always shining and the wind is always blowing somewhere.<p>3: Over-provisioning.   Size your installations for cloudy days and winds at 2km&#x2F;h.    Solar&amp;wind are an order of magnitude cheaper than nuclear, so 1.5X - 3X over-provisioning is still a lot cheaper.<p>4: Indirect storage.   If you&#x27;re overprovisioned, then you will have lots of excess power, even more power than you can store in your batteries.  (See 5).   So use that power to hit several goals at once.   For example, if you use it to produce methane, you can use that methane for carbon storage, use it to power peaker plants (see 6) or sell it for profit.<p>5: batteries<p>6: peaker plants.  If 99.9% of your power is handled through 1-5, the emissions from the remaining 0.1% are negligible and can be offset with #4.')
