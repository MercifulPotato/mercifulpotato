I do no think anything critical necessarily relies on them being a thing.<p>As for copyright, though.... a large part of the downsides lie with having to do bookkeeping and such. I&#x27;d argue for a total elimination of copyright, only keeping some very basic anti-plagiarism clauses (don&#x27;t copy and then claim it was you who did it). They have to rely on intent, however. Accidentally reciting a joke and thinking you came up with it has to be very far from the grey zone.<p>Trademarks are a vehicle for reputation and trust in a market, see e.g. how you can&#x27;t buy poor quality tools branded &quot;Knipex&quot;, or how Samsung is know to not employ overly deceptive branding&#x2F;advertising for their portable flash media, along with being known for at least decent reliability.')
