You can start to see the ways in which abuse and rape victims, for example, are dismissed, blamed, insulted and ignored.<p>As for the article you linked, it’s very specious to suggest that is a defense or mitigates Connery’s endorsement on national television of slapping women. It’s obviously a quick PR filler piece to run  interference on his choice to decline that Holyrood interview knowing he would be grilled on his abuse comments, purely and obviously self-serving and obviously not any type of sincere apology or retraction of his earlier remarks.<p>It would have been trivially easy for him to make a press release specifically apologizing for and retracting the earlier remarks. Any little Scottish press article where he doesn’t even explicitly apologize and retract is just simply not something relevant to consider at all.')
