In other words an object&#x27;s velocity is a 4 dimensional vector, and the curvature of spacetime causes the angle in 4d spacetime of that vector change, while still preserving total momentum, thereby accelerating the object in space while decelerating it in time. So as an object falls into a gravity well, it actually moves more slowly through time, transferring more and more of its total momentum from temporal motion and into spatial motion.')
