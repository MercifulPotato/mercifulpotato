Those kind of abuse is common in the three highest risk zones for human trafficking, ie mining, construction and fishing.<p>Sex and drugs has a common themes when it comes to making them illegal. If you want to forbid drugs that are harmful, you must first make an exception for drugs like alcohol and nicotine. If you want to make the sex industry illegal based on harm to workers you must make exceptions to industries that are worse.<p>The common response to human trafficking for non-sex related industries is to focus on regulation and enforcement of regulations. Sadly the crime rate is so high that last year, the police here in Sweden announced that they would stop investigating human trafficking in the construction industry. The reason was that such reports outnumber all other human trafficking to the point that they would have no resources to do any other investigation unless they dropped them. Unsurprising there are regularly news about slavery, passports being taken, fraud, threats of violence, and of course physical harm.')
