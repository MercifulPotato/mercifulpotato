It&#x27;s not usually, or ever have I seen it, written in a linear fashion. Cursors jump up and down, you open a brace&#x2F;bracket&#x2F;parenthesis and almost always immediately close it, then proceed to insert code. Many languages are written from the inside out (like swizzling some lisp code together). Most people don&#x27;t think &quot;Ok, this is the code I am going to write&quot; and proceed to type it in &quot;page order&quot; (I can&#x27;t think of another phrase, it&#x27;s early). Type hints, docs, access modifiers, can be added after the fact. Then constant refactoring occurs as things are broken out into their atomic parts. Then what you are left with is the result. It&#x27;s akin to tracing a sculpture, there was a lot of work that went on before that sculpture became something beautiful.<p>That&#x27;s all.<p>This is still a neat product. I typed a page from 1984. Makes me sad that I can&#x27;t seem finish my own book or screenplays.')
