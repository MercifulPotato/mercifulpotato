I am not sure if we agree on what &quot;cherry picking&quot; really means. There is a difference between isolating relevant variables and cherry picking data. For example, if you wanted to track the long term trend of lion weight in Africa, you wouldn&#x27;t also include in your dataset the weights of monkeys in South America. That&#x27;d just add irrelevant noise because, even though they are measurements of animal weight, they are not what we are studying. It absolutely would not be &quot;cherry picking&quot; to exclude monkeys from your sample. Real cherry picking would be things like excluding particular years of measurements or finding other reasons to exclude data that goes against a trend you are looking for.')
