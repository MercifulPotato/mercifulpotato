We&#x27;re talking about a repressive government, but not a race-based regime like Nazi Germany was. Indeed from their own propaganda they seem like they bend over backward to trumpet the well-being of their ethnic minorities, and you&#x27;ll hear of cases of the Great Firewall censoring outpourings of nationalist&#x2F;racist sentiment.<p>The more boring explanation is the simpler one I think; that they&#x27;re bringing policies toward minorities in line with policies toward the majority -- i.e. ending a form of &quot;affirmative action&quot; they used to have.<p>You can argue that population control of _any_ kind is wrong and cruel, and I think that&#x27;s a totally defensible argument, but there&#x27;s a rhetorical sleight of hand going on here where people equate China&#x27;s controversial population control measures (that have been ongoing for decades) with the elimination of a particular ethnic minority, Nazi-style.')
