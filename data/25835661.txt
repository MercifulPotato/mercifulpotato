You&#x27;re right that the Google contacts app provides a far superior experience to the iOS contacts app, so most users who don&#x27;t care about providing their data will use that if it&#x27;s the default.<p>&gt; That still doesn&#x27;t stop Google from processing the data that people enter.<p>But how will Google get the contact information? The fact remains that iOS <i>requires</i> the user to log into an Apple account. iOS <i>requires</i> users to tell Apple all the apps they run and ties that information to their Apple account. iOS <i>requires</i> that anybody who wants to get their location also send their location to Apple. Android does none of these.<p>&gt; Yet on my friends Android phone all he had to do was enter my phone number and the same e-mail address I used to register a YouTube account, and Google matched and linked those two together to populate the contact with my YouTube profile picture.<p>This is called contact merging, which Google&#x27;s contacts app does far better than iOS&#x27;s. iOS is a far less usable platform with far more unavoidable privacy invasions.')
