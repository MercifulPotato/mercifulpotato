Item(by='kortilla', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602891145, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24786818, text='&gt; This isn&#x27;t universally true in the US. Millions lost their homes in the great recession and never fully recovered, it&#x27;s just easy to forget that the American economy doesn&#x27;t work for everyone when it does work for you. Now millions more face eviction and starvation amidst a major public health crisis.<p>On a per capita basis, home ownership was at an all-time high during the 2000s before the crisis and crashed down to 90s levels after the crisis and has returned now to a level not ever seen during the 1900s. In the worst of the Great Recession more people still owned homes than during the 70s-80s.<p>Starvation is not a realistic outcome for anyone in the US who chooses to use social safety nets. Both government and private programs provide meals to people who need them and are available all across the country. What you might be thinking of is “food insecure” households, which are people that would need such programs.<p>WRT wealth inequality, that is mostly a meaningless statistic for actual lifestyle of the lower and middle class. All it tells you is that the wealth growth was faster at the top than at the bottom. Not that the bottom got worse or even stayed stagnant for that matter.<p>From the perspective of the data on violence, purchasing power, disposable income, home ownership, etc, society appears to be quite stable. From the perspective of shared stories on social media, I can see why you might be led to think otherwise.')
