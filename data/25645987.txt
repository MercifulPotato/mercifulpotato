For me the most important one is: The director of the Wuhan BSL4 lab that was dealing with SARS coronaviruses said that the first thing she thought was &quot;omg, I hope it&#x27;s not from our lab&quot;. That kills ALL arguments about this being a conspiracy theory that <i>cannot</i> happen and is debunked. It is <i>apparently</i> a valid possibility.
