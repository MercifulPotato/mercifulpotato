If you make that, and you live in nearly any where else, your money suddenly goes further. If you take it one step further, and make the same money but live in a state without state income taxes, your money goes even further. Keeping up with the Jones in the SF&#x2F;SV area is quite expensive.<p>Just a bunch of sentences to say that $&#x2F;hr isn&#x27;t the end all, but a decent at-a-glance way of comparing.')
