He said that every innate ability to learn has a corresponding innate &quot;teaching mechanism&quot;.<p>For example, an animal like a duck won&#x27;t necessarily reason &quot;hmm, is this a safe spot? Maybe I should find an area with more protection from [predator]&quot;, instead it will have an innate anxiety that it feels when it is in an unsafe place, and that anxiety will drive it to find a different spot.<p>This was really an a-ha moment for me. Where I previously thought that anxiety and &quot;depression&quot; (not clinical depression) were mysterious unexplainable side-effects of evolution, now I see that they are probably innate mechanisms that spur us to go out, learn more, find opportunity, exercise, meet people etc. Our bodies know when we are stagnating before our minds do.<p>The fact that we can override those innate mechanisms and sit alone in a quiet, empty room at all is what is really impressive.')
