This might be libraries and functionalities nobody uses, parts of memory of processes that is used only at startup, etc.<p>&gt; It is always better to page that memory to the disk so that the memory can be actively used to serve demand.<p>That&#x27;s a good point.  But interestingly, not a strong enough one to make eg Google turn on paging out to disk nor ssd.  (At least not a few years ago.  No clue if they do that these days.)<p>Perhaps what you would want is a hybrid: let the OS page stuff out by default so you can free up the libraries and startup code and data structures etc.  But if your disk hits some thrashing threshold because the working sets get larger than memory, let some variant of OOM killer loose?')
