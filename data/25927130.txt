Item(by='dbrgn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611748609, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25926418, text='Over the last ~10 years, I&#x27;ve put around 800$ into Kiva. From that, 188 loans for a total value of 5000$ were made.<p>A bit more than 300$ went into Kiva donations (you can choose for every loan, to cover administrative costs). 20$ went to currency losses. 80$ went to default losses.<p>The default losses are 10% of what I put in, or 1.6% of the total amount lent. And I explicitly chose a few loans that were explicitly marked as high-default-risk, because of the social situation of the recipients or due to the political&#x2F;economic situation in the region.<p>I cannot confirm that my money dried up in default losses. I still think it&#x27;s quite a good model (but I haven&#x27;t followed economic research about microloans in the last few years).<p>Edit: I grew up in the amazon region, parents worked in an NGO. Giving people gifts&#x2F;donations is worthless to most, since something gifted feels like it has no value. If you build a water well for free, it will be broken in a few months to years. If you make the village pay a part of the costs on the other hand, and if they must help building it, they&#x27;ll value it more and keep care of it. It&#x27;s a cultural thing. I could imagine that loans work the same way: You don&#x27;t get a donation, you&#x27;ll get a loan that you have to work for. In that culture, it will be valued more. (Of course, that applies to the region I grew up in, I don&#x27;t want to over-generalize.)')
