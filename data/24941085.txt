Boreal forests are nothing like that.<p>“ Soils in the boreal forest are typically podzols (from the Russian word for “ash”), gray soils that are thin, acidic, and poor in nutrients. These soils lie beneath a mat of coniferous tree needles and other organic material that accumulates due to the slow decomposition rates and limited soil microorganism activity that occurs in the cold climate. Tannins and other acidic compounds from this layer cause the upper layers of soil to become acidic (Lakehead University 2007). Podzols are formed when precipitation exceeds evaporation, and nutrients, minerals, and organic matter are leached by downward-moving acidic water from the upper soil layers. These soils are unsuitable for agriculture, but can support numerous species of trees, shrubs, and other plants that have adapted to these soil conditions.”<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ramp-alberta.org&#x2F;river&#x2F;boreal&#x2F;canada&#x2F;physical+environment.aspx" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ramp-alberta.org&#x2F;river&#x2F;boreal&#x2F;canada&#x2F;physical+env...</a>')
