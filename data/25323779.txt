If you want privacy from both Reddit and Teddit, then it sounds like a VPN is what you need.<p>I think Teddit&#x27;s focus on privacy is the removal of ads, tracking beacons and other analytics that the official Reddit front-end includes, perhaps at the cost of  - as you put it - having Teddit track your actions via proxy instead (although you&#x27;re not logged in, so all they get is your IP).<p>If you run it locally then you remove the proxy problem but then you are talking directly to Reddit, but - unless you use a VPN - that seems unavoidable.<p>So pick your poison, or add another layer like a VPN to the mix.')
