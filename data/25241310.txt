So even though I started developing in the 90s, I immediately used Visual Basic and never even heard of QBasic for at least a decade or so later... maybe more. Lately there&#x27;s been posts on HN reminiscing about QBasic, which is great, but it seems almost like a niche group of people who in the 90s were still using DOS a lot. (Which, granted, was a lot of people). But I completely missed it - it almost feels to me like it didn&#x27;t exist and someone retconned history to add it in.<p>Now TRS-80 BASIC? Or Delphi? PowerBuilder? Or - wait for it - LotusScript? Now there&#x27;s some languages to celebrate! (Joking, of course). I used all of them, the latter ones to make a living at one point or another.')
