An iron oxide fire has a ton of energy but none of the designs or tests I&#x27;ve seen so far even remotely attempt to prepare for an accident.<p>Gas?  Shut it off.  Wood and coal?  Water. Oil? Fine water mist or co2.<p>But iron oxide?  An out of control fire can burn for days and most fire departments aren&#x27;t equipped to handle it.  The byproduct is a magma that destroys anything it touches and if water contacts an iron fire it will result in an explosion.')
