If we were anywhere we would be seeing iterations of it everywhere.<p>Self driving will be one of those things that’s so gradual that you barely notice it arriving because there is no concrete “it’s here!” moment. It doesn’t just get unveiled one day.<p>For example, I bought a base line suv this year that drives itself on highways most of the time.  I think it’s the coolest thing ever. And a better version will be around every year until one day I wake up and think,\n“Oh wow self driving snuck up on me!”<p>I’ve had that very moment about my smartphone recently. My Star Trek data pad snuck up on me.')
