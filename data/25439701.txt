I believe the general public has wanted a lot of things for a very long time (general welfare for all people, within reason, especially domestically), but improvements along these lines seem rather marginal, despite essentially unending productivity and GDP growth. Something seems rather imperfect here - the advertised benefits of democracy seem more impressive than the results, not unlike TV commercials for a Big Mac Meal versus what you actually get at the restaurant.<p>I think the lack of progress is due to a fundamental misunderstanding of how democracy functions and drives progress. Meaningful progress is only made when persuasion occurs. Living in political or philosophical silos then going to the voting booth only perpetuates the status quo. To drive forward, you have to change someone&#x27;s mind. Just about anyone can double their political impact on an issue by going out and having a 1 hour conversation with someone who is indifferent on the topic. The biggest trick ever played on the public is telling them they are disenfranchised and that the system is rigged. If people spent 5% of the time and effort they spent lamenting corruption or political advertising on persuasion, change would advance at a rapid pace.')
