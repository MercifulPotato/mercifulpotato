Handling this the right way.<p>I do think there&#x27;s a larger discussion about trillion dollar companies just forking a project and announcing it as a new feature for their platform without even talking to the original creator.<p>If there&#x27;s anything to improve, &quot;reach out first&quot; will be a start.<p>It&#x27;s open source. You don&#x27;t have to reach out. There&#x27;s nothing legally or morally wrong with what you did. But you can do better. A trillion dollar company can do better to act grateful to be in the position that it&#x27;s in. To be seen as a leader in a space instead of as a consumer of free work.')
