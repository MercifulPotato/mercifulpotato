So I think posting stories like this one and the comments that come with it help solve the problem we&#x27;re talking about here, which is at least partly an Eternal September kind of thing.<p>One other thing they might be able to do to improve discussion&#x2F;post quality is to increase friction for posting and commenting, but that could understandably harm the site, too, and I figure it&#x27;s been considered.')
