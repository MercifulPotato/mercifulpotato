I&#x27;m somewhat of a senior WordPress developer and eager to help, but the sheer amount of absolute basic stuff, without any effort made by the poster, just kills it for me.<p>And it&#x27;s not even the &quot;can you recommend a plugin&quot;-questions, but those which show that somebody has been given a task (or took it by themselves) without knowing anything at all. It&#x27;s like getting into a car and then asking what that round thing right in front of you is for.<p>I just downvote and flag those questions. I think nobody should answer those questions at all and we have to discourage behaviour where people, without any knowlede and effort, try to collect breadcrumbs to (somehow) reach a goal without even trying to understand the bigger picture.<p>edit: Why the bigger picture is important? Because we are talking about systems that are, in most cases, facing the internet. And the internet is a hostile place where attacks against your systems are starting right after setting them up.<p>It&#x27;s ultimately important to know what you are doing and what the consequences are (or could be) when you start tinkering with theme files, &quot;how WooCommerce works&quot; and whatnot. That&#x27;s especially true for shop systems which contain private data of customers but it&#x27;s also important for any page that could be misused to send spam, distribute malware and whatnot.')
