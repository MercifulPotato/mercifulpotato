A few of my friends and people at work do too, but this is the first time I’ve heard &#x2F;etc pronounced as etsy. It’s always been “etcetera” for me. This led me to look up the history of that directory:\n“ But people encountered a situation to keep some files which can be a config file or a data file or a socket file or some other files. So they implemented a folder to keep all these files in it and they named it as &#x2F;etc(As said earlier etcetera). As time passed the meaning of this folder has changed but not the name “etc”. Now &#x2F;etc folder means a central location for all your configuration files are located and this can be treated as nerve centre of your Linux&#x2F;Unix machine.”\n(from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linuxnix.com&#x2F;linux-directory-structure-explainedetc-folder&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linuxnix.com&#x2F;linux-directory-structure-explained...</a> )<p>If that’s truly the case, I’m curious how it got from “etcetera” to “etsy”')
