There are other props on the same ballot which cannot be overturned by the legislature at all. Constitutionally (the CA constitution) the default is that a ballot measure cannot be overturned without another ballot measure.<p>I agree that the 7&#x2F;8th&#x27;s thing is ridiculous, and it is most of the reason why I have decided to vote against 22, but it&#x27;s not particularly notable, this is just how ballot props work and it is why your presumptive answer to most CA ballot props should be no.')
