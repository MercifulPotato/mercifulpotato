I have a 13&quot; 2016 MBP, and I actively dislike the trackpad. You need to use far too much pressure to &quot;click&quot; (even when the resistance at the lowest setting), and there is something &quot;off&quot; about the mouse pointer tracking - I can&#x27;t figure out what it is, like if it feels too smooth, too jerky, I don&#x27;t know, but it feels wrong somehow.<p>Oh, I do like the gesture support, though even Windows 10 supports gestures nowadays.')
