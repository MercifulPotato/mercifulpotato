Haven&#x27;t upgraded anything the past 6 years.<p>Honestly I&#x27;d like an SSD and RAM upgrade but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.  It costs money, too, and there&#x27;s a bunch of stuff that doesn&#x27;t improve with it like the CPU and battery which are key. And secondarily, any improvements to formfactor, screen, webcam, keyboard etc, although that&#x27;s not as significant nowadays.<p>I&#x27;d rather just sell it for a few hundred bucks now that I&#x27;m 6y in, and get a replacement machine with twice the battery and a much better CPU. I think even without resale value $1200 or so machine cost me like $16 a month and I think I use it about 300 hours a month, or about 5 cent per hour. It&#x27;s quite negligible part of my hourly&#x2F;monthly wage. With resale value it&#x27;s probably even 25-30% less, maybe 3.5 cents per hour.<p>If I were to have spent money on upgrades, it&#x27;d be a bit cheaper than a full replacement - resale value, but at best it&#x27;d get me to 2 or 2.5 cents per hour. But I&#x27;d miss out on improved CPU, battery etc.<p>Not being able to upgrade parts isn&#x27;t that big of a deal to me. Back in the day it was, as within 2-3 years I felt I saw noticeable better experiences on the market with new parts. But today I&#x27;m quite fine purchasing an experience and having it last the next 5-6 years, before I upgrade. At which point I want a full upgrade, rather than only a few parts.')
