It helped me and my company enourmously with both recommending solutions to customers aswell as troubleshooting. Mainly by providing a truthfull baseline compared to the datasheet of the vendor. all firewall vendors seem to basically lie on their datasheet in regards to real life performance. This becomes a real pain in the arse when you start seeing performance issues or weird behaviour because you actually run a firewall &quot;to spec&quot;.<p>a good example of this was a cisco asa with firepower (which in itself ia a terrible solution, but alas).\neven at &quot;just&quot; 50% of the specced load, we started seeing weird issues in regards to IPsec tunnels. (SA&#x27;s randomly dropping, getting abysmal performance at certain times etc).')
