It’s very good, but at typical viewing distances it’s still unquestionably lower than the human eye is capable of resolving. I doubt there’s <i>much</i> value in going higher, but it’s not <i>useless</i>, either—if all else was equal, 400ppi would certainly be more pleasant to look upon than 267ppi.<p>4K on 17″ is 260ppi, which I reckon is pretty good. On 13″ or 14″, full 4K is probably a little bit of overkill at present (315–340ppi), but 1440p is definitely less than I’d <i>like</i> even on a 13″ monitor (226ppi).<p>Of course, it’s always a matter of balance, because all else is <i>not</i> equal; higher resolution means higher cost, higher power consumption, higher memory usage, and higher processing requirements. But I’d definitely prefer 4K to 1440p even at 13″.')
