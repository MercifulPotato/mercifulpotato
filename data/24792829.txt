This is why I would limit such contributions to small amount per individual contributor.<p>It makes really easy for a large enough group of fans fund a popular project for free, and double their larger contributions, without the government choosing the projects. It also would still require spending money, or just effort, to donate, so donating just for kicks is limited.')
