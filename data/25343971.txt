There were a lot of new projects daily, so I was constantly involved in designing and documenting new database.<p>It was a PAIN to do this by Google Docs - the formatting is just terrible, and navigation is extremely hard. After a long time, the document becomes messy and I felt panicked every time I receive a request to change a field&#x27;s name or its metadata (which happened A LOT...)<p>Also, drawing charts in Docs (or even in Lucid Chart) is painful. They are not designed to display ERD and so the experience takes a lot of time and learning. Again, after some time, the ERD in Docs just get uncontrollably large.<p>So I decided to build this tool with the support of my colleagues. My initial requirements are simple:\n- Must be easy for me to generate. I hate spending time tweaking and editing on Word â†’ I decide that I MUST use code to generate it.\n- Must be business-friendly. The generated result must have a clear and friendly format so even non-tech people know what is what.<p>And here it is, a beta launch today. I believe many people out there are having the same problem. Hope that this little product can help you find some inner peace!')
