I find the competitive aspect a pretty big turn off. I usually get a few puzzles in and then burn out, because I can&#x27;t keep up with the people who do it every day (I don&#x27;t even use my computer every day).<p>I wish the scoring didn&#x27;t prioritize timeliness. This is really the sort of thing I&#x27;d enjoy cranking out on a plane ride, not every day.')
