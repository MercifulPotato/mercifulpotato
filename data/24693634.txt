I keep thinking I&#x27;m gonna go off of it and then I still need it and objectively that might look sketchy, since I some students sell their meds. I&#x27;m scared that if I bring up any other type that might look worse? Anyway, this thread has taught me more about extended release and I&#x27;ll likely look into that when I start working after graduation.')
