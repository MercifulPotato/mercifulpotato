On the whole, I would think that they are more motivated by a thirst for knowledge and wanting to make something cool and gain social approval from other smart people.<p>I&#x27;m more referring to the people at the top who make the decisions about the direction of AI innovation and use AI as an excuse for receiving tons of funding from the government (or from industry) that they don&#x27;t deserve and could be better allocated to more productive things which will actually help people instead of trying to control people.<p>Controlling people does not help them. AI tech related to productive industries like farming, construction, etc... That&#x27;s great. But clearly that&#x27;s not the kind of AI which Facebook is working on (there may be general overlap, but the goal is wrong).')
