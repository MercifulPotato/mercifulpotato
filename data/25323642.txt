Item(by='Pick-A-Hill2019', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607264820, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25323282, text='I would suggest that things like this are best e-mailed directly to the HN moderators (hn@ycombinator.com). If their response still seems &#x27;off&#x27; then  ....<p>I&#x27;m not saying that there isn&#x27;t any manipulation of karma and submission votes (it happens, or at the very least people try to game the system). I think even dang would admit that their filters pick up stuff from time to time which indicates that at the very least some do try to game the system. I also think most would agree that when it comes to detection algorithms that you don&#x27;t catch every fish that swims through the net - i.e. no system is perfect.<p>With that said - I&#x27;m not a HN moderator so this is purely some random internet stranger spouting words on a screen.<p>However - Your post risks being flagged by someone for being Off-Topic. Because HN doesn&#x27;t allow the person flagging a submission or comment to provide a reason for flagging, all that you would see would be your post being flagged and perhaps assuming that it was an attempt to suppress&#x2F;censor&#x2F;hide your post - Which might lead you to assume via confirmation bias that there is indeed a &#x27;voting ring&#x27; in play.<p>With all of that said - there are certain subreddits where HN submissions and comments are actively discussed so I don’t think any reasonable person would state that it didn’t happen (or at the very least is attempted) so if you think you have spotted something then the best (and fastest) way to get it looked in to is to email the Mods (based on personal experience).<p>Btw, welcome to HN and congrats on reaching 48 karma points in 20 days. It took me a few months to get to that. (Said so that it isn’t read as being a ‘sarky’ welcome to HN tone).')
