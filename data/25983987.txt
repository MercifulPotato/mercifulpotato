But they refuse to experiment with emphasizing those aspects, at least to the same degree they do in their performances of Beethoven.<p>Take the last movement of Mozart&#x27;s String Quartet in E-flat Major, K 428. Mozart begins it <i>without</i> a lyrical melody (one which only appears in the final statement of the rondo theme)-- all four instruments are just playing an accompaniment to nothing. Then a contrasting phrase with an overactive melody in the first violin speeds its way into a half-cadence, after which the initial accompaniment material is developed in more substantial imitative polyphony.<p>On paper this looks completely reasonable-- starting with a little mystery, gaining some momentum, then developing what it started with. The problem is there is a <i>repeat</i> sign after the speedy melody-- that means the players are <i>forced</i> by the tradition of the form to go back to the banal accompanimental pattern right when the music should be moving toward development[1]. It&#x27;s a clear a musical joke-- these forms force the listener to hear everything twice, and the composer is using that fact to <i>ruin</i> what would otherwise be a sensible flow. It&#x27;s equivalent to getting up from one&#x27;s chair and running vigorously <i>back</i> to one&#x27;s chair to sit and do nothing.<p>In every performance I&#x27;ve heard, the performers underplay the weirdness of the first phrase and smooth over those hard edges at the repeat sign, thus hiding the joke. It&#x27;s a shame because if they made it sound as weird and jarring as it&#x27;s written, even people who don&#x27;t listen to classical music would get the joke.<p>[1] And the performer can&#x27;t simply leave out the repeats as performers do with sonata repeats-- in a rondo this would disrupt the proportions of the phrases.<p>Edit: clarification')
