I think that more actors are benefiting from this situation on each side of the trade either by shorting the position and waiting for the dip to happen or simply riding the wave without making noise about it.<p>Most of the core community of &#x2F;r&#x2F;WSB is clear about not to making it a habit and on the other side, you already see some actors trying to exploit it by trying to replicate the meme stock trend on other stock either. Moreover, we will see on the 9th of Feb how the short ratio may have moved or not. Even if it does not have moved that do not mean that the same actors are holding their short, it can be different players shorting the position.<p>The good news, from my point of view, is the raised interest about the situation in the media and the society questions it raises :<p>* When hedge funds decides to over-short a company, is it no a way to force the hands of the market on a specific view of how the society should work?<p>* If your money is managed by a hedgefund (pension, 401k, etc.) could make them accountable on how they use it in the market?<p>* Does the playing field need to be level for retail traders have the same access to the market that others economic actors? Or will we see a stronger &quot;Leave it to the pro&quot; mentality emerge where retail traders are shut down or really restrained by their actions in the market?<p>* In our current world, most people are loosing money by stacking it in savings account due to inflation and extremely low interest rate, how that can be leveled? Day trading may not be the solution, but when you can not increase your wealth in another way than working more and trying to be the unicorn, how could you do it?')
