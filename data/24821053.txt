Explain what you want to achieve, what you considered and why you discarded certain solutions whilst you know they are common. If you get a substition beyond all of that chances are the person answering knows what&#x27;s up. Embrace it, see why it is proposed and simply take time to explain why you couldn&#x27;t use that (or can). It takes a few minutes but the person answering is spending more than you are, for free. Also you help every next viewer of your question.')
