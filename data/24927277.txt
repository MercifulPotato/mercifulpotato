Having programmed in C++ for a long time (but no more!), I think it has too much baggage (compiler support &#x2F; versions &#x2F; platforms etc) and the ecosystem isn&#x27;t as good as Rust&#x27;s.  C is just C and you need to know it from a first-principals point of view, but it&#x27;s terribly unsafe compared to Rust (kind of like driving in a 60&#x27;s convertible with no seatbelts or ABS).')
