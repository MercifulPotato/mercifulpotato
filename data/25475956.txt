Meanwhile, I&#x27;m just sitting here enjoying the hell out of this game. The world is absolutely beautifully realized, both inside the city and outside. The glitches I&#x27;ve encountered are of the &quot;Bethesda&quot; type and I haven&#x27;t run into any game breaking bugs yet.<p>I&#x27;ve probably spent around 25 hours in it so far, with a good chunk of that on side missions. Just like in The Witcher 3, some of the side missions are really good. This game is a solid 8 for me right now, and it&#x27;ll only go up with patches.<p>Playing on Series X fwiw.')
