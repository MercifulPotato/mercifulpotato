I think it&#x27;s just that you do not quite get how exporting&#x2F;importing works. It&#x27;s standard and has nothing to do with Brexit. What Brexit does is that this now applies between the UK and the EU.<p>If you are in the EU and import something from the UK (e.g. you buy online from a UK-based company) :<p>- you do not pay UK VAT (exports are not subject to VAT)<p>- the item must go through customs and have the necessary paperwork.<p>- you need to pay your local VAT<p>The carrier will handle this and collect VAT from you. They will charge you a handling fee for doing that.<p>That&#x27;s the way it is and has always been. It&#x27;s the same if you&#x27;re in any country (UK, US, any) and import something. Politicians did not misled anyone. It&#x27;s just that many people don&#x27;t usually import and are not familiar with the process so are surprised.<p>Try to order something like a laptop or whatnot from the US and the same will happen plus potentially custom duty (tariff).<p>The UK has decided to leave everything: EU, single market, customs union. So it&#x27;s basically completely &#x27;foreign&#x27; and both sides only agreed not to impose tariffs. This was made quite clear.')
