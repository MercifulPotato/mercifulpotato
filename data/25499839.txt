This can be used to work out how it is spreading geographically, its like a fingerprint that changes as it spreads.<p>e.g. the tree diagrams in this tweet: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;firefoxx66&#x2F;status&#x2F;1340359989395861506" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;firefoxx66&#x2F;status&#x2F;1340359989395861506</a><p>The new strain is notable because it has no obvious ancestors - it has about 14 or so changes that can&#x27;t be traced backwards in the tree. This points to it arising within one immunocompromised individual.<p>See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;virological.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;preliminary-genomic-characterisation-of-an-emergent-sars-cov-2-lineage-in-the-uk-defined-by-a-novel-set-of-spike-mutations&#x2F;563" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;virological.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;preliminary-genomic-characterisati...</a><p><i>&quot;The accrual of 14 lineage-specific amino acid replacements prior to its detection is, to date, unprecedented in the global virus genomic data for the COVID-19 pandemic.&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;These considerations lead us to hypothesise that the unusual genetic divergence of lineage B.1.1.7 may have resulted, at least in part, from virus evolution with a chronically-infected individual. Although such infections are rare, and onward transmission from them presumably even rarer, they are not improbable given the ongoing large number of new infections.&quot;</i><p>In all of this, its worth remembering we&#x27;ve never tracked an epidemic in this much detail before, so perhaps this sort of thing is just par for the course.')
