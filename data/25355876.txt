Case in point, the Patriot Act was up for renewal just this year (20 years later). We still have not unequivocally withdrawn from the Mideast (almost 20 years later). Free trade, well, it changed the world totally (for better or worse), and should not be understated as an aside of the Clinton administration. ACA had a lasting impact (one of the few positives). Trump was unable to pass any lasting legislation (taxes can go up and down if we try to count that).<p>In a sense, Biden could be a very consequential President as he will operate similar to Clinton&#x2F;Bush&#x2F;Obama, and I sense the country has forgotten how a determined executive branch can have you talking about stuff they quietly championed 20 years later (as we are doing now).')
