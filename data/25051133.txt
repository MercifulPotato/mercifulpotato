It&#x27;s interesting that IBM discovered that soldering RAM to the individual compute modules in the Blue Gene&#x2F;L (ca. 2004-2007) did improve reliability, in part because they had 2^16 modules in one cluster. I don&#x27;t really buy that argument for laptop RAM, and especially not for SSDs, but I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s anything that can push back against Apple other than plain old competition, which they&#x27;re trying to distance themselves from as much as possible, of course.')
