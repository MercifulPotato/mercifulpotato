They&#x27;re either written by someone non-technical &amp; may be inaccurate, `OR` specify the unicorn candidate. The latter serves to improve the quality of applicants by cutting a good amount of time-wasters, but it also cuts an unfortunate number of valuable self-doubters. Which is why the &#x27;just apply&#x27; advice turns up frequently; the people who care enough to ask on forums are probably conscientious and interested enough to be in that latter group, and some will be good value hires - even if they tick only 20% of the boxes at the time of interview.<p>In my limited experience, your attention is better spent sleuthing about on LinkedIn, on the company website, and especially a dev blog if one exists. Getting to know a company is far more instructive and helps with every stage of an application.')
