A huge market manipulation by a massive amount of retail traders, enabled by Robinhood and similar brokers, that has the potential to cause a lot of established players billions in losses.<p>How can and will the SEC react to this market manipulation; it seems unlikely they can pursue the millions of retail traders individually, so can we expect some new regulations instead? Can companies like RH exist in the same form in the future? The fact they stopped people from buying stocks may or may not have been legal, but it certainly distorted the action price. Again, I think this is pretty unprecedented, at least on this scale, so the financial landscape after all of this settle down might be significantly altered. Finally, if the short squeeze happens, what will be the consequences? Are we in for another huge financial crisis?')
