No one could doubt he would try to cheat in 2020. Why would it be unjustified to cheat to make sure his cheating didn&#x27;t succeed a second time?<p>How are these people risking their livelihood any more than any other group engaged in criminal activity, like people cooking the books for banks? Why would they expect the democrat local district or city attorney to come after them? Why would they expect their fellow lifelong committed Democrats to turn on them, ever?<p>The officials in these cities could only influence the elections for us representatives that represent their congressional district, which are seats that Democrats always win anyway. They could only meaningfully influence Senate races, which many believe they did in at least two states, and gubernatorial or other statewide races, of which there were none this cycle in the 6 contested states.')
