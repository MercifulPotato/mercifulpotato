I can&#x27;t connect with other people because I feel awkward and out place and feel like I don&#x27;t have anything relevant to say so I always avoid conversations. For this reason I have lost many friends and I haven&#x27;t made a new friend in 10 years.<p>I spent a lot of the time daydreaming, thinking of &quot;what could&#x27;ve been&quot; as if my life was done, but it isn&#x27;t because I&#x27;m 35.')
