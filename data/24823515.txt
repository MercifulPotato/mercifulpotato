That does not mean it&#x27;s ok to call people who try to help, &quot;liars&quot;. I don&#x27;t know how much Walter was &quot;abused&quot; by Google&#x27;s bad customer service; maybe a lot, maybe not at all. But given that I only have Walter&#x27;s side of the story, and I don&#x27;t see him as a reliable &#x2F; honest source of information, I choose to discard this complaint as &quot;probably nothing serious&quot;.')
