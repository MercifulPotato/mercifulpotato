Item(by='kaba0', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611017469, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25820548, text='It is hate speech in Saudi Arabia by definition of law (I guess, but I didn’t look up your claim). \nIn Germany there is a different law for hate speech with a proper definition, made by the government chosen by the people - which may or may not have been the case in the former case. I don’t see how a law on hate speech is any different from all the other laws. Separation of powers is a thing (and it should be the highest priority of the people to keep it separate), and there are already plenty of rules controlling every aspect of our lives. How is it different in the case of hate speech? \nA theoretical case of a dictator rising would mean that a) he&#x2F;she changes the definition of said hate speech to be more ambiguous b) infiltrate&#x2F;corrupt the juries to remove people they deem dangerous to them.<p>Now, if they manage to do a, they can have an easier time removing said opponents, but only with some corruption on the juries’ side. And if that happens, they could do away with the change of law, since any law can be applied to the oppnents in this case.')
