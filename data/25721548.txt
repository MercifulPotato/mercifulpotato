I moved off it to Linode before the three years was up. After 3 years they billed my debit card again for another 3 years, and would not refund the money nor would my bank as it was debit charge, so basically they scammed me out of $300. Please use anyone but HostGator. Linode has always been great, and SSD Nodes is even cheaper with great service.')
