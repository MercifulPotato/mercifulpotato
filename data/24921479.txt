It&#x27;s a space-alien UI relative to the Photoshop they know. And while I love GIMP and think it&#x27;s a fine drop-in replacement for 90% of use-cases, it&#x27;s still not good enough to fly (not fast enough, not robust enough, not the same size of plugin ecosystem) for the 10% that are using Photoshop in high-volume professional work settings. Businesses love cheap, and if GIMP could be substituted, they&#x27;d have already forced substitution on their art-houses.<p>You can even probably get Photoshop running on your box with the right cocktail of emulators and libraries. Most people can&#x27;t.<p>The problem of picking up software from any brick-and-mortar store, taking it home, and running it on my Linux machine has no good solutions. Alternatives that you and I know work just aren&#x27;t palatable for the average user. The average user still <i>can&#x27;t</i>.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this is, practically, a solvable problem; I&#x27;m just identifying that it <i>is</i> the problem for adoption of Linux on desktop outside of the wonks like us that are willing to learn a lot of computer stuff off the beaten path.<p>Modern desktop Linux is great, but it&#x27;s a whole commerce-adoption model away from being part of the beaten path.')
