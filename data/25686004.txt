The charm of it wears off.<p>Yes and no. Food stops becoming an enjoyable activity, and just becomes fuel. If you&#x27;re hungry, in the true sense of the word, you&#x27;ll have meat and fat and ask for seconds. Fat adaptation works because if you have fat around you, your hunger signals tends to fade as you&#x27;re already carrying a significant amount of energy.<p>The fact that carbs and sugar are so sought after is great when you&#x27;re a paleolithic man, but is the cause of the modern obesity epidemic - it&#x27;s an energy source than can be easily stored and accumulated around the body, so our taste buds have evolved to encourage us to eat plenty, because it was VERY scarce until recently.')
