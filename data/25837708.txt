It&#x27;s ok if it&#x27;s &quot;truely OSS&quot; I just want to see how they did it, what trick they made.<p>An example, a few years ago I saw a few mac app that show you network metered in status bar and little snitch. I don&#x27;t know how they did that. I wish I can read their code, even if it&#x27;s truely OSS.<p>To me, the value that ElasticSearch give to us is great. And  when I do some cool thing, I myself want to share too but I don&#x27;t want other to take my code and make money off it without contributing back to me.<p>I think Elastic, as a company, doing a good thing here, and AWS is the bad actor here, they even lie about their collaboration between them and Elastic.')
