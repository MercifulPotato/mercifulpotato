The only way that renting actually comes out ahead is if you&#x27;re actively and aggressively investing amounts larger than your would-be down payment, and making consistent profits for the duration that are larger than bank loan interest rates.<p>FWIW I&#x27;m on my 2nd house, and the costs listed have never felt like they change the balance of the equation at all. I don&#x27;t have HOA, most people don&#x27;t (unlike all the other costs listed, HOA is a choice, you don&#x27;t have to buy into a neighborhood with HOA dues). The other costs are somewhat in the noise. Closing costs are a one time thing, think of them as part of the purchase price, nothing to think about later. Tax and maintenance are ongoing but not very large (and don&#x27;t forget rent is also paying tax and maintenance, bundled). The biggest additional costs of owning a house for me have been remodeling, but so far those have come back to me with returns, in the form of a higher sale price on the house.')
