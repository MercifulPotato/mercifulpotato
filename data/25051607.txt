The context-sensitive touch bar is actually very useful in these applications for things like rebuilding, changing targets, stepping through the debugger etc. without having to use the mouse.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of things to complain about with Apple products, but if you ask me there&#x27;s been enough touch bar bashing by now and people should just get over it. It&#x27;s pretty useful in some situations, and IMO no real downsides, especially now that the esc key is a real physical key again. Why all the hate?')
