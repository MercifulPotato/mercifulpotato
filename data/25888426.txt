You&#x27;re missing whole swaths of knock-on effects of borrowing.  What if I told you that the government only borrows money on the backs of the working class, who pay for it in increased prices that the economist class doesn&#x27;t measure because they have lost touch (compare the increase in price of a quarter pounder vs cpi)...  Then would it be worth it unlimitedly borrow?')
