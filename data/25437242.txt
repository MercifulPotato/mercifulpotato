I have seen one or two of these &quot;trading in public&quot; apps emerge recently. The one that comes to mind is Commonstock.<p>I like that this is a public web page that can have account-less following. I could see influencer or thought leader types chucking this on their linktree or whatever.<p>Two pieces of feedback were (1) the sample site was on the slower side to load given its content and (2) it would be good for recent trades to have the trade type (buy&#x2F;sell). Right now just looks like buy only? Bonus points for more trade types if you want to cater to the wsb crowd.')
