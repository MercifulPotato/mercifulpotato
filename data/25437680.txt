The other projects came across as seeming to think of all the &#x27;physical stuff&#x27; as a distraction that they&#x27;d just outsource, when in fact it&#x27;s the most important part.  They also don&#x27;t seem to have any &#x27;year of the Linux on X&#x27; delusions: they are in the 10&#x27;s of thousands of units on PinePhone and they&#x27;re fine with that.<p>I&#x27;ve been happy enough with my Pinephone (just don&#x27;t call it a daily driver!) that I&#x27;m seriously considering picking up their next gen Pinebook Pro whenever that gets announced&#x2F;released.')
