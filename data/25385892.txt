This allowed you to lock the device and make it a worthless piece of hardware when the owner wanted it to be.<p>In principle, with all the electronics on the AirPods, one could imagine a situation where they are locked to an Apple ID and if they are stolen they could be locked down. This would dramatically lower the resale value and prevent future thefts if Apple were to implement this.')
