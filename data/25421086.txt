Item(by='sgt', descendants=None, kids=[25449218], score=None, time=1607970001, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25418676, text='I live in South Africa which can get pretty chilly in the winters, but people generally don&#x27;t understand insulation, so they just tend to put more clothes on, or just wear a kortbroek in the summer.  Even if they did, a lot of people can&#x27;t afford it.<p>It&#x27;s catching on slowly though, for example things like double glazed windows. Also, building regulations have improved and insulation is now a mandatory for normal residential houses.<p>I&#x27;m in the process of changing all the windows in my house to double glazed, and installing better insulation above the ceiling.  It makes a massive difference, and at least in my area (Cape Town) you don&#x27;t need an air conditioner in summer, except perhaps a few extreme days in February :)')
