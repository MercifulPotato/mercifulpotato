The interpreter runs in a WebWorker using a Promise based interface so the UI doesn&#x27;t get held up. Many of the dependencies (e.g. FFTW, CHOLMOD, ARPACK, Qt, HDF5) are disabled as they are not needed to run MATPOWER. There was no particular reason for using v4.4.1. The core functionality of GNU Octave doesn&#x27;t change much and that version was stable and sufficient for my needs.')
