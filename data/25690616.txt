Not handling wire transfers was infuriating when buying a house and refinancing and the recent removing of bill pay&#x2F;check sending was egregious. You want to know how they tried to spin that? They sent out an email saying “we now support paper checks!” And then at the bottom said something like “and bill pay is going away kthxbye”.<p>YNAB “manages” all my money now so thankfully switching isn’t terrible. I just have to switch my direct deposit, my utilities, and my CC’s and I’m done.<p>I’m sad to see Simple die but it’s had one foot in the grave for a while.')
