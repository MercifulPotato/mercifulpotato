Like maybe I want to cross reference my google calendar with my bank spendings on a particular day or something.  We also get stuck with crappy UIs all the time (often from banks in particular).  Dunno about how ads would work if sites just provided data, but I can imagine an intermediate step where we have a tool that can real time scrape a site for only what we are interested in and discard the rest.  Then present it to the user using custom real time presentation')
