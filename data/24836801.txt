I live in Fairfax County just outside of DC. It&#x27;s pretty populous (1.15 million) but getting anywhere is still a challenge if you don&#x27;t live within walking distance of an Orange Line metro stop. This assumes that the metro hasn&#x27;t caught on fire recently or that the line hasn&#x27;t been shut down for multiple months for repairs. Bus timetables are so spread out that a 20 minute drive is a 2-3 hour bus ride in a lot of cases.<p>Sprawl certainly plays a part but lack of investment in public transport is big reason why cars are so essential.')
