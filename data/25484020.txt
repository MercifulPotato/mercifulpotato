From the Results:<p><i>&quot;Although the difference observed was not statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a 46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection.&quot;</i><p>The points you are raising about limitations in no way affect the conclusion of the work. Short of putting infected people in a room with uninfected people, there is no ethical way to test the hypothesis that <i>&quot;masks could decrease disease transmission from mask wearers to others&quot;</i>.<p>But since it&#x27;s pretty unlikely that masks are effective <i>in one direction only</i>, this is the highest-quality evidence we have that they have no effect in one of the two directions.<p>&gt; Finally, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s clear that a randomized controlled trial is the best method to answer this question.<p>A randomized controlled trial is always the gold standard for an intervention of this sort. But yeah, you can&#x27;t do one for that hypothesis. So you&#x27;re stuck with something that is fundamentally un-falsifiable. The best you can do is try to do what people have done so far: look at populations, and see if mask mandates make any difference, or ask people who caught Covid if they wore masks, or do similar things within families.<p>This is called retrospective cohort analysis, and it is low-quality evidence, at best.<p>&gt; Aside from ethical concerns, you can&#x27;t give someone a placebo mask. Shouldn&#x27;t we assume that people will behave differently when they&#x27;re wearing a mask?<p>Yes, we <i>should</i> assume that this might happen. It could well be true that wearing a mask makes people be more careless about distancing, for example. This is called &quot;risk compensation&quot;, and is a well-known phenomenon in public health.')
