Especially when all the arguments for why it <i>is</i> possible already exist in public forums.<p>I mildly disagree with you, but I can&#x27;t even begin to take the other side of the argument without knowing <i>why</i> you think the price estimates given aren&#x27;t plausible (or even basic facts like what the cost you are using for the Falcon Heavy is...). Other responses to you spew out random facts trying to argue that Falcon Heavy is expensive in ways that Starship isn&#x27;t, but I really can&#x27;t tell if those random facts are even closely related to why you think it&#x27;s implausible.')
