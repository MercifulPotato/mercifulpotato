It would be strange for covid to cause symptoms that other respiratory viruses don’t. And since I’ve never heard of “long rhinovirus” or “long influenza”, I’m inherently doubtful of claims that there’s such a thing as “long covid”.&quot;<p>This is just getting caught up in silly semantics, people are experiencing longer term health effects, they are calling it &quot;long covid&quot; for lack of a better name not because it is an affirmative diagnosis.<p>&quot;On MedRxiv, there is a pre-print awaiting peer review of a prospective cohort study that followed 4,182 people with positive PCR tests... if we assume that this study was reasonably accurate, then one in 50 people who get covid still have symptoms at the twelve week point...&quot;<p>This is supposed to be an argument that inclines me to think that whatever &quot;Long Covid&quot; is I am not supposed to be worried about it? If 1 in 50 people that get a positive test are still feeling after effects of having what the author believes &quot;behaves just like other coronaviruses&quot; then I think we should be very concerned! Even if truly long term effects only develop in 1 in 500 COVID-19 cases.. that&#x27;s a lot of people who are going to be sick for a really long time! It would be 400 Americans a day right now. Yikes! That&#x27;s bad!<p>I&#x27;ll take my chances with a vaccine!<p>(And I know the standard response to this is.. &quot;well, those people are mostly old or sick with something else so you can&#x27;t really count it that way&quot; but a certain, maybe large, proportion of those people would probably never get a serious respiratory virus in the near or medium term in the absence of COVID-19. It is a really large number of extra sick people, and all at once.)<p>Also the 4 other coronaviruses circulating thing is silly, obviously the long term effects of the common cold viruses are not going to be comparable if the short term effects are clearly not comparable, it is reductionism of the worst kind.')
