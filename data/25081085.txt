This still absolutely true, even for large distributions.<p>Every 2 years or so, I give Linux another try on the desktop, and it always ends after a couple of weeks, because I&#x27;m just tired of fixing mouse and keyboard settings, touchpads, HI-DPI and multi-monitor settings, font rendering and video codecs.<p>I&#x27;ve tried Ubuntu, Mint and recently Manjaro and – don&#x27;t get me wrong – all of them had great stuff in it and worked fast out of the box, but it&#x27;s always the last little details where desktop linux fails for me.')
