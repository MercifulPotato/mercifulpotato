That’s not the issue though. The issue is whether there was <i>coordinated</i>, <i>systemic</i>, and <i>purposeful</i> electoral fraud. That’s a much more difficult question to answer (probably a no lol). I would say that people like you who say that there was 0 electoral fraud are just as ignorant as the people conclusively saying that there was 1000% coordinated systemic electoral fraud.')
