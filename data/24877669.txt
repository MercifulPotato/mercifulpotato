And there were economics and business studies electives if you were into that.<p>It was useful, but I think these sorts of topics really benefit from life experience. When you haven&#x27;t had to pay many bills yourself, it&#x27;s hard to know what&#x27;s important and it&#x27;s mostly a meaningless jumble. Chances are that most kids forgot most of it by the time they moved out of home. But at least it&#x27;s always easier to re-learn than to learn.')
