Happy to answer any questions about this post.<p>I still work with Samantha about once per year for a tune-up. Coincidentally, she edited the article I&#x27;m planning to publish later this week.<p>Trivia: I submitted this article to HN when I originally wrote it[0], but I was still pretty new to this community and didn&#x27;t realize how clickbaity the original title came across. I changed the title a year later and resubmitted,[1] but it didn&#x27;t get any traction then either, so I figured it wasn&#x27;t up HN&#x27;s alley. I just changed the title this weekend because I realized it was doing well in search queries for the term &quot;blog editor,&quot;[2] and I wanted to make it obvious that the post explained how to repeat my process, so I guess the new title made a difference.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14847499" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=14847499</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17724508" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=17724508</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;deliberatecoder&#x2F;status&#x2F;1333781338340593666" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;deliberatecoder&#x2F;status&#x2F;13337813383405936...</a>')
