Up to the paper to prove it&#x27;s not something you say it is? I don&#x27;t think so. The paper is what it is. If you claim it&#x27;s fake, you need to make evidence for that. Not just launch lazy accusations. Seriously, what is what you said, if not just a lazy dismissal (<i>oh it must be a p-hack</i>)? And you&#x27;re content with that?<p>That&#x27;s not science. They went to the trouble. If you&#x27;re going to just dismiss it, and claim that&#x27;s valid, you should go to the trouble to do science on that hypothesis you have. Thanks, friend! :P ;) xx')
