Sport in the coming months. I&#x27;d guess that those will be a lot more competitive with the XM4s&#x2F;QC35s&#x2F;etc., and likely will cost $299-399. I&#x27;m interested in how they&#x27;ll differ from the AirPods Max, though -- a crappier speaker? More plastic and less aluminum? I think the trouble is that the AirPods Max (to me) seem more like $350 headphones than $550 headphones, so it&#x27;s difficult to imagine what they&#x27;ll do to hit the price point I actually have in mind.')
