That is certainly one of the theories I had and it shows a lack of ethics.  However it isn&#x27;t the only theory I had and they all looked bad.<p>For example, maybe they weren&#x27;t being sleazy and they thought this was a clever play off Tesla.  It isn&#x27;t clever.  It is unprofessional.  It also shows a lack of clear vision in that they are fundamentally defining a company based off being an alternative to competitor.  This shows a lack of leadership.<p>Or maybe they are even stupider than we gave them credit for.  They saw the company was named Tesla and assumed Nikola Tesla had a direct hand in designing electric cars and were too lazy to look up the rather tangential connection between the man and the company.  This shows a lack of knowledge or desire for knowledge.<p>I couldn&#x27;t think of any positive reason for the name.')
