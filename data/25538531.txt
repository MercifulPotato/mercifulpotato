I would then design and prototype apps to demo these ideas. These concept apps were shown around internally, presumably to inspire the people who did the real work.<p>A few things I became known for include pervasively direct-manipulation interfaces (where users do their thing by moving and gesturing with meaningful objects, instead of relying on verb buttons and other indirect controls), new forms of creative tools and new ways of learning information, and being easily frustrated with the realities of corporate research.<p>I made many, many things. The ones I cared deeply about mostly didn&#x27;t catch on.<p>I would love to show you these things -- maybe they&#x27;ll inspire you instead. In the box below, I have put all of my creations that I can show publicly:<p>FAQ:<p>Q - But that box is empty!
