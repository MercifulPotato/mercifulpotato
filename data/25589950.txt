I have no network because i just sat in my office and worked daily...didn&#x27;t make many friends in grad school...just worked. i&#x27;m never going back to academia; rent seeking vampires. the worst part is my advisor discouraged me from looking for internships over the summer. kicked me to the curb after all of that work.<p>now, I send out applications daily, work on &#x27;projects&#x27;, and grind leetcode. It&#x27;s so hard to get an interview without any network. I&#x27;m a very disciplined person, gym in the morning, eat breakfast in the office and work until my goals for the day are met. moving back home, unemployment, and no gym removed those structures from my life. I run a lot now days but the gym was my social life. my phd involved a lot of coding, hpc work, and &#x27;data science&#x27;, i don&#x27;t understand why i can&#x27;t get past recruiters. it sucks being 30, doing a difficult thing, and now being broke and unemployable. my undergrad students i taught have found jobs...i don&#x27;t understand.<p>in the interviews i&#x27;ve gotten, it seems like if i make one little mistake, i&#x27;m out or ghosted. i wrote and app for a well-known start-up in my area and then they ghosted me. i don&#x27;t get this market.<p>i&#x27;m starting to get really scared; these past two weeks i&#x27;ve sat in my room silently screaming and crying...I&#x27;ve never done that in my life. i run by some cliffs on a hillside and have really started to wonder...because i&#x27;m not afraid. i just don&#x27;t want my family to have to go through it....creeping thoughts of uselessness, wasted life, and being a burden.<p>sorry it&#x27;s fragmented and don&#x27;t worry i&#x27;m not going to do anything drastic...i still want to learn to paraglide and get to the top of denali...i can&#x27;t go through life without doing those.<p>..i think my going to find some open source projects to contribute to...i think that might be a good way of doing things.<p>anyway a view from the other-side. sorry for the vent...i don&#x27;t have anyone to talk to.')
