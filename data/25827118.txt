In Germany, the situation changed a few years ago, every household has to pay now, even if they don&#x27;t own a television or radio. When I was a freshman student 10 years ago, things were a little bit different: an inspector (the &quot;GEZ man&quot;) came by my apartment a few months after I moved in. He wanted to have a look inside. I declined. He came back a few times, but I didn&#x27;t open the door. I never paid the fee (and I didn&#x27;t have to, because I received BAf√∂G [1]). Even if I would have had to, there was just no way for them to prove I was actually owning a television. Here, those &quot;detector vans&quot; have been an urban legend for 60 years. I am pretty sure I read somewhere that they never existed and where basically &quot;created&quot; to fear people into paying the fees.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rundfunkabgabe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;de.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rundfunkabgabe</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bundesausbildungsf%C3%B6rderungsgesetz" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bundesausbildungsf%C3%B6rderun...</a>')
