It seems to contain just CPU+graphics, which AMD defines as &quot;APU&quot;:<p>The AMD Accelerated Processing Unit (APU), formerly known as Fusion, is the marketing term for a series of 64-bit microprocessors from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), designed to act as a central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) on a single die. APUs are general purpose processors that feature integrated graphics processors (IGPs).[0]<p>The memory modules on the PS5 are not built in, which seems to be a key factor to the definition of SoC:<p>A system on a chip (SoC) is an integrated circuit (also known as a &quot;chip&quot;) that integrates all or most components of a computer or other electronic system. These components almost always include a central processing unit (CPU), memory, input&#x2F;output ports and secondary storage â€“ all on a single substrate or microchip, the size of a coin.[1]<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;AMD_Accelerated_Processing_Unit" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;AMD_Accelerated_Processing_Uni...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;System_on_a_chip" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;System_on_a_chip</a>')
