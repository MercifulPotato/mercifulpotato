As weird as it sounds I think you have to &quot;practice&quot; liking certain foods.<p>We do. The taste buds of young children are attuned to liking sweet. Milk is sweet (lactose), and poisonous foods are usually not, so its of evolutionary use. As is switching teeth.<p>From what I read, it takes about 10 times till a child likes something they disliked before. Force feeding leads to trauma though; so we provide our child with options and encourage her to sample. One particular quote I use (translated from Dutch): &quot;you don&#x27;t know yet how it tastes. If you try it you&#x27;ll find it out. Maybe you&#x27;re missing out?&quot; I want to stimulate her curiosity because its a trait I like (in both her parents). She won&#x27;t get an alternative food though, and she will be allowed her desert regardless.<p>As for sour, we combine yogurt (sour) with custard (vanilla, sweet) at times. The balance is more in favor of the latter for the child; parents eat a more sour version. From my memory I disliked bitter as child (some vegetables are abundant with that taste). Now I drink coffee black daily, and love bitter vegetables, as long as the taste is combined with herbs, spices, pepper, and other flavors such as sweet&#x2F;sour&#x2F;salty&#x2F;umami (while respecting the bitterness as being the dominant taste).')
