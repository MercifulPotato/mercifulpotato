If a formerly arable area becomes a dustbowl, there&#x27;s no adaptation of our food production that you can do to fix this problem.<p>Moving our agriculture north doesn&#x27;t work either, because of the poor quality of soil in what is currently the tundra&#x2F;taiga.<p>If you have a handful of magic beans that will grow a magic beanstalk, that will be resistant to the temperature and weather and soil changes caused by global warming, sure, by all means, share it with us, and I&#x27;ll stop worrying. We don&#x27;t have that handful, though, and I&#x27;m not keen on hope-based planning.')
