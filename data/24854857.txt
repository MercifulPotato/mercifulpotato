My home was by no means full of music, but we did have a record player and my sister liked to sing with my mother sometimes. And although it took me a while to get interested in pop music, by late primary school I had a CD player and some bands that I liked.<p>So I doubt the difference in ability was solely environmental rather than innate; surely the other kids hadn&#x27;t <i>all</i> been taught how to sing, or grown up in very musical households. (I&#x27;m still very weak musically, and still can&#x27;t sing, but I&#x27;m not literally tone deaf.)')
