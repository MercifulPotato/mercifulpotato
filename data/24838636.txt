It mimics the behavior of the great herds and incorporates overlooked factors that contribute to the biological soil cycle including plant succession, coverage, small and large animal impact.  It also incorporates permaculture.  It arrests the desertification process, doubles the effectiveness of rainfall, promotes deep penetration of water to restore aquifers, brings back the native plants, insects, birds etc. It can be used purely to restore biodiversity on damaged land.  And it’s carbon negative. It can be used for agriculture or ranching (or forest fire management).  It eliminates the need for fertilizer and tilling. It eliminates runoff.  Ranchers who are using it here in Colorado are seeing a 300% increase in hay production and thus the same for number of cattle or bison the land can sustain.  It’s become known as concentrated, rotational grazing but there’s a little more to it.  Alan Savory developed the technique while studying land degeneration on  game preserves in Africa. His book and course explain SO many previously-invisible processes that contribute to soil health. Even without using animals, there is SO much we can do to restore healthy soil cycles, increase the effectiveness of rainfall and stop erosion desertification.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;savory.global&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;savory.global&#x2F;</a>')
