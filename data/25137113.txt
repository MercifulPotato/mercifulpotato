These are websites. [...] Not everyone can build a business. That involves marketing, advertising, customer acquisition, cash flow management, legal, on and on.<p>Incorrect. The word business is defined simply as &quot;the practice of making one&#x27;s living by engaging in commerce.&quot; or &quot;a person&#x27;s regular occupation, profession, or trade.&quot;<p>A kid with a lemonade stand has a business. My dad ran a plumbing business that did zero marketing or advertising and had no regular lawyer. According to your definition neither of these are businesses.<p>Gee, you know come to think of it - Knowing who your customers are is marketing, talking&#x2F;blogging about your business (however small it is) is advertising, accepting cash and knowing what&#x27;s in your bank account is cash flow management and avoiding breaking any laws is legal. So, whichever way you look at it - you&#x27;re wrong.')
