Facebook (market cap: about $800 billion) was all PHP for a long time.<p>The &quot;network effects&quot; you mention do not exist with server-based software. You can run any language on the server you want, as long as it spits out well-formed HTML to the client.<p>In fact, these languages are popular because they are terse and powerful. And yes, like all powerful tools, they can kill or maim you in a hurry if you don&#x27;t use care.')
