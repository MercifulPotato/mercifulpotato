He&#x27;s turned into an automaton, and we&#x27;re assuming his central planner has all the knowledge and understanding necessary to successfully manage a central plan and react to (perhaps unexpected) changes.<p>And that&#x27;s only considering the perspective of task performance, which is not the only angle here.
