Item(by='throwawaygh', descendants=None, kids=[25877863], score=None, time=1611358370, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25877598, text='<i>&gt;  I don&#x27;t think mens rea is particularly relevant when it comes to the actions of corporations. It&#x27;s not at all clear to me what it would mean for a corporation to have intent.</i><p>But we do distinguish in regulated engineering disciplines. A contractor that intentionally uses shoddy materials in a bridge or tunnel is treated differently from a contractor who simply fails to implement legally required QC is treated different from a contractor who implemented legally required QC but laid bad concrete due to operator error that wasn&#x27;t captured by that legal requirement.<p><i>&gt;  At the end of the day, does it really matter?</i><p>Yes, and the reason it matters is immediate when you try to answer the following questions.<p><i>&gt;  Whether you subscribe to functionalism or intentionalism in that case, the horrible end result is the same and people need to be held accountable for it. </i><p>1. Held accountable how?<p>2. Toward what end?<p>--<p>Facebook has good engineers, but they&#x27;re not gods. It is not possible to write a perfect -- or perhaps even passably good -- &quot;political extremism&quot; filter.<p>Shifting blame from &quot;the algorithm&quot; to &quot;the engineers&quot; or &quot;the corporation&quot; completely misses the whole fucking point: there is no spec for &quot;perfectly functional political extremism filter&quot;. 0.000% of the people calling for &quot;politically neutral moderation&quot; have any god damn clue how to define the thing that are asking for, even in a natural language, let alone a language precise enough to implement.<p>Just look at the rhetoric used. People blame in passive voice &quot;corporations&quot; and &quot;engineers&quot;, while criticizing others for using passive voice to blame &quot;the algorithm&quot;. I&#x27;m not saying that we don&#x27;t need a base level of QC and corporate responsibility. I even think Software people should be folded into Professional Engineering  with all of the personal responsibility that entails! But we need to be very realistic about the fact that engineers are not Gods who can Solve Politics.<p>Hell, even if you erase inherent political tension this is <i>still</i> an impossible task. Can you write down a filter that&#x27;s perfectly biased toward liberal speech? No.<p>So, again, Held accountable how? Toward what end? Unless your answer is &quot;purposefully kill all social media including HN&quot;, mens rea matters.')
