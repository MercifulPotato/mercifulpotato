I recently launched Duuce, a marketplace to buy and sell newsletters. With the rise of newsletters I figured there might be a demand to sell newsletters for profit or buy one&#x27;s to monetize or head start. It&#x27;s free to post and free to sell (no transaction costs). You can post anonymously if you don&#x27;t want everyone to know you&#x27;re looking to sell an active newsletter. Also buyers and sellers can communicate directly over the platform. There have been already a few successful transactions made, which is awesome. Will keep on building and hope deliver more value to this space. I&#x27;m on twitter @jonastwt Cheers!')
