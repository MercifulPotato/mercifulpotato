But generally, prices are going up, the down payment is normally 20% of the price. This is one problem, another one is how they calculate the risk. The &quot;law&quot; is you have to be able to pay the mortgage at 5% and that 5% cannot be more than 1&#x2F;3 of your income.<p>So if you buy a 1.25m house and take a 1m mortgage 5% is of that is 50k, so your salary has to be 150k.<p>Point 3) is wrong, they make still a lot of money with loans, a lot of people still take 10 year loans for somewhere between 0.6% and 1%.')
