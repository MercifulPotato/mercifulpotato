This is usually around 25 years.<p>The cables themselves have a lifespan, but it&#x27;s far longer than 25 years. Many cable systems have had their lifespan extended beyond 25 years, but is more of a question whether they are economically viable, rather than technically viable.<p>A lot of cable systems have been retired, purely because they had become obsolete and a new system was more cost effective.<p>Fiber optics cables themselves are very longlived, if there is no external trauma. There are cables from the 1980s still in use. It&#x27;s more likely that the amps in a subsea system fail long before the cable. Once the amps start failing, it usually isn&#x27;t cost effective to keep using the cable system anymore.')
