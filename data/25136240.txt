And no I&#x27;m probably not changing minds, unfortunately these issues seem to be quite naturally polarised. It reminds me of gun control somewhat - both sides having a highly emotive connection to their positions and feeling as if the opponent is somehow awful or evil to oppose them and thus making absolutely no forward progress.<p>I really regret the emergence of figures like Greta Thunberg, while heralded as a great advocate for action against climate change I feel she has actually been more harmful than good - she advocates an extreme alarmist position, often referencing highly debated timelines (&#x27;follow the science&#x27; doesn&#x27;t take into account scientific dissent) which of course if&#x2F;when they don&#x27;t happen get ignored much like a doomsday cult.<p>It has resulted in this &quot;if you&#x27;re not perpetually panicking you&#x27;re an anti-scientific climate denialist&quot; mentality which I find really stymies actual practical discussion on the subject.<p>It&#x27;s not helped by actual climate denialists pointing this out and thus tarring those like myself who absolutely believe in man-made climate change but who are pragmatists who realise the world is not quite so simplistic as good&#x2F;evil and governments are not all-powerful gods who can magically change everything all at once.<p>I also think unfortunately there is a fair bit of anti-capitalism (the system that has lifted billions from poverty) that has snuck in, in the UK &#x27;extinction rebellion&#x27; a very much Greta-esque protest group have openly advertised their views on this. Of course no comparison is made to other economic systems and their ecological track records...<p>It shouldn&#x27;t be about ideals - &#x27;we must cut carbon emissions to 0 no matter what&#x27;, but rather &#x27;what option is best in comparison to the consequences of another&#x27;.')
