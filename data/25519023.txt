This is the way I listen to what I want (along with occasionally making playlists).<p>I actually really enjoy the ability to effortlessly \ndiscover new music I never would have found otherwise that Spotify gives. The recommendation algorithm can be weird at times, but I hear liberal use of likes and dislikes helps though YMMV.<p>As an aside, everyone else I&#x27;ve seen using Spotify tends to strictly build playlists and not really follow any artists. Not really sure what to make of that.')
