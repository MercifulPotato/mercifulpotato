It&#x27;s a completely fair one. It&#x27;s a dick move on my part to react like that without any context as to why. Suffice to say in my case it&#x27;s akin to asking a drug addict why don&#x27;t you just not take the drugs?<p>I&#x27;m very &quot;field dependent&quot; meaning my behavior is influenced by my environment to an outsized degree. It&#x27;s not all under my voluntary control. The absolute best, and sometimes only, way to get myself to what I want&#x2F;need to do is to create an environment that doesn&#x27;t give me the option not to do it. Having a bus that is leaving soon and won&#x27;t be one for another hour gives me the kick in the pants I need to tear myself away from what I&#x27;m doing and head home. The bus gives me nothing else to do, so I read. When it was WFH my environment didn&#x27;t force me to do anything, so with those guard rails gone I lost control, which is pretty natural for me.<p>2020 has been a tough year.')
