Please optimize for casual users and due to Covid-19 social distancing more people are forced to making and editing their own video.<p>Agreed! I&#x27;ve done my best to do just that - but clearly, you will be the judge of that :)<p>&gt; 1)Try to enable targeted video size feature for the generated&#x2F;exported video. Also design a simple UI menu to automatically transcode and resize the generated video according to the chosen video format.<p>Agreed! I would say I&#x27;ve done achieved this - basically, when you click &#x27;Export&#x27;, you can set the FPS, and the video format (low, HD, Full HD, 4k - coming soon).<p>There&#x27;s also an option for video ratio (such as 16:9, 4:3, and so on) - available via the project&#x27;s settings. Hopefully people won&#x27;t think it&#x27;s buried too deep in the settings menu :)<p>&gt; 2) Make it easy for the authoring of the sub-title by including dead simple and easy to use vector graphic editor built-in and integrated inside the video editor (not third party full blown vector editor).<p>Added to my todo list. I want to do it similar to what Adobe has - which will be a bit of work :D But yeah, I&#x27;ll have it ;)')
