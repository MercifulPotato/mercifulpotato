I want to expand on one point that seems to be lurking beneath the author&#x27;s remarks. Technical debt does not necessarily come from technical people. If you&#x27;re in a startup, there is almost no way that you can end up with a small amount of tech debt because the target that you&#x27;re aiming at will change. And if you over-optimize for code cleanliness too early, you&#x27;ll end up shipping code way too slowly. Slow, deliberate code writing is better suited to large, established companies than small, scrappy startups. You cannot escape tech debt; it can only be managed.')
