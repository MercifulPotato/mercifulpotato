Item(by='nybble41', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610405226, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25713256, text='&gt; It&#x27;s more concrete than that there&#x27;s an input, from a computer, with some sort of physical storage, and an output, again with some storage, that ultimately is for viewing.<p>None of which is novel, or even directly related to the subject of the patent. The patent isn&#x27;t about the input mechanism, the computing hardware, the storage media, or the display tech. It&#x27;s about the abstract math that is carried out mechanically by these <i>existing</i> computing elements.<p>Evaluating a mathematical formula and visualizing the results as a grid of colored squares—all by hand—should never be found to infringe on anyone&#x27;s patent. (This appears to be relatively uncontroversial.)<p>Doing the same, only <i>faster</i> thanks to the aid of a computer, should be similarly exempt from all patent infringement claims. The patent doesn&#x27;t cover the computer, which already existed. All that&#x27;s left is the math.')
