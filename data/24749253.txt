Not a blog, just a personal journal. I wrote down what happened and how I felt, with no regards for any audience.<p>That was after I gave up on writing a blog about it.<p>I read some of it a bit later. I couldn&#x27;t make it through a single blog article, but poured through the journal with a wide grin. It was enjoyable precisely because it was so raw. It perfectly captured everything: the fear, the excitement, the anger, the embarrassment, the lust, the boredom. <i>That</i> was the story, not the diluted version I felt comfortable sharing. It felt much more real with the bad parts left in.<p>Write for yourself, as a record. Be angry, be lewd, be irrational, but be honest.')
