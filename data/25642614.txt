Item(by='webmaven', descendants=None, kids=[25649007], score=None, time=1609826035, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25641256, text='<i>&gt; I mean no one&#x27;s made an argument why it shouldn&#x27;t be _optional_ if it already isn&#x27;t either,</i><p>I&#x27;ll give you an argument against optional headshots: Adverse selection.<p>Given the advantages and disadvantage of having a headshot, most of the folks omitting them will have good reason to do so. Which means that those who don&#x27;t have a headshot will be disadvantaged further.<p>IOW, not having a headshot signals one of three things: &quot;I care about my privacy more than most people&quot;, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t be bothered to include a headshot&quot;, or &quot;I am a member of a group that experiences prejudice based on superficial characteristics, such as weight or race, and wish to avoid this&quot;.  There is a long tail of possible reasons and variations on these, for example the privacy one could actually be more along the lines of &quot;I am hiding from my violent ex&quot;, but you get the drift.<p>None of these possible reasons are ones that give a reader warm fuzzy feelings. If the profile owner is very lucky, the reader will treat the absence of a headshot as largely irrelevant metadata, but that&#x27;s the best case scenario: one of merely avoiding negative associations. There is no actual upside (the one exception I can come up with is an employer actually looking for candidates who are fanatical about their privacy for some reason, perhaps for security-related positions).<p>At least when you include a headshot you are only going to get hit with the actual relevant prejudice (which is a social filter that can be useful to you), rather than a stew of prejudices attached to all the imagined or assumed reasons for the image&#x27;s absence, none of them consciously or coherently articulated.')
