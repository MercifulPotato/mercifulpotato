What you are doing is attempting to simplify and reduce a set of interactions that are so incredibly complex that you have no hope of understanding them in their entirety.  Can you point out specific differences between the sexes?  Of course.  The problem lies in attempting to draw conclusions about complex systems (human behavior &#x2F; interaction) that map neatly to simple concepts (how big are boobs?).<p>But, you asked me to define terms, so let&#x27;s do just that.<p>Truth(1): Something that is verifiable, and by it&#x27;s nature, falsifiable.  If you cannot ever hope to disprove something, then you also cannot prove it.<p>Toxic: A pattern, substance, or behavior that has a deleterious effect on an organism.  In this case, society as a whole.<p>and to define a term or two I think you might have gotten lost on:<p>Generalization: A set of conclusions obtained by inference from specific cases (e.g. I am not strong, and she doesn&#x27;t like me, thus all women want strong men)<p>Average: A statistical measure equal to the sum of a set of scalar quantities divided by the number of said quantities (e.g. the average height of a male human is 5.7&#x27;, whereas the average height of a female human is 5.2&#x27;)<p>Nobody has all the answers when it comes to systems as complex as human cognition.  If they did, there would be no point in things like markets, commerce, advertising, etc.  Complex systems often display unintuitive behaviors.  If you have <i>women</i> figured out so well, why don&#x27;t you make a product they&#x27;ll all buy?  You&#x27;d be the richest man on earth!  But, there&#x27;s a problem - preferences are not a scalar quantity like height; they are far more complicated.<p>Something we <i>can</i> observe about people is that expectations can shape perception (2).  Given this knowledge, one can quite easily infer that making unverified claims about the motivations of literally half of humanity is probably fairly dangerous - it has a high likelihood of shaping bad patterns out of thin air.  Put more bluntly, it makes us all collectively dumber.<p>I do not have my head in the clouds, nor am I looking at the world with rose tinted glasses.  I am merely pointing out that it is harmful to impose your (negative, uninformed, sexist, reductive) worldview on others, as we are all struggling enough to make the most of this difficult and confounding life we have without it.<p>(1)<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:The_Truth" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Wikipedia:The_Truth</a><p>(2)<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.mit.edu&#x2F;2019&#x2F;how-expectation-influences-perception-0715" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.mit.edu&#x2F;2019&#x2F;how-expectation-influences-percept...</a>')
