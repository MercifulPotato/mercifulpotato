They like to pretend they&#x27;re protecting people and doing the right thing. But they&#x27;re just bullies in uniform. Never trust any of them. Ever. &quot;My dad is a cop though and...&quot; no. If there was a single good cop, they would have stopped this. Fucking pigs. Your dad is a pig. Get over it.<p>Maybe if cops had better training, they would stop something like this and focus on protecting us. But they don&#x27;t, and they didn&#x27;t. They&#x27;re pigs. Don&#x27;t be another person who buys into the pigs&#x27; lies.')
