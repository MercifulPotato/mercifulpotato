I&#x27;ve been working on Nodewood for a little over a year now in my evenings and weekends, and it&#x27;s finally at a point where I want to open it up in public beta to get a broader set of customers and feedback.<p>The idea for Nodewood comes from the fact that every time I wanted to start a new web app, I&#x27;d have to code up a whole bunch of things from scratch -- user authentication&#x2F;administration, subscription payments, the whole web UI scaffolding, etc.  I figured, instead of half-assing it every time, I could whole-ass it once, and then end up with a product that other people might be interested in using as well!<p>There are definitely competitors in this space (which I&#x27;m excited about, it shows there&#x27;s a market), but I think Nodewood has a decent niche targeted by using JavaScript for the front-end and back-end and really focusing on the code re-use that allows for.<p>I&#x27;m happy to answer any questions, and to hear any feedback you have!')
