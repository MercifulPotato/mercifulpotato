I&#x27;ve been running the company mostly solo for 5+ years and need somebody to take over the core engineering, product management, and ops functions.  You must be knowledgeable and excited about code reviews, and able to both plan a product strategy and execute on it.  Ultimately, if you&#x27;re interested and capable, there&#x27;s a path towards assuming leadership of the business and partnership in the company.<p>Salary and benefits, US only (for now).  Tech stack is Vue&#x2F;JS, Node&#x2F;TS, Firebase RTDB, GitHub API, and Docker.<p>Please get in touch with piotr@reviewable.io if interested in a chat.  Thanks!')
