Veterinary studies are often small in scale and not made of representatives of the whole population.<p>I don&#x27;t feel like digging through PubMed to back up an assertion like &quot;unneutered dogs are more likely to roam and get hit by car.&quot;  At best I&#x27;ll be able to give you a records-review type of study and it&#x27;s a low quality of evidence.  Also, trends don&#x27;t mean that your specific animal is going to be the same.  I work with an unneutered labrador patient who is never going to get hit by a car, and I have definitely treated neutered ones who have.  This association, though, does have a basis in animal behavior and is familiar to vets who work in emergency rooms.<p>The level of evidence that suggests that neutering is positively associated with cancer is extremely poor.  Yet, there are people running with it like it&#x27;s 100%.  Meanwhile, we have stronger evidence that spaying prevents mammary cancer and castration prevents testicular cancer.<p>Good on you for jogging with your dog.  Be mindful of their limits, because they will hide pain.  Keep them in athletic trim and you should be fine, in my opinion.')
