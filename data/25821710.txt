Both PoW and PoS reward validators in proportion to their capital assets. In the case of PoW, mining ASICs, and in the case of PoS, ETH.<p>In any case, the fact that larger miners&#x2F;stakers make more is neither surprising nor a cause for concern. It&#x27;s the rate of return on capital being higher for larger investors that would be concerning, as that has the effect of concentrating wealth.<p>There is less of an economies of scale effect in staking than in proof-of-work generation, with smaller validators having a ROI on their capital assets that is closer to that of larger validators in PoS than in PoW.<p>So PoS should have a weaker tendency toward growing wealth inequality than PoW.')
