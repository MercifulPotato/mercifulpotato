As the USA steps out of its own nativist administration, the UK has fewer like-minded global partners with real shared interests.<p>I&#x27;m an American that lived in London for 2 years in the 90s - the high tide for an American abroad - so that&#x27;s the POV I bring to your question. The following decades have seen mostly retrograde changes. I cannot imagine it becoming -easier- for a non-native in Britain in the 2020s... can you?  Germany and even France now bring a genuine interest in cultivating technology economies by welcoming global investors AND workers.  I would put Berlin or even Paris ahead of London for the next decade if you&#x27;re looking for an exciting soup of technology culture, opportunity, reasonable costs, and relative freedom to operate.  I&#x27;m not being arbitrary in saying this - the company I co-founded, Spoonflower, runs its European operations out of Berlin.<p>That said, I loved London and still do - such a civilized place to visit.  I was there just before Covid times, and was absolutely amazed by the changes to LHR immigration and Crossrail that allowed me to go from deplaning my transatlantic flight to my hotel in central London in 55 minutes.  I can&#x27;t wait for the city to re-open and Crossrail to be complete.  There are few pleasures to equal a walk by the Thames on a long sunny day - perhaps summer 2021?')
