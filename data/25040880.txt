The reason they don&#x27;t do it is because reviews move products.<p>Amazon&#x27;s business is moving products -- not pleasing customers, or providing the world with honest reviews, or being a force of good, etc.<p>That said, it&#x27;s probably normal that cperciva&#x27;s review was denied, as reviews should describe the product and only the product, not the virtue of the seller or the validity of other reviews:<p>&gt; <i>I figured I should leave a product review mentioning this and warning other customers to not trust the 5</i> reviews of this product*<p>Not the place. Product reviews are not about a specific seller; a product can be sold by many sellers; the fact that one or even many sellers are bad doesn&#x27;t mean the product itself is bad.<p>(And that&#x27;s true even if the product is sold only by the manufacturer. In theory it&#x27;s always possible that other sellers will come along, if only to sell used versions of the same product.)')
