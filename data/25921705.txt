And some short-sellers are shorting it believing it is worth almost nothing. Now a bunch of traders buy up shares, sending it to $20, at which point the company dilutes by 10% by selling 100 million shares. All of a sudden the company has 2 billion in cash, and even with a complete collapse, it will still be worth more than the price at which the short-sellers shorted.')
