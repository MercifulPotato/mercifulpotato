There exists a medical controversy over the effects of MSG. There exists racism, both in general and in particular against Asians in the United States. There also exists a very profitable industry that relies on flavour enhancers, and MSG is one of the most potent yet least expensive flavour enhancers available.<p>I&#x27;ll tell you that I&#x27;ve inadvertently done the double-blind &quot;Is MSG harmful&quot; test too many times in my life. I&#x27;m one of the very, very few people who are negatively affected by MSG. But just like the hordes of non-celiacs who refuse gluten, there are many people who are not affected by MSG who prefer to avoid it as well.<p>What I do find disgusting is the attempts to conflate racism with the ill effects of MSG, in an effort to discredit those who do suffer from MSG sensitivity. It is telling that independent studies done in the late 1960s and early 1970s, as told in the fine article, found a connection between MSG usage and onset of negative symptoms.
