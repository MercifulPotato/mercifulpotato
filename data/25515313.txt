Whether it&#x27;s a giant &quot;extracting every penny&quot;, or a startup &quot;trying to survive&quot;, it&#x27;s just editorialization. They made it difficult, so less customers would cancel. Less customers cancel, more money retained.<p>I&#x27;m okay with an optional questionnaire, and I often fill them out when I cancel a service. But if it wants me to call to cancel, and especially if it deliberately makes the call longer and unbearable, I have all the reasons to be angry about it. I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s a struggling startup. A startup is an organization, not an actual life; I&#x27;m not going to pity it.<p>Obviously, an optional questionnaire is not as effective as forcing a call onto the customer. But it&#x27;s the right thing to do.')
