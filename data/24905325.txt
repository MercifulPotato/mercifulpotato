The Antarctic sea ice always melts away during the spring&#x2F;summer. The Antarctic is surrounded by ocean, making precipitation an often occurrence, which funnily enough means that it snows more on the land when ocean temperatures rise slightly, and this snow helps build the seasonal ice around the Antarctic.<p>In contrast, the Arctic isn&#x27;t a land mass, it&#x27;s only ice, and it&#x27;s mostly surrounded by land, making precipitation a less often occurrence and making the effects of rising ocean temperatures more devastating.<p>Basically, there&#x27;s no going back once the Arctic melts, and by the time we see the Antarctic ice receding we&#x27;ll be in serious trouble.<p>&gt; Sea ice volume is above 2012 in the Arctic<p>2012 was an outlier, but sure.<p>&gt; And Greenland has had massive, earlier than usual gains in ice this year<p>See the explanation for landmasses above.<p>&gt; Cheyenne, WY saw record breaking cold this past week\n&gt; Northern Hemisphere snow mass is nearly 400 Gigatons above average for this time of year<p>Climate change will have variable effects on local weather around the world.  An upward trend in global average temperature doesn&#x27;t mean everywhere is going to get hotter all the time.')
