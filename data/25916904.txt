I have never upgraded a computer component. I have never flashed custom OS to my old smartphone. Mostly because by the time the need arises, the device is too old&#x2F;slow, etc.<p>Though the problem is that the issues of unrepairability are moving into high cost professional equipment. Consumers maybe are not willing to repair themselves or pay for repair, because indeed the consumer level devices are relatively cheap and labour is expensive, though it may not be the case on professional equipment or devices.<p>Your 1000$ professional printer&#x27;s head dried with ink? Buy whole new printer.<p>Error from your&#x27;s 500 000$ tractor&#x27;s ECU - only a dealer can fix this, which may take months, but you have a one week window for harvesting.<p>A &lt;cheap device&gt; broke on your car. It costs 50$ in your nearest salvage yard, but you __must__ flash a firmware to match your exact car at dealer for 500$, because only dealers can do it.<p>This whole &quot;efficiency of industralization&quot; will start to fall apart when industries will start blocking other industries. Farming is super efficient these days - couple of guys with couple of tractors or other farming equipment, will harvest enough food in a week that will eventually feed hundreds of thousands of people. If their super efficient tractor equipment will fail during tight windows of harvest and their equipment provider will say &quot;fuck you&quot; - that whole harvest can be spoiled.')
