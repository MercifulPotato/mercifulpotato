The thing is the scope is (intentionally?) so wide that even legitimate, legal and sanctioned businesses were caught up in this with little to no recourse. It goes even further because even those that eventually complied but were deemed &#x27;difficult to deal with&#x27; had their business licenses delayed, had audits, and had insurance premiums skyrocket as a result of having gone through the process.<p>We won our battle in the Industrial hemp side through the farm bill in 2018 that made it 50 state legal, so I exited my startup as that was my only goal all along; but if people only knew how hard it is to conduct a business in the US the State doesn&#x27;t deem &#x27;worthy&#x27; of financial services and payment processing they&#x27;d soon realize the &#x27;pro-business&#x27; narrative that so pervasive in American Culture is actually BS.<p>They&#x27;re pro-big business&#x2F;bank, as seen with the CARES act and the dragging of a new relief&#x2F;stimulus: the plight of restaurants and small businesses that had to shutdown due to COVID, again, its clear to see that they couldn&#x27;t give less of a damn about them and their situation and the suffering to their communities.<p>This is one of the main reasons currency is too important issue to be left in the hands of ANY nation-state and bureaucrats. You can point to better examples all throughout Human History but its still plagued by the same fact that Humans cannot help but succumb to corruption when left to their own devices.<p>&gt;  That already happened to political groups. Money is life and death these days.<p>Sadly, it always is... and the closer you are to its creation the more machinations you can create to benefit you or your organization. It&#x27;s the major pitfall of all Civilizations, and is a massive hindrance to the progress our Species could achieve of we had solved this matter already.')
