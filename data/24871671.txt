Some of their positions would reduce profitability and alienating a substantial number of your potential customers can&#x27;t be helpful for business either.<p>Maybe Unilever management or it&#x27;s board are asleep at the wheel.  Who knows, but there are plenty of counter-examples that demonstrate that no company is necessarily about financial profits alone.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that investors know this, and invest for some of these non-financial motives as well... again,  may not be the norm, but probably not rare for these companies either.')
