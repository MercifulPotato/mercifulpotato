Item(by='woodruffw', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612047225, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25973007, text='&gt; What size monitors are those? I use a pair of 24&quot; 4K monitors in roughly the same configuration as yours. 27&quot; would definitely be too tall.<p>They&#x27;re 24&quot;, like yours. It sounds like our setups are actually nearly identical: the top of my horizontal monitor is also just below my eye height, and I spend most of my time looking at the middle of the vertical one. I should probably move them around a bit so I can actually look at the vertical one without turning my head, though.<p>&gt; With your horizontal monitor sitting so close to the desk, I have to wonder if your seating position may be too low? Are your forearms horizontal when typing? (Forgive me if I&#x27;m being nosy or presumptuous, just curious.)<p>I appreciate it! I <i>think</i> my seating is right, at least based on what I was taught about ergonomics -- my forearms are horizontal and I don&#x27;t have to pivot my wrists up or down while typing or moving my mouse.')
