Capitalism means each individual can choose how to allocate his resources based on the market at the time. I might decide, for example, that owning a car is currently too expensive and I&#x27;d rather shift that allocation towards owning a house. It&#x27;s my choice.<p>Healthcare is not a choice. Nobody who discovers they are critically ill examines the market and decides it is not worth allocating resources to it. Once you&#x27;re ill, you&#x27;re all in. No choice. The only thing that makes capitalism good is gone. But everything that makes it bad is still there.')
