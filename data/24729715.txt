Item(by='ncallaway', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602250250, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24726404, text='&gt; The only question is whether you pay it on every ride as an up front increase or whether you pay it on the unfortunate ride as an addition.<p>Amortizing the cost of rare negative pricing events across all trips seems a much better model to me. I&#x27;d personally choose that option every single time.<p>The time-and-distance model asks me to learn average wait times, approximate route information, and consider potential worst case outcomes for both time and distance. It also requires me to police the route the cab driver is taking to ensure they aren&#x27;t taking advantage of me. And I need to do all of this in every city I visit.<p>The upfront model asks me to be able to compare prices between different offerings (a skill I already have), and doesn&#x27;t change at all between cities.')
