Being a highly-paid C-level exec of a $120B corporation that holds people&#x27;s lives in its hand isn&#x27;t exactly a human right like living in a household. It&#x27;s as much a privilege as anything can be. And it can and absolutely should be revocable when you show your leadership allows people to people <i>die</i> under your authority, your awareness notwithstanding. When hundreds of people die under your watch, it isn&#x27;t about you anymore. It&#x27;s about the rest of society. You can tweak it if you feel it prohibits things like being a CEO of a self-proprietorship or a small family business or whatever; I don&#x27;t care if you want to do that. Just draw a line that ensures they would get nowhere <i>near</i> a position like this in the future.<p>The ultimate point being: you can still let them make decisions about their <i>own</i> lives if you want, but that doesn&#x27;t imply you have to let them make decisions that affect <i>other people&#x27;s lives</i>.')
