The one thing the author&#x27;s missing is the real reason every Vim user uses it:<p>Vim is not an editor. It&#x27;s a language. A text-editing language.<p>When I&#x27;m editing, I&#x27;m thinking things like:<p>- change these 2 words: &quot;c2w&quot;<p>- remove everything in these parentheses: &quot;di)&quot;<p>- delete this line: &quot;dd&quot;<p>- where is this declared: &quot;gd&quot; (this is a custom CoC.vim mapping)<p>Any editor implementing that language would probably see very good adoption in Vim user circles (e.g nvim).')
