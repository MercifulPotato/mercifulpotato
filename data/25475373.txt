I tried to transfer them to a provider with my bank information, and immediately flushed them into &#x2F;dev&#x2F;null because I didn&#x27;t understand the <i>separate</i> sequences of numbers that I was supposed to provide.<p>I wasn&#x27;t exactly upset, but it really solidified my opinion of the entire space: as an end user, my <i>single greatest interest</i> is the fidelity of the transactions that I take part in. Tack onto that the constant whirlwind of technical compromises that lack legal recourse, and my feelings of confidence approach zero.')
