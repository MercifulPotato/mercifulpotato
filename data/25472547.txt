It may work with kinetic weapons because research is more expensive, obscure, dangerous and accumulation of knowledge has a greater effect.<p>On the cybersecurity side, its effectiveness inherently reduced because any person with a laptop can conduct the same research in principle. So, other parties can find breakthroughs or leapfrog each other with <i>relatively</i> minimal effort.<p>On the other hand, NOBUS has an inherent ego attached. It considers other parties to be inferior <i>permanently</i>. It considers other parties are unable and will be unable forever unless <i>we</i> leak something. This is a flawed thinking in computer science &#x2F; programming research.<p>The core of the irony has two layers. First the personal one: The timing of reading the book and how the events unfold.<p>Second irony is in the US government. They were aware that they&#x27;re not ready to defend if someone uses the same weapon against them, however they were so focused to improve their offensive capabilities and failed to secure themselves. Moreover, the attack came via a national software company. They&#x27;ve hit from inside. It&#x27;s like adding insult to injury.')
