He said Theranos&#x27; cap table had an &quot;absence of Silicon Valley firms&quot;, which is false. Also DFJ is not the only SV firm that invested. So did Larry Ellison in the $28.5M Series C. This is all very easy to find information.<p>It seems like a weird point to nit-pick, but in most of PG&#x27;s essays, there are so few demonstrably easy-to-disprove facts. This one is easy. And the misplaced hubris in thinking zero SV firms were foolish enough to invest in a fraud makes you question all his other assertions.')
