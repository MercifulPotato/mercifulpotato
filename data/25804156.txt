It&#x27;s the same reason why HN is dogpiling on any site that announces &quot;Only works in Google Chrome&quot;, &quot;Best viewed in Safari&quot; or, for older users, &quot;Designed for IE&quot;.<p>One of the reasons why users decided to jump ship to browsers implemneting more advanced security features (which invariably including some sort of malware&#x2F;phishing actors filter) was the realisation that even a site that has been safe to visit before may serve you malicious content. PHP.net, for instance, was compromised in a way that is eerily similar to what the author here describes - JS files were variably serving malware depending on certain conditions [0], and the first warning anyone got was GSB blocking it. You can read and compare the outrage that &#x27;it can&#x27;t be true&#x27; that particular blocking has caused at your own convenience [1].<p>Whilst you can convince the users to jump ship to some fringe browser that does not use the technology (and I do invite you to try to find one which does not use either Google, Microsoft or Tencent filters and has at least 0.1% of global usage!), it is a losing proposition from the start. The take is: the vast majority of users is actually comfortable and happy to get this message, as long as they can trust that it is warranted.<p>Should filters be hosted and adjusted by a major technology company like Google? Probably not, and some indepdendent non-profit hosting them (for the sake of the argument, even StopBadware that kick-started the whole mess [2]) would be welcome to try to take that responsibility. But the filters are here to stay until we come up with something better as a solution.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6604251" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=6604251</a>\n[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;webmasters&#x2F;forum&#x2F;AAAA2Jdx3sUpuLmvjtK0m8&#x2F;?hl=en&amp;gpf=%23!topic%2Fwebmasters%2FpuLmvjtK0m8" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;support.google.com&#x2F;webmasters&#x2F;forum&#x2F;AAAA2Jdx3sUpuLmv...</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stopbadware.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stopbadware.org&#x2F;</a>')
