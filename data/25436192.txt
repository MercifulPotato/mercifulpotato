Someone that releases information that you agree with?  His videos are often releases of what Antifa publishes and rarely of his own recording (mostly because he has been violently attacked in the past by them).  Stop excluding sources because you don&#x27;t like the information...take in as much data as possible and make your own conclusion.  When protestors are going into residential neighborhoods and causing conflict with people that are minding their own business...or throwing fireworks or other projectiles at the police...you can&#x27;t say that&#x27;s not happening and is contrary to the truth.')
