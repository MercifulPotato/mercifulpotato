Even legislation efforts like european &quot;cookie laws&quot; and such seem bumbling and naive.<p>What&#x27;s the legal fix to this, assuming google lose? An extra tick box? T&amp;C update?<p>The reality of interacting with large software companies as a consumer doesn&#x27;t lend well to brick and mortar analogies. A T&amp;C section is not analogous to a rental contract. Even residential or employment contracts are usually subject to legal filters... cultural norms at least.<p>The &quot;problem&quot; here is one of structure. Google own android to (a)dominate the mobile phone market and (b) support the targeted ads business, the main business.<p>Whether or not google are &quot;stealing&quot; data allowance from customers, or acquiring this right voluntarily&#x2F;contractually from customers is interesting in the abstract, I guess. In is so peripheral to the actual problem though.<p>I realize this case isn&#x27;t supposed to be dealing with the wider problems of legal monopolies. The legal&#x2F;legislative whole <i>is</i>. It seems that whatever the goal of the action (from litigation to legislation or regulation), they pick around the irrelevant edges.<p>What, legally, <i>should</i> google be legally allowed to do given that it&#x27;s leveraging the fact that they control your phone, own a lot of your data, etc. If the answer is whatever the T&amp;Cs say, the answer is &quot;everything.&quot;')
