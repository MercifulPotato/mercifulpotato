A great example is Landau&#x27;s <i>Mechanics</i> .<p>If your book is long you can afford to be more verbose, present more examples and broad the subject as much as you like.Even then there is usually a preferred order to present the material but the length of your book gives you leniency.<p>This book is the first type but even in the first chapter it just dives into an specific example using SVM without contextualizing the technique. It is like a 100-pages calculus book solving an integral by parts in page 1.')
