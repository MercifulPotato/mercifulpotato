Instead of land speculators like Donald Trump making profits off the backs of our hard work the unearned land wealth will be distributed more evenly.<p>In both scenarios few people will build villas in downtown Manhattan because it is too profitable to build skyscrapers instead. The difference is that with LVT building a villa will be a massive tax burden whereas under our current system there is no tax burden.')
