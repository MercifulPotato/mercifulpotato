Tog gave a definition but I don&#x27;t think UI people know what that is. They just call it UX cos it&#x27;s the latest sexy term.<p>&gt; Also most programs have terrible UX (and bad UIs).<p>And it&#x27;s easy to cure. It involves a) testing and b) admitting your great idea isn&#x27;t so great. That&#x27;s most of it.<p>&gt; but there are not many people having the correct blend of skill, personality<p>I&#x27;ve a pretty good feel for UIs and plenty of people can do it with a bit of training and a decent amount of practice. It takes that training, and a personality that is considerate of other&#x27;s needs, and who&#x27;s ego accepts they&#x27;re wrong (the main thing). The rest follows.<p>&gt;  and motivation out there<p>Just like any other job.<p>UIs are not hard. They just aren&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a skill like any other.')
