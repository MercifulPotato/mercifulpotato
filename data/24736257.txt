It is possible to overdose on magnesium, despite popular belief.<p>Excess magnesium is eliminated very slowly, meaning overdose can happen after months of steady supplementation.<p>Anecdotally, gwern tracked some results after consistent magnesium supplementation and found a trend toward worsening after an initial boost: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gwern.net&#x2F;nootropics&#x2F;Magnesium" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gwern.net&#x2F;nootropics&#x2F;Magnesium</a><p>I think we’re going to look back at this period of high-dose vitamin exuberance with a lot of regret. It’s relatively easy to hit optimal levels of all vitamins with basic attention to one’s diet. We already have several studies showing that multivitamin supplementation is slightly negatively correlated with longevity in elderly populations (or at least statistically insignificant). These people taking unnaturally large amounts of vitamins are in uncharted territory.<p>&gt; As I’ve had evidence of Mg deficiency, I’ve been taking magnesium malate for a while, but am now looking at the more absorbable forms magnesium l-threonate and magnesium bisglycinate.<p>Two suggestions:<p>1) Don’t guess. Get a blood test to check for low magnesium levels. There are too many bad sources of information on the internet that attribute vague symptoms to magnesium deficiency with little supporting evidence. Getting a blood test is cheap.<p>2) Don’t bother with exotic higher bioavailability supplements. Just take more of the cheap stuff. If the cheap stuff has (example) 20% bioavailability and the expensive stuff has 40%, you’re almost always better off just taking twice as much of the cheap stuff.<p>Another complication is that the L-threonate and glycine in the more exotic formulations isn’t entirely inert. Glycine, for example, is well studied to improve sleep when taken on an empty stomach. A lot of those glowing reviews of “magnesium” for sleep are from people taking magnesium glycinate and then mis-attributing the effects of the glycine to the magnesium because they read glowing reviews of magnesium on the Internet. It’s a mess out there.')
