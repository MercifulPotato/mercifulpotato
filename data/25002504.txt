One thing we could do is pick some small industry and run experiments with it.  An example might be food trucks.  There&#x27;s a lot of regulations around these today.  As a thought experiment we could eliminate all sales tax, special licensing, etc. for food truck companies under a certain size (We don&#x27;t McDonalds food trucks to count).  We could see what happened, is there wide spread food poisoning?  Are families brought out of the lower class?<p>It doesn&#x27;t have to be food trucks exactly, that&#x27;s just an industry that people like in a business that&#x27;s relatively simple and imo has low systemic risk.')
