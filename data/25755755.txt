Anyone using computers is using a system subjected to unknown and unlimited inputs, especially when connected to the internet. (But it can be exposed via employees if it isn&#x27;t)<p>Any controls we have at the moment are &quot;this will not happen (under the assumptions we&#x27;re currently aware of)&quot;.<p>If those companies didn&#x27;t run this monitoring solution, they would use a different one. Unless the system is perfectly covered with access policies (none are), the monitoring solution is a global access to enterprises. You can mitigate the impact, shard things, etc. but there are still many cross-cutting concerns which will (suddenly?) turn out to be a single point of failure.')
