The point is that code is a well defined system with clear rules that can be expressed through logic and mathematics. GPT is suited to approximate systems where the rules are not well defined. Until AI can actually learn the principles of logic, it may not be useful for code generation on a meaningful scale, other than things just like simple auto-completions.<p>Not only that, AI would also have to learn the principles of system design, performance, security, readability, maintainability. That&#x27;s what makes &quot;good&quot; software. It&#x27;s a far stretch to say that AI could achieve anything of the sort based on current abilities.')
