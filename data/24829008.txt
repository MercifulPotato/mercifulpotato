Her family called her Ada, so she would be introduced as Lady Ada Byron-King, Countess Lovelace.<p>Her father was George Gordon Byron, Lord Byron, but he’s usually referred to simply as Byron.<p>At some point “Ada Lovelace” stuck as the common way to refer to Lady Lovelace. I have never seen her referred to as Augusta Ada Byron-King.')
