If you set that precedent then hedge funds will short more than 100% of every company on the stock market and make a lot of money of that.<p>Do you know what short selling more than 100% of the available stock does? It&#x27;s the same as if every single stock owner collectively decided to sell their shares. Worse 140% of the float was shorted which means the amount of people that sold their shares was bigger than the entire market. That&#x27;s an extreme example of market manipulation and that is what happened to GME. It was trading at $4 per share when its fundamentals would value it at $20.<p>You&#x27;re also forgetting that this started with the Chewy CEO buying a 13% share in the market because he wanted to turn Gamestop into a growing company. That was the day when short sellers should have started sweating but they kept shorting more and more. They could have made a lot of money by closing their positions. If they had done so they could have shorted Gamestop again once its digital business turns out to be a dud and short it again with almost no risk. Why on earth did they not do the responsible thing? Come on. It&#x27;s extremely crazy what they did and it can only be explained by greed. When you short a stock from $20 or more to $4 the only upside left is that the stock literally goes to $0. That&#x27;s a measly $4 when you already have safe $16 gains per share.<p>Unfortunately they failed to close their shorts and become rich. I don&#x27;t know exactly how much Melvin Capital had in shorts but they probably could have made $3-6 billion off reasonably safe shorts. If they started at $3 billion they would have basically trippled their starting capital. That&#x27;s a bitcoin bubble level of return with a fraction of the risk. It was almost guaranteed money.<p>Now enter greed. They never exited their shorts until recently and they probably didn&#x27;t exit all of them. Other hedgefunds still keep shorting the stock even though it is going up astronomically.<p>How does wall street bets enter the picture? Wallstreet bets is just a place where your average retail investor posts some memes about how much money they have lost. They&#x27;ve grown thick skin and are willing to trade $300 or $600 with the full expectation of losing the entire investment.\nThey absolutely love household brands. They shill Nokia, Blackberry and also Gamestop. Here is the thing. They know that short sellers are holding the bag and completely &quot;overshorted&quot; the market and put themselves into a really bad position of their own making. They started buying the stock because it fits with the WSB theme. They value the stock like a beanie baby. The stock itself is what they care about, not how much it costs and that means they will not sell their precious stock. It&#x27;s like any other consumer good. They are basically decorating their broker trading apps with stocks and the accompanying losses. It&#x27;s purely about fun.<p>Okay now lets go back to what you said.<p>&gt; The only manipulation anyone is engaging in are the WSB people,<p>As I said they basically buy shares and hold them. What I haven&#x27;t said is that WSB is a tiny fraction of the buyers of GME. There are lots of large institutional traders investing into GME. The only difference is that WSB types tend to be slow and just end up holding the stock way too long. Either by accident or intentionally. This idiotic slowness is actually very bad for short sellers because they bank on desperate people selling their shares in a panic. It&#x27;s a situation in which the disadvantaged retail trader somehow does not suffer from his weaknesses.<p>&gt;and they should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,<p>They aren&#x27;t breaking any laws. The short sellers are potentially doing illegal naked shorts. We don&#x27;t know but considering that more than the 60 million shares are shorted its not impossible that 5 million of them are naked.<p>&gt;and should be made to forfeit any and all profits made from this criminal scheme<p>What about the act of selling all shares in a market to artificially drop the value of a share below its fundamental value? Why is that not a criminal scheme? I&#x27;ll repeat, if you let the short sellers get away with this then they can get away with anything. They can tank any stock simply through the act of shorting. If shorting 100% isn&#x27;t enough then they&#x27;ll go for %200. If that isn&#x27;t enough they will short %300. There is no limit to how many shares you can short just like there is no limit to how much debt banks can create if it wasn&#x27;t for reserve requirements. With this strategy you can reduce the market cap of any stock to zero. Think of destroying Apple overnight. That&#x27;s what you can do with naked shorts.<p>&gt;plus penalties and a permanent ban from trading securities.<p>The only counter strategy against an over shorted stock is to just buy it. There is absolutely nothing illegal about buying stocks. However, if you make it impossible to buy it then you basically make the short selling scheme self fulfilling because it has no natural predator.')
