They are never grouped together as “environments”, but instead are independently managed for each deploy. This is a model that scales up smoothly as the app naturally expands into more deploys over its lifetime.&quot;<p>How do you do that practically while avoiding bundling vars in files? I know you can use e.g. docker secrets for credentials, but what about bare metal? For example, how would you manage deployments of a NodeJS service? Or a create-react-app project?')
