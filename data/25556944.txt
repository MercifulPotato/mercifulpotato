The worst part is you need to budget quite a lot of extra travel time before your flight since you need to clear customs before boarding the plane. Less terrible but still annoying, since there&#x27;s a separate terminal just for US departures, if your party is going to different (US &amp; non-US destinations) you have to split up.')
