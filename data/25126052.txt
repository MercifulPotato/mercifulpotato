Maybe it’s my own ignorance, but I don’t know what kind of apps (besides web browsers) would want just the web rendering engine and not various other components in a web browser. What are the responsibilities of a “web rendering engine” anyway? How tightly coupled is it to the DOM? Does it “own” the DOM, or is that owned by some other component in the browser? In the latter case, how are the relevant aspects of the DOM communicated to servo? And does the rest of the web engine query servo for things (e.g., “what are the exact coordinates of this &lt;div&gt;?”)? If this engine ends up not being so web-specific, then maybe it could be used as a replacement for Skia, more or less.')
