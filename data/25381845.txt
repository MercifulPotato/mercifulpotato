An old CPU just supporting the base x86 instructions probably doesn&#x27;t have a hardware solution. Is it unfair to compare them?<p>If the utilisation of the hardware accelerators is completly opaque to the user (not importing special libraries) is it unfair that one CPU has specific hardware implementation for common tasks and one only has the generic circuitry?')
