I&#x27;m sorry but I&#x27;ve used linux on the desktop many times, using many different distros, and many different desktop environments. It&#x27;s shiny and pretty when you first install and then very quickly you run into apps that don&#x27;t follow that design methodology and it takes you out of it. Desktop linux is not ready for average users and honestly it may never be. Also &quot;getting stuff done.&quot; and desktop linux do not belong in the same sentence. I&#x27;ve personally spent and watched coworkers spend hours and hours tinkering with graphics cards drivers or other random quirks. Linux is amazing, don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a workhorse with immense power and the ability to tinker to your heart&#x27;s content BUT most users, myself included, don&#x27;t want to put in the upfront and ongoing work to keep it in tip-top condition.<p>I will forever use linux on servers and enjoy every minute of it but for the desktop linux is nowhere near ready for primetime. I&#x27;ve watched too many people online and in-person preach about linux on the desktop and then watched them having to spend tons of time tinkering with it so they can &quot;get stuff done&quot;. Is it possible to be productive on the linux desktop? Absolutely but I value my time way too highly to spend the effort to make that a reality.')
