One day I realized GitHub lets you customize them, so I started making some templates.<p>That eventually turned into a full product. Itâ€™s free to use. And it can create some nice open graph images for your open source projects.<p>I use the GitHub API to pull in a few stats from the repo: stars, language, forks, open issues, creator avatar.<p>I hope this helps the open source community by giving them a nicer way to share their projects.')
