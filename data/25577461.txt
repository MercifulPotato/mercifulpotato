E.g. if the spike protein bears a sufficient resemblance to part of another protein expressed by healthy human tissue, is there a risk of an immune response?  Presumably the Phase 1 trial would sort that out for the most part, just wondering if there is any kind of ability to screen for that ahead of time.')
