She made a mini series podcast called Constellation Prize for the Believer magazine this year. I want to say that my favourite episode is &quot;My Year with Franz&quot; where she spends a couple of years listening to Franz Wright&#x27;s (a poet) recordings which he made in the last years of his life. It is very moving and sad story. However, I am not 100% sure that this qualifies as a 2020 release, since its a re-release of her work and the original was released on 2019.<p>However, Crossing Guard (first episode in Constellation Prize) is also very good. It is Bianca interviewing a crossing guard and it gets very existential. I listen to it when I feel lonely.')
