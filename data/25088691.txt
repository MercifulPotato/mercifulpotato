If other people here want to continue to make it about me that my comment in this discussion happens to have been upvoted by other people, I&#x27;m not taking responsibility for that. It was my third comment for the day on HN and the other two have been utterly and completely ignored so far.<p>I have no control over other people&#x27;s upvotes and a really poor ability to predict which of my comments will do well on HN. I spend about half my time going &quot;That was <i>brilliant</i>. Why doesn&#x27;t anyone appreciate me?&quot; and the other half going &quot;God, why is this being upvoted so much???&quot; and maybe one percent of my time going &quot;Yes, this makes total sense to me how this comment is being received.&quot; (Comment not intended to be mathematically accurate nor to cover all scenarios of how I feel about HN reactions to my comments.)<p>0_o<p>Toodle doo, y&#x27;all.')
