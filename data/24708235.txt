The entire system fits on a single PCB board. The rest of the size of the internals are a massive cooling fan (about 30% of the overall console size) and a huge full-height-full-length heatsink.<p>I am assuming that the radial layout of the SSDs (which are hard soldered btw, so not user replaceable&#x2F;upgradable like past models) and the RAM, must be for cooling purposes as well.<p>Overall the PCB is not very condense. Everything is quite spread out on it... again I assume for cooling. It looks like cooling is either a major concern for this device, or that Sony over-engineered its cooling in order to prevent problems.<p>(Edit: oh in my off the cuff estimation, I am also attributing the empty space in the case to cooling as well, since that is an intentional design choice by Sony and contributes to its airflow capability and cooling capability).')
