Iâ€™m not aware of any. In fact there are social reasons people might stay up late. It is a mistake to ignore that.<p>They had this discussion in Iceland recently (which is on permanent DST; and with heavy population centers way north of Alaskan population centers) and health officials were pretty keen on moving to standard time precisely because teenagers have a hard time waking up so often before sunrise. Yes a big part of the year will always be before sunrise, however on standard that part is shorter.')
