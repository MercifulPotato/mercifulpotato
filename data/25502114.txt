This has led me to adopting new workflow tools and plugins, but I still haven&#x27;t done much to address what seems to be the elephant in the room - having most of the work I do go through a keyboard with a infamously impractical layout, especially for programming. I&#x27;ve been curious to try switching to a layout like Dvorak, but never actually wanted to spend the time. One thing I find particularly frustrating is the frequency of symbols I have to type while programming that are pretty unergonomic to input and often lead to typos. For example all the []\\{}|;&#x27;:&quot; keys on the right hand side. I saw a snippet of some Rust code a minute ago (below) and one of my initial reactions was apprehension toward the use of pipes &quot;|&quot; in the lambda syntax since they&#x27;re relatively difficult to press. The keyboard is definitely something I don&#x27;t want biasing my judgement of a language or syntax, so that feeling has reminded me that it might be worth investing the time in taking a new approach.<p>Rust snippet:\nlet squares: Vec&lt;_&gt; = (0..10).map(|i| i * i).collect();<p>Do you use Dvorak or another keyboard layout alternative to QWERTY?<p>Do you use any other unconventional input devices such as mouse alternatives?<p>Do you use any other non-standard input configurations?')
