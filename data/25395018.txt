YouTube is a private company. They&#x27;re pretty much allowed to moderate the content on their platform in an arbitrary way. I would argue that this is a good thing.<p>They are allowed to, but they should be criticized for being hostile to the concept of free speech.  Especially since nobody believes YouTube endorses what is posted on Youtube videos.<p>Separately, their monopoly should be broken up. We can&#x27;t let a company dictate all political discourse in the country.')
