That was the count in Wisconsin.  Looks like a virtual tie to me.<p>That&#x27;s the information we have, and it&#x27;s real, so it&#x27;s much more valid than any poll which poorly samples a few thousand people.<p>Maybe it was a fluke result.  But that&#x27;s unlikely because the other Midwestern states had similar results.   But a fluke in which direction?   You don&#x27;t know, so it&#x27;s even odds in both directions.')
