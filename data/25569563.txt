Incredibly frustrating doing all of the steps on phone support to even get someone to come out. They advertise it as better than an Apple store, but after the first year you have to mail it in with a two week repair delay<p>I now use a MacBook with zero issues, while the XPS never worked properly (they forgot thermal paste after the first repair) and it died entirely after barely 2 years. Huge waste of money')
