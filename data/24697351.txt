IDEs have their place.  So do the &#x27;minimal&#x27; editors.  The biggest gripe I have with modal editors like vim is they seem to adhere to the path of most surprise instead of least.  With most IDEs they try to get you into moving text into a file quickly.  A modal editor you first have to learn how to just change modes.  I can not number the amount of times I started typing and had the conclusion &#x27;I have no idea what I just did to my document and what state the editor is in now&#x27;.  Which is maximum surprise :)  I get why they were made in the first place.  They are a thing of teletype machines.  Yet we keep this mode style editor around.  It is interesting.  I personally am kind of stuck with this right now due to the way my work manages machines.  So I am stuck with whatever the box has on it.  So minimal customization is allowed.')
