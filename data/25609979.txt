You&#x27;re not defending a comment that was based on any data, you&#x27;re defending the <i>a priori</i> reasoning with which someone decided to <i>rebut</i> someone&#x27;s reportage of own experience. I do not think you would stand for that for one second if the topic was operating system development or database engineering or anything at all involving experience that you recognized and valued.<p>Secondly, you&#x27;re wrong. &quot;Lived experience&quot; is not the same as &quot;an anecdote.&quot; An anecdote is a story. Experience is interrogable. The man sharing his experience is right here on HN. The person who wrote was not repeating a story that he had heard, or describing a single isolated incident.')
