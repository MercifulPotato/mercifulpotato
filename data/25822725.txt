Where there is water, there is oxygen.<p>Edit:\nI assume people are missing my reasoning. Yes, water requires energy to split, but assuming you are doing some other process that ends up with a resulting split anyway, you could use the hydrocarbons as a fuel source at that stage. Think recycling, not energy production.')
