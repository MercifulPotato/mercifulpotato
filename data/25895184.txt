My parents paid $140k for their house a few years ago in flyover country. $300k would be going overboard. My mom&#x27;s a nurse and my dad is basically an account executive for a food distributor in the area -- both thoroughly normal middle class jobs. My guess, though, is many folks here wouldn&#x27;t be willing to do either of those jobs or they wouldn&#x27;t be willing to live in middle America. If you want an interesting, trendy job in a hot urban center where you&#x27;re constantly surrounded by the best restaurants, parks, bars, museums, and more, naturally you&#x27;re going to need to either make a lot of money or make sacrifices in your life.<p>&gt; No amount of stop-the-rat-race mentality gets me a house for $300,000.<p>Note that the median price of a home in the US is somewhere in the $250k - $300k range.')
