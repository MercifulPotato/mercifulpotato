Of course, very usefull when prototyping a CPU, but if you only want a CPU... you can just buy one.<p>I think a more interesting use is for hardware that you <i>can&#x27;t</i> buy. Like the balls in this project:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IceCube_Neutrino_Observatory" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;IceCube_Neutrino_Observatory</a><p>Those balls contains frequency analyzers implemented on FPGA:s, essentially doing Fourier transforms using lookup table maths. This means they can do transforms much, much faster than in software.')
