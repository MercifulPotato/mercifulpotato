On his advice, I never left my apartment :-).  I went for more than 24 hours, closer to 40, from Friday night to Sunday around noon when my roommates returned.<p>I had a basement apartment and my bedroom was totally dark without lights on, and the rest of the apartment very close to totally dark, so that really helped compared to the author as I only had to don a blindfold before leaving my room.<p>I tried to replicate the experience of being blind and did a whole bunch of stuff; I cooked 4 simple meals (very, very, carefully) did the dishes and put everything away each time, tried to clean my place, showered and shaved, drank a few beers, played music on my roommates CD stereo system, practised karate.  I reorganized the cupboard after the first breakfast.<p>Maybe I have better balance than the author,  but I had no trouble moving around my apartment and certainly never crawled anywhere.  Heck, I became quite adept at simply walking to my roommates room, going through their CD collection and putting something on every hour (their collection was alphabetically sorted so I was sort of able to find what I was looking for with a few tries).<p>Mostly, I was bored.  I never became lethargic on anything like that, maybe because I was getting up and moving around all the time.  Maybe the karate kata and other exercises helped.<p>I lucid dreamed for the first time.  I experienced the flashes he talked about as well.  I learned to be careful where I put things as I spent the first morning constantly trying to figure out where I had set things down.  I gained an appreciation for how it would be to totally blind (my classmate had zero vision).<p>Mostly, I was surprised the author didn&#x27;t DO anything.  Didn&#x27;t try to make meals (ants? wtf?).  Basically just sat and listened to music.  No wonder he got lethargic.')
