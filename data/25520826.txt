Item(by='loceng', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608750004, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25520777, text='Yes, but if you&#x27;re providing people enough to at least cover the costs of necessary services (perhaps even providing 10%+ above costs to allow budget for R&amp;D or profit) then a competitor will come along who&#x27;s against ads (for reasons: interruptive&#x2F;intrusive, manipulative, etc) then there at least is a choice now possible - the ability to compete with ad-only funded options. Some people, maybe the majority of people, will be fine with using ad-only supported systems - exchanging their time, attention, and being manipulated - so then they have more of their UBI to spend elsewhere. The important point is the fluidity it allows within the system, to allow competitors to exist who don&#x27;t need to depend on ads; and then you&#x27;ll have the whole ad industrial complex + every other company that depends on influencing&#x2F;manipulating people with ads to sustain their sales trying to counter how much UBI get so these systems can&#x27;t be maintained without ads, keeping non-manipulative competition down at a disadvantage and unable to compete adequately.')
