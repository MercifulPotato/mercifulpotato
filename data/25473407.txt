That begs the question: are there resources that do? This is <i>not</i> a question about how lexing and parsing works, the merits of parser generators and specific grammars, the implementation of canonical parsers, or codebase examples, e.g., JetBrains community edition. It <i>is</i> a question about design patterns for practical concerns like evolution and maintainability, generating great error messages, operating incrementally, and remaining snappy when used on real (not pathological) PL sources.
