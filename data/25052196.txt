It&#x27;s talking with people who know how to get shit done and some of those people happen to be millionaires and billionaires because they know how to get shit done. Others are lowly PhDs (okay, sometimes someone is both a Phd and a zillionaire).<p>And they will, in a surprising number of cases, answer your questions in layman&#x27;s terms even though you are a big fat nobody. Assuming you are <i>not</i> blatantly an over the top asshole about it.<p>(Whoops. Forgot the <i>not</i>. That&#x27;s a bad thing.)')
