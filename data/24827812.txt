If a bunch of enlisted folks who make less than 30k a year get the equivalent (or close to) a felony for their actions, I would expect the Secretary of State to get much more.<p>Obviously it makes it hard to have this discussion in light of someone like Trump who has escaped accountability at every turn, and attempts to do so devolve into a sick game of &quot;which is worse&quot;. What I&#x27;d like to remind people of is what she did is a felony for most, and the constituents (and her) turned it into a meme to escape accountability. If we&#x27;re big enough to say Donald Trump is bad, I think we&#x27;re big enough to stop letting people trivialize this issue to their own ends too.')
