No more, no less.<p>I&#x27;m a free speech absolutist, but violent speech, &quot;fighting words,&quot; insurrectionist speech, etc. are <i>not</i> protected under any free speech doctrine. Free speech isn&#x27;t some <i>carte blanche</i> that allows anyone to say anything at any time. That&#x27;s not how it works†. I&#x27;ve argued in favor of free speech here on HN (and got the downvotes to prove it) more times than I can remember.<p>But this letter by Gab is absolutely disingenuous. Eric Coomer, a Dominion executive, for example, is <i>not</i> a public person. He has received death threats and is currently in a secure location due to credible threats to his family, children, and parents. At this very moment, on Gab TV, we have a live channel discussing his alleged fixing of votes (featuring Lin Wood). I mean, this is a blatant attack on a private person that has been proven to incite violence.<p>This has nothing to do with free speech, and Gab is an absolute cesspool of delusional QAnon conspiracies, anti-vaxxers, and adjacent movements. They&#x27;re going to have a hard time monetizing (just as 4chan did).<p>† See Mill&#x27;s <i>Harm Principle</i>.')
