Instead they initially refused to tell her the reasons for the demand for retraction.<p>They didn&#x27;t give her a chance to address those factors at first.<p>Later they had a manager read the confidential feedback on the paper in question, but still didn&#x27;t leg her read it herself.<p>If that feedback was only saying that the paper lacked relevant new context and advancements, why were they being so cagey about it?  Something doesn&#x27;t smell right about that.')
