Business open as usual, kids go to school in person as usual, bar open as usual. I would happily choose to live there if I can choose.<p>USA is not bad at all, number of case is high but most of it are asymptomatic or only have mild symptom. What bad is the government reaction in some state that put so many covid related restriction. how are u thinking of locking people is beyond me, it makes people suffer, its harmful.<p>Death from car accident can be reduced by banning car altogether but we did didn&#x27;t ban car because banning is more harmful.')
