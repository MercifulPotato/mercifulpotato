Item(by='Melting_Harps', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606585543, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25238599, text='&gt; and it did not really disrupt a lot of the supply chains or economy...<p>Your argument made sense up to this point, I agree we should have implemented WFH and Online classes years ago in order to lower traffic congestion and reduce our carbon footprint as inter-connectivity increased.<p>What I think you&#x27;re missing is the critical flaw when we saw a massive hit in the Supply Chain, the Value systems within them responded in kind. I&#x27;d argue the Supply Chains remarkably broke down (specifically in food, gym equipment and toiletry). Distribution becomes an impossibility when demand far outweighs production and you have nothing to ship for weeks to months, or you have no one to harvest and it rots in fields.<p>&gt; The most important thing these people do in our economy is spending.<p>Consumer based economies have this baked into the system, and is actually one of my gripes with this Crony-Capitalist system we&#x27;ve been operating under, but it has it&#x27;s limitations: this year&#x27;s black Friday which was a monumental failure by most economists metrics, but was actually a reversion to the mean wherein people have lost significant amounts of expendable income they spend this time of year (which is really debt driven) and overproduction was met with large price reductions that will likely remain. Target, one of the largest online retailers, had a month long &#x27;black Friday&#x27; sale as did New Egg and these are the affects of supply forecasting done several quarters ago, perhaps some even from 2019. Unfortunately politicians make giving them bailouts a priority and the model never really seems to undergo the correction that needs to happen to reduce overall consumption to sustainable levels.<p>For someone who did Supply Chain and Logistics in the Auto Industry and is now returning back into it after a 4 year hiatus, its a Brave New World with immense challenges. Some things still remain, but it&#x27;s definitely not the same animal at all.')
