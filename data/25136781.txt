My definition includes creating massive stockpiles of enriched Uranium, especially for countries with acknowledge weaponization programs and no reasonable other motive.<p>According to your definition, if someone builds an empty bomb, sets it aside, and starts working on creating some explosives that someone &#x27;suspended the bomb program&#x27;. Maybe the explosives are just for fireworks! Right.<p>&gt;Two ignores Iran&#x27;s status in OPEC<p>That only strengthens my point. OPEC gives a maximum export quota which most states are easily capable of exceeding. Might as well use it for internal purposes given the marginal price of extra production is zero.<p>&gt;Disliking the imperialist policies of a state that regularly bombs you makes sense.<p>It&#x27;s usually Iran which inefficiently does the &#x27;regular bombing&#x27;. It&#x27;s Iran that supplied EFPs to insurgents during Iraq war, and whose sellswords fire rockets at the Green Zone regularly. A rocket killed an Iraqi child just yesterday.')
