What changed? Working for a company that is publicly known enough for people on HN (and Reddit) to comment about it. It has been hilarious and scary to read comments from people who don&#x27;t work at the company say completely inaccurate things like they are facts.<p>In this case, it&#x27;s easy for me to recognize they are wrong. But what about other topics (or companies) I don&#x27;t know much about? I have no easy way of recognizing inaccuracies so I default to mostly accepting them. Sadly, you need to be skeptical of almost everything you read even when the person sounds like they know the subject matter.')
