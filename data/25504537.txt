Example is arbing US equities.<p>Crypto is one level more complicated, because you don&#x27;t share inventory across exchanges and transaction costs are high, which means a coin on Exchange1 isn&#x27;t perfectly fungible with a coin on Exchange2.<p>One level more indirect than that might be basis trades, where you trade a derivative ( like SP500 futures) vs it&#x27;s underlying (the SP500 stocks, although in practice it&#x27;s SP500 ETFs).  So here the correlation is very high but there is a difference between futures, stocks, and ETFs fundamentally, and those play into the pricing.<p>Going even further might be trading correlated products that don&#x27;t have the same underlying, example is Nasdaq futures vs SP500 futures.<p>To simplify: It&#x27;s basically about the level of correlation between the products.  The strategies used to trade different correlations look qualitatively different.')
