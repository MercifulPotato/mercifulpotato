It&#x27;s too elementary and cutesy. That is not anything like what I&#x27;ve experienced real mathematics to be like. It is a continuous painful struggle.<p>Sorry, but what?<p>You&#x27;d be hard pressed to find any single person, in the past 10 years, that has ushered more people into STEM by providing a solid fundamental education, than Salman Khan.<p>I understand that you&#x27;re wanting more rigorous math, on a higher-level, but still - to blow off KA, 3B1, etc. as a waste of time sounds more ignorant than anything. Of the millions and millions that have seen these those guys, I&#x27;m sure a certain % have gotten their &quot;Aha!&quot; moments there, which have helped them tackle on much more comprehensive topics &#x2F; fields.<p>edit: Just to clarify, I do not think these vids are any replacement for a solid book, just in the way I do not think lectures or tutorials are a replacement. But they can be fantastic aids for your learning.<p>Interactive websites are IMO vastly more efficient at conveying information, compared to static pages (like books, for example).')
