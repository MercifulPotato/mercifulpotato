Between when I interviewed and when I was started, offices shut down. It&#x27;s been great.<p>The fact that everyone is remote is actually a great &#x27;leveler&#x27;, since the company has a &#x27;main office&#x27; and a few satellite offices in other cities. I&#x27;m not affiliated with the &#x27;main office&#x27;, but I actually am concerned that I&#x27;ll suffer career-wise once the company goes back to in-office, since I&#x27;ll be in a satellite office missing out on casual-but-important lunch&#x2F;coffee&#x2F;hallway conversations.<p>So, from my perspective, it&#x27;s a great time to change jobs. YMMV.')
