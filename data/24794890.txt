It definitely touches on all of the surrounding problems such as managing dependencies, integration tests, and running arbitrary tasks (think DB migrations)<p>You define one part of your system at a time and Garden compiles that into a graph of modules that it knows how to build, test, and deploy. This means you can adopt it piecemeal and use it to run an entire CI pipeline from any given context, e.g. your local machine, VM or actual CI for that matter.<p>Full disclosure, I&#x27;m affiliated with project but your comment describes a problem we see from a lot our users so I couldn&#x27;t help but replying.')
