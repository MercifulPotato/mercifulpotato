Vintage clothing (and even more current but high quality clothing) does well in thrift stores. But most of the clothes people are junking is low quality and doesn&#x27;t actually stand up well enough to being reused OR it&#x27;s got some sort of gimmick or pattern that falls out of fashion too quickly rather than seeming timeless. Some of it might be cool again in 20 or 30 years, but probably not and that&#x27;s longer than the cycle time for people to dispose of clothes besides.<p>But the article isn&#x27;t really about that. The article is about how making stuff new nowadays is so cheap that there is barely any cost savings over making stuff out of recycled material. This is partly because our standards for new stuff have slipped to where good quality fabrics and material are no longer valued. But it&#x27;s also because a lot of the costs of making stuff new are so externalized that nobody&#x27;s paying them. Also, people are so accustomed to the cheap stuff that most people wouldn&#x27;t even know how to differentiate between good quality and bad. They&#x27;ve outsourced that discrimination to brands but the brands have wised up and there isn&#x27;t as much of a relationship between the brand equity&#x2F;prestige of a luxury brand and quality as there used to be.')
