In Mate Desktop. the default terminal is Mate Terminal. Upon installation of Suicide Linux, Mate Terminal could be modified to delete the users home, but provide no warning that it is running. For the user, they could use another terminal program for their daily needs without fear of deleting their home. In the event that their laptop is seized or stolen an attacker may use the default terminal program ie, Mate Terminal which would then upon the issue of any command delete the users home folder<p>If someone can make this I would install it')
