This is just <i>phrenology</i> laundered through their &quot;powerful artificial intelligence engine&quot; black box. Predicting behavior from the shape of someone&#x27;s skull is still bullshit pseudoscience, even if the calipers[1] are replaced with a bunch of linear algebra.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;antiquescientifica.com&#x2F;phrenology_calipers_George_Combe_on_Wells_bust.jpg" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;antiquescientifica.com&#x2F;phrenology_calipers_George_Com...</a>')
