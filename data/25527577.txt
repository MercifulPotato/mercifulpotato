Less and less as time goes on, but happens.<p>In those cases, I might want or need to use the web for some reason before I get a new one (to locate or purchase a new one if nothing else). I definitely have appreciated sites that take keyboard navigation into consideration at those times.<p>The keyboard is a common UI mechanism. Why not try to design the site to increase access via diversity of mechanisms instead of dismissing them due to low use rates?<p>I agree with some of the other posters that something has gone awry with UI testing and design. A lot of it is good, but there&#x27;s these huge holes that pop up all the time. Usually it feels like something that&#x27;s a trend that&#x27;s being applied inappropriately... Other times obvious considerations seem completely ignored.<p>In general I think there&#x27;s problems with UI trying to be too clever and novel, or too &quot;fresh&quot; without focusing critically on functionally. I&#x27;m all for clever, novel, and fresh, as long as it&#x27;s actually driven by function and not using the UI to implicitly assert some kind of status of taste or ability.')
