Adding multithreaded parsing capabilities to CSV.jl was really a joy; basically just chunking up the file and spawning threaded tasks to process each chunk with the existing parsing code.<p>My favorite favorite thing about developing in Julia is the ability to write &quot;high-level&quot; type code and usually get decent performance, BUT THEN have the ability to fine tune for that extra boost of performance. The code inspection tools (see lowered, typed, LLVM, or native IR code levels) and super nice Task-based multithreading really make performance tuning a delight.')
