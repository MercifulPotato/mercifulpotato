Item(by='tchaffee', descendants=None, kids=[25317416], score=None, time=1607193511, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25316203, text='&gt; Is there any evidence for people becoming homeless because of skyrocketing rents?<p>Plenty of it, it is one of the primary causes. But just to put it in concrete terms that should scare anyone, the average rent in San Francisco in 1994 was about $1000. By 2001 the average rent was $2300. [1]<p>Consider that other living costs go up along with rent.<p>&gt; Are there no renter protections in the USA, anyway?<p>Sometimes. But what happens when you lose your job, and then lose your apartment as a result? How are you going to afford the much higher rents now at a new apartment even if you can find a new job? At minimum wage?<p>If you ever decide to work with homeless people (you should) you&#x27;ll hear two types of stories over and over: 1. Diseases such as mental illness and addiction. 2. People who are pretty much just like you and me. And then something unexpected happened. These stories are humbling, because after hearing enough of them you realize that a lot of what&#x27;s keeping a roof over your own head is luck. Add medical bankruptcy to the mix and you&#x27;ve got the USA.<p>&gt; The theory is simple that where the area is rich, there are more jobs - catering to the rich people.<p>So your theory is that rich people hire homeless people off the street to cater to them? NYC has loads of rich people - the most in the world [2]. NYC also has a huge homelessness problem. Maybe that will get solved when and if NYC gets just a few more billionaires?<p>NY state itself has the highest per capita homelessness rate in the USA [3]. Trickle down doesn&#x27;t work.<p>&gt; but also the jobs that make the rich people rich.<p>This is along the lines of saying &quot;stop being poor, just get one of those jobs that the rich people have&quot;.<p>I would encourage you just read up on the subject instead of inventing theories that sound good to you. Homelessness is a well researched topic, and there is no lack of studies and data around it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;johnmacon.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2016&#x2F;03&#x2F;Rents_Avg-SF_by-year.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;johnmacon.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2016&#x2F;03&#x2F;Rents_Avg-S...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;giacomotognini&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;07&#x2F;worlds-richest-cities-the-top-10-cities-where-most-billionaires-call-home-2020&#x2F;?sh=7f17c8ef3101" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;giacomotognini&#x2F;2020&#x2F;04&#x2F;07&#x2F;world...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;psydprograms.org&#x2F;the-places-with-the-most-and-least-homelessness-in-america&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;psydprograms.org&#x2F;the-places-with-the-most-and-least-...</a>')
