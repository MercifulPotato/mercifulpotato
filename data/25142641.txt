The sensors can be perfectly calibrated for CO2, but still read differently because most of the sensors are sensitive to a variety of other carbon-containing gasses.<p>Most consumer CO2 detectors use a sensor which measures the IR absorption of its surroundings. These sensors have varying cross-sensitivities to a bunch of other gasses including carbon monoxide, propane, alcohol, etc. Calibrating them for CO2 will not compensate for different responses to CO, which is much more IR-absorbent in many of the same frequency bands.')
