Highly recommend not using NUC, they get super noisy as soon as you have any load.<p>I would otherwise also use consumer hardware if it wasn’t for IPMI. Particularly if you are running an OS like windows which loves rebooting randomly and which updates often go wrong or take hours, if you don’t have a way to see what is happening while the server isn’t online, you end up walking a lot to the server with a screen. I think the sweet spot is a server MB (and therefore CPU) but everything else consumer.')
