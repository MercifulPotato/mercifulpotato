Ryan&#x27;s claim is correct?<p>The problem is that there&#x27;s an implicit assumption in Rep. Ryan&#x27;s claim that the SURE numbers are complete and represent the actual number of voters who actually voted. If a few counties have not completed uploading their vote histories, then that implicit assumption is invalidated, thereby invalidating the rest of the claim.<p>&gt; And the other explanation is a hypothetical explanation of over or under votes. No proof that this was actually the case here.<p>The burden of proof is on Rep. Ryan to show that the over- and under-voting in 2020 is nefarious&#x2F;fraudulent&#x2F;malicious. Merely saying that over- and under-voting exists is not sufficient to show something is wrong; one also needs to show that such a thing does not happen in &quot;clean&quot; elections. Pennsylvania is merely pointing out the gap in the analysis here.<p>Edit: Added missing word')
