The idea that we would so foolheartedly blaze a trail of atomic poison<p>Frankly your comment here is extraordinarily unhelpful in the grand scheme of things because it begins with preemptive insults and grievances and devolves quickly into breathless fearmongering and insult-laden tirade that is <i>exactly</i> the kind of thing that gets labeled as histrionics.<p>And the fact that you end here:<p>&gt; Nuclear is the dullards flex-tape solution<p>These insults are just not helpful. It&#x27;s exactly the kind of comment that makes these discussions so unruly, tiring, and turn people off.')
