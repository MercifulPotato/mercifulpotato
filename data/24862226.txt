It&#x27;s so ridiculous that this is a problem so often. I was in McDs once when the service guy was there. I overheard him say it would be $9,000 to fix just the shake side of the machine. I thought to myself, &quot;That&#x27;s a lot of milkshakes! There&#x27;s a grocery store in the same parking lot... gallon of ice cream, some milk, and a blender. Problem solved.&quot;')
