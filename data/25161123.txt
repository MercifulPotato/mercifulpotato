Anyway, this analogy is silly. Neither software nor bridges is <i>exactly</i> like the human body and the myriad of complex interactions that happen within.<p>At the end of the day, all I&#x27;m saying is that A. under normal circumstances, it takes a lot of time to get a vaccine tested and approved - for good reason. And B. these are not ordinary circumstances, there may be reason to think the process was rushed, and it <i>may</i> be prudent to not rush to be among the first to take the vaccine.<p>And just in case anybody misunderstands what I&#x27;m saying, let me reiterate as clearly as I can:<p>This is NOT an anti-vax screed, or an appeal to any conspiracy theories, or anything of that nature. And I am <i></i><i>NOT</i><i></i> suggesting anyone refuse to get vaccinated in the long-term. I am only suggesting a certain measure of patience, which is probably going to be part of the process anyway due to the logistics of distributing the vaccine.')
