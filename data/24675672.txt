It bothers me when designers make every icon the same color, because I distinguish colors much faster than shapes. (Much easier still than using an app that would tell me which shape it is, of course.)<p>I think the visual design should embrace <i>both</i> shapes and colors, and use color palettes that are discernible for people with different senses of color.<p>The objection is usually that the design must look &quot;neat&quot;. I&#x27;d say that a visually neat but unusable design wastes all the effort that went to making it neat anyway. Being bold and even flamboyant in order to be highly visually discernible pays off most of the time; look at flowers.')
