And with some balant mistranslations<p>The ABC link shows a random video uploaded and verified as &#x27;authentic&#x27; by someone who sits at his home watching Google maps. If that&#x27;s the level of evidence required for Holocaust then it&#x27;s a lost cause to reason with you.<p>also to add, there are 12 million uighur in china, if the claim of genocide on 3 million of uighur is true, that means 1 in 4 uighur are slaughtered. Xinjiang to this day is open for visits for foreigners, there are zero reports of refugees in neighboring countries. If the there is indeed a holocaust going on, then these evidence should be easy to find right? and you probably wouldn&#x27;t need to rely on &quot;leaks&quot; and videos verified by a 22 year old &quot;goolge map&quot; expert.')
