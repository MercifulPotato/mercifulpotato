In fact, the AWS custom-built Graviton2 Processor, which uses a 64-bit ARM architecture, edged out GCP and Azureâ€™s winning machines, both of which ran AMD processors.<p>Google&#x2F;GCP plays catch-up, and while GCP has been coming to the level of AWS on services, the AWS already gets new CPU platform, and Google doesn&#x27;t have ARM thus leaving GCP several years behind - this will become pretty clear in the coming years. With ARM beating x86 on performance and power AWS can undercut - typical AMZN&#x2F;Bezos - the GCP on price or use the extra margin to expand and finance even more R&amp;D of AWS. I also think that  Apple with M1 will become a huge cloud player, at least for various mobile apps, etc. ie. encroaching into GCP market, while not necessarily into enterprise market of AWS nor Azure. That way the GCP will be squeezed from all sides.<p>&gt;Its revenue is growing fast, currently over $12 billion&#x2F;year.<p>The tough question here for GCP is whether that revenue is supporting the  R&amp;D to match the R&amp;D of AWS and Azure (and probably Apple in the coming years), especially the investment required to get their own ARM. If i remember correctly Google gave GCP till 2023 to become a leader comparable to AWS or something like this. I think they wouldn&#x27;t reach the goal, and as result Google will start counting money when it comes to GCP and will just drop GCP from the top priorities, and the GCP will just linger lagging behind more and more.')
