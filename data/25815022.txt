In fact, the AWS custom-built Graviton2 Processor, which uses a 64-bit ARM architecture, edged out GCP and Azureâ€™s winning machines, both of which ran AMD processors.<p>Google&#x2F;GCP plays catch-up, while GCP has been coming to the level of AWS on services, the AWS already gets new CPU platform and Google doesn&#x27;t have ARM thus leaving GCP several years behind - this will become pretty clear in the coming years. With ARM beating x86 on performance and power AWS can undercut - typical AMZN&#x2F;Bezos - the GCP on price or use the extra margin to finance even more R&amp;D of AWS. I also think that  Apple with M1 will become a huge cloud player, at least for various mobile apps, etc. ie. encroaching into GCP market, while not necessarily into enterprise market of AWS nor Azure. That way the GCP will be squeezed from all sides.')
