Ask your question.<p>Put these two together and you get something like, “good morning! Do you know how many froops the borgle puts out?”<p>If a question you’ve asked is no longer relevant&#x2F;you’ve found the answer elsewhere, a simple “disregard” closes the loop.<p>“Disregard - Jeff said it’s 12”<p>People won’t always reply. There are things going on behind the scenes that you don’t and can’t know about.<p>Keep it brief. Unless there’s an actual reason to write a paragraph, don’t.<p>If you’re given information without a question, a simple acknowledgment suffices. “Roger,” “copy,” or a thumbs up.<p>Chat is a walkie-talkie, not a coffee date!')
