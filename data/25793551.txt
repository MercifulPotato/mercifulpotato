No one likes to be shaken awake and bombarded with a new dream — especially when they haven’t yet made sense of the last one.<p>This really hits it for me. It&#x27;s not even the credits that I need, per se, as long as the movie <i>stop playing</i> when it&#x27;s done, whether with a credits sequence or a simple fade to black.<p>I waited for Stranger Things to come out on BluRay (currently waiting for the third season), and I&#x27;m 100% convinced I had a better experience than someone watching on Netflix, because the episodes actually ended after the credits. For a show few people will get to see this way, the writers really knew how to conclude each episode in just the right spot, so you had a nice place to take a breather and contemplate.')
