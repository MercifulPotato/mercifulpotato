If you just looked at EV numbers a lot of other car makers would be growing as well. It&#x27;s a new market. In fact Tesla grew <i>less</i> than the overall EV market as I&#x27;ll show below.<p>About 90k new EVs got registered in Germany in 2020 so far, meaning Tesla is only about 1&#x2F;9th of the market.<p>Furthermore, in the same period in 2019 about 45k new EVs got registered. Which means the EV market overall grew by +100% in that period, while Tesla only grew +24.5%. They actually lost market share if you just look at EV numbers.<p>Numbers are a bit rough because I had to add the months up myself: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ecomento.de&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;03&#x2F;elektroauto-hybridauto-zulassungen-august-2020&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ecomento.de&#x2F;2020&#x2F;09&#x2F;03&#x2F;elektroauto-hybridauto-zulass...</a><p>Now looking at it this way isn&#x27;t completely fair either, because while the EV market is new and growth thus is no surprise, it&#x27;s also true that EVs are still competing with regular cars.<p>So if you asked me which of these statistics is a lie, the answer would unequivocally be &quot;yes.&quot; :)')
