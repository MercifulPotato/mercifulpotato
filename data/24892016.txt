This left equipment inside, including a radiotherapy machine.<p>People broke in to steal stuff that look expensive, and decided the radiation source (they didn&#x27;t know what it was or contained) looked like it would be a worth a lot, and was portable enough to be stolen. So they did.<p>They tried to disassemble it, in doing so managed to get to the raw radioactive pellets. From there people played with it, and it spread around, before they eventually took it to a junk yard.<p>A number of people got sick, at least one died (OTOH).')
