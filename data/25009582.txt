You can rewrite the really bad sections and you can also restructure the code so it’s possible to rewrite components in other languages&#x2F;stacks later.<p>But it’s hard to communicate this to other devs and also up the management chain. Devs don’t like it because it’s not “cool” and also requires understanding of the current system  and management doesn’t like it because it adds overhead to development so new features get rolled out a little slower.')
