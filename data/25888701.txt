I find it incredible how so far all responces to your post are in-denial.<p>Being productive while remote is hard work and requires a high level of self-awareness and self-control. We cannot &quot;will it into existence&quot; by denying the negative experiences of employers.<p>Time theft is a real concept businesses care about. Business think they are buying time, with an eye to capture the results. If any one reads this gets confused or angry about this: go contractor. If you want to be selling results not your time then you best move into a working relationship where you sell results. Salary is a time-selling relationship.<p>As a remote contractor, with my own remote employee, I can say I expect the time logged to be productive time. I don&#x27;t care if my employee stops work mid day to paint his house: but he better log that time. Flexibility is a responsibility, if people continue to abuse work from home you can bet companies across the world are going to return to office at the fastest opportunity.')
