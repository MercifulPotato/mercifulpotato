When I went about this whole process, I thought I was doing it the right way by setting up business entities with the name, getting a trademark and the various legal sides of things all on BrandVantage because I really thought the &quot;digital brand expert&quot; is what I was going to launch with. My pivot for structured data from websites definitely makes the name not lineup well with what I&#x27;m offering now.<p>The idea was that the data one could gather from sites (and eventually news articles, products and companies) would be able to help businesses with their brands (competitor analysis et al). The whole &quot;data driven brands stand out&quot;, that was trying to signal to a certain type of business (ones that use analytics or other data sources to guide their business decisions) that this could be a useful tool for them.<p>I&#x27;m probably too emotionally and financially invested in the name to change it but yeah, I&#x27;ll likely refactor the content to push the structured data angle harder (maybe bring a copy of the use cases information to the homepage) and just deal with the name not lining up to the product.')
