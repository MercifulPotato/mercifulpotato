Every platform has some content that they struggle to moderate due to scale issues. The issue with Parler is that they purposefully attracted the absolute dregs of society, and now there isn&#x27;t much else on it other than plans and threats of violence. They&#x27;re a half step above Gab, barely.<p>Edit: I&#x27;ll note that Parler banned the DevinNunesCow parody account. They are fully capable of moderating when they want to, they just don&#x27;t want to moderate calls for violence.')
