Dijkstra was and still is right.<p>The newfangled ways of teaching how to code managed to produce a generation of really poor-quality software &quot;engineers&quot; producing atrocious slow and buggy bloatware.<p>You cannot be a good engineer if you reason with analogies and metaphors instead of understanding how things actually work, at multiple levels, and knowing what and when can be abstracted and which lower-level details are important and should not be ignored.<p>So... if you want to become a decent software engineer, start with learning digital electronics and assembly.  This way you won&#x27;t need &quot;metaphors&quot; for arrays and such - because you will know that a static array is just multiplication by constant followed by addition to a constant and dereferencing of the resulting address.')
