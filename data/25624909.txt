They&#x27;re dead-simple and not subject to cosine error and sensitive closed-source calibration techniques though. Even accounting for clock skew and clock drift, if an average speed camera says you were going x+2ϵ mph then it&#x27;s safe to say you were going at least x+ϵ mph for at least some small interval and some very small value of ϵ.')
