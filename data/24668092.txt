Looks like the answer is no. [1]</i><p>Are you sure?  From that link:  <i>&quot;PVA is prepared by hydrolysis of polyvinyl acetate&quot;</i><p>Follow that and you&#x27;ll find: <i>&quot;Polyvinyl acetate is prepared by the polymerization of vinyl acetate monomer (free radical vinyl polymerization of the monomer vinyl acetate).&quot;</i><p>Which leads to <i>&quot;The major industrial route involves the reaction of ethylene and acetic acid with oxygen in the presence of a palladium catalyst.[6]&quot;</i><p>And finally: <i>&quot;Ethylene is produced by several methods in the petrochemical industry. A primary method is steam cracking (SC) where hydrocarbons and steam are heated to 750–950 °C.&quot;</i><p>PVA seems to be made from fossil fuels (oil, coal, or natural gas) when manufactured at industrial scale, though Wikipedia does a good job of obscuring this.  The Wikipedia page mentions that North Korea produces it because it doesn&#x27;t require oil but they make it with <i>coal</i> instead, which isn&#x27;t mentioned on that page.  The section on environmental considerations mentions only that it&#x27;s nontoxic and biodegrades, nothing about where it comes from.  (Do the fossil fuel &#x2F; chemical industries have a history of misleading the public?  Hmm..)')
