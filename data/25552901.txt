You <i>can</i> improve things with education, but only up to a point. Most people just don’t want to think about any of these things, so until it gets <i>really</i> bad (most commonly of the “leopards ate my face” variety, when something you’ve tacitly endorsed suddenly starts to harm <i>you</i>), they’ll normally just go along with whatever happens. This is the whole reason for government, to maintain rough balance so that no one gets <i>too</i> upset. It’s extremely imperfect, as you correctly imply, but that’s the general idea of it, and it normally works well enough (better than nothing, at least), and no one has presented any better alternative.')
