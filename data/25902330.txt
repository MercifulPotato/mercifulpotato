Item(by='zenorogue', descendants=None, kids=[25903175], score=None, time=1611577339, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25899824, text='Usually &quot;non-Euclidean&quot; is used for Riemannian manifolds, so if something is not a Riemannian manifold, it is not called Euclidean or non-Euclidean.<p>Just like &quot;irrational number&quot;, which is not any number that is not rational -- we still assume that it is a real number, so i or Aleph-Null are not considered irrational.<p>If we include teleport points in our metric, we no longer have a manifold (if teleports are one-way, not even a metric space). Similarly for Mountain Valley, or affine&#x2F;projective manifolds that can be found in some games, it is wrong to call them Euclidean or non-Euclidean.<p>Anyway, originally &quot;non-Euclidean&quot; was just the hyperbolic plane (the only geometric structure which satisfies all the Euclid&#x27;s axioms except the fifth), and then (depending on whom you ask) it was extended to also mean other situations which are different but similar in nature -- so spherical geometry (which is just the opposite), Nil&#x2F;Solv geometry (which also play with parallel lines), but not cylinders, affine manifolds, teleports, taxicab metric, and so on (they don&#x27;t really do anything interesting to parallel lines).')
