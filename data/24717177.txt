Unless something is in the public domain, don&#x27;t use it unless you have permission.<p>&gt;  The entire software industry is built on the idea that APIs are not copyrightable.<p>The entire open source movement was built on copyright (ala FSF and the GPL). So this doesn&#x27;t even make sense. It&#x27;s not anarchy as you imply and copyright has a purpose.<p>Also, copyright is far more limited than patents. Patents are dangerous because it&#x27;s like claiming ownership over a mathematical formula that anyone can derive. It&#x27;s completely different.')
