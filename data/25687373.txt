[emphasis added]<p>For a bad pot roast, maybe. I&#x27;ve never cooked a pot roast so hot that it would reach that internal temperature, and I&#x27;ve never known anyone else to either.<p>EDIT: Looking up recipes now, apparently some recipes do call for taking pot roast to <i>much</i> higher temps than I cook it to. Maybe that&#x27;s why fast food roasts are so bad, but also why I don&#x27;t eat them.')
