I don’t expect to make money here. It’ll be fun to watch for a few days, maybe weeks.<p>We just felt a lot of solidarity with the sentiment over there, and are happy to make a small contribution to the squeeze.<p>It feels kind of like contributing to a Kickstarter with low chance of success.<p>But you know, there’s a nonzero chance it goes to $1000 before the shorts can wiggle out. That’s what makes it exciting.<p>In general, since watching what they did to Tesla I have no sympathy for shorts.')
