I usually can’t comfortably work in multiple windows side by side without zooming out or doing a ton of vertical scrolling, and when I’m multitasking in Chrome, the tabs get tiny very quickly.<p>This doesn&#x27;t really add up. When working with windows side by side, horizontal space is beneficial. And the tabs in the browser will also have more space on a wider aspect ratio. You can&#x27;t have it both ways - on a wider screen, you&#x27;ll have more space to put windows side by side and have a lot of tabs, on a tall screen you need to do less vertical scrolling within a window.')
