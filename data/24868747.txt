I went to the page and was thoroughly confused -- does this library:<p>- Read application code (written in python?) and extract an API specification? Is it flask only?<p>- Does it update the file on disk repeatedly?<p>- Does it modify generated application code to add an endpoint for the Swagger UI and host it?<p>- Are any modifications to the pre-existing applications necessary?<p>- Does it wrap an existing application?<p>Good tools also often have a comparison section -- are there other tools in your space that do what you do, but differently?<p>I&#x27;d like to think I&#x27;m familiar with the Swagger&#x2F;Swagger2&#x2F;OpenAPI3 space, and I&#x27;m aware of tools that go spec-&gt;code (usually generating clients&#x2F;servers) and code-&gt;spec (whether by comments, annotations, or some other language mechanism), but it&#x27;s not clear what your tool actually does.')
