I also don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen this &quot;feature&quot; of C used productively in modern codebases, except maybe to declare generic function pointers in something like dlfunc. In general it&#x27;s just that people are too lazy to type `void func(void)` (or don&#x27;t know the difference).<p>You can also tell that the C++ standard committee agrees with this to some extent since they tend to add C novelties into the C++ standards whenever possible to make it easier to write compatible code, for instance: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;C%2B%2B11#Improved_C_compatibility" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;C%2B%2B11#Improved_C_compatibi...</a>')
