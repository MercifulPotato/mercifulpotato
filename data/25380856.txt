Your quote explains it perfectly though.  They flat out can&#x27;t because the accounting and reporting is badly designed and incapable of providing (near) real-time data.<p>IMHO the easiest solution to this is government regulation.  If you set a budget for a pay-what-you-use online service there should be legislation forbidding companies from charging you more than that.<p>I also find it (sort of) hilarious they can magically lock the whole thing down once payment fails, but not before the CC is (presumably) maxed out.  Lol.  Talk about a good deal for Google.')
