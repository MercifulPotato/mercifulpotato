Having a superior architecture (which they don&#x27;t anymore) can only compensate for so much regarding node size. Intel isn&#x27;t going to pull that one around. Having your fab in-house only makes sense if you&#x27;re state of the art. At some point, not admitting defeat and just keep increasing TDP is false pride.')
