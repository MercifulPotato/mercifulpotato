If you are a very big customer, then any discount given to you will directly affect the cloud business bottomline.<p>A public cloud inherently&#x2F;structurally has more costs because it is built to be truly multi-tenant and has lots of elastic capacity.<p>A single tenant private cloud can cut out a lot of bells and whistles and can be tailored to the needs of the company&#x27;s private use-case – this brings down the cost significantly.<p>If your compute&#x2F;storage bill is greater than $10 million per year, then it is highly likely that for the same money you will get much higher compute&#x2F;storage capacity in a private cloud. And that gives you more headroom for growth&#x2F;elasticity etc.<p>If your bill is greater than $30 million per year, then you will likely save significantly as well as get other strategic advantages – especially if your infra scale continues to grow over next 2-5 years.')
