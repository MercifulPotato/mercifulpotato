The same way you would establish trustworthiness of any entity you don&#x27;t know more generally.<p>This is just a more general case of having a trusted broker. How do you trust your bank? How do you trust airlines to be safe? How do you know your doctor is competent? You don&#x27;t demand first hand evidence for all of these.
