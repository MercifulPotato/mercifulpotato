I&#x27;m sorry you don&#x27;t like the tone, but I viewed this as a fair guide for programmers managing corporate settings running into those barriers. T\n&gt; his article appears to do a fine job explaining HR&#x27;s role to people coming from e.g. CS undergrad degrees which will prevent them from getting hurt. It&#x27;s no better or worse than a guide for e.g. American women as to what to expect if they marry someone from Saudi culture.<p>I agree that cross cultural training is important, and indeed what is needed here. But I don&#x27;t think this article is framed properly to be seen as cross cultural training. Instead this article portrays one culture only as seen from the other. It lacks the opposite view, failing to consider how the management culture might perceive the coders. The article neither suggests that the actions by management might be a reasonable response from their culture, nor does it suggest ways to better interact.<p>&gt; If you don&#x27;t show a certain modesty and humility in gift-receiving in China, you&#x27;ll be an outcast. If you don&#x27;t show a certain opulence and over-the-top gratitude in some parts of the Middle East and show the same, you&#x27;ll be an outcast just as much.<p>In the context of this analogy, this article would be much like a Chinese rant on &quot;how all Middle Easteners are Jerks for displaying their opulence, and therefore cannot be trusted&quot;. That is not an article that helps in cross-cultural training.')
