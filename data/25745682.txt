Nowadays displaying text requires font selection, text shaping (incl. kerning), glyph selection, text layouting (incl. line wrapping), glyph pre-rendering, and a final assembly step to get the composite image of all glyphs.<p>Want to skip font selection? No emojis for you.<p>Want to skip glyph selection? No ligatures or Arabic or Devanagari text for you.<p>Want to skip text layouting? No Right-to-Left support for you.<p>There is a whole crapton of legitimate complexity in the font rendering stack because we don&#x27;t want to have the constraints of the 70s anymore (only 256 glyphs, fixed font size, monospace font only).<p>(Sidenote: For those of you who think &quot;I&#x27;m fine with monospace fonts in my terminal&quot;, I am using a monospace font as well. But &quot;monospace font&quot; only means that all <i>ASCII glyphs</i> are equal-sized, which is a tiny minority of all glyphs a Unicode font supports. I have grown a very strong opinion regarding this topic since I started to learn Japanese and hence want to be able to deal with CJK characters.)')
