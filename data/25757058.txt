But I don&#x27;t think it is actually going to work as a traditional government and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to work as a set of de facto tech organizations that the governments fight with.<p>What I think can possibly work is one of Buterin&#x27;s suggestions: decentralized protocols.<p>I actually believe that a path for global security, sustainability, and sanity is a &quot;world government&quot; that we evolve through shared decentralized protocols.  And that governance including information distribution regulation, to be effective, will need to be tied into money in the form of sophisticated cryptocurrency.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this is easy. Traditionally government has been incredibly bad.  But leaving things to private technopolies is just not a solution that can work out for the public good.  And it definitely isn&#x27;t going to integrate with any sort of democratic or other governmental model.<p>I think the starting point needs to be something like package registries.  So the government is just providing a metaframework for sharing protocols and certain guidelines or constraints.\nOtherwisee it is too hard to evolve and people get stuck with old ineffective protocols.')
