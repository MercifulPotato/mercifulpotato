Visual Studio Code is about changing\nindividual bytes in tiny plain text files. I don&#x27;t think it has\na single feature that didn&#x27;t exist before. Yet its startup time\nis somehow closer to that of a full-fledged IDE, almost as long\nas the whole operating system needs to boot. Same with websites;\na freshly configured email client can download a thousand\nmessages from the server in a shorter period than it takes to\nload most news articles in the browser.<p>And the most baffling thing to me is that such things are so\nwidely accepted. I&#x27;ve seen many users shrugging it off with a\n&quot;that&#x27;s just how computers are&quot; mindset; many things are\nimplemented so badly people don&#x27;t even expect them to work\nproperly.<p>This may sound a lot like &quot;old man yells at cloud&quot; material, but\nin the end it can&#x27;t be denied performance is often at least an\norder of magnitude away from where it could be - my current\nlaptop has 32 times as much RAM as my first PC, and it still\nswaps just as frequently.')
