Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605732560, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25140946, text='&gt; Frankly, this way of talking seems to have its origin in the 2008 financial crisis more than in any actual technical economic language<p>The exact phrasing of &quot;privatize the profits and socialize the losses&quot; seems to have become popular in 2008, if not actually originating there, but the concept of the problem is much older; its essentially a new phrasing of what has both before (and even since) popularly been phrased as &quot;Socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor&quot; [0].<p>But &quot;socialization&quot; for distributing a cost&#x2F;benefit outside of the participants in a transaction, and &quot;privatization&quot; for concentrating it there is a common term that is disconnected from &quot;socialism&quot; except that their shared &quot;shape&quot; is not mere coincidence, but because they have related-though-not-derived-from-each-other meanings.<p>&gt; And it speaks more to American&#x27;s mis-education about what socialism is (or its history) than anything else.<p>That&#x27;s true of the older form (though less so the newer, though it derives some rhetorical utility from the similarity in words), though not in the obvious way. At least the earlier form was coined and is still popularly used by people who know very well what socialism is; it deliberately and directly leverages the way (not just the fact, but the specific arguments used) that the people who support what it criticizes have poisoned the well \nagainst socialism and misleading used to promote capitalism, turning it against the system.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Socialism_for_the_rich_and_capitalism_for_the_poor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Socialism_for_the_rich_and_cap...</a>')
