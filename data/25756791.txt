You would also have needed an arrival quarantine and post-arrival testing.<p>Some of this is now present in parts of the US, such as New York state: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coronavirus.health.ny.gov&#x2F;covid-19-travel-advisory" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;coronavirus.health.ny.gov&#x2F;covid-19-travel-advisory</a><p>But indeed this wasn&#x27;t in place at the start of the pandemic, and New York&#x27;s ability to enforce it is quite weak.<p>Do we know if the new US federal order will allow the unreliable rapid tests to meet the requirement? Canada&#x27;s similar requirement, added last Thursday, insists on either a PCR test or an RT-LAMP test. Edit: the wording in the CDC&#x27;s FAQ requires a &quot;viral test (NAAT or antigen)&quot;.
