Guitar has 6 positions, different spreads to voice correctly, different shapes for the same chords, and with little in regards to visual cues. C and Eb major look pretty different across a fret board, and if you want to shred, there is going to be a lot of scales in your practicing.<p>Nothing is stopping you from becoming a virtuoso on something like an Ableton Push, but there just isn&#x27;t any short cut around the practice and that&#x27;s honestly the main slog. 2 hand independence, internal sense of rhythm, syncopation, groove and understanding the relationships and functions of chords&#x2F;harmony take tons of dedicated practice. Ear training to recognize intervals and chord voicings&#x2F;relationships is a pain as well. To get where this is second nature just requires a lot of time. Issues with the keyboard&#x27;s ergonomics are small in comparison.<p>You will need to practice and learn some goofy names, but pretty much it&#x27;s just a way to describe relative notes, groupings and relationships. Knowing your major and relative minors scales you can learn the other modes relatively easily; Mixolydian is a major scale with dominant 7th, Dorian is a minor scale with a major 6th. Same thinking with chords. Most of this knowledge starts building on top of each other, and gradually you stop consciously thinking about these things while playing.<p>Jazz musicians are absolute nerds when it comes to this. Theory is descriptive not prescriptive; it&#x27;s how musicians can discuss what&#x27;s happening in a piece.')
