Item(by='old-gregg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611088384, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25838391, text='&gt; Is it not at least somewhat possible that at least some of those Apple laptops will age out and be replaced with GNU&#x2F;Linux laptops?<p>And I personally hope that by then, GNU&#x2F;Linux will have an M1-like processor available to happily run on. The possibilities demonstrated by this chip (performance+silence+battery) are so compelling that it&#x27;s inevitable we&#x27;ll see them in non-Apple designs.<p>Also, as it usually happens with Apple hardware advancements, Linux experience will be gradually getting better on M1 Macbooks as well.')
