And since the central government has been outsourcing more and more responsibilities to local government, these local taxes have increased massively to pay for things that were hereto paid out of the national tax budget.<p><i>So if a house price goes up by 100% but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s twice as valuable</i><p>Not likely. Many studies have shown that in scarcity, house prices don&#x27;t follow the value of the property, but the budget of the buyers. The increase in housing prices is more due to the ease of access to mortgages (low interest rates, tax bonuses, etc) than due to value increases of the property.')
