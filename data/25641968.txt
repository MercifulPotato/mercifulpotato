Item(by='est31', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609819663, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25641798, text='WhatsApp lets you upload your chat history to either icloud or google&#x27;s cloud offerings. Those backups are accessible to Apple&#x2F;Google. Many people have enabled it, so if you are in any decently sized group chat you can basically assume it&#x27;s available to Apple&#x2F;Google, the people who hack them, and whomever they have data sharing contracts with.<p>Personally I use Telegram because they don&#x27;t mind non-official clients like the FOSS builds. Whatsapp on the other hand is known to ban non-official clients. API access isn&#x27;t available either unless you are a big corporate user, at which point you need a facebook ads account and cooperate with some API reseller... no joke lol.')
