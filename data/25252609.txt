Now round 2 of lockdown I figured something needed to be done, So I have invested in a walkingpad (treadmill for walking speed - it folds up and tugs under the bed when I am not using it.) I have been walking for 2 hours WHILE WORKING FROM HOME now and its perfect ! - loosing around 1 kg&#x2F;week while eating pretty normal (though I am trying to only have 1 big meal a day and just snack the rest of the time). The walking is not hard and I can walk 10km&#x2F;day without really thinking about it, because time flies by while working. When work time is over I have all my time free and don&#x27;t need to spend time on excersise. I would highly recommend this. Walking is a low effort thing that burn more calories than you would think. Its also good on general well being to not sit down all the time.')
