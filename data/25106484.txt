My house had a bathroom and the kitchen upgraded by the previous owner and we did the basement but most of the house remains on knob-and-tube.<p>I&#x27;ve gradually added GFCI outlets to each circuit.  They&#x27;re not grounded, unfortunately, but they do trip if something were to go wrong.  And it allows us to plug in 3-prong plugs without using those horrible 2-to-3 adapters.<p>We had to change home insurance companies because Amica blacklisted us the instant they heard there was knob-and-tube wiring.  A few other companies have the same approach.  But it&#x27;s not like homes are spontaneously combusting everywhere because of it.')
