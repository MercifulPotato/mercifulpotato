Now you need a whole different suite of tools from the usual tools you use. Your library that parses all the meta tags, identifies the content, <i>&amp;c.</i> is now useless. Now you need either a full JavaScript execution environment, or a <i>JSON</i> parser instead of an HTML parser (and that JSON has completely lost the semantics that HTML provides, so you can’t query things like “document title” or “meta description”).<p>You have JavaScript disabled? Here, have a mess that, well, it’s better than most client-side rendering things in that the content is still probably <i>there</i>, rather than the screen just being blank, but there are reasons why you should <i>always</i> prefer server-side rendering for things like blogs.<p>You have a slow or unreliable internet connection? Now the page is taking longer to load, and until the JavaScript loads, the page is empty—and it may fail to load.<p>I object to people doing things like this as more than a fun technical demonstration because it does harm some users.')
