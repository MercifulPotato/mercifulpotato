I really don&#x27;t include spy agencies in my threat models because I feel like it&#x27;s a battle already lost before I even begin. If they put a gun at my head, I&#x27;ll tell them my password anyway. Nothing in my hard drive --- or my head --- is worth my life.<p>As long as my devices can fend off the generic attacks, like script kiddies, port scanners, DNS hijacking at public wifi, I&#x27;m content.<p>That said, my defeatist attitude is at least partly because I&#x27;m a nobody. For high-value targets, they must have their own method of protection that doesn&#x27;t rely simply on a promise to be neutral.')
