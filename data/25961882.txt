Breaking previous contracts would be unreasonable.<p>There are so many things the EU could do here that could help:\n- Provide more resource to AZ to get more facilities up and running.\n- Offer to sell some of that future ramped up production back to countries like the UK in exchange for getting some vaccines now.\n- Expedite the approval process of other vaccines.\n- Allow member states to negotiate indepently.<p>What did they choose to do? Raid the EU vaccine production facilties, and threaten legal action against the very company trying to supply them the vaccine. Like yeah, that&#x27;s really going to help people.<p>The UK government directly paid for the research and development of the AZ vaccine, and paid for the manufacturing facilities in the UK to be built, when there was a lot of pressure to simply partner with US firms. Where was the EU when this was happening? Why didn&#x27;t the EU take it upon themselves to do the same thing?<p>The presumptiveness of the EU to dictate that AZ should redirect UK vaccines to the EU is astounding.')
