From the videos in Nagorno-Karabakh it is evident that unarmoured vehicles and dismounted infantry are faring no better, even those dug into positions with camouflage screens. Indeed, the lack of protection means they will likely fare worse since there are more kinds of munitions that are lighter and easier to employ that can kill them.&quot;<p>It is possible, that the inability to hide, and thus the increased ability to quickly inflict losses with concentrated fire, means that the balance has shifted decisively to the offense.  Whoever attacks first, is able to disable enough of the enemy firepower to win.<p>A situation in which the balance of power shifts to the defense, is not great; as WW1 showed, it can favor war of attrition.  But a shift to offense, favors attacking first, and that seems even worse.')
