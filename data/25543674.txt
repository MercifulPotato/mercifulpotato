The story says it was an explosion, not a bombing, but that the police are suspecting it was intentionally caused.<p>When &quot;media&quot; (yes HN you are media too) starts to drift the narrative, people latch onto it and they stop looking for evidence-based facts, and instead start looking for anything that supports their preferred narrative. You&#x27;d think 4 years of Trump and decades of Fox News would&#x27;ve been a lesson.')
