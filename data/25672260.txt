Brief review:<p>I love it. Particularly excellent for photo editing (it&#x27;s so huge I have to zoom out sometimes) and programming. There is a slight visual oddity on the very outside 1&#x2F;2px caused by the viewing angle of the pixels out there, which I think they&#x27;d only solve by curving it - personally I only even noticed it because a reviewer mentioned it. I also wish all the HDMI ports were 60Hz (2 are, 2 are 30Hz) but that&#x27;s just a nitpick.<p>I play games on it too and it&#x27;s generally very enjoyable. It has un-advertised FreeSync support, interestingly, which I find works well with my AMD card under Linux, but it does have a very limited range of like 60-70 I think. There&#x27;s a different setting on my Linux drivers whose name I can&#x27;t remember that basically means as long as you&#x27;re over 60FPS you&#x27;ll never see any screen tearing, which I can attest works for me with it.<p>The stand is very solid, and the speakers are decent too. I love that it comes with a remote for operating it. It&#x27;s so much better than using the nubbin under the display.<p>The input splitting modes are really quite good, surprisingly. Being able to display 4 inputs in a 2x2 grid is awesome, although I use a tiling window manager so I don&#x27;t really use it much. If you were feeling particularly adventurous you could attach 4 inputs from a single machine and it&#x27;ll recognise it as 4 separate displays :D')
