For whatever reason its like I go into immediate clinical triage mode.<p>My two year old son ended up breaking his leg stepping off a short stool a couple years ago.  My wife thought nothing of his crying but after ten minutes or so she called me while I was upstairs working.  I immediately came down and sensed unordinary danger, triaged his leg and concluded it was a broken bone in about 20 seconds, and was off to the ER a minute later (he&#x27;s fine!).  But there is something that just kicks in and says &quot;SOLVE THIS NOW&quot;.')
