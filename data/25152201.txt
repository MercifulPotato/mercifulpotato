The issue comes down to if you spend even a modest amount of time&#x2F;money on development of something to jump into a vast sea of competition, where someone searching for the name of your app specifically cannot find you and to add insult to injury takes 30% if your gross before you&#x27;re even able to recoup costs and there&#x27;s no way to work around their distribution or payment models.<p>Take Netflix for example, which doesn&#x27;t run on Apple&#x27;s distribution network... Should Apple have to pay for part of the deployment of all the assets and feeds?  They don&#x27;t... the margins are already thin and Apple frankly doesn&#x27;t deserve 30% of that recurring revenue.')
