The only information is that other people don&#x27;t feel safe given your distance and lack of mask.<p>It&#x27;s analogous to you feeling like you&#x27;re a safe driver but having passengers asking you to slow down. If you&#x27;re not judging the danger to others commensurately to them, it seems like the onus should be on you to adjust your behavior.<p>Also, as others pointed out, this study&#x27;s idea of &quot;crowded spaces&quot; might not align with your idea of it. If someone with COVID-19 passed me on an average-sized trail path or sidewalk breathing heavily while running, I wouldn&#x27;t feel safe and I doubt many other reasonable people would either. It&#x27;s not an issue of outside air vs. inside air as it is whether you end up breathing the same air as others, and you might not be a great judge of when that is or how it applies to this study.<p>Also, if you&#x27;re interested in backing up your actions with studies, you should note that &quot;social distancing&quot; meaning 6ft distance which I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re referring to has been debunked by MIT and Oxford studies.<p>Figuring out exactly what&#x27;s safe and not is not clear cut, which is why simple rules like &quot;wear a mask outside&quot; is so important, because we clearly can&#x27;t all be trusted to make good judgment calls.')
