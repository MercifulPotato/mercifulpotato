Are you serious?<p>I don&#x27;t have links or videos saved with me right now, but I am an Egyptian and followed all of what happened. I can get it if I wanted, but it will take time. But I think you can easily find it. Listen to professor Chomsky&#x27;s lectures for example.<p>As far as I remember, this one (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zLPYN82xHck" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=zLPYN82xHck</a>) contains most of his opinions about it. But I would have to watch it again to be sure.<p>Even &quot;Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&quot; was joking about how Obama didn&#x27;t admit the coup to keep giving them aid, but I also don&#x27;t have the link of the episode here.<p>So I think it is obvious if you wanted to see it. But pick your opinion as you wish. It is a free world, right?')
