Some manufacturers (e.g. Amazon&#x2F;Ring) are a little too eager to essentially hand all of their data over to the police in real-time with almost no strings attached.<p>Devices that don&#x27;t already upload everything to the cloud (e.g. Apple and Google&#x27;s pinky-promise that smart assistant audio is processed locally) automatically receive and apply software and firmware updates from the manufacturer &#x2F; carrier that can arbitrarily change device behavior. The government can and probably does compel these companies to write and push custom firmware to targeted devices.<p>&quot;We encrypt your data so hard that we couldn&#x27;t access it even if we wanted to&quot; is almost always a lie, is never verifiable, and is ultimately subject to the same automatic firmware&#x2F;software update problem.<p>It will never be possible to secure systems like these from government snooping, and people largely don&#x27;t seem to care.')
