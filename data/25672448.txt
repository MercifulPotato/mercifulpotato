(Nor could there be, on the original Bike that I have, as the resistance control is manual.)<p>The new one might have it.<p>At a hardware level I&#x27;m not sure how well it would work. Out of the box, the tablet only queries the bike for cadence&#x2F;power&#x2F;resistance every 100ms, one query at a time in round robin, so your power reading is only coming every 300ms. However, the bike responds to queries much faster - on the order of 200-300us (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ihaque.org&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;26&#x2F;pelomon-part-ii-emulating-peloton&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ihaque.org&#x2F;posts&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;26&#x2F;pelomon-part-ii-emulatin...</a>), so an external device could certainly ask for updates faster. I&#x27;m not sure how rapidly the micro on the bike itself actually updates its own measurements and what ultimate time resolution is possible.')
