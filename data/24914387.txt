I, for one, expect we will see a handful of very interesting research programming languages coming out in the near-future with HoTT-based features, which will allow a lot of stuff which is currently inefficient to do in functional languages to be implemented in very efficient (and provably safe) ways.<p>Sure, that&#x27;s very much a niche and we can&#x27;t be sure anything practical will come out of it, but for some of us it&#x27;s interesting in its own right. :)<p>I understand how this isn&#x27;t interesting to folks working on pure math, just as category theory likely isn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s the fact that these mathematical abstractions map so well onto (certain kinds of) programming that makes them such recurrent topics on HN.')
