Projects have been badly designed by well meaning engineers before.<p>That said, I wasn&#x27;t trying to say that the problem was technical in nature. It&#x27;s that a sound technical design (and competent construction of that design) is only one part in a much larger problem set. A solution that the people who are paying for it don&#x27;t want (for whatever reason) is unlikely to succeed. The Wikipedia article for MOSE (the Venice anti-flood system) lists many lawsuits worried that it&#x27;s insufficient, will damage the environment, etc[1].<p>To me, this suggests that it may harm projects to leave it at &quot;the engineering is fine.&quot; The engineering may actually be more flexible than other constraints. It&#x27;s possible that the optimal design for a perfectly supportive environment may be less well suited for the world that exists.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MOSE_Project#Criticism,_corruption,_and_court_cases" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;MOSE_Project#Criticism,_corrup...</a>')
