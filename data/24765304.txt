Or just &quot;giz a butch&quot; as a more colloquial version. I think &quot;having a Ruby&quot; is less common outside of Greater London.<p>Context: I&#x27;m from the South Coast, navy town, and we had a lot of dockers from London move here in the 19th and 20th centenaries. If you listen to the way older people speak, they have a cockney twang with some Hampshire vowels thrown in. Growing up we used a lot of rhyming slang mixed in with a lot of London slang and &quot;Gypsy&quot; words. So off the top of my head (sorry - none are rhyming slang): Mush&#x2F;geezer for man (and geezer is not an old man like in American usage), to chav - steal, khark it - die, bird - woman, mare - any bad situation, having a mare - having a bad time, squin(ny) - someone prone to crying or telling tales, din(lo) - idiot, dinny - stupid, lairy - cheeky or confrontational, to cop - to be angry. You get the idea. Most of the consonants sound like Londonish ones, most Londonish vowels are different. So (in some rough approximation) &quot;dane&quot; for down, rather than &quot;dahn&quot;, &quot;pained&quot; for pound rather than &quot;paahnd&quot;, but baw for ball, bu&#x27;a for butter, and li&#x27;aw for little, hevva for heather, fing for thing. English accents are sent to blow American minds - that much I&#x27;m sure of.')
