A lot of really interesting material on being a dad and specifically parenting boys (but a lot of the benefit also extends to women obviously). At first the material felt a little too &quot;men&#x27;s rights!&quot; to me, but there really are a significant amount of culture deficiencies in raising men to be fathers.')
