I am interested in expanding into the US next year, and our team can only be in charge of development and technical support. We have compared our service&#x27;s technical features with existing SaaS services in the US, and in many ways our service are better. Our current weakness is that we don&#x27;t have a partner or experience to run the US company.<p>How to find a partner? Does the VC offer such a partner? What other ways are there?<p>Thanks,')
