Clearly not ethical.<p>However, if you <i>grow</i> a brain in a jar, would it suffer? It doesn&#x27;t know any different, and as a baby accepts it&#x27;s reality as it grows up, so would the brain. I posit here that it wouldn&#x27;t suffer, as living in a jar would seem normal to it.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m against growing brains just because they may suffer. I do know I&#x27;m against growing brains because it will undoubtably lead to a robot&#x2F;cyborg uprising that will doom all of humanity.')
