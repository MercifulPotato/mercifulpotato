Ceteris parabus I always favor rewriting if only to allow the\nrewriting programmer easier maintenance going forward.  When the breakage\nreveals why the old code was written in that peculiar way, the hope is that\nthe cost of breakage is less than the time cost of understanding the\npeculiarity.  Obviously, for big stakes, e.g., the Google search algorithm,\nthis &quot;move fast and break things&quot; ethos is untenable.')
