TDP is supposed to specify the highest power you can get the processor to dissipate, not typical or idle use.  And since different manufacturers specify TDP differently, you can&#x27;t even compare the number.<p>Performance&#x2F;watt metrics and idle consumption would have been a far better way to make this choice.<p>If you have a choice between A) something that can dissipate 65W peak for 100 units of performance, but would dissipate 4W average under your workload, and B) something that can dissipate 45W peak for 60 units of performance, but would dissipate 4.5W under your workload... I&#x27;m not sure why you&#x27;d ever pick B.')
