One idea for sifting parking pages that comes to my mind is using image recognition.  I can easily tell when something is a parking page by looking at it, I bet you could get an ML model to do so with pretty good accuracy too.<p>There is a class called fast.ai [1] which I personally found to be an amazing introduction to machine learning &#x2F; deep learning.  The first hour and a half course gets you using their library to make an image classifier that can differentiate dog and cat breeds.  I bet by simply gathering training data (sites that are and are not parking pages) and reusing the same architecture used in that first class you could train a model that does a pretty good job of it.<p>Once you could classify pages you could just pre-compute a large list, classify, throwaway all the parking pages, and make the remainder available to your user.<p>1 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fast.ai&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.fast.ai&#x2F;</a>')
