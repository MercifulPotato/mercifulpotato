There must have been more than 50 drivers (with many annoyed stares into my window as they passed) that made unnecessary lane changes to go around me just to then closely follow the car in front of me.<p>This large gap may make it seem like the car is going slower than it is, as so many drivers tried to overtake me but failed as slower traffic in the other lanes blocked them.<p>Human drivers may just become worse over time as more law-abiding autonomous vehicles hit the road. &quot;5x&quot; might not be as much of an improvement in the future.')
