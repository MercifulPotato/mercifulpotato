What concerns me is the finiteness of non-renewable resources both oil and the materials used to produce wind and solar power. Processing of ore to produce the rare metals used is very power intensive and polluting. What happens in say 2050 when all this green power tech needs to be replaced?? Is there enough raw materials left over to continue the production of green energy tech ??')
