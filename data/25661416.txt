Advertising that you are doing an end-around KYC, is something that a judge will find very interesting if this comes to court.<p>In addition, KYC is a big priority of the US Treasury department and there is pretty bipartisan support for it.<p>Basically, the US Treasury Department does not want any company to facilitate large money transfers anonymously. If you are doing that, they will likely come after you, despite whatever clever legal &quot;hacks&quot; you may think you have.<p>I don&#x27;t see this ending well.')
