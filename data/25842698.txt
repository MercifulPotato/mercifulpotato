Unfortunately I&#x27;m not sure how that would be enforced for most apps. For example a browser, my browser runs pretty much until I reboot so if I gave it permission once it would still have permission until I quit. So it seems like the browser needs a permission system on to of the OSes. OS is per app, browser is per domain&#x2F;page&#x2F;tab something.')
