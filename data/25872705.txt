This has the advantage that it plays nice with <i>git diff</i>, which will faithfully show every affected line. If you use block comments or <i>#if 0</i>, it will only show the 2 new lines that start and end the new comment block.<p>Trivia: Opposite to C, which originally had block comments and not line comments, the Ada language only supports line comments, with the reasoning that it&#x27;s clearer at a glance whether a line has been commented out (especially in the absence of syntax highlighting).<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.dlang.org&#x2F;Commenting_out_code#Nested_comments" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.dlang.org&#x2F;Commenting_out_code#Nested_comments</a>')
