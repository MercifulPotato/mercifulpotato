There is not enough evidence to make such a definitive conclusion. I can see how people might read my comment as implicitly asserting that if people did understand the empirical facts they would come to the conclusion of zoonotic origin.<p>That said, there <i>are</i> facts, and they are relevant: the fact that COV RaTG13 has 96.2% similarity to SARS-COV-2. The incredible diversity of bat coronaviruses, and the fact that only fraction are studied and understood, despite serious study by the WIV.<p>Here&#x27;s another good quote from another good thread: And investigating zoonotic origins can take decades, and you may NEVER find the &quot;smoking bat&quot; or whatever other intermediate species that may be involved. It&#x27;s like looking for a needle in a planet-sized haystack. -- \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;angie_rasmussen&#x2F;status&#x2F;1349754597275914242" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;angie_rasmussen&#x2F;status&#x2F;13497545972759142...</a><p>The main point that I was trying to make, which I stand by, is that most people are going to base their beliefs about this question on essentially political considerations: do you trust the CCP or the US State Dept more? Unfortunately, both of those institutions have done terrible damage to objective scientific inquiry, and in my opinion neither one is really deserving of trust. Better to follow the science where it leads, but this is an often frustrating and time consuming process.')
