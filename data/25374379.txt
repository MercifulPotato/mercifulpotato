Item(by='erinaceousjones', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607612677, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25373574, text='&gt; Counter backlash then. You don&#x27;t have to support people that don&#x27;t support GeForce Now over Stadia. GeForce Now is no different than renting some server and streaming to another device.<p>Can&#x27;t really backlash considering I already own the games of those publishers who initially supported GFN and then pulled their games from it :P I already paid for the Mafia trilogy, Fallout &amp; Elder Scrolls, GTA, Red Dead Redemption series, DOOM, Wolfenstein, Borderlands series, .....<p>FWIW I paid for Stadia for a month but I wouldn&#x27;t sink much money into it, either. The games I want to play are mostly missing on Stadia too. Wouldn&#x27;t pay for either GFN or Stadia at this point.<p>&gt; From what I&#x27;ve heard people are able to play Cyberpunk 2077 with RTX on using GFN (GeForce Now).<p>Yup, CD Projekt Red are one of the publishers of AAA games that seem to have no beef with GFN.<p>&gt; That&#x27;s interesting, I&#x27;m surprised you can&#x27;t use Steam to stream games. But interesting nonetheless.<p>Oh, I forgot about Steam Link actually. I&#x27;ve used that too. It was... okay, but I experienced more bugs and couldn&#x27;t get the same quality I got with Moonlight. Moonlight has higher framerates available (90fps, 120fps) and is more actively maintained than the Steam Link app (the Android TV version, anyway). Moonlight does depend on you having an NVIDIA GPU though.')
