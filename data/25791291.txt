Their code wasn&#x27;t amazing but he was a great leader and could sense trouble and help people out (religious help or just every day advice).<p>I&#x27;ve known non-religious people who are utter assholes and I would pay to never work with again. As long as someone isn&#x27;t trying to convert me in the middle of the work day I couldn&#x27;t care less who or what they worship.<p>On the flip side, this sounds like the people who complain when popular tech people talk politics on their twitter. Unfortunately, politics and religion have been around a lot longer than programming&#x2F;tech and both of those things affect lives greatly.')
