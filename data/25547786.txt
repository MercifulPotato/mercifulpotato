Basically with an open differential all power would be routed to a wheel that’s getting no traction (for instance if it’s on ice). A differential lock closes it, so it’s as if there were no differential, so both wheels on the axle will turn at the same speed. This is bad if you’re on a normal road (obviously, since that’s why differential were invented) but great in low traction environments like mud or ice.<p>Most off road vehicles have locking differentials.')
