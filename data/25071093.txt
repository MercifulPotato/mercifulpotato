People drive well in Japan, it is no easy task to get one drivers license. In Tokyo, drivers seem to be aware of all their surroundings. Pedestrians also obey the rules and don&#x27;t walk where ever it suits them.<p>A lot of US drivers are terrible. Even lvl 1&#x2F;2 is an improvement over most drivers on the roads who are looking at there phones while driving down the center line or against traffic.')
