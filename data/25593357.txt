And that is the point.<p>Just imagine how that would work in practice. Somebody does an original experiment that gives exciting results. Let&#x27;s say they get a 1000 Science Points for that. Now somebody replicates that experiment. How many points should they get? Should you get as many points for replicating a 1000 points experiment as replicating a 500 points experiment? Why would you do original experiments at all anymore? Isn&#x27;t it easier just to replicate original experiments where all of the hard work has already been done?<p>Awarding points for replication is a nonsense idea.')
