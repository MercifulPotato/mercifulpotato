I imagine on a day-long hike, the numbers may completely change and it may substantially draw power; but, that wasnâ€™t the case for the long walk.<p>The 22 minute indoor exercise seemed to draw proportionally more power. It might have been the type? Indoor I chose the one that implies strength training, so maybe it has to pay closer attention than the 80 minute walk&#x2F;run?')
