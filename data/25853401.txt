Item(by='kannanvijayan', descendants=None, kids=[25854131, 25853731], score=None, time=1611186104, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25851569, text='It&#x27;s an honorific and a sign of respect that is be paid between generations, within social circles where respect is due.  It is used in particular by children and young people to refer to those of an older generation within the &quot;circle of respect&quot; of their parents.<p>A child will simply not be introduced in a familiar way to someone you don&#x27;t trust or respect - they will be kept away.  If the person is referred to for some reason, they&#x27;ll be referred to as &quot;that person&quot; or somesuch.<p>When I ask my son to refer to someone as uncle or auntie, it means I&#x27;m signalling to him that they have some degree of standing in my life: they are a colleague, or friend, or acquaintance to whom I am asking him to show respect on my behalf.<p>An uncle or auntie is someone who &quot;is known&quot;.  By bestowing that title, and instructing your child to use it with them, you are granting them status in the eyes of your child, and segregating them explicitly from the general set of all older people.<p>When the term is used by adults, it naturally refers to the _even older_ generation of the elderly.  So in this case, where the perspective of the writer is an adult perspective, it refers to the elderly.<p>Lastly, there&#x27;s a subtle detail that should be made explicit.  When it&#x27;s used &quot;in general&quot; like it is in this title, it does not imply that I, or any reader, considers all of those people uncles and aunties personally.  It&#x27;s implicit in the usage that we are referring to &quot;people who are uncle and aunties for those whom they are the uncles and aunties of&quot;.<p>I hope I&#x27;ve done a half-decent job, because the entire set of cultural associations around that word are hard to get across.')
