Item(by='MrBuddyCasino', descendants=None, kids=[25276379], score=None, time=1606906587, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25275204, text='One of the problems with exceptions is that they bubble up the call stack, and then you&#x27;ve got layering violations: higher level modules should never depend on lower level modules. The &quot;checked exceptions were a failure&quot; meme goes towards this direction, it results either in nasty boilerplate because you&#x27;ve got to handle and re-wrap the implementation-specific exception in something more general to avoid leaking things that should have been hidden (like Hibernate does), or unsound error handling.<p>Maybe the solution to that is<p>1. Only allow checked exceptions, and force error handling.<p>2. Only have 2-3 exception types, not user-extendable: Retryable, Unrecoverable, and Error (for non-user code errors like OOM). OTOH, how to distinguish between different exceptions thrown by the same method, and how to add additional error information (like status_code) would become a problem. Javascript doesn&#x27;t seem to care tho?<p>A Result type Ã  la Rust solves most of that: you might still have to wrap lower layers, but at least the  noise &amp; syntax is much more sane (never thought I&#x27;d say that about Rust!).')
