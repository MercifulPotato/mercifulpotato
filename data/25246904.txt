If the hardware fails you&#x27;re buying a new ipad anyways, and unlike a commodity windows PC the iPad can&#x27;t be repaired.<p>- malware is still a threat if you have a spyware solution like O365<p>- as google demonstrates on a regular basis, you can&#x27;t trust that you&#x27;ll have access to your cloud backups. If you have data that you actually need, then you need to back it up yourself. Restoring backups takes maybe a few hours a year. Not an issue.<p>- an iPad is not a substitute for a desktop workstation<p>&gt;If your device breaks, you toss it, switch to another machine, go to a browser, type in the website, login, and youâ€™re good to go again within seconds. That seems a lot better and faster than paying for in house IT.<p>Sure until google locks you out of your account for no reason or you realize you&#x27;re paying insanely high fees per year when your strategy could be to buy a prebuilt system from Dell once or twice a year and copy your backup data from a USB hard drive. For a business of 30 people or so this is perfectly viable.')
