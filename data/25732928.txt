The theoretical generation capacity is very high but their solar power capacity factor in reality is 10%, add wind and (debatably green) biomass and its still only 20% of installed renewable capacity. So that’s a significant gap that coal ends up covering (more than a few percent). Expanding the program by a factor of 5x to account for inefficient power factor is probably not in the cards considering electricity is already the highest price in Europe. Doing a u-turn on nuclear or a new initiative to replace coal with LNG is more likely in next two decades.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spectrum.ieee.org&#x2F;energy&#x2F;renewables&#x2F;germanys-energiewende-20-years-later" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;spectrum.ieee.org&#x2F;energy&#x2F;renewables&#x2F;germanys-energie...</a>')
