Together with the TPM, physical access no longer means easy data access, and you don&#x27;t have to input a passcode for the encryption either.<p>There is no good story for tpm-secured booting into a full-drive encrypted Linux OS. What I have now still requires a passcode at boot, and it was still a pain to set up.')
