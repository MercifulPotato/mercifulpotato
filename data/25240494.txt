If someone is not <i>intending</i> to discriminate, then they are not guilty of anything and should not be &quot;punished&quot;. It&#x27;s not even slightly reasonable to expect every possible way of slicing a group of people to be reflective of the average gender&#x2F;race data of the overall population because people are different: that&#x27;s the entire argument for diversity to begin with.<p>That&#x27;s the basic position that is alienating so many hundreds of millions of people and convincing them this kind of activism is toxic. It&#x27;s why Trump won the first time and did much better than predicted the second. It&#x27;s why this thread is full of people that think the NYT is being manipulative and deceptive. You may <i>not</i> punish people simply for not having enough black&#x2F;women employees if they haven&#x27;t actually done anything to discrimate: end of story.')
