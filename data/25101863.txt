IIRC the EU has outright banned NiCd batteries entirely with a few very minimal legacy exceptions (medical devices I think?). Even though in principle part of the price is supposed to cover proper disposal EOL, people being people plenty got tossed and it&#x27;s nasty stuff to have in a landfill even let alone elsewhere. There isn&#x27;t any real treatment for it either as far as I know, normal heavy metal treatments like chelation therapy don&#x27;t really work with Cd.<p>So I think yet another benefit of lithium is also that it&#x27;s relatively easier to deal with over its whole life cycle. Elemental lithium is of course quite reactive, don&#x27;t want to be directly exposed to it, but it doesn&#x27;t stay that way in nature. That it&#x27;s extremely abundant and distributed doesn&#x27;t hurt either. While for economic reasons it makes sense to get it initial from naturally highly concentrated sources, and to recycle lithium packs, it&#x27;d be perfectly viable to pull it right out of the ocean with solar power if there was ever a need.')
