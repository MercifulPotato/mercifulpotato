I 100% agree with this feeling at most scales of code size, and the feeling matches reality at the small scale. However, I&#x27;ve found that this feeling of productivity doesn&#x27;t match reality in the large. I use Haskell for programming in the large despite this feeling of unproductivity, because in fact, I am way more productive.')
