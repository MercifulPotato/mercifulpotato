Item(by='skissane', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602725590, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24782333, text='Years ago, I worked for a public sector organisation that had both staff and contractors. In IT, we had to create accounts for them all. For the staff, HR had a central database with all their details, so we just sucked that database into our identity management system. For contractors, there was no central database of who the contractors actually were, that knowledge was distributed across all the departments that employed contractors. Finance knew how much money was being spent and who the contracting agencies were, but didn&#x27;t keep records of who the individual contractors were.<p>I said: &quot;Can&#x27;t we just get HR to put the contractors in their database too? We can have a different person type or something to make the staff-vs-contractor distinction clear&quot;<p>I was told: &quot;HR will never agree to that. The unions keep on asking for statistics on how many contractors are employed and how many hours they work. HR can truthfully answer &#x27;we don&#x27;t know&#x27;. If HR puts the contractors in their database, then they will know, and then they might have to tell the unions.&quot;')
