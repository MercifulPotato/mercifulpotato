That was two other people. I&#x27;m simply trying to set the record straight.<p>Regarding Greenwald&#x27;s claim that he never supported the Iraq war: He redefines &quot;support&quot; to mean using a platform or role in politics to publicly profess support for the war. By that definition, my hawkish uncle didn&#x27;t support the Iraq war because he never published anything on the matter. I agree with Greenwald that his beliefs at the time were reasonable. And I know the Iraq was a big reason why he changed many of his political views. But unlike Greenwald, Harris never even implicitly supported the Iraq war. At the time he thought it was, &quot;...a very dangerous distraction from the ongoing war in Afghanistan.&quot; In hindsight, he admits it was a disaster.<p>In <i>The End of Faith</i>, Harris uses the Iraq war as an example of the US being utterly abhorrent, but still being more ethical and moral than many other societies on the planet. He argues that the reason those societies haven&#x27;t caused more harm is because they lack the capability, not the will, and that it&#x27;s crucial to make that distinction. Now it&#x27;s quite possible to disagree with that argument, but it takes an extremely uncharitable reading of Harris to get support for the Iraq war out of that text.')
