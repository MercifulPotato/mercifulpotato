It appears to be a product of accumulated experiences in short-term memory. People with attention deficit disorders experience time differently and are unable to gauge even short periods accurately, but even for neurotypical people, time seems to &quot;pass quickly&quot; if nothing takes place, or if you&#x27;re distracted. It&#x27;s a function of attention, instead of our other senses (smell, hunger, hearing), which happen whether we pay attention to them or not.')
