Between my prison &quot;stigma&quot; and the discriminatory ageism that is very prevalent in the industry, and even though I have 30 years professional programming experience, I am currently finding it impossible to find any work.<p>Can someone please tell me...what am I supposed to do at age 55?  Find a new &quot;career&quot;...doing what?<p>I know plenty of you reading this with your secure jobs and paychecks have done illegal things and not been caught...well what if you were?<p>I mean I hear all day all the &quot;protections&quot; that this group and that group are getting recognized for, and meanwhile all I want <i>is an opportunity</i> to work my ass off in the field that I have loved since I was a 13yo kid riding my bike to the local Radio Shack on weekends so I could literally sit-in the window display and program on the TRS-80 and save my &quot;work&quot; to a cassette drive.<p>But no...hiring me (or anyone else in my situation) would apparently pose such an existential threat to companies so in need of people with my exact talent stack that I can&#x27;t even be considered once it&#x27;s discovered I went to prison some 20 years ago.<p>I know this subject has been discussed <i>ad nauseum</i> here on HN, so I don&#x27;t expect any new answers to my questions, but maybe a few of you with open ears and the ability to think outside the box when it comes to hiring could be a bit more understanding if a qualified candidate with past legal issues come thru your interview process.')
