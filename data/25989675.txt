Some people will be into it and it&#x27;ll work for them, but others will just not be interested (whatever their reasons).<p>For example the first picture of the article shows basketball. That could be seen as a great team building exercise (for non-remote teams) but some people just don&#x27;t like basketball or sports.<p>Unfortunately there are no silver bullets.')
