With luck, they will be intercepted before anything can happen that might be deleterious to the safety of all these lives we&#x27;re all claiming are we care about so deeply.<p>It&#x27;s good to see so many loyal and patriotic americans keeping eyes forward in this common endeavor. And not being sidetracked by matters like, say, street crime, that can be reliably left to the capable handling of municipal authorities.')
