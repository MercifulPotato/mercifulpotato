(He may have introduced predicate logic in that same lecture.)<p>Intro to Logic was a philosophy course, but some majors allowed students to take it instead of their one required College Algebra course. The result was it was a lot of very non-technical people who struggled with intro algebra, and consequently struggled with formal logic. (Predicate logic was the focus of the third section of the course later on.)<p>Discrete Mathematical Structures was a math&#x2F;cs course, where almost every student was a CS major, so it was predominantly technically-minded people for whom formal logic was at least very familiar, if not natural.')
