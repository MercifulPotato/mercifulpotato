Managing compilation units by grouping up what changes infrequently actually make compilation faster in general and much faster incrementally.<p>Even visual studio&#x27;s compiler compiles sqlite&#x27;s 6MB in under a second.<p>&gt; Again this is specific to header-only libraries, but to avoid code bloat you&#x27;ll need to turn on link-time optimisation<p>This is nonsense. This list seems like you are trying to invent problems that aren&#x27;t there. The vast majority of the time you decide what compilation unit to put the definitions into and that&#x27;s it.')
