Morals are personal&#x2F;cultural values, I can&#x27;t imagine equating them to &quot;actual truth&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m really not following how this relates to my original comment either, I meant your idea of &quot;fairness&quot; depends on personal values. The fact that people have different ideas of what&#x27;s fair is conclusive proof.')
