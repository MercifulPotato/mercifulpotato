The first three are not really a problem for big engine makers, as they can afford to implement additional backends but it is an issue for smaller studios and indie makers. 32-bit support is probably going to be less important (unless Rosetta can also translate x86 only code). It&#x27;s good that they packed a decent graphics subsystem in their new chips but that&#x27;s only part of the solution.<p>I believe their main concern is to bring iOS games to macOS rather than bring new games into the platform. Let&#x27;s be realists here, iOS games bring in the cash. If they can run it in another form factor with potentially better graphics then even more money in the long run.')
