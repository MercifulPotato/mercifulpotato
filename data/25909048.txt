Putting stuff on the 3&#x2F;Y like a simple instrument dash like on the S&#x2F;X or even a HUD  seem to be things he is vehemently opposed to. Supposedly because the car will drive itself, thus there is no need for such instruments (of course we know as of January 2021 that hasn&#x27;t happened yet and not likely to happen soon).<p>Rumor has it the S&#x2F;X will lose its instrument cluster for its next (imminent) refresh too.<p>Shame because the 3 would otherwise be perfect for my next car, which I&#x27;d like to make an EV.')
