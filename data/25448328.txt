The price of building and feeding hyper-targeted, data-bloated marketing machines is far out of scale with their utility for most use cases, but people are throwing silly money at it right now.  (Compare the Smart TV&#x2F;IoT device model, where they believe that peddling usage data is enough to justify an increased BoM AND frequently selling the product near or under cost).  If they expect the bubble to burst (either through marketers coming to their senses or heavy-duty GDPR style regulation), they might be just &quot;passively&quot; pushing the privacy angle-- don&#x27;t bother building out an infrastructure that will be worthless as soon as the bubble bursts, and you come out of it with a huge branding&#x2F;goodwill win when everyone else reinvents their business model and invents privacy.<p>I was surprised Chromium!Edge ended up being such a mess with privacy because, somewhat like Apple, MS has associated businesses that let them subsidize its development without having to leverage user data.  They could have come out looking good-- weren&#x27;t they the only ones who tried to make a go of Do Not Track headers?')
