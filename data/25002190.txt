Item(by='theandrewbailey', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604611804, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24998305, text='&gt; There was a competing bicycle dealership next door (Apple) that one day began selling motorized vehicles--expensive but attractively styled cars with their innards hermetically sealed, so that how they worked was something of a mystery.<p>In retrospect, I think Neal was referring to a specific aspect of Apple&#x27;s products when writing &#x27;hermetically sealed&#x27;, but I view almost any Apple product, as a whole, that way. (Apple doesn&#x27;t want you to service them yourself, or know how the software works.) Even after 20 years, some things never change.')
