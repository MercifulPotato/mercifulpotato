Nearly any desktop or mobile app or game won&#x27;t have any such constraints, for example. And you&#x27;ve also got overcommit to deal with on those platforms, so it&#x27;s not like your allocation failure will actually happen at malloc time either.<p>So outside of embedded, which tends to have a variety of constraints, what even pretends to handle allocation failures across the entire program?')
