I personally don&#x27;t believe this though, though it is a valid argument. There is a counter argument too.<p>The common argument in favor of more life is that the probability of life evolving is some very small number, such that there must be a very large number of opportunities for life to evolve in order for life to actually evolve. At the same time, there are a large number of opportunites given the size of the universe. Given that there is presumably no relation between the &quot;small&quot; probability for life to evolve and the &quot;large&quot; number of opportunities in the universe, we don&#x27;t expect these two numbers to conspire to be near the same size, which is what would have to happen for just one life to evolve. Rather, we expect there should be lots of life that evolved in different places or that the probability that any life evolved at all is extremely (vanishingly) small. So if this argument is correct and we know of one life form, we should expect many more in the universe. (Not to imply we would necessarily be able to find them.)<p>There is one potential problem with this argument. It assumes there is just one universe. If there are many universes then it is possible that life did not evolve in almost all of them. In universes where life did evolve, odds are it happened just once. And of course, that life (us, for example) would see that univese and the life that evolved there, however improbably that would be.<p>I read a saying &quot;You know an argument is wrong if it invokes quantum mechanics.&quot; But I&#x27;ll do it anyway. Some educated people believe quantum mechanics works this way - the univese effectively branches into parts that are essentially distinct (referred to as different universes too). It is not as outlandish as it may seem. The whole reason quantum computers are supposed to be powerful is that different things happen in parallel.<p>You don&#x27;t have to buy the quantum mechanics part. If there are multiple universe for whatever reason then the probability argument above is not valid.<p>I do want to add one thing. The number of &quot;opportunities&quot; for life in our universe grows linearly with each dimension in the universe. (Lets just say to the fourth power of the size of the universe.) On the other hand, the size of probability grows&#x2F;shrinks exponentially. So it is not hard to imagine between the two of these numbers, the exponential one wins.')
