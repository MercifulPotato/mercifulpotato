One or two day prior is unthinkable, just per common sense. Although data points would be valuable and appreciated but we don&#x27;t really need data to understand the one or two day is just not enough time for anyone or anything.<p>It&#x27;s not like there are a bunch of dedicated reviewers, it&#x27;s always other researchers who review. I don&#x27;t think some of the most valued papers like MapReduce or BigTable would be reviewed in just a day or two. It&#x27;s just not a reasonable amount of time in any condition in terms of reviewing research papers.')
