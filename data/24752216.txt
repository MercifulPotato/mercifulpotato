The relative pittance they get from Hollywood studios isn&#x27;t even a drop in the bucket and generally won&#x27;t effect the pace of development of Unreal, though it has driven Epic to put even more effort into making Unreal a better component in Hollywood workflows. However, this effort won&#x27;t have much, if any, impact on game production since the workflows are completely different.')
