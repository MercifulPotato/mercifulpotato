It&#x27;s 3% in a category of your choice (gas, online shopping, dining, travel, drug stores, or home improvement&#x2F;furnishings), 2% grocery stores and wholesale clubs, and 1% in everything else.<p>But those are all multiplied by 1.25, 1.50, or 1.75 if you have balances of at least $20k, $50k, or $100k, respectively, in certain BofA <i>or</i> Merrill Lynch accounts. What matters is the total in all our eligible BofA and Merrill accounts.<p>Transfer $100k worth of your mutual funds or your IRA to Merrill, pick &quot;online shopping&quot; as your 3% category, and with the multiplier you&#x27;ve got 5.25% cash back at Amazon. And at Newegg. And at online orders at Walmart, Best Buy, and so on. At some stores it counts as online if you order through their website or app for in-store pickup, too.<p>You can change the category once per calendar month, so if you are planning on a big purchase at, say Home Depot, just buy near the end of the month and switch the category to home improvement&#x2F;furnishings before buying, and switch back to online when the month rolls over.')
