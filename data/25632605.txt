He has no ties or obligations to the US. His organization also rededicated almost all published documents to prevent doxing. He is no different than the New York Post.<p>Snowden was an NSA contractor. Personally I still think he&#x27;s a disinformation campaign similar to Operation Mockingbird or COINTELPRO and likely still works for either the CIA or State Dept (look up &quot;Limited Hangouts&quot;)<p>Manning swore and oath as a soldier and broke it; releasing information that was not filtered or screened.<p>Three entirely different cases.')
