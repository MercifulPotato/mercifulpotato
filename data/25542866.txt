That’s like 8 extra strength Tylenol.<p>Another commenter alluded to why it is the number 1 cause of acute liver failure in the US: that’s because we can buy bottles of a couple hundred pills and thus the majority arise from suicide attempts.<p>The British used to have a big problem with paracetamol (what Tylenol&#x2F;acetaminophen is called there) and acute liver failure, so they mandated only blister packs for the medication, no ability to buy large bottles. Suicide rates due to paracetamol and acute liver failure decreased as a result. In fact, aspirin is also an issue in the UK, and this mandate also helped with that.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC31616&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC31616&#x2F;</a>')
