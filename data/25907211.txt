It is a level 100 equivalent book.<p>Given its mandate of 100 pages, it sacrifices breadth for depth - it covers most of its topics in 1 page or fewer. It has lots of paragraphs that end with &quot;There are many advanced techniques that go beyond the scope of this book.&quot;<p>The best thing about the book is it is fairly comprehensive and well-organized as an end-to-end overview. It has short, 1-2 paragraph chunks about the 80% of ML work that covers 99% of what ML is.<p>It of course doesn&#x27;t go into detail but it also does not have many topics missing, which means if you make a mind map while you&#x27;re reading you&#x27;ll have a great starting point to branch out further once you&#x27;re done.<p>When you&#x27;re done with this book, you should be able to speak intelligibly about most aspects of machine learning development and design.<p>You should also be able to find strengths and weaknesses in your understanding based on what you came to the table with to pursue further.<p>I think this book coupled with some kind of lab practical or a series of Kaggle contests and notebooks to apply what you learn in this book would be an excellent &quot;ML 101&quot; course.<p>I teach out of this book for a 2 week bootcamp to new hires and converts to the data science practice at the consultancy I work at.')
