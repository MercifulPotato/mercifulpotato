Think Sterno burner type deal, I know there are others.<p>2) Burns Naptha, starts in liquid cycle (by lighting the volatile components in the fuel), then starts running in gas cycle once it heats up. (this is a normal Coleman Fuel stove)<p>3) Burns Kerosene, these stoves must use either naphtha or alcohol to start by burning in a staring cup, this is the kind of stove featured, Kero is not match lightable (not enough light volatile components in the fuel), so you preheat the gas generator to turn the kero into a gas, which can be match lit.')
