Said another way, a Tesla is a supercomputer you can drive around. A GM is a car with an electric motor.<p>Also, Tesla sales growth is 40% annually over the last 3 years and will likely continue for 5-10 years. GM&#x27;s might be 1%. Keep in mind, GM is fighting to retain market share. Tesla is taking it away from the incumbents.  They really cannot be compared in this analysis. Apple is the closest as a proxy for future P&#x2F;E.<p>If the legacy autos spun out their BEV business, that would be the closest comparable.')
