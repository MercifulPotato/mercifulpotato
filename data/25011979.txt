Item(by='munk-a', descendants=None, kids=[25012745], score=None, time=1604704029, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25011881, text='Oh it&#x27;s definitely arbitrary, the reason why dwarf fortress made the &quot;sorta&quot; list but other strategy games that are technically just as perma-death (i.e. every RTS ever from Starcraft to AoE2) don&#x27;t... in fact Dwarf Fortress is notably _less_ roguelike than those other games - it&#x27;s just more &quot;brutal&quot; almost certainly because there is no ability to tune the difficulty and some gameplay requirements are not clearly explained as necessary.  In DF the presence of your prior fortress can potentially make your life a lot easier (or more difficult) by tackling overworld threats and providing security (or becoming a hive of scum and villainy)... And there&#x27;s even a &quot;recover my save&quot; sort of game more in launching an expedition to reclaim your fortress.<p>Everyone who has ever played a dwarf fortress game for longer than four seasons will tell you &quot;Oh yea - I realized you&#x27;re going to need plump helmet&quot; - compare that to starcraft where often times players will realize they&#x27;ll eventually need a military of some form in their first game.')
