Item(by='eitland', descendants=None, kids=[25280595], score=None, time=1606935993, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25278855, text='I can&#x27;t understand why I should talk to any of my devices as long as they are as idiotic as they are now and like you describe above doesn&#x27;t have the slightest idea about how to handle context.<p>That said Siri feels at least 100 times smarter than Google assistant to me, the below are actual (if somewhat anonymized) examples:<p>- Google suggestions when I look at the phone at 5am in the  morning: &quot;text random friend of a friend that I answered a question for over Telegram&quot; or &quot;call customers project manager&quot;.

In the years I had access to the future it maybe helped me twice by pointing out it was time to leave for an appointment.<p>- Siri suggestions are mostly mundane (more or less predictably tells me when to leave for appointments, kids soccer and hockey training etc, suggests picking up kids at kindergarden - although not consistently, suggests sending messages to my wife over our preferred messaging solution, tweeting, or if I drive 5 minutes down to the shopping center: that I should drive home the way I always do etc) but I have never caught it suggesting outright idiotic things like Google, and once this weekend it even suggested something semi-smart (a text message to my wife that was surprisingly close to one I could have written myself to tell her I was on my way home, including one of my rather unusual abbreviations and with good timing :-)')
