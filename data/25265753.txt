Item(by='strangegecko', descendants=None, kids=[25272780, 25266344], score=None, time=1606835057, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25265573, text='I haven&#x27;t done a long-term trial.<p>The only things that are legally available here are ritalin and modafinil (only if you have narcolepsy). I tried 5mg of ritalin 2 or 3 times, it made me work and think faster and with more focus, but it also felt jittery and I&#x27;m not sure it was all that pleasurable.<p>So based on that and on worries about causing more long-term damage I haven&#x27;t tried to take it longer. Maybe I should try combining it with something that&#x27;s supposed to be fun, but I don&#x27;t know how I feel about doing this without some kind of a plan. E.g. combining with games that are challenging I would be worried about lowering my frustration tolerance.')
