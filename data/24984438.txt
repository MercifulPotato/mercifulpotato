It&#x27;s an antitrust problem that has caused me genuine huge cost increases in reality (Comcast mandatory 1TB data cap in Comcast only neighborhoods. not sure if this nonsense still going on), not just hypothetically.<p>There are ways to expose the existing networks to competition too. There are examples out there of using careful legislation to force a big monopoly player to share cable space and so on, allowing other vendors to compete on price.')
