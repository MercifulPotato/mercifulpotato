They don&#x27;t fear bankruptcy when considering whether or not to get a health checkup. They don&#x27;t pay the majority of their wage to have a decent livingspace. They pay less for food and overall have less cost of living. Poor people in the third world can eat decent meals (and they don&#x27;t even need to cook it themselves) for almost nothing compared to the US. What do our poor have access to? I guess dollar menus at fast food chains.<p>So no, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to say people in the US have it easy. <i>You</i> have it easy, and maybe the people around you do. But that means nothing to all the other people whose pain and suffering are invalidated by people like <i>you</i> just because they happened to be born on a piece of land that happens to be classified as &quot;first world.&quot;')
