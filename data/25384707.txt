But I do agree it will attract those that have a hard time finding a place elsewhere. Anyone who can be tolerated on twitter, which isn&#x27;t a high bar, wouldn&#x27;t go elsewhere unless ideologically motivated to do so (mind this doesn&#x27;t necessitate horrible views, some people want to oppose censorship not because they themselves are censored). People who hold objectionable views won&#x27;t change their minds when censored, and they won&#x27;t change their minds because they&#x27;re being told they are wrong or somehow deficient. But we have to do something to lead people to have better beliefs, there has to be a way to redeem the objectionable people of the world. If one is to choose to not help these people, in my cynical opinion the only other option is too cynical to post.')
