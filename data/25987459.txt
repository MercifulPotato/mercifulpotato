Clearly you&#x27;d want to know if your property is being loanded out, because it means that you&#x27;re incurring risk, no matter if you&#x27;re compensated for it through interest or not.<p>I can&#x27;t find any other interpretation for this logic and terminology other than a rally against fungibility.')
