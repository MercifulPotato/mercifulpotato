Strategies like price anchoring, premium pricing and other kinds of artificial product segmentation are ways to derive maximum value from a wider range of customers. I don&#x27;t consider them a way to rip off people.<p>If you&#x27;ve got a monopoly, sure this can lead to price gauging. But in a competitive market it just means you are rewarded for your edge.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ve only felt like I was ripped off on price a couple times. And every time it was buying something in a higher end brick &amp; mortar store where I bought a quality item at significant mark up. Brick and mortar stores simply are something that&#x27;s a luxury that is hard to justify if you&#x27;re on a shoestring budget.')
