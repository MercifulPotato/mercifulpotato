I joined in 2013, and wouldn&#x27;t know half of what I do if it weren&#x27;t for conversations on r&#x2F;webdev and r&#x2F;web_design. Such topics would have been shut down on StackOverflow because it broke some cardinal rule that nobody except people that spend all day on SO would know about.<p>That&#x27;s just for work related things. In terms of having conversations about relationships, or sports, or new phones and tablets, I wouldn&#x27;t even think of having these anywhere but Reddit.<p>Granted, I don&#x27;t spend time on r&#x2F;pics, or r&#x2F;teenagers or whatever is on the front page. But I don&#x27;t click the &quot;Trending&quot; tab on Youtube either.')
