One way to think about buying tech stocks right now is to insure yourself against new &quot;industrial revolution&quot; type of thing, but more like &quot;tech&#x2F;ai revolution&quot;. I feel like I need to have at least something allocated in all of the tech companies that might be part of that revolution. Eventually unless governments are able to stop it, it seems like larger companies might grow even larger compared to others and it will be a very complex challenge to stop that monopolization. If Tesla success will be sure to happen it will be too late by then.<p>It seems like FOMO and it is, but I think it is very reasonable.<p>I don&#x27;t invest in Tesla because I hope to double or triple short term, I just want to be part of what might very reasonably happen.')
