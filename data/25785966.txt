Not everyone here is an American or works in the private sector, either.<p>I would be fairly surprised if $60K is top 1%, even if you have the entire world population in the denominator. But when I checked your link, it&#x27;s <i>not</i> using the entire population for the denominator, (which is correct, IMO) so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s even close.<p>In the US, there are about 110M fulltime wage earners, (out of 330M population) with median being ~$50K and top quartile ~$80K. My very rough estimate based on that might be 45M people &gt;$60K. That is a lot more than 110&#x2F;330 * 1% * 7.8B = 26M before adding in Europe (lower wages but twice the population) or anywhere else.<p>Source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;news.release&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;wkyeng.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bls.gov&#x2F;news.release&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;wkyeng.pdf</a>')
