Seriously.<p>In ubuntu, when you update, you just update.<p>In arch, when you update, &quot;It is your responsibility to first go to arch website and see if there is any breakage or issue that needs to be handled manually. If yes, follow the instructions. If they&#x27;re unclear, spend hours on Arch Wiki. Then go ahead and update.&quot;<p>But wait, there&#x27;s more. If you don&#x27;t do arch updates regularly, like if for some reason you couldn&#x27;t update for 6 months, all bets are off. You&#x27;d be lucky if your update works at all. In the 99% chance that it doesn&#x27;t, &quot;they&quot; advise you to take the snapshots (that are archived every few days) and update snapshot-by-snapshot. So if it&#x27;s 20 snapshots you&#x27;ve missed, you update from snapshot 0 to 1, then 1 to 2, then 2 to 3, and so on. And if during any of the updates, there was some required manual fixup, you&#x27;re SOL.<p>If you are in the mood for going hardcore, just clear up your weekend, get a spare hard drive, and do LFS [0]. Once you&#x27;ve completed that project, trash that install (it was only for your learning), and go back to Ubuntu as a daily driver. Now you can tell arch fanboys to go eat a carrot, cz 99.9% of them know jack compared to what you know now. (side note: doing LFS would be enlightening enough that you&#x27;ll start having ideas and&#x2F;or future projects of your own. Have at it).<p>If you don&#x27;t like Ubuntu cruft like bloated desktop, snap, cloud-init on ubuntu server, what not, there&#x27;s a gazillion ways to go about it. You can simply &#x27;purge&#x27; (remove completely) then after install. Or do minimal server install and then install only the packages you want. Or you can pick a sane Ubuntu variant like Xubuntu. If you&#x27;re a tiling wm user, just pick regolith [1] (it&#x27;ll make your life so much easier).<p>If Ubuntu LTS packages aren&#x27;t recent enough and you need to use the latest version of some package, you can either install it in your home directory, or use a docker image if available (or build your own).<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linuxfromscratch.org" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linuxfromscratch.org</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;regolith-linux.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;regolith-linux.org</a>')
