DNA sequencing uses AI to sample the DNA at certain spots, then predict what the amino acids&#x2F;genes will be from there.<p>There aren&#x27;t more significant research towards finding new ways of solving DNA sequencing since this method is good enough and can improve from more data and better models.<p>We consider it &quot;Solved&quot; in this case.<p>Tons of tooling was built on top of it and until we can get the true sequence of amino acids quickly and cheaply, it&#x27;s not going away.')
