It absolutely does not mandate anything. In particular, there are a number of particularly simple compiler optimizations that are not forbidden, though they are not technically correct according to IEEE 754, such as algebraic reassociation and simple commutativity. Moreover, C allows subexpressions to be computed in higher precision (e.g. 80 bit &quot;long double&quot;), which is observable. That last one is primarily due to the x87 FPU coprocessor design that has given us a good 35 years of headaches. Good riddance to that!')
