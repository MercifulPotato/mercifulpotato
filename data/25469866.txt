Asians are routine discriminated against in academia, but nobody fears them. Hispanics and Latinos are horribly abused by companies and the labor market, not to mention the government, but nobody fears them. Women and blacks will sue you, riot, and drag you through the mud with no proof other than their own personal outrage. The media picks it up and amplifies it with disregard to the truth. That&#x27;s the only reason society responds to them, not out of concern, but fear, which is the worst possible motive.')
