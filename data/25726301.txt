However when looking at the app&#x27;s page, I noticed that someone seems to be engaging in some kind of review-bombing with that app. There are tons of reviews claiming that it was recently updated and has highly intrusive full page popup ads. But looking at the version info, the app hasn&#x27;t seen an update for over 2 years and the repository is in maintenance mode, and I nor anybody else that I know has seen a single ad when using it.<p>I wonder if this is a concerted effort to steer impressionable people away from a &quot;real&quot; FOSS QR code reader app and direct them to a malicious one instead, using scare tactics.')
