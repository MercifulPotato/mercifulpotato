I think the best and brightest could solve the problem without decimating their profits.</i><p>I hope you&#x27;re right! But so far, it appears no one at Facebook has figured out how to escape this &quot;tyranny of horrible choices.&quot;<p><i>&gt; I think the problem partially is maximizing revenue at the cost of everything else.</i><p>I disagree. I think the problem, from the perspective of Facebook, is figuring out how to do The Right Thing while <i>remaining relevant and competitive</i> against the many companies trying to dislodge Facebook from its dominant position. Many of Facebook&#x27;s users are <i>addicted</i> to the social-media-crack; if Facebook stops providing it, they will migrate to other social networks that provide it. And many of Facebook&#x27;s customers -- advertisers and propagandists -- <i>want</i> Facebook to continue to modify user behavior on their behalf; and if Facebook stops doing that, those customers will migrate to the competition.')
