Good to know.<p>My gtk-rs project is intended to replace a small, self contained win32 application.  The application is 132KB.  So although 5MB is small it&#x27;s an oom larger than my benchmark.<p>However, my gtk-rs hello, world GUI application is 14.6MB in release mode and that does <i>not</i> include the GTK DLLs that are also needed.  Yikes.  That&#x27;s crazy.<p>Perhaps 5MB is a reasonable price to pay for cross platform GUI.  Not taking 7+ seconds to build a GUI hello, world would be nice as well.')
