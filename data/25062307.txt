Without that, in both the OP&#x27;s link and [0], he just comes off as contrarian.<p>Krugman&#x27;s Nobel Prize was well-deserved, but like Chomsky and other popular academics, it&#x27;s so hard to separate the brilliant-thinker signal from the spotlight-powered noise.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;07&#x2F;31&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;transaction-costs-and-tethers-why-im-a-crypto-skeptic.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;07&#x2F;31&#x2F;opinion&#x2F;transaction-costs...</a>')
