It&#x27;s almost an absurd analogy.<p>If I was to make an analogy, I might say Walmart is a better analogy. Walmart is the biggest store in town, but you do have alternatives and nobody is forcing you to shop there, even if it&#x27;s kind of hard not to. Walmart does all the legwork of getting customers into the shop, then puts other companies&#x27; products on its shelves and sells them for a markup. Their markup? Pretty similar to Apple&#x27;s fee, roughly 25%.')
