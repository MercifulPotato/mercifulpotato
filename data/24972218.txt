I have worked with some truly excellent managers. The stereotype I called on is in my experience much rarer, usually new to the role or inexperienced, but it is what I&#x27;ve seen cause the most cultural and productivity damage in organisations which is why my reaction skewed in that direction.<p>If I am being totally honest with myself, when I first found myself in a management position, having ratcheted up from a development background, I was na√Øve and very much process focussed, and acted like every problem could be solved with additional or more detailed instructions. There was definitely also projection here on my behalf.<p>Nowadays I take a more measured and analytical approach to things in general, being thrust into management was a very tough learning curve but was also ultimately rewarding in terms of personal growth and professional development.<p>I definitely shouldn&#x27;t be here taking my frustrations of the day out on random articles, even if thinly veiled in jest. I should have written some music or put on an audiobook instead...<p>Having said that, I couldn&#x27;t resist one more before I turn in for the evening.<p>------------<p>Failure to acknowledge receipt of this email by COB will be considered an act of mutiny, and all dissidents will be fed directly to the server room boilers.<p>This is your first and only warning.<p>------------<p>Anyway, have a good day &#x2F; night.')
