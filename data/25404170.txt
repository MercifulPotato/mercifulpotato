In the context of law, and this entire thread, it&#x27;s nonsense used by people to make themselves think they are smart, or trick other people into thinking they must be smart. In law, <i>everything</i> is textualism, and therefore anyone who claims textualist jurisprudence as a distinct thing they practice are simply attempting to classify anyone else as not smart enough to form valid opinions about what words and phrases mean.')
