I&#x27;m also more tech than fitness, but I try to get in a quick row or treadmill run every day.<p>In my case, I purchased a Concept 2 a couple years ago, not because I&#x27;m a rowing enthusiast but because &quot;best rowing machine&quot; seemed to point to it and it cost less than my treadmill =P<p>I found a mount online for the Concept 2 that can attach my iPad and the last few weeks I&#x27;ve been using Apple Fitness+, but the select is <i>really</i> limited. Also, like all Apple Fitness+ programs, there is currently no feedback between what I&#x27;m doing and what the program is asking&#x2F;pushing me to do, which is disappointing.<p>I probably won&#x27;t purchase your product in the near future, given that I have a semi-working solution today. But I will encourage other folks to check it out if they are in the market for a rowing machine. And if you decide to go pursue a strictly software&#x2F;services solution, I absolutely would run your programs on my iPad while I row on my Concept 2 :)')
