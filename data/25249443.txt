In many places, I have food available to me around the clock in nearly unlimited quantities, which I also think is not natural and potentially harmful, but them&#x27;s the breaks.<p>When I wake up, I usually don&#x27;t eat for several hours, nor do I have any desire to, as my digestive system is still &quot;booting up&quot;. I have heard countless times from various wise beings that drinking a glass of clean water after waking up is very beneficial, so I do that. Sometimes it is yesterday&#x27;s tea, though.<p>My ideal eating technique is once a day, and then maybe a few light snacks here and there. It&#x27;s to avoid processed food, meaning anything which I didn&#x27;t see its original form of and wasn&#x27;t prepared by someone I know, whether it is grinding up or mixing, and to avoid things with multiple ingredients.<p>However, because I co-exist with others who are not as far along as me, I stray from this quite a bit. I partially alleviate it with occasional water fasting to give myself a chance to clear out the junk.<p>(When I say &quot;natural&quot;, it&#x27;s shorthand for &quot;how our life was for millions of years and what evolution tuned our bodies for&quot;.)')
