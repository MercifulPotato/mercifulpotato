In-fact, there were a time when there was a craze for Bitmap pixel fonts which looks the best at 8px. I used to build apps for Physicians who uses a hand-held device called Pocket PC[1]. My weapon of choice when it comes to fonts were these 8px bitmap fonts for the interfaces.<p>They look super sleek and smooth but the physicians keep complaining about the font-size. The clinics&#x2F;hospitals were replacing pen-paper with these Pocket PC Devices and the physicians depend on them for their earnings. I learned my lessons and made the fonts bigger. Designs do not look so nice (at-least to me and my team) but they loved my work. It paid for them, their families. The last time I heard, they were still using the &#x27;programs&#x27; (not apps) for over a decade or so.<p>Of course, my IDE had tiny fonts too. Then I grew and aged. By the time I crossed 30, my IDE&#x27;s fonts were big enough and I began liking it that way. Today, I occasionally write code with &quot;Monaco&quot; font at 16px on a 5K iMac. One day, I might scale it and even make the text&#x2F;content bigger.<p>Enjoy your tiny fonts while it lasts, you will also appreciate BIG text and fonts as you progresses.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pocket_PC" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Pocket_PC</a>')
