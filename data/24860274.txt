In the US they were also stupid expensive in just about every aspect.<p>Console MD player&#x2F;recorders were ridiculously expensive in the US. Portable players were expensive but not nearly as bad as the mains powered console ones. This meant most people just went for CD players.<p>Because they didn&#x27;t sell well here music labels didn&#x27;t release many (any?) MD albums in the US. That meant you were buying new albums from the &quot;import&quot; section of the store (if you had a record store that sold imports) for full integer multiples of CD album prices.<p>Unless you were stupid rich then you bought blank MDs and recorded your own music on them. That didn&#x27;t mean dropping tracks onto a playlist and pressing the &quot;Burn&quot; button. You had to plug your MD deck into an audio source, hit record, and then play the track&#x2F;disc back in real-time. If you just did a whole CD at once it would record as one long track but you could go back and mark start and end points to break it into actual song tracks.<p>So you either spent tons of money buying commercial MD albums or bought blank discs to make your own. Making your own discs meant every album you listened to required the cost of the blank disc and at <i>least</i> an hour of your time to record it.<p>Or you could just save yourself tons of money and effort and listen to CDs.<p>Source: a friend of mine was obsessed with MiniDiscs and I thought they were cool until I spent an afternoon recording two discs. I realized my DiscMan was a way better deal.')
