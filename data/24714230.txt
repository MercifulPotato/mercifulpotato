It can&#x27;t really account for how amazingly fast children are.<p>I&#x27;ve witnessed from absolute zero to conversational English in 3 months. Fluency within a year, with no discernible foreign accent (even got the local accent)<p>It took me years (late teens to early twenties) to achieve the same level that was attained by a child in a single year. My brain wasn&#x27;t even old by any means. I got plenty of exposure, daily (advanced) classes, where I would be corrected by experienced teachers. Plus I had some early exposure to written English.<p>The kid got... a normal class at a public American school. Nothing special apart from an exercise book we got from a teacher, to help with basic concepts.<p>It is astonishing.')
