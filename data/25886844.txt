The whole &quot;wake up, sheeple&quot; mode of political argument is based in the paranoid belief that clandestine groups and powerful actors have a certain degree of control and agency over the world, and that there are those in possession of awareness or knowledge who can &quot;reveal&quot; the truth to the masses.”<p>Except nothing in the quote says anything about <i>clandestine</i> actors.<p><i>You</i> are adding that.<p>Also nothing about  <i>warning</i> people has anything to do with <i>paranoia</i> or ‘wake up sheeple’.<p>Again <i>you</i> are adding something out of whole cloth that simply isn’t present in what he is saying.<p>There is nothing ‘paranoid’ about saying that a liberal democracy can become authoritarian if it adopts certain priorities and practices, or warning of this when those practices are being adopted.<p>Commenting on an observable trend is not the same as claiming that there is a conspiracy behind it.<p>On the other hand, dismissing ideas as ‘conspiracy theories’ can be a way of simply discrediting one’s political opponents, so we need to be careful not to do it casually.')
