More features? Cyclomatic?<p>&gt; urthermore, rewriting an established program from one language to another will always introduce more bugs than it fixes, and more severely the more complex the program is.<p>Should be obvious to anyone that this isn&#x27;t true.<p>&gt; The single best way to improve security is to reduce the attack surface,<p>Not true, but it&#x27;s a great way to start.')
