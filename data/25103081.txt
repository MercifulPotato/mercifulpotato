It&#x27;s difficult because the emotional part of the brain does NOT have the ability to use language. It evolved hundreds of millions of years ago, and is the deepest part of our central nervous system, and absolutely necessary for our survival. It can not be shut off or ignored. And in the case of depression, it may or may not be &quot;normal&quot; - but it is doing it&#x27;s job.<p>If you try to fight stress (which masquerades itself as problem-solving) it will create more stress.  When you&#x27;re okay in the present moment -- you&#x27;ve let go and accepted how you feel through recognizing the stress is temporary like a rain cloud; it will go away without doing anything -- you can passively and non-interactively observe what is going on, which is the beginning of learning.  This learning then turns into answers or at first something to talk about with a therapist.  Therapy can help quite a bit with this one.  This process of passively observing in a relaxed state no matter how bad you feel, is called meditation, and it&#x27;s what you&#x27;re talking about, &quot;let the &#x27;emotional&#x27; part of the brain do it&#x27;s natural function and simply process the emotions&quot;.<p>&gt;And while you can do that if your depression has an obvious cause. . . there are tons of people who are depressed for no obvious reason - OR - there is no way to get out of the situation that&#x27;s causing it.<p>That&#x27;s not really true though.  The high majority (88%) of people who go in for CBT therapy are cured from their depression in under 3 months, and of the majority who do not, the largest group is avoidant of psychological work.  Yes, there is a small subset of incurable depression.  The current theory is it has to do with ones gut biome, but those are estimated to be around 1% of people with depression, and for the majority of those people antidepressants do nothing.  They have this constant stomach ache.  However, those people can still get benefit by learning how to deal with the situation and live a happy and healthy life.  Eg, changing diet can remove many of the symptoms.  Calling it depression is even somewhat controversial, because of how different it is from all of the other kinds of depression.<p>People have yet to realize how far modern psychology has come, in part because most psychologists today practice an ancient form that barely, if at all, helps.')
