If you&#x27;re a US citizen&#x2F;permanent-resident, there&#x27;s sort of a &quot;ceiling&quot; to how much abuse you will get from your employer, since at the end of the day you can say &quot;fuck this, I&#x27;m working somewhere else&quot;...however, if you&#x27;re on some kind of visa, these things get a lot more difficult, since the company doesn&#x27;t <i>just</i> control your livelihood, they actually control you being allowed in the country at all.<p>While of course you can still apply to other places, and maybe you&#x27;ll get lucky to find another company who wil sponsor your visa, it&#x27;s a substantially more-uphill battle.<p>(disclaimer, not an immigrant, this is just based on what immigrant friends have told me and from what I&#x27;ve read).')
