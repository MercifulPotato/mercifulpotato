Maybe your OS disk is on a ludicrously fast SSD but is space-limited and you don&#x27;t want to waste that space on applications that don&#x27;t need it.<p>&gt; Why would I even &quot;install&quot; something, instead of dragging&#x2F;dropping a single &quot;file&quot; (yes I know it&#x27;s a directory) like I usually do.<p>Agree wholeheartedly. It makes perfect intuitive sense: the application is exactly where I think it is, and if I move it somewhere else then it is exactly there, and if I delete it then it is exactly gone.')
