(it&#x27;s impossible)<p>Or think of it this way: You could explain a car to someone who has never seen a car before, but only so long as the ideas used to explain the idea of a car (e.g. wheels, doors, windows), have already been familiarized to the other person. Otherwise if those ideas weren&#x27;t familiar, such as a wheel, you&#x27;d need to also explain what a wheel is. And if the concepts used to explain the wheel wasn&#x27;t familiar (and so on), you&#x27;d eventually hit a point where you <i>must expose the idea(s) directly to their senses (eg show them), otherwise they will never understand what you&#x27;re talking about</i>.<p>So all ideas come from the senses, and your minds ability to combine these &quot;pure&quot; ideas that you&#x27;ve sensed. &quot;Pure&quot; ideas are cheap and easy because they&#x27;re the simplest ideas - they&#x27;re what you directly sensed. To have good ideas, you need to combine many &quot;pure&quot; ideas together, hence why those who have experience working closely and thoroughly with something, will often have the best ideas associated to that something...')
