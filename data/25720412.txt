Item(by='ptero', descendants=None, kids=[25721409], score=None, time=1610315658, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25717116, text='&gt; We teach five year olds about Jim Crow and the Civil Rights Movement because it’s an important part of our history. Children are going to have questions about why things happened, and what the “right” side of it was. What are we going to tell them?<p>I hope you have a good answer. And if they question it, because it is natural for kids to question the world around them, you have a great chance to explain and reinforce that message with arguments. But if instead we shut down the questioner that chance will be lost, and they will likely revisit it later as they grow up, not inclined to take your priors anymore.<p>And yes, a few will always stay unconvinced. That is the price of freedom. But the country where the majority holds their opinions because they were <i>allowed</i> to think them through, consider alternatives and were not demonized for disagreement is much more resistant to sellers of next Auschwitz than the country where the majority parrots what a talking head on TV&#x2F;Twitter&#x2F;Facebook tells them.<p>&gt; Like, how are you gonna convince the dude wearing the Camp Auschwitz sweatshirt?<p>A dude or a gal wearing the Camp Auschwitz sweatshirt is, as I said, the price you pay for freedom. In a society where the majority would like to live, the predominant reaction on the street would be &quot;Yuck&quot;. In a society that is <i>told</i> what is right it is much easier for the ruling party to bring the next extermination camp to a site next to you.')
