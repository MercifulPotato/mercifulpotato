I would time travel 10 years from now and see who the top tech companies are. I would then come back and wait for those startups to appear and you know what I am doing next :)<p>2. I would travel back to somewhere around 1993ish when no one knew Jeff Bezos ?? and convince him that I would like to back his startup idea of selling books. I become a lead investor in Amazon and then come back to 2020 :)<p>3. I would go back to the times when religion was invented and then try to uninvent it (controversial I know). Nothing against faith in general but most religions have caused misery and pain over the years in the name of God.<p>4. Time travel to the first time fire was invented and watch the reactions just to get a kick out of it. Time travel to the first time when the first light bulb was invented and tell the guy he changed the world :)<p>5. Go back to the time when my dad was healthy AND try to convince him to eat better and exercise so he could hopefully live beyond 70 (he didn&#x27;t) and spend time with his grandchildren.')
