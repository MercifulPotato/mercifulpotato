It definitely could be better. I think GPLv3 or AGPLv3 with a dual license is currently the way to go. That offers the free software folks the freedom and increases awareness of the code, and the commercial license can be negotiated on a case by case basis. The challenge is to get projects to require CLA before they grow and lose the control needed for dual licensing.')
