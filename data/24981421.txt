You can&#x27;t audit all of it. So, there is only two non-exclusive options:<p>A- Trust the source or an auditing third party (source signatures, apt, App Store, etc)<p>B- Run it on a sandbox, optionally extended with capabilities explicitly allowed by the user (browser, android, docker, wasm, snap, etc)<p>It seems there is no other way. This also shows how the classic unix permission model is obsolete. I think Wasm has a big role to play here.')
