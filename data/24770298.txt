Item(by='mikestew', descendants=None, kids=[24773340], score=None, time=1602623131, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24769844, text='At least in WA state, vehicle insurance card can be electronic. Health insurance card is electronic. That leaves an ID, one CC (in case &quot;they&quot; don&#x27;t take Apple Pay), and a Health Saving Account card that oddly cannot be added to Apple Pay. Looking in the wallet, I guess I carry my credit union debit card, too.<p>The point is not to brag, but point out that two of those cards get taken out because there are electronic alternatives. Some states allow electronic driver&#x27;s licenses, too. Subtract those three, and there&#x27;s your &quot;3-4&quot; in your wallet. And a fuel card, FFS, for a <i>fleet</i> card that couldn&#x27;t be an NFC&#x2F;RFID fob like Exxon has had for a decade? Which in turn might as well be a reader on the pump for your NFC payment of choice.')
