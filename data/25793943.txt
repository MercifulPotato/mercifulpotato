Every dating app got an influx of people due to bordem from lockdowns.<p>I&#x27;m biased towards (investing in) bumble because it has anecdotally acted as the best dating &#x27;middleman&#x27; compared to tinder&#x2F;hinge. I&#x27;ve had only great experiences taking bumble girls on dates.<p>Compared to tinder, bumble has more serious people looking to date. The system is set up so girls message first and matches will expire after 24 hr. When a girl messages you first, she is already more invested in getting to you know than when a guy using a cheesy pickup line on tinder.<p>I&#x27;ve always loved the philosophy bumble took to the dating scene compared to the apps part of $MTCH.')
