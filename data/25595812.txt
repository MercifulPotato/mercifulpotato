Item(by='miahi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609441057, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25595592, text='On many mirrorless cameras the shutter is open by default (even when the camera is closed), so not even one shutter &quot;count&quot; on this type of usage (the shutter is only used when taking a photo, and not even then if in silent mode is used). Shutter lifespans are in the tens of thousands to hundred of thousands normally. It&#x27;s good to know the value when buying used (because you don&#x27;t know what you are buying, some cameras have such a high burst rate that you can reach hundred of thousands in hours if you keep the button pressed).<p>For many cameras you can find a power line adapter that replaces the actual battery and connects to power (Canon cameras cannot charge their batteries in-camera so this is a must for them).')
