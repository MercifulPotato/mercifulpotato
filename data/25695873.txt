I would also like to point out that you originally asked, with an incredulous tone, for a list of names of people who died as part of the BLM riots (implying that no one died). Now you are saying those deaths did not matter or were not caused by the riots, because of some cherrypicked examples where you didn&#x27;t like the people who died. Every person that died was a person.<p>As for your decision that it wasn&#x27;t terrorism or invited by aoc,\nAoc said this <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;ocasio-cortez-says-some-communities-no-choice-riot-2019-7" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;ocasio-cortez-says-some-comm...</a>\nI think this is a stronger incitement to riot (saying some people have no choice but to riot) than anything Trump said.<p>I think absolutely the issue is not as cut and dry as you are making it, and I don&#x27;t listen to fringe youtube or talk radio and live in a big city.')
