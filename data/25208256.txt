But with Bitcoin&#x27;s POW, the hashrate is part of the consensus rules by requiring the hash of the output block having a certain property which can only be attained in a timely manner with enough processing power and luck (in that sense, also in POW a block proposer is chosen &quot;randomly&quot;).<p>With POS, you don&#x27;t have the hashrate. But you have the stake which (in Ethereum&#x27;s POS) is lost if you try to vote for more than one possible new block for the chain. Which is a direct economic incentive to behave correctly.')
