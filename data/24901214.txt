Bluntly, no-one knows how to do it. As far as I can tell, the conventional wisdom used to be that it&#x27;s just not possible. New Zealand has some fundamental advantages that put it in a better position to achieve this than anyone else (island, long way from other countries, relatively low population) but even they&#x27;re having a bit of a time sustaining it.<p>Now, you&#x27;re probably right that a few decades ago the response to something like Covid wouldn&#x27;t be seen as such a disaster - but that&#x27;s mostly because expectations were different back then. If you take a look at some of the flu pandemics, they were a mess in terms of things like school closures and other measures, but as far as I can tell this was just seen as normal and inevitable.<p>(Obviously, countries which had bad experiences with SARS do have very different pandemic planning - but SARS was a much better candidate for cotainment and elimination than Covid is.)')
