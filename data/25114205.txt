The UI these days is cleaner and leaner, rivaling XFCE in resource usage.<p>&gt; <i>I still find Gnome to be the most usable and aesthetically pleasing desktop by far.</i><p>This was my initial impression, as well. But if you want to do something that the GNOME team feels is superfluous, you&#x27;re either out of luck or depending on some plugin that will break your DE if you upgrade GNOME.<p>On Plasma Desktop, almost everything is configurable, but it isn&#x27;t overwhelming and disorganized like it was in KDE 3 &amp; 4. There&#x27;s a considerable amount of polish. Plugin bugs don&#x27;t take down the entire desktop environment, either.')
