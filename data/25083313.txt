Unless you street charger is the same price as charging at home, but then it is free parking.<p>Note that electric is often cheaper at night. Most free parking spots are empty at night: the cars are at home.  Thus same price charging on the street as at home should be looked at as subsidized parking!<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it makes sense to have some on-street charging. However people won&#x27;t normally use it. Most will charge at home for the cheaper rates. What is left is those who can&#x27;t make it home on the current charge.  This is a small minority of all who park even in an all electric car world.')
