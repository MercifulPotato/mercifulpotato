Airbeds are a terrible guest experience: you have no privacy, no reserved space, you&#x27;re sharing a bathroom, and you probably have a backache when you wake up. Almost no one on AirBNB actually offers airbeds. It&#x27;s not until you parse &quot;AirBNB&quot; as something completely unrelated to airbeds that you start to think it might be a good idea.')
