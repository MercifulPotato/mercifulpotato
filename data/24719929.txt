PyTorch Lightning is built exactly for this purpose, so it is highly scalable and designed for working at this kind of scale.<p>I built it while doing self-supervised learning research at Facebook AI research where I was running dozens of model versions each on 256 GPUs!<p>We&#x27;ve applied a lot of these lessons to Grid, so when you use Lightning with it you have to do nothing. For other frameworks you also don&#x27;t have to do much in most cases but if there&#x27;s some friction there we have tools and guides to help!')
