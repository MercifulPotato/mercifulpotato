Perhaps they lied for your own good; because they don’t know what will happen to you or what to do about it; or perhaps they lied for monetary gain. <i>But does the reason really matter?</i> The inherent doctor-patient trust has been broken and we fervently and unequivocally condemn deceit of any kind in the medical field.<p>Yes, of course it matters! Suppose there was a rare form of brain cancer that could only kill you if you found out you had it. In that case we would rapidly rethink what medical ethics requires of doctors. Surely it would not be beyond the pale to argue that a doctor is not only ethically in the clear to not tell you that you had this form of cancer, but in fact might have a moral obligation <i>not</i> to tell you.<p>This is exactly the position some people believe that economists are in vis-à-vis markets. Markets are basically dumb amalgamations of human choices and sometimes react to information pathologically. According to the argument, certain people have an obligation to project confidence in the market if that will lead to better outcomes, even if logically the market should start ignoring you if it expects that you&#x27;d lie.<p>I don&#x27;t know whether I buy the argument or not, but it&#x27;s certainly not stupid!')
