(The public television was deeply inspired by the bbc).<p>But here they solved it by a much easier way.<p>* once you got married, you were automatically assumed to have a TV set.<p>* any tv that was sold were reported to the communication ministry.<p>* a car owner would pay by default. Assumption was all cars would have and use a radio.<p>* to show you don’t have a TV set or it’s not receiving any over-the-air broadcasts you were suppose to wait for random check ups. Once finally someone came, they can decide if you don’t need to pay.<p>But the most interesting story any Israeli know is the “mehikon” (Eraser in Hebrew) and its counterpart (anti-mehikon).<p>Back in the days, the countrie’s manifest at least was socialism. It wasn’t “fair” someone would have a color tv while others can’t. So the communication ministry required the broadcasters to wipe colors.
