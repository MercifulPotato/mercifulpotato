Based on other comments on this thread, I was strongly tempted to switch from Spotify to Tidal (mostly because Tidal apparently pays the artist more fairly and they’re not trying to appropriate podcasts). I had also just verified that Tidal support Last.FM scrobbling and that I can use my Squeezebox devices to stream music from Tidal. I was just about to investigate how I might export my Spotify list of artists and albums.<p>However, as a supporter of open, non-proprietary standards, promoting MQA would really put me off.  I don’t have time for “audiophile” nonsense and hadn’t heard of MQA until now but it seems like another attempt at building a walled-garden for rent-seeking opportunities [1].  MQA is not something I want to support and while I don’t know if it’s a complete deal-breaker with respect to Tidal, I won’t be switching today.<p>Thanks for the info.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linn.co.uk&#x2F;blog&#x2F;mqa-is-bad-for-music" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linn.co.uk&#x2F;blog&#x2F;mqa-is-bad-for-music</a>')
