Item(by='confluence_perf', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609621775, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25616500, text='&quot;High variance as a consequence of poor software&quot; is an interesting point and not one I&#x27;d considered -&gt; I will take this to engineering and see if we can do anything about that (some components maybe, but we see high network variances too which seem unlikely to be fixable).<p>Showing that we&#x27;re making progress isn&#x27;t as much of a problem - similar to what you stated, the fixes themselves target large enough value that it&#x27;s measurable at volume for sure, and even in testing.<p>The main issue is &quot;degradations&quot; -&gt; catching any check-ins that can degrade performance.  These are usually small individually (lets say, low double digit MS) within the variance noise), but add up over time, and by the time the degradation is really measurable, its complicated tracking down the root cause.  Hopefully I described that in a way that makes sense?<p>Any suggestions welcome.')
