If you select &quot;Future Founder&quot;, you won&#x27;t be asked to complete a company profile. If you accidentally selected the wrong track, you can update your selection at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.startupschool.org&#x2F;track" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.startupschool.org&#x2F;track</a> . Hope that makes sense!<p>EDIT: to those still running into issues here, the workarounds others have posted (fill out dummy company data, then go to &quot;Choose a Track&quot; and switch to &quot;Future Founders&quot; track) seem to work. Still trying to find the root cause here.<p>EDIT2: This should be resolved now for everyone.')
