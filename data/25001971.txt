Item(by='adrianmonk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604610317, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25001008, text='Some people can, but there are people who can&#x27;t use a bank account. There are a surprising number of people who can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t.<p>One reason is that banks will refuse to open an account for people whose records show past behavior they don&#x27;t like (bouncing checks, overdrawing accounts, leaving fees unpaid, etc.).<p>Some other people could open a bank account but have practical reasons not to. For example, identity theft. Someone drained all your accounts, but you still have a good-paying job. If you open another account, maybe they will drain that one too? Maybe not a good risk to take when you&#x27;re trying to stabilize your situation.<p>Another example, probably more common, is poor people who have court judgments against them from people they owe money to. You have medical debt, or you got evicted and owe back rent, or you messed up withholding and you owe the IRS back taxes. You might be living so close to the brink that your monthly income is $1500 and you need $1499 to survive. The court lets the creditor garnish money from your account, so one day you check the balance and find $500 gone, and you can&#x27;t pay your rent or buy gas to drive to work. So you prevent that scenario by dealing entirely in cash and not opening an account.')
