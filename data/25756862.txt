It&#x27;s either &quot;you allow all speech or it&#x27;s immoral&quot;<p>I disagree with this argument not because I disagree with your conclusion, but because the issue is much, much darker.<p>It&#x27;s not that folks are claiming &quot;you must allow all speech,&quot; it&#x27;s that they&#x27;re saying &quot;your free speech rights aren&#x27;t as important as mine.  As such, you should be <i>forced</i> to host&#x2F;amplify <i>my</i> speech even if you don&#x27;t want to do so.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not advocating for free speech, that&#x27;s demanding that some folks&#x27; free speech rights be limited in favor of those of others.<p>And that&#x27;s not only wrong, it&#x27;s hypocritical and <i>morally reprehensible</i>.')
