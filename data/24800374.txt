Item(by='enragedcacti', descendants=None, kids=[24800406, 24800669], score=None, time=1602853234, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24800301, text='That is what I thought initially, but you do get a 120hz screen  and 64GB more storage for $200 with the pro 11&quot;. If you want 256GB then it&#x27;s only a $150 difference for the better screen. If you need 128GB but not 256GB then it is $50 since Apple doesn&#x27;t sell a 128GB iPad Air (probably to leave room for the Pro 11&quot;). It isn&#x27;t a great deal but if I were in the market for an iPad I think I would go for the pro just for the fluidity, especially since either should last for years and years.')
