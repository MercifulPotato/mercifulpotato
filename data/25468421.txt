I&#x27;m the CEO of FusionAuth and we&#x27;ve been working on our product for 6 years now. I can attest to the complexity and challenges that exist in this industry. Our belief is that no one should be building auth anymore.<p>You should connect with Mike over at Gluu. He&#x27;s a great guy and very supportive of the industry as a whole. I&#x27;m also happy to connect with you all as well.<p>Steer clear of Auth0, OneLogin and the others. They don&#x27;t play fair and I&#x27;m positive you&#x27;ll be receiving your first cease and desist letters in the coming weeks. We have stacks of them and their claims are always total BS. But you don&#x27;t want to go to battle with a company that has $300M in the bank.<p>Congrats on the launch!')
