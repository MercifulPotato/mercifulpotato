Just so it appears to the app that you&#x27;ve given the permission, when you in fact have not. This would solve this entire class of problems and then some. So, for example:<p>- App &quot;has&quot; access to contacts, but the system returns that you have none.<p>- App &quot;has&quot; access to location, but the search for GPS satellites never completes.<p>- App &quot;has&quot; access to storage, but it&#x27;s actually &#x2F;dev&#x2F;null.')
