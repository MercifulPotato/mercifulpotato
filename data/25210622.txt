I totally agree with you on that.<p>If only GPT-3 was for sh*ts and giggles I&#x27;d be with you.

AI researchers are staking major claim on all these amazing things GPT-3 can and will do.<p>So pardon me if I&#x27;m non-plussed about all these wacky and crazy things we can do with the largest neural network ever trained.<p>Maybe after all it&#x27;s a billion-dollar Madlib.
