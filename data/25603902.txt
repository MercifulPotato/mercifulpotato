And with relatively simple moddifications offers 90%+ efficient pumped hydro storage capabilities.<p>The downsides are the large ecological impacts noted in the BBC article, sedimentation (a particularly large problem on the silt-heavy Colorado River), as well as some risk of structural failure, though the US record on this is generally quite good.<p>With many thousands of dams, there&#x27;ve been a handful of major failures.  Planning, alerts, and response generally eliminate of minimise deaths, though disruption from evacuations, or property damage can still be substantial.  Long-term consequences spanning centuries, as with nuclear failures, are not a factor, even in utterly catastrophic failures, largely experienced outside the US.<p>I&#x27;m not defending the Klamath hydro facilities, only noting factors.<p>Your obsevation that there are both benefits <i>and</i> negative impacts is true of any technology or technological intervention.')
