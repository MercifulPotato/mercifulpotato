An imperfect rule of thumb is that the more granular the lesson, the less useful it is to the future.<p>I would say that suprisingly lots of history is relevant today because all history is revisonist history. Historians look at past people and situations through today&#x27;s lenses and bringing up what resonates with todays problems and dilemas. Also the human nature isn&#x27;t changeable so political and social and personal dilemas of ancient Athens, Rome or China can resonate with us. It only requires a good author to show us past events in new, interesting light.')
