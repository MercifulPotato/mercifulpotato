I’m very skeptical of the claim that these programs are comprised mostly of the independently wealthy.<p>&gt; Majority of students go for practically sounding degrees - like various business related degrees. They tend to learn to like them somewhat, but generally are not intrinsically motivated to be accountants or what not at first. They are not making childhood passion based decisions, but the &quot;what gets me job&quot; decisions.<p>I welcome some evidence here. I’m very skeptical.')
