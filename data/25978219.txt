Not the institutions.\nBitcoin fees often exceed $10 per transaction. Nano has no fees, and never will.<p>* Bitcoin transactions take an average of 10-60 minutes. Nano transactions take 0.2 seconds.<p>* Bitcoin transactions use ~741 kWh of electricity each. Nano transactions use 0.000112 kWh.<p>* Bitcoin can&#x27;t scale past 7 tps. Nano&#x27;s tps is uncapped and limited only by hardware.<p>* Bitcoin miners will inflate its supply until the year 2140. Nano is fully distributed.<p>Bitcoin is not the inevitable long-term &quot;winner&quot; of cryptocurrencies. Its technological limitations and disastrous environmental impact would create an incredibly bleak future for the everyday person. There is a clear alternative to Bitcoin, and they don&#x27;t know it exists: Nano.<p>The rumor that Nano is being suppressed by crypto miners and Bitcoin maximalists has been around for a very long time, and it makes sense. Nano works ridiculously well, and is there to eat the cake of all the miners who are raking in millions a day. BTC maxis and miners hate the word Nano, and have a strong incentive to literally pay to have it disappear from the face of the earth. Bitcoin influences on Twitter have muted the word Nano because they know their thesis is fucked when it gets mentioned.<p>Github ref: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;nanocurrency\nWebsite ref: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nano.org&#x2F;\nlinkedin: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;company&#x2F;nano-foundation&#x2F;')
