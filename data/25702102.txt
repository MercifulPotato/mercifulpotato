I’m imagining some fantasy where I could wear lightweight AR sunglasses and use gestures and&#x2F;or voice control and somehow be able to do everything I do with my desktop. I’m not sure it’s realistic even ten years from now, but I’m also not sure this kind of setup is out of reach either. I use standing &amp; treadmill desks on and off. They’re good for taking care of my body, but take effort to use consistently, and have some tradeoffs.')
