Regular people are feeling it, and health care workers are not immune to it.<p>Having said that, I&#x27;ve been going to a hospital twice a week for the past few months for allergy shots, and everyone is strictly masked and distanced. Two examples of strictness details: nurses will open and close doors for me so I don&#x27;t have to touch them. And once they had me take an allergy medication before getting my shot, and the nurse actually left the room while I had my mask off taking the pill.<p>Having said <i>that</i>, I go running in my neighborhood, usually through part of the campus of a (different) hospital. I regularly see people in scrubs with hospital IDs walking to the parking lot (within a few feet of me if I didn&#x27;t avoid them) with their masks pulled down off their faces.<p>So seems there&#x27;s quite a bit of variation.')
