You&#x27;ve invested 13+ years into a career and if you aren&#x27;t financially independent and don&#x27;t have a backup job then you do still need to pay bills, right?<p>For an interesting perspective on another career - there is a YT channel called the handyman.  He talks a lot about how he isn&#x27;t choosing the light fixture to install and has opinions on it but is just getting paid, decently, to install it.<p>Maybe contracting is more for you at this time.  Get paid to come in and code stuff, solve problems and go home.  Move onto the next job.  Maybe you&#x27;ll discover some idea along the way that could be kindle into your own project.')
