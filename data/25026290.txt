I&#x27;ve seen several articles and interviews now where the leftists can&#x27;t believe that someone can hold a different view than theirs and vote for Trump. It&#x27;s as if only they hold the absolute truth, and everyone else is the manifestation of evil. It&#x27;s quite ridiculous.<p>We haven&#x27;t seen any protests or destruction by the right after Biden won. Had Trump won, we&#x27;d seen wide spread chaos and looting and burning. It&#x27;s not for nothing that many stores in large cities boarded up.<p>What they&#x27;re doing by keeping these lists is not that different from the Nazis keeping lists of Jews. Very ironic.')
