These social media platforms have a significant effect on the beliefs and values of their users. Divisive, outraging content drives engagement. This leads to the curation of echo chambers that work to continually galvanize and outrage users.<p>I have made the choice not to use social media, but a large majority of Americans do. Since we live in a democracy, this gives companies like Twitter and Facebook a non-trivial amount of control over elections and legislation.<p>I don&#x27;t think this can be ignored with the quip &quot;just don&#x27;t use the platforms&quot;. These platforms have the ability to form public opinion, and that is a problem for democracy that we as a society need to solve.')
