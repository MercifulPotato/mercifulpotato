Go ahead and demonstrate that Signal Protocol has received sufficient attention from motivated hackers to your satisfaction. Telegram has an open invitation to crack their protocol for 100k USD. Nobody&#x27;s collecting. I guess those high-value targets using Telegram must be worth more than 100k.<p>I don&#x27;t need to demonstrate anything other than what I have already: when would we know a protocol has received significant attention from motivated hackers? I&#x27;ll take a gander and say it&#x27;s when that protocol is <i>broken</i> and is discovered by a security researcher or someone on the crisis response team.<p>I&#x27;m not claiming MTProto 2 is secure. Neither am I claiming Signal Protocol is secure. Undoubtedly both protocols have undiscovered vulnerabilities. I am directly refuting and admonishing a user for linking to a Stack Exchange comment that addresses a previous protocol with almost nothing in common to the present one.')
