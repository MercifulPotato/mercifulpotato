I&#x27;m old too and I confused the conversation by hauling out my rusty trusty grinding axe about some miscreants I encountered along the way.<p>In general though I do think we diffuse the term &#x27;research&#x27; a bit in this case by applying it to a very broad spectrum of actions and motivations.  As a result I think we lose some of the nuances of incentive that emerge at opposite ends of that spectrum.  I mean we do call them &#x27;bug bounties&#x27; afterall and we don&#x27;t call Duane Chapman &#x27;Dog the Fugitive Reseacher&#x27;. :)')
