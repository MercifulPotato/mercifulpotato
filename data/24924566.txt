If you throw a bottle into the television, are you effectively convinced that you have just disrupted the broadcast signal or do you entertain the possibility that you have simply messed up enough the proxy by which you were registering the signal? This is not woo. This is intellectual honesty. You seem skeptic and rational judging by what you write. Go all the way. We simply don&#x27;t know that brain causes consciousness. We just don&#x27;t, and I&#x27;m the first not happy about the possibility that it may not be the case, but I must accept rationally that there&#x27;s all kind of holes in the brain-causes-consciousness narrative. By that account, for instance, every reduction in brain activity should correspond to a reduction of consciousness. Well, this is not the case, see for instance Carhart-Harris et al 2012, 2016 and many others more recently. Moreover, NDEs reports demonstrate enormous level of conscious experience in the absence of any brain activity. There&#x27;s no space where to fit this empirical evidences in the causal framework.<p>Moreover, to believe in the fairy tale of physicalism implies accepting that the building blocks of such worldview (fundamental particles) pop up into existence out of thin air, that the universe is made mostly of &quot;dark energy&quot;, and that experiential properties &quot;emerge&quot; from unconscious matter... is this the kind of woo you were referring to when you mentioned damaged reasoning ability?')
