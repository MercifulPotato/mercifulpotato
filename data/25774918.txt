Item(by='pasabagi', descendants=None, kids=[25776375], score=None, time=1610622016, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25774373, text='I think alcohol works better as a counter-argument. In Germany, it is not only legal, but it is also legal to sell in &#x27;bubblegum flavour party boxes&#x27;, obviously aimed at children. It is legal to sell at checkout, so after a recovering alcoholic is tired out by all the shopping they can be tempted by a little bottle of vodka or whatever.<p>Despite this, and a social culture that revolves around drinking, the vast majority manage to avoid serious alcohol problems.<p>This essentially shows how responsible people are - even with a culture that makes it very easy to start, and very difficult to quit, most people manage to maintain a reasonable distance from an extremely addictive drug.<p>If you follow this argument along, I think if you legalized drugs, but also put some restrictions on their use (for instance, not allowing supermarkets to sell them, not allowing child-branded stuff, etc) - there&#x27;s no reason to imagine the situation would not improve vis-a-vis the current one.<p>All this said, my preferred drug policy (for all drugs, including alcohol) would be something like a ban on their public use and sale. As somebody who used to take a lot of drugs, I have no illusions about the destabilizing influence they can have on people&#x27;s lives. Alcohol is well known for being a force multiplier for pre-existing misery or mental instabillity, and I think even mild drugs, like weed, work in the same way.')
