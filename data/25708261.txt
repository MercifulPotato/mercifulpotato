Customers are essentially paying for usage of a company&#x27;s services and don&#x27;t actually own anything besides their own code and IP. If <i>company</i> decides it&#x27;s worth it to them to remove <i>customer</i>, then they will do that. Companies have no reason to care what their customers do, as long as it doesn&#x27;t adversely effect the company (see also: Apple clamping down on companies avoiding the 30% revenue cut).<p>I think what will be interesting to watch is how the government responds with legislation&#x2F;mandates.<p>Will the government require they can ask for people be removed as customers from certain companies? Or require companies share data about customers with the government? Or give the government a backdoor API?<p>In the name of using it for good, in some ways it makes sense. Then, how does one trust the government to only use the tools for good - and who judges what &quot;good&quot; is?<p>If a 17 year old gets the keys to a Ferrari to only drive to school at 35mph, can they be trusted with that responsibility?')
