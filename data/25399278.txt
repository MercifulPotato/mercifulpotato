(I recently lost access to my PayPal account due to them having a wrong phone number - and I can&#x27;t login to correct it, nor have any contact for support.) I&#x27;d love to remove PayPal as a dependency, and pay DO directly from a bank - but not give them permanent permission to withdraw from it.<p>It&#x27;s a clear dark pattern that GCP&#x2F;AWS does not provide a simple way to prevent such unexpectedly huge bills.')
