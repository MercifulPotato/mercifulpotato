But what if you import a package with a new type? You have to recompile the function for parameters of that type or can&#x27;t use it. Or if a function has 3 parameters and there are, say, 20 different types. That&#x27;s a lot of combinations, compiling them all would be wasteful.<p>(I don&#x27;t know how Julia handles these things internally so I might be wrong.)')
