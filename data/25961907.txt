Assuredly once the shorters get a hold of a share of stock, they&#x27;re not gonna let it go because they need it to cover their position.<p>So what they do instead is to sell the stock to each other at super-low volumes in order to try to drive the price down, using their brokerage advantages to make it so the shares don&#x27;t reach the open market. This is a ladder attack and it&#x27;s responsible for every last one of the dips on the market. They wait until late in the day when people aren&#x27;t really paying attention. They can sell to each other but that doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s a lot of float. Don&#x27;t let that fool you, there isn&#x27;t.<p>It&#x27;s not in the interest of the shorters to buy up all the shares that come on the market. That&#x27;s effectively covering their position. It&#x27;ll drive up the price massively. They want to get lots of people scared into selling so there&#x27;s lots of float. Then they can manipulate the price down using media shills or whatever and then snap them all up at a bargain rate and use them to cover their positions. If it&#x27;s not cheap then any collective buying will drive the price up tremendously, what&#x27;s called the infinity squeeze.<p>You need a DISTINCT share in order to cover your position. One you own. That&#x27;s the contract. They have to deliver it to the market maker which they took up the short position with. The market maker will then put that share back on the open market. If you want to deliver another stock, you need to buy it back from the market maker, at full market value, and deliver it back to the market maker. You can&#x27;t just conjure up a share in order to cover with. High trade volume !== high float. It has to be an actual, honest-to-God share. If not you just defaulted to someone with way bigger pockets than you have.<p>There just aren&#x27;t a lot of shares available. Volume can be incredibly high, as it was over the last few days, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s a lot of float. The vast majority of shares are in the hands of people with no interest in floating them. The trade volume that&#x27;s happening right now is the same shares changing hands with people who are just now discovering the action. The shorters will do anything to liquidate the massive amount of shares being held by the degenerates, but they took their stock certificates and buried them in the desert.')
