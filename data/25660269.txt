Nothing has been debunked. What we do know is IQ is heritable AND China has people with High IQ. Whether IQ is inherited for chinas case or whether IQ is a good quantitative measure for intelligence is not formally established but the parent-parent poster does not make an unrealistic proposition. I may get voted down on this but shame on people who voted this up for supporting a social ideal over the cold hard truth. Nothing has been debunked.<p>Genetics control how we look physically across all races, there is no black magic that suddenly makes every race equal in intelligence and behavior while only controlling for physical differences. Uphold your social ideals but donâ€™t let your ideals blind you from the cold hard truth.')
