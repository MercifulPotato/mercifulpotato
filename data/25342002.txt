I disagree strongly with one of his positions (I don&#x27;t think we should be opening schools while the rest of us are locked down), but I too find it very, very encouraging to have a public official obviously using his brain and being honest about the fact that nobody really knows the right answer.<p>And especially in the context about the use of power, the acknowledgement that imposing a lockdown doesn&#x27;t <i>actually</i> necessarily change people&#x27;s behavior all that much is a really good point.  We&#x27;ve definitely seen that there are some that will intentionally do the opposite if they feel their freedoms are being impinged upon, so if it&#x27;s not going to actually make an improvement, the gesture could be a huge mistake.')
