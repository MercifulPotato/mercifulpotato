When you add a friend you are looking them up in this tree and then storing their public key chain in your own (private) storage in a tofu manner (then any key changes they make are verified against your local copy).<p>You can also verify keys in person using the same protocol as Signal (via QR codes or number groups).<p>There are no private keys stored on any devices, so adding devices is not a thing. It is a pure capability based system.<p>Unlike keybase, we are fully open source and self-hostable.<p>There are a lot more details in our booklet- <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;book.peergos.org" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;book.peergos.org</a>')
