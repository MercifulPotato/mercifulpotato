It&#x27;s like saying that it&#x27;s really about potential resisting arrest.<p>The premise of money laundering is that you&#x27;re a criminal engaged in some kind of profitable criminal enterprise and it should be illegal for you to hide the source of your ill-gotten gains. But nothing about the laws against money laundering require them to apply only to someone engaged in underlying criminal activity, so people who are doing nothing wrong regularly end up ensnared in them regardless.<p>And they&#x27;re a massive invasion of privacy, because they in practice require you to have all of your purchases tracked. As if it&#x27;s Mastercard&#x27;s business whether you buy birth control, or what books you read, or who you split your restaurant bill with.<p>Meanwhile anyone engaged in the actually-bad money laundering is doing so because of some criminal activity that they were already subject to prosecution for. You don&#x27;t need laws against money laundering to go after a drug dealer because you can already charge them with drug dealing.<p>So in practice what they actually get used for is things like this -- oppression of political undesirables, who need privacy because they&#x27;re politically vulnerable and then get booted out of the financial system over it, even if they&#x27;re breaking no other laws.')
