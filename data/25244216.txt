If every app was a free app and the apps offered in app purchases without involving apple&#x27;s payment system then Apple would get nothing. The rules and mandatory cuts have to exist to ensure the continued existence of the App Store.<p>The alternative to an App store with a 30% cut on everything is a store without free apps and a complete ban of in app purchases.<p>I personally have never understood the selfish HN user arguments against any particular cut because if you followed those arguments through they would want Apple to give them a negative cut because they only care about themselves with no single though about the consequences of their wishes.')
