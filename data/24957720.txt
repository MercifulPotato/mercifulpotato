I thought maybe it was when the ball &quot;joined&quot; with a player but it does it when its in motion too. That is just completely broken.<p>I can see a pattern.  It helps if you think strictly in terms of what visual feature a ball and a bald head have in common:  a crescent of glare against the sun.<p>* The ball is obscured by legs, shadow, or a player&#x27;s body (this appears to be majority of the occurrences to me) - this one seems to trigger even if it&#x27;s only out of view for a fraction of a second<p>* The high kick at 2:07 is similar to the above, except it&#x27;s the glare from the sun instead of shadow that obscures the ball (ambient brightness matches the crescent instead of the umbra on the ball)<p>* Most of the rest I can&#x27;t even find the ball myself, I think it might be too small in the far end of the field to register clearly')
