You can join any union that will have you, and there are several big &#x27;general&#x27; unions. But most employers will only recognise a single union (if that) per group of workers.<p>So, if you&#x27;re an academic like me, you can join the University and College Union, and there will be a local organisation, probably a collective bargaining agreement with the university, and so on. Or join a different union and get no local representation and only &#x27;central office&#x27; services. There are some places with multiple recognition (when I worked in local government Unison, GMB and the T&amp;G were all recognised, with membership strengths in different parts of the council) but it&#x27;s often just one. And that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re lucky: many employers recognise no unions.<p>Of course, the UK also doesn&#x27;t have the closed shop (union membership is strictly optional) so there is a competition between member and not-member that keeps some pressure on the union organisation. And each European country has its own traditions of union organisation and different working cultures, so this probably doesn&#x27;t extend outside of Britain.')
