All major email providers have spam&#x2F;unsubscribe buttons already and I don&#x27;t want to risk forwarding emails to someone else to reveal even more data.<p>If this was more like a global unsubscribe service that removed me from all major email lists somehow, or helped with other privacy&#x2F;data cleanup then it might be worth a one-time fee.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25013979" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25013979</a>')
