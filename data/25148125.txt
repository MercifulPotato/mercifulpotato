The media in the US has an extreme centrist position on most issues, leaning to the right on foreign policy and immigration (with no exceptions), but to the left on social issues (with notable exceptions such as Fox News).<p>I stand by my characterization of Breitbart though - they absolutely knowingly lie about facts. I would also add that you know that your political view is extreme far right when you start calling The Economist &quot;left-leaning&quot;.<p>And I don&#x27;t think that journalism, especially in the mainstream, has ever been more than an opinion &amp; public relations (propaganda) piece. News organizations are usually owned by rich owners and financed by rich corporations through ads, and so can&#x27;t stray too far from the mainstream capitalist right-wing&#x2F;centrist view on most issues of consequence for their sponsors. It happens that lately, corporate America and the rich have generally become much more open on social issues, so you see that reflected in the press.<p>But you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find a mainstream journal or news organization that shares the left&#x27;s more extreme beliefs on economic issues (e.g. pro unionization, shorter work week), and extremely hard pressed to find any news organization that is against armed support for Israel, that is against the coup attempt in Venezuela, that is against US support for Saudi Arabia, that is for US nuclear disarmament, that is against escalation of the conflict with Russia etc.<p>Note: if you want to see left-leaning media, look at The Jacobin for example - you&#x27;ll probably be shocked at how vastly they differ from the NYT.
