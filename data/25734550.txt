You can correct misinformation without breaking the site guidelines. Plenty of HN users do that respectfully and patiently, without attacking anybody. Moreover your corrections will be more effective that way, so it&#x27;s in your interest to do so.<p>What you can&#x27;t do is destroy this community by tossing bombs of snark, flamebait, name-calling, etc., at the side you consider wrong and bad. That is something completely different, and is what we warn or ban accounts for doing.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=%22always%20feels%22%20by:dang&amp;dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;sort=byDate&amp;type=comment" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.algolia.com&#x2F;?query=%22always%20feels%22%20by:dang...</a>')
