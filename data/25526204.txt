The main facts might be correct, however the presentation and interpretations implied seem disingenuous.<p>The Google representative from the story is woman, but a white one, which makes her a bit more evil than if she was any other color obviously. The other Google woman there is a colored one and is presumed innocent without proof in the text. Now I might be wrong and the poster might know things that she is not sharing. Or this is just an emotionally manipulative story. At least, she learns about the plagiarism in 2018, but at the end of the thread she says that she felt betrayed for the last four years. Final touch is how she leaves the discussion and pushes the &quot;mom mode&quot; just in case that we&#x27;ve forgotten.<p>One of the reasons I don&#x27;t like Twitter is how declarative it is with people stating their shit as universal truths, and no space for argumentation, construction of proofs, and nuance.')
