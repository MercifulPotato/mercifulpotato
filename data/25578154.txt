For example, in most European countries, levels of violence are very low, and the likelihood&#x2F;desire for an average person to own a weapon is also low (aside from hunters&#x2F;the Swiss). Compare this to the US where violence is comparatively more common and gun ownership is high.<p>Do Europeans consume large amounts of violent media? As a European, I can tell you the answer is yes. I don&#x27;t know how much compared to the US, but I basically grew up on violent video games and I have a large number of friends who love horror films that depict far, far worse than anything in a game I ever played. I suspect the media we consume is pretty similar to the media in the US. And yet, less violence. So, an obvious hypothesis is that the tendency to enact violence comes from elsewhere in culture than media.<p>The best suggestion I&#x27;ve come across is from Pinker&#x27;s History of Violence book. He suggests that levels of violence correlate with an &quot;honor culture&quot; - as in, godfather style &quot;you disrespected my mother now I gotta kill your brother&quot;, to varying degrees. In the US, especially ex-confederate states, an honor culture still persists, while in Europe and northern US states we have progessed to a &quot;law and order&quot; culture with correspondingly lower levels of violence. If you&#x27;re interested in this topic, I highly recommend reading the book. It gives a much better description of this topic than I can here, and once you&#x27;ve spent some time thinking about it, hopefully, you&#x27;ll come to recognize that blaming media for violence is shallow thinking. Communities and culture cause violence, or prevent it. Media is just fantasy.')
