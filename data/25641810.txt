The major difference would be that individuals could choose how they wished to determine which doctors they wished to use[1].<p>To give an example, many people who wish to become doctors are required to go through a residency program that features elements such as required 24 hours shifts. Personally, I would be quite fine seeing a doctor who wasn&#x27;t required to do such shenanigans. As it stands right now, I can&#x27;t make that choice, because various special interest groups have gained a government-granted monopoly on the certification of physicians.<p>[1] One objection would be that, if we didn&#x27;t have the force of law (which is the force of violence) keeping &quot;quacks&quot; from practising medicine, then many people, particularly the poor, would actually have &#x2F;less&#x2F; choice. This is a utilitarian argument, but even if the premise of utilitarianism is granted, this still seems incorrect due to two factors. First, regulatory capture has led to a system that already can prevent poor people from accessing care. No care is probably worse that mediocre care. Second, the U.S. (as a nation) spend more money than other developed nations on healthcare and gets similar outcomes. This seems to indicate that a lower cost of care wouldn&#x27;t necessarily cause a sudden influx of quacks onto the market.')
