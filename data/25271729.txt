My lab does plant root growth modeling, which (like protein folding) is a 3D morphology prediction problem. Tweaking crops for even a small increase in carbon uptake and sequestration in soil (e.g., via deeper or longer roots) may be able to cut a sizeable chunk out of annual CO2 emissions[0], but almost nobody&#x27;s working on it because it doesn&#x27;t have direct applications to human healthcare.<p>[0]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;nature17174" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;nature17174</a>')
