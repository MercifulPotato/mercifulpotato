Xor is the first one and it sounds like you didn&#x27;t solve it. (fwiw I haven&#x27;t figured it out yet either)<p>1. It does only save one solution for each level but if you can do it in fewer nands, why do you need to keep the fewest components? Most puzzle games like this work this way<p>2. In later levels it uses your best solution from previous levels. The basic (non-optimal) xor solution has 3 compents with 6 nand. The first time I did half-adder, it told me my solution was 2 components&#x2F;8 nand (a 2-nand AND plus a 6-nand XOR). After trying for optimal xor again (and failing), solving half-adder shows &quot;2 components used. Mission XOR is not completed, so the total number of gates could not be counted.&quot; So it uses YOUR best solutions.<p>3. I mean it&#x27;s pretty obvious. optimal == fewest nand, simplest == fewest components. If you optimize for nands, your solution is going to be less simple&#x2F;more complicated.<p>I think it&#x27;s a really great game. You should give it another try')
