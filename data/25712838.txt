Often they even are bored or lack a &quot;sense of purpose&quot; and community (social connections are the rarer the older we get). Wikipedia adds all that. If Wikipedia would tech-ipo as the likes of WeWork, it would probably be &quot;The Purpose Company&quot;. Thank you.<p>I&#x27;m from Germany (2nd biggest Wikipedia) and proud to say 50%+ of my school and university education would not have been possible with excellent articles in BOTH english and german language. Often the english one was great, but the german one better (think WWII topics, german cars, ...) and vice versa (most of the cases hehe). And: it might be a good pointer for learning a language as well, reading about stuff you deeply care about.')
