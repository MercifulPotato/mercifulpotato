This way, you can have low earners earn as much as they would have after switching to higher paying job in your “retire early when you have Enough”, but you’d have both high and low earner continue working, so more total value would be produced.<p>In this better alternative why would high earners continue to earn high when they can just switch to become a low earner and eat the tax from the remaining high earners.')
