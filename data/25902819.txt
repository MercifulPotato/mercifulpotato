I feel that in the netherlands, if you really want to make a change, you have to form a (one issue) party and convince people.<p>The impact of a single active voter is not big, and especially in a country where there is limited passive voting, e.g, a 2 party country like the US, it is hard to impact a change.<p>In this sense, US democracy is broken compared to the Netherlands, as there is very little room for passive voting other than being part of a large existing party.')
