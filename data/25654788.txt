Item(by='monocasa', descendants=None, kids=[25655019], score=None, time=1609909153, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25653033, text='&gt; This is all a noble goal, but I can&#x27;t see this as being anything other than a complete and total non-starter with zero cooperation from Apple.<p>I think marcan has proven he has the chops for pieces like that.  The ps4 linux port had him reverse engineering the ISA for the custom risc cores that are some of the deepest firmware of a pretty modern AMD GPU.  Like even the open source drivers just treat this stuff as blobs and moves on with their life, but he had to port a fix over and showed off more publicly than anyone else had.<p>This Apple stuff is for sure more work, but it all seems within his wheelhouse.  Hence the patreon I think, attacking the size of the problem with some funding to make it more viable than a side project.')
