For the rest of the world prices are much lower, even in developed countries (the average EU car price is about $35k: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;425095&#x2F;eu-car-sales-average-prices-in-by-country&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;425095&#x2F;eu-car-sales-aver...</a>). And let&#x27;s not get started with developing countries, where it&#x27;s a lot more likely that the price is around $15k.<p>On top of that, a lot of people buy used cars. Even in the rich US, used car sales dwarf sales of new cars: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;183713&#x2F;value-of-us-passenger-cas-sales-and-leases-since-1990&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;183713&#x2F;value-of-us-passe...</a><p>And as cars are a quickly depreciating asset, used cars are much cheaper on average:<p>&gt; In 2019, the average selling price of used vehicles came to around 21,000 U.S. dollars<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;274928&#x2F;used-vehicle-average-selling-price-in-the-united-states&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.statista.com&#x2F;statistics&#x2F;274928&#x2F;used-vehicle-aver...</a><p>This is what EVs are fighting against. Not just against other new cars, but against used cars too.<p>Plus personally I&#x27;ve rarely convinced anyone to buy anything with TCO calculations. Maybe you&#x27;ve had more luck :-)<p>I think EVs are still a few years ago from real mass adoption. 2025 sounds a bit more realistic. I&#x27;d say that the second gen ones are the ones that will make it through (Tesla Model 3 2027 facelift, or whatever they&#x27;ll call it, ID3&#x2F;ID4 2028 facelift, etc.). Those will probably have access to well developed super charging networks and to 90-100k MWh batteries at a 25% lower price.')
