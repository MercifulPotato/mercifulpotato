The Nexus drivetrain with belt drive is fantastic for casual cycling.<p>This? Let me quote the directions for the most common bike maintenance issueâ€”A flat tire.<p>&gt; &quot;The rear wheel is removed from rear-facing dropouts. Remove both left and right side covers. Remove brake arm fixing bolts and washers. Loosen axle nut. Note orientation of the non-turn washer. This washer is used to prevent the axle from rotating in the dropout.<p>&gt; &quot;Disengage the cable from the bell crank unit. Depress the adjusting rod and pull cable end from lever. Pull lever away from axle and remove adjusting rod. Use a 15mm wrench to loosen and remove axle nut.<p>&gt; &quot;Remove bell crank unit and cover fixing stay bracket. Disengage chain from chainring and pull wheel back and out of dropouts.&quot;<p>Compared to on a bike with a Nexus drive train:<p>- Release the quick release.<p>- Pull the tire out and disengage the chain.<p>This is not simpler. Traditional bikes are already fairly simple.')
