It was won, like you said. Yet there&#x27;s a new generation of tech-minded people, even here, who are not Joe Averages and who don&#x27;t acknowledge the matter is settled, who disregard the old arguments, and who will argue walled gardens and locked down hardware are good things. Surely you&#x27;ve seen this too. It&#x27;s really disheartening, and probably part of the general phenomenon of younger generations unwilling to learn and understand old battles and hard-won rights.')
