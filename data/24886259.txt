Item(by='the_af', descendants=None, kids=[24899790], score=None, time=1603633925, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24883177, text='&gt; <i>The argument in favour of Free Software was won, philosophically, a while ago.</i><p>This is what depresses me. It <i>was</i> won, like you said -- yet there&#x27;s a new generation of tech-minded people, even here (or on stackoverflow, reddit and many other places), who are not Joe Averages and who don&#x27;t acknowledge the matter is settled, who disregard the old arguments, and who will argue walled gardens and locked down hardware are good things. Surely you&#x27;ve seen this too. It&#x27;s really disheartening, and probably part of the wider phenomenon of younger generations unwilling to learn and understand old battles and hard-won rights and lessons.<p>To be clear: I don&#x27;t mind people not knowing about the history of computing. Nobody is born knowing. But actively arguing for less freedom, freedom that was once part of hacker culture -- that hurts.')
