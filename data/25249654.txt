At best, it provides some momentary entertainment. This can be easily replaced by any number of free sources. Mostly it provides negative value in the form of stressing people out about things they have little control over.<p>In the aggregate, the news does provide value to society (theoretically) by informing the populace about things the government and large corporations are doing. But this value is not immediately useful to an individual.<p>My own proposal is that the news should have a time-limited paywall. Say, pay to have the news as soon as it&#x27;s available, then after a day or a week make it freely available to anyone. If knowing about a political scandal or corporate merger is actually important to the day-to-day business of your life, you will probably pay to have access to that information asap. If not, you can learn about it later with plenty of time for it to still inform your voting or consumer decisions.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiltingatwindmills.dev&#x2F;lets-fix-the-news&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tiltingatwindmills.dev&#x2F;lets-fix-the-news&#x2F;</a>')
