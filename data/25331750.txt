It&#x27;s also lower power consumption for the same compute, which means a smaller&#x2F;lighter battery, or longer runtime at the same weight.<p>This is not a privacy-vs-convenience battle, sadly; this is a very carefully planned circumstance where you can maintain privacy, or you can be effective in life.  It&#x27;s already impossible to use most mobiles in a private fashion, and within a few years, effective desktop computing will be exactly the same way.  You&#x27;re going to have to provide ID to do <i>anything</i> with a &quot;normal&quot; phone or computer.<p>Recently I learned that Apple will only give out NetworkExtension API entitlements for apps (that are required for VPN apps to work on macOS) to apps distributed via the Mac App Store.  Aside from the obvious antitrust issues here (you can&#x27;t self-distribute VPN apps, or run a competing app store that can distribute apps with the same functionality as Apple&#x27;s), this means that you can&#x27;t get access to e.g. the WireGuard app on macOS without IDing yourself to Apple to get an Apple ID and installing it via the Mac App Store.<p>Want privacy via a VPN?
