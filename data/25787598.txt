Basically the same functionality of [api, web gui, etc] that everyone has except, files need to be requested and may take some time to become hot&#x2F;available to the user. It&#x27;s really just because I think it&#x27;s silly that the only reason I pay $100+&#x2F;year to my provider is because I have some archived videos&#x2F;photos that put me over their free limit. I never touch those files but don&#x27;t want get rid of them either (I realize I could store myself but them I&#x27;m the one responsible if they get lost :))')
