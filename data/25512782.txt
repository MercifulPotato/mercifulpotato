The EV displays are calibrated. It&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going to get on your high end monitor when you get home. Eyes do not work like camera sensors, so I don&#x27;t see how this is a plus. White balance being a great example.<p>&gt; the true dynamic range,<p>How can your eye tell you this though? Unless your&#x27;e doing HDR&#x2F;exposure stacking, dynamic range from the perspective of the sensor is all you&#x27;re going to get. With the EV, you get clipping&#x2F;black indicators, and even a histogram. I&#x27;m never wondering if I&#x27;m going to blow out the sky or crush some details in shadows anymore. I can see if I am, without having to snap then preview.<p>&gt; the ability to see to edges of the focal plane with greater clarity.<p>I don&#x27;t understand this at all. The new EVs give you 100% crop (with some slightly reduced zoom so it fits), with complete clarity edge to edge.<p>I would suggest giving a new high end EV another try.')
