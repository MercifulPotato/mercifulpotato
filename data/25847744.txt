It&#x27;s one of the earliest; and fortunately others leared from its mistakes.  Including the US itself, when it had considerable influence in drafting the WW2 losers constitutions, which uncoincidentally are quite different from the US.<p>Checks and balances essentially don&#x27;t work in the US.  The best bit is simply a decent judiciary, but that was mostly copied from the British. And even that is more poorly executed than elsewhere, due to the political nature of judicial appointees, and esp. due to the tradition of direct elections of some judges.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s arguably worse than the British model it was copied from, not because the Brits were psychic geniuses, but because of the not entirely unrelated fact that the UK model is much more open to reform; it&#x27;s aged better because it&#x27;s less crufty. When lead by a dangerously populist government that might be risk, of course, but so far even populists have turned out not to do too much consitutional harm - might differ in the future.<p>It&#x27;s more like: the US constitution was grand it its aims, but pretty v1.0 in its execution.  It&#x27;s full of unintentional (or at least unfortunate) indirect effects that didn&#x27;t work out too well; such as that congress is likely to deadlock; that the constitution isn&#x27;t sufficiently amendable; that its form of democracy is subject to unproportional divergence as state population sizes diverge, that by contrast adding new states is way too easy, that elections at all are in no way shape or form necessarily fair (and I don&#x27;t there there has ever been a particularly free&amp;fair election in the states) due to gerrymandering, state size disparities, imbalanced voting registration requirements, and lack of constitutional protections for elections in general; the presence of systematic biased introduced by winner-takes-all approaches; the lack of a checks on the presidency (clearly not intentional, but impeachment is a purely hypothetical check).  I&#x27;m sure actual scholars could name a bunch more. Then theres the more general flaws in legal republics, such as that there no systematic mechanism for reform; laws just accumlate leaving extremely outdated wordings on the books forever, and with ever increasingly large rulebooks.<p>Seriously, name 1 check&#x2F;balance that&#x27;s actually particularly good!  (I mean, I guess there by sheer scope might be one... but I can&#x27;t think of one anyhow).')
