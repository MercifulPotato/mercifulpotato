A lot of people have things going on in their lives that make it impossible to concentrate on this sort of thing.<p>- You need to be close enough, background wise. No prereqs -&gt; can&#x27;t learn this subject.<p>- You need to be aware of where the low hanging fruit is. This might be some random comment by a lecturer or a line in a paper that makes you investigate something.<p>- You need access to resources. Anything from a sparring partner to a hadron collider might be needed.<p>- Timing. Bunch of stuff coming together, might happen 10 years before you or 10 years after.<p>So there&#x27;s reasons why undergrads don&#x27;t always come up with groundbreaking things. Not to worry. You can still try to understand stuff after someone else has found it.')
