Then, any function that is super hot, they&#x27;ll see if it&#x27;s being ran consistently (ie always receives two numbers as its arguments).  Then they&#x27;ll make a streamlined interpretation of the js code which only checks the arguments and then skips pretty much all the other checks.  By doing this, it makes JS significantly faster.<p>If you&#x27;re trying to compare and contrast v8 to quickjs, this is the first thing that comes to mind for me as to what they may be doing differently.')
