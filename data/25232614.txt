When do you think US embassies will start issuing L1 visas (I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s next to impossible to receive them right now).<p>2. Is it possible for a company to apply for an employment-based greencard (EB3) for an employee that is based out of the USA? How does the timeline look for those (when is the moment where it&#x27;s the absolute necessity to arrive in the USA)?')
