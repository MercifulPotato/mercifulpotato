Item(by='ptero', descendants=None, kids=[24865197], score=None, time=1603387382, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24860021, text='Your counter-claim of 2-3M US deaths from COVID is questionable. This is 0.7-1.0% of total population. Sweden, which had no forced quarantines and for which the ministry of health web site explicitly recommends <i>not</i> wearing a mask for people with no symptoms, has effectively zero COVID deaths from late July (from Wikipedia; deaths per week show a classic curve for an infectious disease). No second waves that are starting to hit other countries. Sweden&#x27;s total COVID deaths are reported as a bit  under 6000 as of today -- less than 0.06% and well under the 0.7-1.0% you estimate.<p>This does <i>not</i> mean that the total estimates of 2-3M for the US are proven wrong. But it is a strong counterargument to that estimate that should be addressed if we base our response on the estimate of 2-3M of COVID deaths with no strict measures. My 2c.<p>I will also push back on your &quot;compliment&quot; to me of not meeting the high standards of HN (you note you are being charitable; I wonder what the &quot;objective&quot; characterization). You lecture me to re-read my post and think about my mistakes (at least that is how I understood it; if I understood it wrongly, sorry). I did re-read it and still see my questions as valid. If the answers to them are obvious, great; but this does not make asking them unethical. Sorry for this rant, I will take the downvotes for it if they come.')
