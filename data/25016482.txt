Castes in the vedas were just a division of labour <i>not</i> social castes as they are now. The current caste system is a bastardisation that happened over thousands of years similar to nobility etc in the west. It was then maximised during India&#x27;s occupation by the Mughals and then British who used it to drive divisions (which we deserved, because serious fuck the caste system).<p>Don&#x27;t taint our scriptures by what is going on now.')
