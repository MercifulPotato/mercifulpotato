Having worked two years, I&#x27;ve absolutely found i hate working under people in an office environment. I&#x27;ve hopped across three companies, I&#x27;m growing miserable and finding I dont enjoy this whole CRUD MVC business logic type of work. I&#x27;m tired of fixing leaking pipes in mediocre code bases by people who aren&#x27;t passionate about what they do. I also find app development to be plain uninspiring and am constantly biting my tongue.<p>I want to develop a JS interpreter, a simple game engine, or even an app of my own interests. Can these sort of projects lead to more distinguished roles? Or do I just have to work my way up for the next 20 years under bland government contractors and health insurance companies?<p>This is not what I wanted in life. Do most people lie when asked if they like their job? People keep telling me to do what I live because bigger salaries aren&#x27;t as important. That just doesn&#x27;t seem realistic.')
