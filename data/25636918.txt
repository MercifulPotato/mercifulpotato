Call it a bubble after it crashes, not before.<p>Well, Saylor just made a billion dollars on his convictions (seems like a bad economic outcome to me). The future could prove the bears right but so far the present says they&#x27;re dead wrong.<p>One of the funniest things to me is that very few mainstream economists could articulate the value proposition and missed out on the absurd gains of the last 10 years although assessing the value of something like this is exactly what they claim their advanced degrees should give them an advantage in doing. If they truly had a deeper understanding   they wouldn&#x27;t be writing angry rants because the missed the train.<p>The awesome thing about markets is that they separate the talkers from the doers, so go write another editorial if it makes you feel better. A bunch of kids in their 20&#x27;s have made more money than this author will make in his whole life because they called it better than this &quot;expert&quot;')
