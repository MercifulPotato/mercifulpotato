The fundamental problem I have with them is that they don&#x27;t actually meet the simple, transparent standards I set out for <i>meaningful</i> democratic representation.<p><i>National governments pick the members of the European Commision, so if you&#x27;re not happy with your European Commission representative, take it up with your national government.</i><p>How, specifically, should someone do that in practice? Does someone cast an anonymous vote to indicate their preference? Will some robust system then make an objective determination of the outcome based on the popular vote? This is how the people customarily determine their representatives in a representative democracy.<p>In reality, the number of levels of indirection between you or me as ordinary people who vote in elections and Ursula von der Leyen as the most powerful person in the EU government removes any meaningful requirement for her to either achieve a popular mandate before taking office or accept any meaningful personal accountability for her performance while in office.<p>And more generally, European Commissioner is <i>infamous</i> for being a role you give a national politician who is still in favour with the leadership but perhaps has lost popular support. Just look at the past roles of the people who get nominated to these positions by their respective governments. There&#x27;s an incredible number of <i>ex</i>-representatives, and often not ex- by choice but because the electorate chose not to re-elect them.<p><i>The European Parliament obviously does.</i><p>Not in my country. While it operates a PR system, it&#x27;s a party list, so again at a minimum it fails my personal accountability criterion. The only way for the people to remove a particular individual they don&#x27;t like from power is, in this case, to remove everyone from that individual&#x27;s party from power in that electoral region.<p>In fact, this is the same basic problem with many of the situations we&#x27;ve been discussing here. You can in theory indirectly influence which individual holds power. The catch is that your only way to remove them is some sort of nuclear option. Don&#x27;t like your nation&#x27;s choice for European Commissioner? No problem, just elect a different entire national government at the last election. Don&#x27;t like the UK&#x27;s current PM? No problem, just make sure no-one votes for any MPs in that person&#x27;s party at the last election. Don&#x27;t like the current European Commission President? Sorry, I can&#x27;t help you much with that one because hardly anyone (including hundreds of MEPs, by the way) actually knows how she got the job.<p><i>The whole point of have a representatives is that they have the time and resources to educate themselves on the minutiae of state, and make better decisions than the general public. Not because they&#x27;re smarter or better, but because they&#x27;re better informed.</i><p>Again, so the theory goes. But as someone who has interacted with various MPs personally, and through them also with senior figures in government on a few occasions, I can promise you that it is a work of fiction in practice.<p>Just look at the nonsense MPs on both sides of the Brexit debate were shouting from the rooftops before the referendum. Or for something a little less inflammatory, try the arguments they&#x27;ve made about regulating business and technology, including in the EU measures we&#x27;re discussing here and the roughly analogous UK plans also announced today. Those weren&#x27;t the arguments of well-informed experts who have studied the issues and drawn rational conclusions. In many cases, they weren&#x27;t even the arguments of a moderately well-informed member of the general public. And they were statements not just from elected representatives but often from senior government figures!<p>The truth is that there is absolutely nothing about our current system of government that requires our MPs to be qualified to make or capable of making better decisions than members of the public who are well-informed about and personally interested in any particular issue. Even those who are intelligent and trying to do a good job, as I&#x27;m sure many MPs actually are despite all the negative press they get, can&#x27;t possibly become experts on everything and don&#x27;t have the resources to staff it out. And even on issues they do choose to prioritise, unless they are members of the party in power and take a government position with all the strings that are attached to doing so, their power to influence policy is often very limited even when acting in quite large groups.<p>And the same is true of most other elected representatives and political appointments, whether in the UK or EU. This isn&#x27;t about Brexit, or about being pro- or anti-EU, if that even means anything anyway. It&#x27;s a problem with systems of government operating at national and international levels where those in power are so well insulated from the voting public that they don&#x27;t require a popular mandate and aren&#x27;t required to be accountable to the people for whom they supposedly act. That&#x27;s not democracy, at least not in any meaningful sense of the word.')
