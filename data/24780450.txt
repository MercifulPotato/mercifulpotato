Some questions I would love to see answered:<p>How do you raise money in stealth mode? (not saying that stealth mode is good, but it&#x27;s crazy that people raise large sums of money before having a public facing product).<p>How do you get in front of VCs who haven&#x27;t heard of you yet? This seems a bit easier in a Series A round as your investors can talk to your seed investors and there&#x27;s probably a crunchbase page of your company.<p>How do you give your business a valuation before it&#x27;s launched? I&#x27;ve been struggling a lot with this one, I&#x27;ve ran through the TAM&#x2F;SAM&#x2F;SOM but honestly feels like a shot in the dark still.')
