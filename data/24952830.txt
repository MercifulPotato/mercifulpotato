French court ruling a as far as I understand are very technocratic. You just must paragraphs applied to reach verdict.<p>At least here in Norway there tends to be a strong emphasis on laws being readable by the common people so regular people better know their rights.<p>E.g. we read consumer laws in high school and that was easy. Older laws are written in a very lawyer like Danish form. But there is continuous effort to simplify law texts.<p>While I do have an affinity for rigorous definitions I think this could make the law text less accessible to common people.<p>Also based upon what I know of the US system, it would not work as t he Us system is strongly based on past rulings rather than paragraphs. That makes a formalized approach much harder.')
