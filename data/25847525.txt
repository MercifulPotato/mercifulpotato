There is no documentation on how that GPU works and Apple hasn&#x27;t released any.<p>Making any modern GPU work is a lot of work because of how complicated they are. That&#x27;s even with the full documentation.<p>In the Apple M1 case, the GPU will have to be reverse engineered to understand how it works, then a driver will need to be written for Linux that supports it.')
