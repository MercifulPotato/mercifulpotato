What it actually cost the hospital was significantly less. Several orders of magnitude less I&#x27;d wager.<p>The fact that the insurer was able to negotiate a payment of ~36% (less than half the original price) and the hospital <i>still</i> had enough margin to be profitable should be telling.<p>&gt; <i>I&#x27;m not a fan of this system but it works. Isn&#x27;t the US the #1 medical care quality country?</i><p>No. Not even remotely. It&#x27;s 36th in the world as ranked by WHO. It is, however, ranked #1 in the world for the <i>most expensive</i> healthcare system. And by some margin too. I don&#x27;t consider that a placement to be proud about either.')
