This is very interesting.<p>This seems to take into account number of children and adults working in the family.Minimum wage doesn&#x27;t take that into account.<p>Not sure if it would be possible to make employers pay different minimum wage based on number of children and working adults in a employees family. So I think this the idea behind paying living wage, pay based on employee&#x27;s circumstances.')
