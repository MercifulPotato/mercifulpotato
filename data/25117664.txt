Item(by='tedyoung', descendants=None, kids=[25120342], score=None, time=1605564517, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25115664, text='&gt; Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is the concept that prioritizes business concepts over other types of classification in your codebase (like grouping by file type).<p>Well, no, it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s true that DDD-based architectures (like Hexagonal or Ports &amp; Adapters) do provide guidance on code organization (I teach courses on this), but to say that code organization is DDD is misleading at best.<p>As others have said, DDD is so much more than that, and I&#x27;d summarize DDD as making Domain Concepts and Behavior primary, instead of the Data (and databases) being the focus.')
