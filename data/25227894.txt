When i tried this back in 2011 with the GPIO pins on a Linksys WRT54G, the three biggest challenges were:<p><pre><code>    1. Securing the device - which in practice meant all my hardware had to be mounted inside the property of the back of the front door\n    2. power supply - i battled with voltage sag due to the crap thin wires i used and the long run from the plug socket\n    3. The video resolution was terrible, to the point of not being useful at all\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s interesting to me that in almost 10 years, only #3 is really &quot;solved&quot;. 2 is arguably solved given the cheap high capacity lithium batteries available.<p>My attempt back in 2011:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postimg.cc&#x2F;hfhyWGXZ" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postimg.cc&#x2F;hfhyWGXZ</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postimg.cc&#x2F;R6Rs961y" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;postimg.cc&#x2F;R6Rs961y</a><p>Linksys WRT54G, I broke out the GPIO pins to service a microswitch on the letterbox and the doorbell button. A cheap USB &quot;spy cam&quot; from ebay with a resolution of around 20px x 20px. It looked horrendous despite my best efforts to mount it neatly.<p>OpenCV existed at the time but wasn&#x27;t available on this platform. Instead i read from &#x2F;dev&#x2F;video, converted the image to greyscale, then comparing pixel by pixel the luminosity vs. the previous saved file. If the cumulative value crosses a certain +ve or -ve threshold it treats it as motion detected - which turned out a terrible approach in practice :-)')
