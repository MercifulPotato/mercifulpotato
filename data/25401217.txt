I have fast, but unreliable internet that drops connection few times an hour and Safari and Firefox are almost unusable - when connection drops for just a few seconds they cannot open many websites for up to 5 minutes (reddit, google and youtube among many others; hacker news is one of the few that work all the time).<p>Chromium based browsers do not have that issue, I used to use Vivaldi but temporarily switched to Safari as I wait for ARM build of Vivaldi and I am constantly frustrated by that issue.<p>I have tried debugging it but got nowhere, it seems to be system wide issue as some 3rd party apps exhibit this behaviour too (for example live streaming through IINA or Skype) while others not (Electron based apps usually work fine). Recently switched to new M1 Macbook and it happens on it too.')
