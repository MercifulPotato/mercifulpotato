As much as I&#x27;d love to see someone apply ultrasonic haptics to an interesting use case, I don&#x27;t know if useful haptic feedback can occur within the limits of safe ultrasonic SPLs.<p>Even with relatively large arrays, the prototypes I&#x27;ve seen are so subtle that you almost have to be expecting the sensation to get anything out of it. It&#x27;s not on the same level as the haptic feedback of an Apple trackpad.')
