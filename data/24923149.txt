Essentially, for every transaction you make you have to determine if you made a profit or a loss with your crypto. The purchase date of the crypto you&#x27;re converting into USD matters because you need that for short-term vs long-term capital gains. This problem also gets worse if you buy crypto at regular intervals, like I often do, because now you have different gain&#x2F;loss potentials in the same transaction.<p>Sure, a program can calculate this for you, but it does make filing more complicated. You&#x27;ll probably have a very long list of items on your 1099.')
