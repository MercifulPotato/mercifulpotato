I&#x27;ve heard a number of stories to that effect, and the one time it happened to me they had a bot that charged my card every time customer service issued a refund (at the time, you had to go through customer service to get a refund without a return). It took four additional attempts before they were able to actually keep the automated system from issuing additional charges.')
