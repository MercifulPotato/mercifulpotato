In fact, I think this kind of &quot;we couldn&#x27;t have known what would happen&quot; is IMHO revisionism.<p>The truth is that, while everything about economic depression, the political instability of the system, the KPD and SPD being unable to cooperate, etc., were important factors, it remains true that a large segment of the German population were totally OK with ideas of German imperialism, revanchism and anti-semitism, otherwise Hitler&#x27;s rise to power would never had happened.')
