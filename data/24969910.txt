I can show you why there are good reasons to doubt the programmer&#x27;s ability to reason about a large program in light of computational complexity results accumulated in the last twenty years (and you are simply wrong about the bearings of model checking to the situation), but instead of trying to argue over hypotheticals, I&#x27;m merely pointing out that the ability you believe exists has never, to the best of my knowledge, actually been realised in a scalable, repeatable, affordable way in the field. If you claim you could achieve it, please try.<p>&gt; And I have been for over a decade.<p>What <i>exactly</i> have you done for over a decade?<p>I am quite familiar with predicate transformers, but the distance between using Hoare logic and the like on code units -- which is relatively easy and pretty widely done (e.g. with SPARK) -- and formally (which means mechanically checkable, even if it is human directed) deriving a large program from a specification is gargantuan. Proving&#x2F;deriving code units from contracts and the like <i>is not</i> the problem I&#x27;m talking about. Neither Dijkstra nor anyone else has come remotely close to achieving it, and achieving it is a guaranteed Turing award.')
