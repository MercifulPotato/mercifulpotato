Not quite as fancy but it does an amazing job. I&#x27;ve been using cheap matte photo paper for the few color documents I need and that works pretty well. It uses far less ink than I expected. It&#x27;s cheaper to run than the terrible Epson photo printer it replaced.<p>Not cheap to acquire though.')
