Most of the arguments against private companies banning companies&#x2F;individuals violating their ToS boil down to something along the lines of &quot;this is a slippery slope, we&#x27;re on our way to tyranny&quot;.  But all European countries have limits on free speech and the vast majority are free countries, so all of these arguments are demonstrably false.  We don&#x27;t even have to look to other countries for examples, there has been censorship of various kinds at various times in the US since its founding, and yet there was no inevitable slide to Orwellian tyranny after each instance.  The problem is that Americans are far too paranoidâ€”every little thing is perceived an existential threat to you people.')
