But chemistry still works fine here? When you fall into a black hole, you accelerate until you&#x27;re moving away from the rest of the universe faster than light, but all your atoms are still (relatively, assuming the black hole is large enough to have negligible tidal forces) stationary relative to each other. The event horizon is just the point where your speed <i>relative to the effectively-distant[0] outside universe</i> exceeds the speed of light. Any signal you emit can&#x27;t be moving facter than c relative to <i>you</i>, so it will always be moving <i>away</i> from the outside universe (v&lt;-c implies v+v&#x27;&lt;0).<p>0: &quot;Nothing can move facter than c&quot; refers to relative motion of objects <i>near</i> each other, which is why the Hubble expansion of the universe doesn&#x27;t contradict that either.')
