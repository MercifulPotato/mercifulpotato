After a week I went back to the doctor, and he was reluctant to put me on anti-biotics incase it was viral, and also he was generally anti-anti-biotics if your immune system could do it on its own. So he had me do a 3 day fast. Only water, and once a day a small bottle of Gatorade. Day 1 was easy, day 2 was hard, day 3 was actually easy again. On day 4, I was told to reintroduce food slowly and to eat as close to unprocessed foods as possible, so I had a bowl of watermelon for breakfast, a cup of oatmeal for lunch, then for dinner... McDonalds.<p>The outcome was the bug did die, but I no idea if it was from the fasting or just that it had been 10 days. But the fasting wasn&#x27;t that hard, and I felt better afterward.')
