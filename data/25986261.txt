For example, constitution (created by military) gives military control of 25% legislature seats, president, and courts. The military doesn’t answer to any civilian authority. Civilian government can’t reform constitution or appoint critical positions without military approval.<p>Almost everyone in Burma hates military and understands that civilian government can’t do everything they want.<p>Yet all the international coverage seems ignorant of these facts, condemning ASSK for things she doesn’t control, like military operations in Rhakine against Rohingya. They don’t understand that the reason she defended military at UN is only outcome of not defending them would be sanctions which just further harms civilian government and people. She had no choice.<p>People here in Burma are still confused as to motivation for coup, since military already had best of both worlds: ultimate power of law and courts, and no sanctions because of farcical democracy. Why they would risk sanctions to do this is a mystery.')
