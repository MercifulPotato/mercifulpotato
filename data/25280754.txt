(super sick of calling Comcast every year when they double my rate so they can lock me into another contract)<p>They sent a 4G LTE modem. I&#x27;m getting 5-24 Mbps down, 10-40Mbps up, and 40-60ms ping. It varies quite a bit and, surprisingly, upload is consistently much faster than download. You need to experiment where to put the modem -- 8 feet can make a 10Mpbs difference.<p>The bandwidth seems acceptable for my in-the-sticks area but the latency is noticeable on conference calls. Not sure I&#x27;ll keep it.')
