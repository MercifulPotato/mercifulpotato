Who is the person or official that Yelp is bribing?<p>It&#x27;s not Grubhub, since Grubhub doesn&#x27;t really have any authority to guide purchases through their systems.<p>In fact, if anything, it&#x27;s yelp which surreptitiously can guide purchases through more expensive (for the restaurant) services. But I don&#x27;t think this is extortion either: Yelp is not forcing the customers to use them, nor the restaurant to use them. If one really pushes, I think that Yelp might yield and delist your business (which would be bad, but in a different way), and they anyhow aren&#x27;t asking you for money for an extortion. They&#x27;re (together with grubhub) &quot;simply&quot; asking the business money for an (unwelcome) service they provide.<p>(also, you&#x27;d probably have to sue Jeremy Stoppelman, and not Yelp if you really want to make a RICO claim)<p>Yelp is surely scummy, but I think that if people want to press charges, they should be for more run-of-the-mill fraud claims.')
