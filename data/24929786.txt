Like the way you just said the same thing 3 times in a row.\n   B) The less you <i>say</i> the less someone has to argue with. The opposite is also true\n   C) Stick to main points and save gory details for later, unless you&#x27;re in the &quot;Gory Details&quot; section already.<p>2) Read your writing out loud. What looks great on the page might sound terrible aloud. If it sounds terrible aloud, then it&#x27;ll be awkward for others to read, too.<p>3) Just write. Get the words onto the page. This is the hardest but most important thing. Don&#x27;t pay attention to form, redundancy, spelling, grammar, or redundancy. Just get the words down. These so-called brain dumps will help you get expressive. Then you can edit the heck out of yourself as mentioned in 1 and 2.<p>4) Okay, a fourth. No matter what you write, read Steven King&#x27;s &quot;On Writing&quot; to find out what it means to &quot;kill your darlings&quot;. Epic book.')
