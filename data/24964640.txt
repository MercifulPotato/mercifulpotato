Mine would probably include:<p>- Civilization (the original). I can literally remember waking up at noon and just starting to play the game and then looking up and it was dark outside;<p>- Zork<p>- Prince of Persia (the original); and<p>- ... Bandit Kings of Ancient China<p>I literally had 20+ hour playing sessions of BKoAC. Like I even played this multiplayer (hot chair). I can remember getting to the point where me and my friend had split the map pretty much and he decided to attack me. I basically held a defensive line along a river and used magic to break the offensive line. It was one of my earlier experience with tactics.<p>I have such fond memories of that game.')
