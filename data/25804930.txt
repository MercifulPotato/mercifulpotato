Your output may feel great to someone else, but you may not feel excited about it personally. (and there may be no conflict, or fakery of praise in it) Perhaps based on how perfectionist you are, or based on what you like about the work. You might be excited&#x2F;motivated by different aspects of your work than your manager.<p>To me it would come down to whether I think other person is praising my work just to get more of it done just for the praise (I&#x27;d have negative reaction), or whether he just likes it that much personally (neutral to mildly positive reaction).')
