Item(by='rndmize', descendants=None, kids=[25338568, 25338739], score=None, time=1607379411, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25338074, text='&gt; why are bicycles nonexistant on post-apocalyptic stories?<p>Couple reasons by my guess:\n* Bikes aren&#x27;t cool. Cars are cool, horses are cool. Bikes, trikes, scooters, etc., aren&#x27;t cool, and don&#x27;t provide much besides efficiency. \n* Terrain - as you say, roads are an issue and require maintenance. Trees drop some branches on the road? A car could push it (maybe), horse could walk over it, while a bike has to be carried. Not much fun, and probably makes up for the efficiency you get from riding it. \n* Carrying stuff. Hauling things in a car? Easy. Horse? Easy. Bike? Hope you have a backpack, and you&#x27;re probably still capped at ~40 pounds. And the more weight you have, the worse a time you&#x27;ll have on rough terrain or falling.')
