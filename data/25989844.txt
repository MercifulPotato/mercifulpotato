Get away from the infrastructure as a whole so you can focus on code, and let the cloud providers wave their magic wand to enable scaling?<p>If you&#x27;re saying now the story is: well rely on them to auto scale, until they don&#x27;t - then why would I bother?  Now you&#x27;re telling me I need to go back to having infrastructure experts, which means I can save TON of money by going with a hosting provider that allows allocation of resources via API (which is basically all of them).')
