I tend to do TDD when I develop code and run test suites in CI. I&#x27;d rather like something that can orchestrate in a development environment half way competently.<p>I find it hard to believe that docker-compose thinks that &quot;start database, wait for port to be available and then start web server, then wait for port 8080 to be available and then kick off tests&quot; is a workflow that ought to require a hacky bash script and a lecture about the importance of resilience. It&#x27;s a pretty straightforward feature to implement.<p>I haven&#x27;t used swarm but I can only imagine how bad that is.')
