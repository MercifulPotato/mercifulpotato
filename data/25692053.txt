I bike it out-and-back every day.  To argue it&#x27;s leaving your &quot;local area&quot; is absurd.  To back that assertion with fines is incomprehensible.  To send a pack of police officers to issue those fines is a wanton abuse of power.<p>Glad the BBC wrote an article about it.  Fuck the Derbyshire Police.')
