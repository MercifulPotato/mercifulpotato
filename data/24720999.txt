Item(by='xenocyon', descendants=None, kids=[24721905, 24721451], score=None, time=1602175835, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24720431, text='The visual&#x2F;marketing focus on so-called &quot;Damascus&quot; steel is almost ridiculous:<p>I own a &quot;Damascus&quot; knife. Like many well-designed modern knives, it uses a core of hard steel in the middle (VG-10 in my case) clad between two layers of soft steel. This is a very good design, enabling one to always have a hard steel for the cutting edge while also having the durability of soft steel from the bulk of the knife matter.<p>Now a moment&#x27;s thought shows that the &quot;Damascus&quot; part - which is on the outer cladding layers - has absolutely nothing to do with the cutting edge, and is therefore entirely superfluous from a functionality standpoint :)')
