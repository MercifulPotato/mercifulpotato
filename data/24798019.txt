In a kid-oriented venue, it&#x27;s inappropriate. In a recovering alcoholics group it&#x27;s harmful&#x2F;malicious. In a tech forum, it&#x27;s low value.<p>If you went to a school, an AA meeting, or a tech conference and talked about beer overbearingly, you&#x27;d be asked to leave the venue, and that would be their right.<p>As onerous as it is to have legitimate, authentic speech banned from a popular platform, the alternative of allowing all speech effectively creates a worthless noise chamber dominated by bad actors.')
