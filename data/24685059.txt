They&#x27;re not the cheapest, but they have good sound quality.<p>If I were going to go for a wifi speaker, though, I&#x27;d seriously look at Bluesound&#x27;s product line. They&#x27;re a Sonos competitor and they&#x27;re not nearly as well known, but they&#x27;re part of the same little group that owns NAD Electronics and PSB Speakers and use amplifiers and acoustics from those sister companies. If you&#x27;re an audio nerd (or even if you&#x27;re not), that&#x27;s a pretty good pedigree. AFAIK Bluesound products <i>work</i> with various voice assistants, but don&#x27;t build them in.<p>(Edited to add: I don&#x27;t own a Bluesound device, but I do own a NAD T758 receiver, which uses an earlier version of BluOS for its streaming&#x2F;wifi capabilities and it&#x27;s pretty solid.)')
