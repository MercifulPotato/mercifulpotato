Item(by='monkeydreams', descendants=None, kids=[24939557], score=None, time=1604024995, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24933348, text='&gt; Glenn had a 3 hour long conversation on a podcast a few days ago where he laid out the problem really well:<p>....<p>&gt; The reporting around this story has been absolutely unbelievable to me<p>OK, here&#x27;s the thing though. This is what I call the &quot;Jordan Peterson school of thought.&quot;<p>You begin with a premise. Hunter Biden left his laptop at a repair store, some files were found on it, and these were delivered to a Republican Party muck-raker (and that is the most neutral thing you can say about Giuliani).<p>But, before you examine the premise, you are invited to look at the implications. If this is true then Hunter Biden has traded on his father&#x27;s name! If this is true then Hunter Biden has gotten involved with some shady characters in Ukraine! If this is true, why hasn&#x27;t Joe Biden ever recused himself from his dealings with these self-same shady characters?! And the biggest thing... why isn&#x27;t the Main Stream Media (MSM) doing something about this? What do they have to hide?!<p>In short, you are set a premise, you are required to accept the truth of this premise, then you are pulled on an emotional journey about where the premise leads you...<p>But the premise is garbage. In Jordan Peterson&#x27;s case, the US military is not the same in terms of complexity as real life, for instance. In this case, the Hunter Biden forgot his laptop story does not appear to hold water. You would have to assume a range of additional entities for it to make sense.<p>The reason the media are not reporting on this is because they want evidence that Hunter owned that laptop and that it is, as the US Intelligence community already pointed out, likely Russian interference. (No additional entities assumed here, since their intention to disrupt the US election is well documented, videoed and demonstrated).<p>Why this story is gaining so much traction on HN is beyond me. I am sure that Biden does not have the pearly white hands of a saint, nor is Trump as evil as he is sometimes painted, but I need you to pay the coin of logic before you expect me to invest in your emotional stock.')
