Either they just assume that their phone number is their &quot;account&quot; or in some cases make no distinction between the app and their account. They installed the app so where did their data go?<p>This is especially pronounced now that application sync between devices is more or less universal on iOS and (to a lesser extent) Android.<p>To the layman, the intuitive perspective is that it &quot;just works&quot; and is exactly how they left it previously, regardless of whether they have wiped their phone or replaced it. This isn&#x27;t a dig at tech illiterate people but it is just how things are for the normal person. Hell I have been almost burned by this in the past when I moved phones and a certain app(FGO)&#x27;s data didn&#x27;t transfer over.<p>TLDR The most intuitive thing is working out of the box and seamlessly transferring to a new device. The easiest way to do this is to allow it to be bound to a user&#x27;s Google account, Microsoft account, and Apple ID.')
