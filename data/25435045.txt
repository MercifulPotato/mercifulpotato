Combined with 1993&#x27;s interest rates (~7%) $300k was quite steep.<p>Today the same engineer at a FAANG would make about $300k. Houses are about $2M and interest rates are about 2%, so relatively speaking things are cheaper. However, unlike in 1993, today&#x27;s salaries are unlikely to grow by 10x over the next 30 years while the mortgage is paid off!')
