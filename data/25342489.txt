I tend to get really excited about it as it looks like a private by default system that supports smart contracts (including calling L1 in some cases), inherits Ethereum&#x27;s security, and is interoperable with DeFi and Ethereum&#x27;s ecosystem.\nIt sounds fairly perfect for us cypherpunks but I just know there&#x27;s some blemish that I&#x27;m missing. If there&#x27;s not then it makes me very hopeful for our future.')
