If you use Code First and Code Migrations, you don&#x27;t have access (without getting out of Code First entirely!) to creating Views; and in EF 6 at least, creating indexes was a chore as well.  I believe this has been fixed in EF Core; but regardless the mainpoint still stands: The APIs are different and what is natively available is different. At some point doing &quot;Code First&quot;, you&#x27;ll still need to write raw SQL, and that&#x27;s unexpected if you are planning on doing your work in C# only.<p>Regarding Dependency Injection: It&#x27;s very much suited towards enterprise web applications; and its failure mode is trying to get DI to work seamlessly in a non-web application sense (C# is a general language; and .NET supports console, GUI, and web applications) and once you get out of the we application thread-per-request pipeline, you find yourself hitting rough patches.')
