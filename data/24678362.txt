You can call for the destruction of the left as much as you want over there but don&#x27;t dare say anything against the Blairites, that&#x27;s another bannable offense. Not sufficiently sucking up to the mods, also a ban.<p>&gt;r&#x2F;Labour is mainly frequented by supporters of the Labour Party and not by people who are praying for Labour to lose so they can replace Corbyn.')
