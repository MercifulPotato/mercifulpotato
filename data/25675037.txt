When you take away people&#x27;s ability to be heard, debate, and participate in democracy, people feel they have nothing to lose. Recent events are the consequence.<p>This is absolute bullshit and you should be ashamed of yourself for suggesting it.  This event was not a response to censorship, it was a response to an subset of the population being fed a steady diet of outrage and misinformation and then putting on your surprised pikachu face when they get upset that their candidate lost an election.  These people had the ability to be heard and debate and participate, they just are not willing to accept the consequences of that participation or to acknowledge that their candidate lost.')
