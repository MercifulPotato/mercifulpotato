In fact, that piece of cloth helps hide your identity on surveillance. That <i>increases</i> your freedom.<p>There is absolutely no downside to wearing a mask.<p>If a mask does work, it can help slow the spread of viruses.<p>Masks are effective at helping an infected wearer reduce spread to others. This is not exotic science, this is not a “party line,” it is accepted and, frankly, obvious scientific observation. Respiratory pandemics are not new and masks have been used to combat them since at least a hundred years ago.<p>Even the recent study cited by the parent comment of yours admits that masks are still effective at preventing transmission <i>from an infected person to others</i>. Sure, they aren’t effective at protecting the wearer. That was never the intention.<p>If they are even single digit percentage more effective than not wearing one, why not just wear it? Heck, they keep your face warm in the winter.')
