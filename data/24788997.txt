Create a new account, watch any political video, and then click through the suggestions.  Keep clicking through the suggestions and in hour you will be on some extremist nonsense.<p>YouTube is the source of this problem, and their solution is censorship?  It&#x27;s ridiculous.  Show people the videos they have subscribed or searched for, and that&#x27;s it.  The majority of people don&#x27;t search out extremist content, they find it through suggestions and related videos.<p>Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube (Google) are the ones who have created these problems.  They profit from this crap when people mindlessly flick through the suggestions.  They profit when tweets, FB posts, or videos generate discussion and clicks.  They profit when bots post content that actual humans click on and discuss.  They have created these problems to pad their pockets.  And now their &quot;solution&quot; to it is mass censorship.<p>What an outrage.  These companies need to be absolutely shattered into tiny little pieces.')
