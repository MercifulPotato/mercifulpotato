The fact that a lot of these PRs might originate in India is only relevant insofar as there are a lot of people willing to hustle, and don’t have much open source experience. Chances are that they are oblivious to what happens on the other side of the table, and open source projects are abstract entities (which might as well be run by Github, or some other bureaucracy!) A useful reminder that the celebrated “hustle” is susceptible to the unintended consequences of Goodhart’s law.<p>If this was Sean Parker with Napster or Zuck with early Facebook, we’d be celebrating it.<p>(For all those who advocate for growth hacking techniques, or annoying ads, this is exactly how scummy most such techniques &#x2F; dark patterns feel to users. I don’t think that is geographically localized in any way.)')
