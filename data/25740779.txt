Once we&#x27;ve identified exactly what genes influence transgenderism, and genetic editing of our embryos is commonplace for the populace, no one is going to allow their children to be born with a predilection for being transgender. You&#x27;d be literally putting your child at an enormous disadvantage for no discernable reason.<p>Look how long its taken for gay people to be accepted by society. Not decades, but centuries. Transgender people don&#x27;t have that long. In a century, we&#x27;ll be editing genetically superior superbabies. No parents in their right mind would give their children such a tremendous disadvantage in life when they could make them &quot;normal&quot;. I suspect gay people will probably go extinct too, but one never knows with 100% certainty how these things play out.<p>I suspect a great many classes of people &#x2F; traits will go extinct. Down&#x27;s Syndrome babies will certainly be screened out of the population, because again... in a society of beautiful 200 IQ super athletes, why would you deliberately hinder your child?')
