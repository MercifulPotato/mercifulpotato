Taking a position that is so novel that your peers neither agree nor disagree with it.  Example from 15 years ago: believing that people should live on floating cities.  Most people probably would disagree with this if they thought about it some (or understood the ideology behind the desire to seasted), but the position was so strange that it wouldn&#x27;t stimulate immediate disagreement.<p>2. Taking a courageous position that is already <i>strongly</i> and <i>overwhelmingly</i> unpopular.  This would be something like &quot;I believe democracy is vastly overrated&quot;.  Unlike with (1), almost everyone in the population has already formed an opinion that is pro-democratic, so when you utter the opposite view, you&#x27;ve got 95%+ of the population ready to disagree with you.<p>These two categories are exhaustive.  In fact a <i>false</i> category of contrarian belief is uttering something that is already popularly controversial, and only slightly unpopular statistically.  An example would be uttering &quot;I believe DJT should be President&quot; in a state like Colorado, where a sizable minority of the population already agrees with you. I think this is why most people think they are independent minded, when in fact they aren&#x27;t.  They have a few slightly unpopular views, which don&#x27;t sufficiently qualify as genuinely contrarian.<p>TLDR: Genuinely contrarian opinions are either so novel that almost everyone is ready to disagree with you, or they are so novel that no one has an opinion yet on the subject.')
