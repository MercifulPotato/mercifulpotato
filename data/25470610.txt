Looking at the historical perspective, though, the reason that every principle is a tradeoff is that the principles that are uniformly worse get discarded.<p>For instance, structured programming (building code out of blocks with structured control flow rather than a pile of gotos) was victorious in the 1970s. Nowadays nobody considers the tradeoffs of using if-then-else versus gotos; structured code is the automatic choice.<p>Self-modifying code was very popular in the 1950s (since it was the only way to get many things done), but essentially nobody uses it now.<p>Modularity is another victorious principle of software development, winning out over big blobs of code with global variables.<p>Using a stack for subroutine calls used to have tradeoffs, but now nobody would consider an alternative.<p>Looking at the long perspective, there is real progress in software development (although slower than I&#x27;d hope).')
