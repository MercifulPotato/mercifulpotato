It&#x27;s usually not actually helpful to signal that you are desperate and lonely and your life is in the toilet. Once in a great while, someone will be truly wonderful to you because you did that but it&#x27;s usually counterproductive.<p>I met up with a close friend a few days ago to lament how tough its been to live alone throughout this Covid period, to get rejected by dozens of companies while job hunting, and to do online dating and not only get rejected by 99% of potentials but have some of the worst first dates I&#x27;ve ever had in my life. One woman was literally multi-tasking while she was on the Zoom &#x27;date&#x27; with me.<p>And her response was &quot;I&#x27;m sorry that you&#x27;re going through that&quot; before switching to talking about her kid being noisy. And internally I&#x27;m thinking all these years I&#x27;ve spent listening to you complain about your job&#x2F;husband&#x2F;baby and this one time I&#x27;m being honest about how tough things are right now and you can&#x27;t even bear to hear me out more than a split second? Give me a fucking break.<p>Covid-19 really revealed who my true friends are. I am quite thankful that I do have a couple friends who I meet on a weekly basis where we check in on one another and keep our spirits up. Without them, I don&#x27;t think I would&#x27;ve survived these lockdowns without having a mental breakdown.')
