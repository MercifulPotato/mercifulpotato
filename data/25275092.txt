Item(by='acqq', descendants=None, kids=[25275327], score=None, time=1606904388, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25274460, text='The researchers joke that &quot;animals lie&quot;, in the sense that animals can have different reactions compared to humans, in spite of the researchers trying as much as possible to get something useful in the experiments. Having said that, I still believe your claim of what can be concluded to be unlikely based on &quot;animal model observation&quot; is false, from what is known up to now. Specifically:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medscape.com&#x2F;viewarticle&#x2F;941030?src=soc_tw_201118_mscpedt_news_mdscp_vaccine&amp;faf=1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.medscape.com&#x2F;viewarticle&#x2F;941030?src=soc_tw_20111...</a><p>&quot;In an ideal world, a vaccine would prevent infection entirely and, it follows, also prevent disease and severe disease. <i>But this may be hard to achieve for a respiratory virus vaccine. Animal challenge data suggest that vaccinated animals may still be infected even if they don&#x27;t experience symptoms.</i> A vaccine that is able to reduce the severity of disease, even if it cannot prevent infection entirely, would obviously still have enormous public health value. Therefore, this is what trials target as their primary aim.&quot;<p>I suggest everybody to read carefully the whole article, as it is written by an indisputable expert, and what is presented in the article isn&#x27;t based only on the animal models but on much broader knowledge. Nobody at this moment should expect that the vaccines guarantee that somebody who is vaccinated won&#x27;t be able to infect somebody who hasn&#x27;t received a vaccine. That, for example, means that even if the health workers do get a vaccine they will still have to wear protective equipment.')
