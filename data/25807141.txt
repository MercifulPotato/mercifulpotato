Earth could get stalled in political deadlock, have a nuclear war, or fall under the control of autocratic regimes.<p>But there are direct benefits to humanity even without these worst case scenarios. Independent thought and political control at a time when the countries on earth become ever more intertwined (China’s Belt and Road) will probably serve some benefit in our future.<p>And then regular rockets between Earth and Mars would pave the way for asteroid mining, which would allow construction of massive solar energy harvesters.<p>That’s 200-500 years out but if we’re capable of starting now I’m not opposed to folks trying!')
