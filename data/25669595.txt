While I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy a very expensive monitor at this point that didn&#x27;t have a high refresh rate, I&#x27;d certainly pay for picture quality, viewing angles, resolution, and maybe just appearance before refresh rate. As an external display, you&#x27;d need gpu power to drive the display anyway, and I&#x27;d take my 30&quot; Dell 2560x1600 IPS over some PoS 1080p 120hz TN panel.')
