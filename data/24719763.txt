I understand the satisfying appeal of that picture.<p>However, I&#x27;m looking at my local health department&#x27;s ZIP-code-by-ZIP-code infection map of the metro area.  And it seems almost entirely correlated with poverty, not privilege.  Infection spread seems mostly due to &quot;essential&quot; workers continuing to work.  That&#x27;s a problematic thing to point out, because I don&#x27;t think we can or will solve for that.  But it&#x27;s plain as day.')
