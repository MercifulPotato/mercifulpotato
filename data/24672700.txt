In Europe children are individuals with their own rights, they&#x27;re not property of the parents.<p>Some parents do stupid things with names. In the UK you can call your children almost anything, but sometimes the state gets involved.<p>Here&#x27;s a case where a mentally ill woman (who had previously had 3 children removed) wanted to call her children &quot;Preacher&quot; and &quot;Cyanide&quot;.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bailii.org&#x2F;ew&#x2F;cases&#x2F;EWCA&#x2F;Civ&#x2F;2016&#x2F;374.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bailii.org&#x2F;ew&#x2F;cases&#x2F;EWCA&#x2F;Civ&#x2F;2016&#x2F;374.html</a><p>&gt; The mother&#x27;s mental health continued to deteriorate following the conclusion of the first care proceedings. When it became known that the mother was pregnant there were, inevitably, considerable concerns about the mother&#x27;s ability to care for the unborn twins and the local authority therefore issued care proceedings the day after their birth. An interim care order was made on 18 May 2015, and the local authority&#x27;s interim care plan, to place the children in foster care until long term plans were formulated, was approved. A capacity assessment concluded that, notwithstanding her mental health difficulties, the mother had capacity to litigate.<p>&gt; Meanwhile, on 15 May 2015, the midwife at the hospital where the mother had given birth to the children, contacted the local authority to tell them of her concern that the mother was proposing to name the children respectively &quot;Preacher&quot; (for the boy) and &quot;Cyanide&quot; (for the girl). The local authority were equally troubled about this proposal and brought it to the court&#x27;s attention at the interim care order hearing.<p>&gt; In the days following the birth of the twins, the local authority quite rightly decided that, rather than issue an application in relation to the proposed names of the children, they would attempt to work with the mother and encourage her to choose names other than the ones identified to the midwife.<p>&gt; On 22 May 2015 there was a case management hearing before Her Honour Judge Garland-Thomas. At that hearing the mother gave an undertaking that she would not to register the birth of the children until the naming issue was resolved. The local authority indicated that in the event that the mother&#x27;s position regarding the names remained unchanged, it was considering making an application to the court to invoke its inherent jurisdiction under section 100 Children Act 1989 (&#x27;CA 1989&#x27;). During the course of the next few weeks, further efforts were made to discuss with the mother the appropriateness of the names she had chosen. At a LAC review (Looked After Children Review) on 8 June 2015, the mother said that she had chosen the name &quot;Cyanide&quot; because &quot;this is how Hitler killed himself&quot;. The mother remained determined that the children should be called &quot;Preacher&quot; and &quot;Cyanide&quot; and accordingly, the case was transferred to the High Court for consideration of an application made by the local authority to invoke the inherent jurisdiction of the court under s100 CA 1989.<p>Once she&#x27;s 18 the child can change her own name to Cyanide if she wishes.')
