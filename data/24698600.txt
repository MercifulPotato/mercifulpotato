It even looks exactly like chrome so users like my mom unknowingly start using it. I find that very deceptive.<p>Windows 10 is a horrible OS as far as I can tell. It tries to do things for me that I don&#x27;t want to and I have to spend a few days to remove all the crap and bloat on a fresh setup then I have to figure out how to stop services that try to update and remove all my changes. I am using Windows 10 strictly for work otherwise I&#x27;d not touch it with a 10 foot pole. It&#x27;s sad to see so many young people embrace Microsoft but I know their relationship won&#x27;t last, I was one of them years and years ago.')
