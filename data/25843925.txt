I do understand your perspective, but I respectfully disagree (though I do admit I don&#x27;t know <i>that</i> much about how China really works).<p>Of course, China is a developed economy, and there is a lot of really impressive and legitimate industry in China. The hardware markets of Shenzen, the startups in Shanghai, the generally better-educated (than the US) populous. I want to make it clear that I don&#x27;t hold a cartoonish &quot;China bad&quot; view, and I definitely don&#x27;t see Chinese people as bad people — I have a lot of them as friends — nor even every member of the CCP as a bad person.<p>But I think these &quot;attacks&quot; of China aren&#x27;t that unwarranted. There is something really foul afoot in China, moreso than the US. Perhaps, if the US didn&#x27;t have such a strong constitution and democratic backing, it would be doing worse things than China. But it isn&#x27;t, and that&#x27;s because of the setup of the US government.<p>The things that really bother me about China are:<p>1. The invasion of Tibet (everyone seems to have forgotten about this)<p>2. The Uighur Genocide<p>3. Well-documented organ harvesting of political dissident groups like Falun Gong<p>4. The draconian social-credit system<p>5. The Great Firewall<p>6. Parts of the &quot;Belt and Road&quot; initiative, particularly landgrabs from poor African farmers<p>There is very good evidence for each of these points, and the West doesn&#x27;t have problems <i>like this</i>.<p>I do see that the US has a lot wrong with it. I also see that Germany and Europe has a lot wrong with it. I also know that media perceptions are often wrong — I&#x27;m half German and hold German citizenship, so I know how strange it is to fly between countries and see how distorted media perceptions are on either end.<p>But China in its current incarnation is, to me, dangerous and scary, and also very promising. I hope we can patch up the past, but we can&#x27;t do that by being blind to it.')
