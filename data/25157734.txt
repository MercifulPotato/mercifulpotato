After that it&#x27;s a business negotiation as to how much you are willing to pay.<p>An interesting point is how you can implement a process to make this whole thing not consume non trivial amounts of time. By way of example:<p>Bob is a developer. He finds bug in his code comes from an underlying open source library. This gives Bob 3 options.<p>- Bob can either dig into the library and see if he can fix it and maintain a fork.<p>- Bob can fix it and try to get corporate approval for submitting an upstream patch.<p>- Bob can try to seek approval and budget to pay the maintainer of the project to take a look at the problem.<p>If companies I have worked for are anything to go by 3 sounds like a herculean task. 2 sounds possible but involves effort. 1 is a minor annoyance (with high probability of major issues down the line).')
