Item(by='an_opabinia', descendants=None, kids=[24960784, 24962737], score=None, time=1604249396, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24959238, text='&gt; the revenue model of custom software dev firms<p>Taking a cut of the economics of the transaction, just like giant software firms do.<p>For example, the seller is an HBS grad whose buddy is a PM at Microsoft with permission to pay vendors - the buyer. Seller can&#x27;t program but he can find young people who can. He knows there&#x27;s a $400k budget for a Sharepoint search plugin, he pays 3x young people $66k each, pays out $50k in one time deal expenses (legal, kickbacks i.e. &quot;illegal&quot;), and is left with about $150k in profit on that deal. Some of that profit is used to pay back losses on previous projects, so net that year, a $400k project may make about $80k (i.e. 20%) for the seller personally.<p>Net-of-50, maintenance, etc. - these are just narratives developed for the buyer&#x27;s processes, to close the sale. You&#x27;re in school, you should know that the way people come up with names for revenue is a narrative for investors and accountants, it&#x27;s not a way to talk about economics (models). In this case the buyer has a lot of checkboxes and this shouldn&#x27;t be conflated with a &quot;model.&quot;<p>Anyway, doesn&#x27;t scale and that&#x27;s why custom software dev firms are rarely big.<p>When you look at stuff that does scale, like Pivotal or Accenture, there&#x27;s something fishy with their economics. Or it&#x27;s Red Hat, and they&#x27;re actually not customizing much at all!')
