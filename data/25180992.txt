As far as instruments go, I love smaller, local guitar stores  because they often carry product you just don&#x27;t see in the big stores outside of the used gear department. I&#x27;ve ran into all kinds of cool stuff ranging from some really nice amps made in some local dude&#x27;s barn to custom shops, to one store that was importing insanely nice boutique brand guitars directly from Japan (I picked up a short neck bass there and played it for a decade before I gave it to an aspiring player).<p>Guitar Center was cool and all, but really, I don&#x27;t need 168 perfectly mass-produced bass guitars to choose from.
