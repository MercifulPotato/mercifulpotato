Would I risk that they close them?<p>Best to just ask them. They&#x27;ve never had an issue with my ones even after they&#x27;ve asked why they&#x27;re not active.<p>&gt; One thing that annoys me about the lack of a test environment is also that they allow only one webhook URL per account.<p>Yep, it&#x27;s not ideal and I haven&#x27;t heard anything about them changing that. Is having to create three accounts and a few product clones in each that big a deal though? It&#x27;s not the kind of configuration you change often and once I had subscription create&#x2F;update&#x2F;cancel event processing code set up I&#x27;ve barely had to touch it.<p>&gt; do you know if this persists across all future events for a subscription?<p>I don&#x27;t know to be honest. This is the kind of thing I meant where the API might not be clear but support will tell you. I had to figure out a few things just by experimenting too. The API has at least been reliable.')
