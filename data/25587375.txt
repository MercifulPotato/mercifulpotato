On the contrary, I think Protobuf won because it did a wide variety of things &quot;pretty well&quot; while moving quickly and solving real problems. This is how the best technologies are usually made, not by academically trying to perfect everything, but by banging out something that works and running with it to solve real problems. If you try to carefully design everything perfectly upfront, you&#x27;ll spend a huge amount of time on decisions that don&#x27;t really matter.')
