The plan was to have a TypeScript class for each component, and a render function to render them on dom. Then the listeners would be handled directly via addEventListener. Eventually I started having thoughts like - &quot;maybe I could have the render function parse attributes and auto-attach dom events&quot;.<p>It became obvious it would become a side project of its own and not a smart use of my time. I settled down for Svelte and I love it.')
