Isn’t this part of the progressive dream?<p>Bernie didnt get the nomination. It&#x27;s President Biden.<p>&gt;2) How working class voters end up aligning themselves with a party that is less likely to care about them, e.g. by cutting taxes for earners well above the working class income bracket.<p>There&#x27;s a huge amount of misconceptions and misrepresentations by how progressive taxes work. There&#x27;s a very clear understanding as to why &quot;all tax cuts are for the rich&quot; which is a true statement. The thought experiment goes: Imagine 3 brothers who earn exactly the same wage in exactly the same industry. Except they work different hours. The first brother works 20 hours, second brother 40 hours, and third brother 80 hours.<p>They all have a shared project that costs $30,000. The fair split of the cost is $10,000 each. the first brother exclaims he cant pay it, he doesnt have the money because he doesnt work enough. The middle brother then devises the &#x27;progressive&#x27; system. Since the third brother works so many more hours, he&#x27;s to pay for over 2&#x2F;3rds. The first brother agrees because he gets benefits without paying anything. The second brother designed it such that he pays less. They voted democratically that the brother who earns much more money pays virtually all.<p>That&#x27;s exactly how society breaks down. If you look at real tax rates net of spending. Even the middle class who &#x27;pay taxes&#x27; actually receive more back from the government than they put in. Therefore when you look at &#x27;who pays taxes&#x27; it&#x27;s always the rich. That&#x27;s why &quot;all tax cuts are for the rich&quot; is a true statement.<p>&gt;To be fair, it doesn’t seem like either party does a _great_ job helping the working class. Populism comes in ‘left’ and ‘right’ flavors...maybe it just happens to have come from the right (Trump) at the right time.<p>Did you also know that the real tax rate has pretty much not changed in the USA for &gt;40 years. Politicians have come and left all changing the way the tax system works but fundamentally have never actually changed taxes.<p>The rich pay the taxes, but they also have the ability to make everyone else pay the taxes for them. High taxes benefit the rich. This is why you keep hearing about mega corps who pay no taxes.<p>The rich get all the power because they are who control the spice.')
