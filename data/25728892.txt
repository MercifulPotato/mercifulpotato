The development team is small, and the code is the result of 22 years of constant revision by PhDs. One of our Never To Be Violated Rules, simply because the number of hidden landmines is far to numerous, is template programming. When generic programming is required we use a web language like PHP where the type of something is contextual and one can be free and loose and sloppy if they want. Between the two extremes of our formal as fuck C++ base and the anything goes generic web languages we maintain surprisingly high levels of productivity, with very low bug counts.
