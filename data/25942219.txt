Surely the officer would have access to something that he could have used to break the glass? I&#x27;ve read a few articles about this lawsuit and I have yet to see a clear answer as to why that wasn&#x27;t the solution.<p>It makes me wonder if the &quot;doors wouldn&#x27;t open&quot; part is just a spurious claim and the lawsuit is really about the post-crash fire.')
