In this case it&#x27;s about the owner of the car having the ability to modify it.<p>Most people dont want to modify the software they use, but those that use these licenses want the people who use their code to have that option.<p>&gt;&gt; If you love our industry, please help your fellow devs by giving them the maximum ability to use your work in their own work so that they can create businesses, pay the bills, hire other devs, and so on and so forth.<p>That&#x27;s quite literally asking to use someone else&#x27;s work for your own profit. Someone else asked about royalties and I think I see room for a license that would prevent such exploitation without compensation. That would be a commercial license.')
