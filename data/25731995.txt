Item(by='megous', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610385141, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25730283, text='My experience:<p>- no service&#x2F;troubleshooting manual&#x2F;videos available online<p>- no way to identify what replacement part to buy unless you&#x27;re in the know already<p>- getting access to locking mechanism looked like it would lead to washing machine completely falling apart structurally (there was a somewhat hidden &quot;safety&quot; screw that looked like a last defense against people removing the front panel just by removing the apparent screws and hurting themselves)<p>So I bailed on this without a proper guide on safe disassembly procedure.<p>Thankfully wiggling the connector to the locking switch made the lock and thus the washing machine work again, after a first failure since 15 years ago or whatever. It looked just fine inside (surprisingly). Vibrations probably don&#x27;t allow much dirt to accumulate. No obvious rusting&#x2F;leakage. I was surprised.')
