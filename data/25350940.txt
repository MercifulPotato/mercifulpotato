Their handheld lines — cell phones, earbuds, headphones, TV remotes — all charge with Lightning.<p>(The older end of the Beats product lines use Micro USB due to having been an Android ecosystem product prior to Apple&#x27;s purchase; however, Beats products released this year seem to be Lightning.)<p>I treat the non-pro iPad as a &quot;handheld&quot; device, and the pro iPad as a &quot;portable&quot; device. There are probably more nuanced words in use at Apple for deciding whether a product gets USB-C or Lightning, but I&#x27;m not invested in my choice of words, just in highlighting the distinction between the two categories.')
