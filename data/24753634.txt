Also, I believe OP’s product has a way narrower scope than stack overflow.<p>SO is not going anywhere anytime soon. I just don’t see why it has to be the end all resource.<p>Assuming OP can find a good way to deal with duplicate entries, it seems like a more “to the point” version of SO that can be referenced before having to deep dive SO’s massive sea of information.<p>Just a layman’s two cents.')
