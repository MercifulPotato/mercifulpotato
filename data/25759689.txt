But I think a big problem is that Debian requires that each library was a separate package.<p>For classic C&#x2F;C++ libraries it&#x27;s not a problem, since for historical reasons (lack of a good, standard language package manager and thus high-level of pain caused by additional dependencies) they had relatively big libraries. Meanwhile in new languages, good tooling (cargo, NPM, etc.) makes &quot;micro-library&quot; approach quite viable and convinient (to the point of abuse, see leftpad). And packaging an application with sometimes several hundred dependencies is clearly a Sisyphean task.<p>I think, that instead of vendoring, Debian should instead adopt a different packaging policy, which would allow them to package whole dependency trees into a single package. This should make it much easier for them to package applications written in Rust and similar languages.')
