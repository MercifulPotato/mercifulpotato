Item(by='Shank', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605228012, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25075160, text='&gt; Pretty misleading to include it in the demo if Docker for Mac still doesn&#x27;t launch next week right?<p>The M1 hardware hasn&#x27;t shipped yet. Presumably this criticism is only valid if the hardware has shipped, which it has not. If Apple did indeed have a lot of involvement porting Docker, my assumption is that they&#x27;ll release that with the machines next week (November 17, 2020), as opposed to before the hardware is generally available.')
