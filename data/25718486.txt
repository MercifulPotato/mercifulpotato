Returned 2 days later after realizing that it only supports one external monitor and even found articles stating that ultra wide monitors were not supported on initial release. &quot;Just use display link adaptor?&quot; No thanks I don&#x27;t want a 150$ adaptor that may or may not work with my current setup. Even with display link I&#x27;ve heard of displays flickering on initial startup or not starting at all in clamshell.<p>People saying the MacBook pro 16&quot; might solve the issue but tbh I think this is apples way of pigeonholing users to either their desktop version or their laptop.')
