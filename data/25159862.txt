Linux is one of the few OSes where this kind of approach really makes sense, since it&#x27;s open source and has a small, very well-defined, stable ABI that you can implement and everything should &quot;just work&quot;. Of course this process can be tedious and complicated, but I mean it is so much easier than what Wine or Darling is doing on a closed-source OS at a very different layer in the stack. It&#x27;s of course obvious why WSL2 exists but its existence brings a great sadness, like Oracle buying Sun or Google killing off Hangouts and replacing it with whatever they&#x27;re using these days.')
