The &quot;technology&quot; is specifically referring to the Dominion system, not &quot;technology&quot; in general. If the Dominion system does not include remote access, if it doesn&#x27;t include remote monitoring and if it doesn&#x27;t include remote vote management then &quot;technologically impossible&quot; is a fair statement.<p>They are not arguing that it is impossible for such a system to ever be built, they&#x27;re arguing that their system is not built that way. Voting machines are audited and have a chain of custody, it would be very difficult to argue that &quot;someone could hack all the machines and install this capability&quot; fits within the realm of possibility.')
