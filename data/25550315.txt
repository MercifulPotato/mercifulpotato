Like 40-60 different companies. Not to mention government projects.<p>Of all of those, only RocketLab has managed to do it, and their rocket is basically as tiny as you can build a orbital rocket.<p>SpaceX did an orbital rocket bigger then RocketLab in 2008. RocketLab doesn&#x27;t yet have real competition, despite many billions invested.<p>SpaceX at the same time went from the tiny Falcon 1 to a gigantic Starship program more ambitious then Saturn V  and Apollo.<p>I think we do our self a dissevers by just saying &#x27;well, we have computers now so its easy&#x27;. Given how many people have tried and how many have failed or taken many, many years longer then they thought, it is clearly not easy at all.<p>And mass producing them reliably is even harder.<p>SpaceX and Elon Musk are clearly special and unique. Something we have never seen before.')
