It&#x27;s ideal for parents who want a bunch of good kids movies and shows. Mandalorian, although it was the &quot;killer app&quot; is an outlier. The rest of the original content I&#x27;ve watched on there is almost literally advertisements for Disneyland. Just buy a membership for a month and watch Mando.')
