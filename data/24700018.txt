Downvote me all you like, but if a New Yorker says &quot;Milwaukee&#x2F;St Louis&#x2F;Cleveland is worse than New York for these reasons&quot; they get seen as elitist, coastal snobs. If the reverse happens and someone says &quot;New York sucks for these reasons&quot;, nobody blinks an eye. When really, both options have their pros and cons. I&#x27;m not going to claim New York is always better, but I don&#x27;t think we should assume Cleveland is the best either.')
