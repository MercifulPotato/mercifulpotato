There’s a photo from a BLM protest in DC where the Lincoln Memorial steps (not the capitol building, which is widely-stated misinformation) had lines of National Guard troops stationed on it.<p>Compare that with the tiny Capitol Police force guarding the Capitol building while one of the most important state functions was in progress, with much of the executive branch succession and the legislative branch in attendance.  National Guard troops were denied both in advance and for a while during the ensuing riot, citing concerns about “the optics.”<p>Any meaningful discussion of protest response and overreach, potential or actual, has to account for that disparity.<p>As you said, some rioters were “planning terrible deeds,” which increasingly clearly means “kidnapping or executing congresspeople and the VP for not keeping DJT in power.”  This raises the issue to the level of sedition (organized incitement to rebellion) and insurrection (actual acts of violence against the state or its officers).<p>Maybe “terrorism” doesn’t broadly apply here, and it’s better to refer to the capitol invaders as “insurrectionists.” Trump, the other government supporters of the protest, and any private backers should be labeled as “seditionists.”  I am less likely to push for a “terrorism” label if I can be confident that the other two labels will be applied and prosecuted as such.')
