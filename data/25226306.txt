Doing a side by side speed comparison against my 3970x threadripper you can see the AMD is ~200-500x faster on a given task.<p>The P90 creeks along running the modern kernel. mpv and mplayer can&#x27;t play anything smoothly (not even as a .wav file) and mpg321 fires up pulseaudio before it starts playing so that&#x27;s not happening.<p>In this whole exercise I&#x27;ve learned something valuable:<p>This is all very reasonable.<p>If someone told me they&#x27;d spend an immense effort to speed something up by 0.15 seconds I would think them extremely foolish. That 0.15 seconds translates to 60 seconds on the P90.<p>My AMD has literally 1,000 times more memory than the P90.<p>If someone said they spent some enormous effort and took the memory footprint of something from 40MB down to 28MB I&#x27;d think they&#x27;re just doing a hobby but of course on the P90 that&#x27;s 10% of the memory available.<p>As machines have progressed, the great wins of the past have become nearly unmeasurable noise.<p>The OpenSSH server, for example, a fairly competently written piece of software, takes about 8 seconds to serve me a password prompt.<p>People aren&#x27;t being foolish or irresponsible or naive in not caring about these things, they&#x27;re being sensible.
