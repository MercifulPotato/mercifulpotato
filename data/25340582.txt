I really do. But that is the wrong response when someone is pointing a gun at you. That’s how’s your child loses their father or mother.<p>Don’t forget that police are trained to shoot to kill. There is no training for “shoot to injure” ... the logic being that if you are injured, you can reach into your clothes and pull out a gun, potentially killing the officer who shot you.')
