This is fine except (a) we often don’t care about an exact solution (so we need approximation-hardness that isn’t shown) and (b) I can come up with millions of other obvious things like this! Here’s a silly one one: I give a derivative whose price is $1 if a solution (that is known to exist) to an NP-hard problem is found by a given time. This will “show the NP hardness of EMH” because obviously the derivative price should be 1 (the problem has a solution, by construction) and so anyone should “obviously” price it at $1.<p>This is like saying “life is NP-hard.” Like, yeah, of course it is. That doesn’t mean we aren’t pretty good at doing the right thing and rationality (like EMH) is a good, if imperfect tool to analyze behavior. Taking it to its extreme then everything breaks, because the model is wrong. We don’t throw up our hands and quit because making real-life decisions is a sampling-hard, query-hard, and NP-hard problem (if all data is known), but a basic model of rationality would say that humans can “perfectly” solve it. (Which is obviously crazy, but we obviously don’t throw the assumption of rationality of agents out the window because of this.)<p>Otoh, I am definitely of the opinion that some economists hold EMH as a “magical” axiom, but that’s a different story.')
