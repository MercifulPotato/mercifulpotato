I spent way more on upgrading and tinkering with my printer than the thing cost in the first place.<p>If there was a 2D equivalent, I&#x27;d be interested in tinkering with that, too. And yes, that would probably mean spending 5x ot 10x more than a cheap commercial printer to get a printer than underperformed said cheap commercial printer. But it would be mine, and I would understand it, and be able to mess with it. And fix it if it broke. And use weird inks with it. And so on.')
