As a cop (beat or all of the way up to chief of police) you have no say over private vs public prisons, prison policies, or even prison sentencing because they are not the same organization.<p>Moreover, surveillance and the militarization of police are both policies of local police departments. You can make a completely ethical decision to join the sheriff’s department in a local town that has none of these capabilities nor wants them. The law enforcement of a locality is strictly a result of that city’s politics. There is no national police force nor standard in the US that makes sense to hold all enforcement officers accountable for.')
