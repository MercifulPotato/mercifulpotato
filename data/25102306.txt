I&#x27;m far from a Vim power user, but anytime I have to use a different editor, I&#x27;m frustrated by how slow and cumbersome it is to edit code. It feels like trying to run in water.<p>2) Ubiquity. It&#x27;s so nice to just use the same editor everywhere, especially remotely and&#x2F;or on low-powered devices.<p>On point #1: This is not just an issue of familiarity either; I&#x27;ve used way too many editors over the years, vim wasn&#x27;t my first choice, and I resisted it for a long time. Once I bit the bullet (due to point #2, above), I found that the learning curve was really steep as expected. But an interesting thing happened soon after that: long before I felt proficient in Vim, the speed of editing files in Vim surpassed the speed of making the same changes in any other editor.')
