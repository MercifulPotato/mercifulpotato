But their records is hit-and-miss in my opinion.<p>Good: iPod click wheel, iPhone side buttons&#x2F;switches, old chiclet keyboards, trackpad.<p>Bad: Butterfly keyboards, AppleTV remote is awful (swipes and edge-clicks for all sorts of things), their mice have always been a pain to use (wanna right click? Better lift your left finger completely away from the mouse)<p>But they also aggressively remove physical interfaces where possible. One-button mice, removal of home button on iPhone, removal of function keys on MacBooks, etc.<p>I hope they don&#x27;t do that with a car. There should be a dozen knobs and buttons that have dedicated features. Not just wipers and signals either. I&#x27;m talking about volume control, seat adjustments, windows, etc.')
