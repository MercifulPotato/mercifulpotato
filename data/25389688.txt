I was using zig for a while, and I wish I could build my own (simple) memory allocators for certain things in Haskell like that. I have a project where I want to be able to directly control the memory layout of the data structures but since that&#x27;s just a tiny part of the whole program I don&#x27;t want to build the whole thing in zig or something like C, I prefer Haskell for this specific purpose (it&#x27;s a stream processing application with a small [code-wise, the data set can be huge] in-memory tree database which I want to be able to do the memory object allocation for myself).')
