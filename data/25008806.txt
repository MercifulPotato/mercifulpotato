There are even CAPTCHA solving companies that offer thousands of solves for $1.<p>This is probably a bad argument when your proof of work captcha can be solved for much cheaper. Your site says &quot;Solving it will take a few seconds on a desktop computer&quot;, which I&#x27;ll interpret as 5 seconds. The spot price for a c5a.2xlarge instance (8 thread zen2 CPU) is 21.6 cents&#x2F;hr. That works out to 0.03 cents per solve, an order of magnitude less than the 0.1 cents per solve for commercial recaptcha solving services. It probably gets even cheaper if you get your compute through non-cloud providers, or through GPUs.')
