Under the current situation, Apple is writing drivers for hardware they did not design, and switching between discrete and integrated GPUs has been a flaky issue going all the way back to G4 PowerBooks. A lot of this complexity is going to just evaporate.<p>Incidentally, I was also using a Thunderbolt Display with a 2016 usb-c MacBook for about three years, it was similarly flakey. Switched to an LG 5k (found an inexpensive refurb) a while back and 95% of the problems went away.')
