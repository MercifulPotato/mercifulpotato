France had a wealth tax (called the ISF, impôt sur la fortune) and it never actually garnered the expected revenues. This is because wealthy French people moved to Brussels, where you still have a pretty nice city and you can still speak French. Macron got rid of it and there was a mini-crash in Brussels real estate as people move back. There’s nothing stopping me or anyone in CA to move to CO or UT or TX. Sure I’m further from the ocean but those are still pretty nice places to live. I love CA and I’m very far from the $30M threshold, but if I did have this sort of tax it’s hard to justify not moving for lower taxes AND cheaper cost of living with very little downside. With the rise of remote work, there’s even less of a downside.')
