For example I used to work at a startup where this super finicky NodeJS script was written by a junior dev that ended up being the main deployment script for client build-outs on one of their products. Fast forward a few years, the old CEO contacts me because he still has a few clients using the platform and has no way of running the script. He pays me to try to get it to run on his machine -- I get it working on Ubuntu but will not run on his Mac because the Mac is no longer supported by whatever weird packages the junior dev was using. Long story short, Docker to the rescue -- now he has a baked-in image that will run that script forever.')
