A few film makers do this, respect them.\nA degree of controversy has emerged about line and arc sharpening to\n4K as well as colorisation.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.co.uk&#x2F;article&#x2F;history-colourisation-controversy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.co.uk&#x2F;article&#x2F;history-colourisation-contro...</a><p>It is strange, we see all the old marble statues from greek and roman times as stark white marble objects - I oroginally thought this was normal and as they were made..\nI heard later that most of the original startuary was painted, often quite brightly in its original form.<p>I also read that in many places after Rome broke up into the eastern and western roman empires - the Western one declining into the middle\nages, and the eastern one carrying on, repainting statues from time to\ntime, while the middle age europe allowed the paint to be age away to\ndust and leave the white statuary we have become accustomed to as many of the places where the statuary rested was in weathered and buried ruins. In\nmany Islamic countries with continuity from the time of the Eastern\nRoman Empire we see these old colored statues. Some Arabic leaders\neven bought old white statues and painted them as they used to be -\nthis was portrayed in the Western press as some form of barbarism - it\nwas not.<p>I can understand how digitally easy it is to detect straight lines and\narcs on old photos and render them into sharp straight lines&#x2F;curves.\nAdding colours to old photos and movies and interpolating an extra\nframe to bring it to 60Hz from the old 16 or 24Hz or so, is also reasonable\n- as long as the colours are accurate - we have had hand coloured\nphotos for well over 100 years.\nThese are, in effect documentaries, maximu accuracy is a valid reason. Most, if not all, the places colorised  respected the original colors as they can be seen now.\nMy tendency is to approve these changes as long as they are accurate,\nand render the image as well as if it had been taken by a time\ntraveller with 60fps, 4K full color movies.<p>I can not understand these historians taking umbrage as  long as the\nwork is accurate as to color..<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smithsonianmag.com&#x2F;arts-culture&#x2F;true-colors-17888&#x2F;#:~:text=Colored%20statues%3F,also%2C%20like%20mighty%20stage%20sets" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.smithsonianmag.com&#x2F;arts-culture&#x2F;true-colors-1788...</a>.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;29&#x2F;the-myth-of-whiteness-in-classical-sculpture" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.newyorker.com&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;29&#x2F;the-myth-of-wh...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theancienthome.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;blog-and-news&#x2F;greek-roman-statues-painted" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theancienthome.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;blog-and-news&#x2F;greek-roman-s...</a><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openculture.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;roman-statues-werent-white-they-were-once-painted-in-bright-colors.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.openculture.com&#x2F;2019&#x2F;12&#x2F;roman-statues-werent-whit...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;style&#x2F;article&#x2F;gods-in-color-ancient-world-polychromy&#x2F;index.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cnn.com&#x2F;style&#x2F;article&#x2F;gods-in-color-ancient-worl...</a><p>I rest the case...')
