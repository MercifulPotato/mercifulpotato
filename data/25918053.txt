But I don&#x27;t know why you would, if the browser is changing too much for you you can change to ESR which is security updates only to older versions of Firefox.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mozilla.org&#x2F;Windows_Service_Silent_Update" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.mozilla.org&#x2F;Windows_Service_Silent_Update</a>')
