It does at least have a nice logo which is ultimately enough to make me try something :p<p>I&#x27;d like to see the slew of new messengers coming out also address one of the few areas keeping people on Facebook: group event planning. There&#x27;s lots of places to chat, but not many alternatives for sharing and planning events with a wider group of people. Briar seems to offer blog and forum concepts, which is interesting, but everything seems to be lacking in the &quot;event&quot; aspect and that&#x27;s unfortunately a bit of a sticking point for a lot of Facebook users (it&#x27;s primarily what I use it for, still).')
