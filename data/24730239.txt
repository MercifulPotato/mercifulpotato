It says at the bottom of the readme:<p>NOTE: The sources and build scripts may be added after Unicode Version 14.0.0 has been released (2021), and as time and resources permit.<p>So this repo doesn&#x27;t have the source currently, despite what it may say earlier in the readme. I&#x27;m assuming the TTF file in the release is the actual font, and the &quot;Source code&quot; zip is just an automatic archive of what&#x27;s currently in the repository.')
