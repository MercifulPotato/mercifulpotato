It takes an hour to drive outside of rush hour.<p>The train runs about every 90 minutes outside of rush hour. So it&#x27;s a non-starter for a night event.<p>So, sure, I&#x27;d use a much faster and far more frequent train if it existed. But that&#x27;s a wildly different situation from what exists today. And this is a US location (Boston&#x2F;Cambridge) that has relatively good transit--and I live  fairly close to an exurban train station.')
