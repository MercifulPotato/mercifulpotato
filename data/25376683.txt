You even got a good example with the Spanish flu. It was utterly terrifying, considering that it wiped between 1% and 6% of the global population in a sparsely populated world where nobody could easily travel anywhere they wished at any time - vastly different from today&#x27;s world, which is ideal for an infectious disease.<p>9&#x2F;11 was direct act of violence against the US, of course people will take that more personally than something that not only is a whole separate kingdom from the one we&#x27;re in, but it doesn&#x27;t even qualify as a living thing. Had it been proved to be used as a weapon and the pandemic - a deliberate attack, people everywhere would take it so personally and dearly that nuclear weapons would be casually flying every day since March.<p>Therefore, 9&#x2F;11 and the weaponized germs stuff you linked just doesn&#x27;t make sense in our context. Go make another thread dedicated to weaponization of stuff, you can even include k-t extinction event as well for color, sky is the limit.')
