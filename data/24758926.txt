What has worked for me is to solve problems I encounter. For instance, I was at a friend&#x27;s house a couple of months ago and some walkers in the neighborhood shouted that a pipe was burst, and we should report it to the utility company. We called the utility company, and it was difficult to tell them the location of the burst pipe. From there an idea was born, what if we had an app that can report the gps location to the utility company.<p>The hard part for me is to find the time to implement an idea. An idea for me just naturally flows from a problem.')
