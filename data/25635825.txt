We build a Pay-It Forward chain community from scratch!<p>I used buymeacoffee.com&#x2F;felixbmc, to monetise the community as well as filtering out any bad players. Each pay forward the invites they get while onboarded, back to community so that we never run out of invites. It&#x27;s that simple:)<p>It&#x27;s still day 1 and in the last 24 hours, I have made over 115 dollars in doing so.')
