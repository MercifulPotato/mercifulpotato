There are big security benefits (it becomes much harder to exploit an app).<p>A disadvantage is it becomes much harder to make things like terminal emulators and things that <i>want</i> to download random code and run it.<p>But those are by far the minority of apps, and it seems crazy to make a pretty massive security tradeoff for something that 99% of apps don&#x27;t need to do.<p>One solution might be a special permission to be allowed to do that, but it seems unlikely a user could really make an informed decision.<p>Another solution could be to interpret rather than execute the code - you lose a lot of performance, but for people running bash scripts, that might not matter.  Using WebAssembly might be a good middle ground.')
