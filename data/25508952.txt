It&#x27;s worth mentioning the &quot;So Good They Can&#x27;t Ignore You&quot; book by Cal Newport, which basically argues (I give you my simplified interpretation, I might be botching it) that happiness comes when you become very good at something, and changing careers in the pursuit of happiness will make you be less good in something and in extension, also less happy.')
