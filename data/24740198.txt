Cronus and the Olympians or whatnot.<p>Anyway, to me, a decent working definition of god is immortality (long life or evitable mortality are good nuff), great wisdom and the powerful creative abilities. Those seem at least possible these days.<p>Maybe we only become true gods once you pass the torch. It sort of proves the point, especially the &quot;creator&quot; point... to make a worthy torch bearer.<p>Sure, I guess I&#x27;m in with silicon. I&#x27;d prefer it was <i>me</i> in the silicon, but I guess one descendant is as good as another. Hopefully they won&#x27;t be this bigoted against meat though. At least have respect for your ancestors.')
