Of course I can agree that it sucks if a cheater ruins the fun for anyone else.<p>I&#x27;m really not a gamer myself, I just like messing around with code and learning how it all works. There is really a lot to learn from this kind of projects. The content out there on low level programming tends to be a little daunting, arid and hard to understand. So I thought game modding could be a nice package for people to get interested in that kind of skills. The tool generates legible, explained source code and it helps you with the steps for compiling and what not. I think it could be great to motivate beginners to start getting their hands dirty and grasping some of the concepts out there.<p>I guess most client side hacks (the ones you can make with this tool) are not so great with any modern multiplayer game anyway, as real core domain logic and syncing is often executed server side. And on top of that there is all the basic extra stuff like validations, kicks, bans, anti cheats, etc.\nFor local or single player games, they could work a little better. But what&#x27;s the harm in that, right? it&#x27;s just you in there.<p>Again, even with all that said, I can really see your point, I totally get it! I hope this reply sheds a more positive light on all of this.\nHave a great day!')
