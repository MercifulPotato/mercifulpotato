Batteries are extremely heavy and need to be protected so that in the event of an accident they don&#x27;t explode or kill the driver. Thus far the battery has been more or less part of the chassis. Its not clear that battery technology is advanced enough to provide the energy density required to propel the cars at racing speeds while also being portable enough to be swapped out mid-race.')
