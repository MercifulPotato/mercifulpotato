On places like HN where everyone is in love with Ruby... errr... Go.... errrr I mean, Rust, you’d think that those languages are the what’s what.<p>Then when you look at the job market, you get a very different picture of what actually gets used. In my country there hasn’t been a single job posting for all Rust in all of 2020. There’s been a single mention of Go as a “nice to know” PHD job at Google Denmark and there is just a single company who has had openings for Ruby. Hell even with everyone’s favourite Python, almost every job involving it is in DataScience and needs you to be a mathematician first, analyst of some kind second and a programmer third. There are a few django jobs, and good for those guys, but in general, even python doesn’t see that much general usage.<p>The vast overwhelming amount of jobs that’s been listed in 2020 in Denmark have been for C#, PHP and JavaScript, with JAVA still hanging in there somewhat, though typically bundled with whatever they call JBOSS these days.<p>So unless you’re smack in the centre of Silicon Valley, I probably wouldn’t worry too much about the hate PHP gets.')
