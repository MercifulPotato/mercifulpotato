But very expensive.<p>Should we boost salaries of people in Sydney so they can sustain living in the sun all year long with rich neighborhoods and a thriving city? And then pay people less in rainy and cold places, just because it’s poorer and disenfranchised and flats are cheap in the polluted area of the city, so your price-per-square-meter is lower? That is why the average cost of living there is lower, after all.<p>If we pay people at their living cost, people will flock to nice places, overpopulating them while cold places will die faster than Detroit.<p>There is no right answer to that. So let’s not “organize” it and let the markets decide.')
