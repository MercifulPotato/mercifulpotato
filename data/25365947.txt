Item(by='amadeuspagel', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607551722, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25364344, text='&gt; It&#x27;s weird to me that we still have people that still cling to the idea that censorship and curation of content is always evil and every site on the Internet should allow completely unmoderated speech<p>No, not every site. But just as we have some public forums in the real world (not all, or even most &quot;festering echo-chambers of hatred and racism&quot;), we should have some on the internet.<p>&gt; Not only are you conveniently ignoring that reality, but you&#x27;re also ignoring the fact that humans are humans.<p>This reminds of arguing with objectivists who think that everything they believe flows from &quot;A is A&quot;. I do agree that humans are humans, I&#x27;m glad we found some common ground here. Presumably you are human as well. But you are not concerned that what you believe is the result of &quot;false information that has been carefully constructed and self-selected to misinform you and appeal to your emotions&quot;. It&#x27;s only other humans who are vulnerable to this, and you need to protect them from it, for their own good.<p>&gt; Stop. Just stop. You&#x27;re not helping. You&#x27;re not enlightened. You&#x27;re part of the problem.')
