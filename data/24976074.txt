Give it some time for the patches to come. Recompiling for multiple processor architectures is easier now than it used to be.<p>&gt; I know, there is a crowd out there that loves to declare &quot;you should not use your Mac for games&quot; along with &quot;Buy a system for games then&quot;. Well let me be blunt, if it cannot serve both purposes then it serves none which means leaving the platform behind.<p>I think you SHOULD use a Mac for games. Most people saying that are not in fact Mac users. The ARM transition isn&#x27;t going to push Mac games out of existence. In fact it&#x27;ll probably push Microsoft to properly treat ARM as a first class citizen so companies will be compiling their software for two different architectures anyway.')
