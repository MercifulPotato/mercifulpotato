Story:<p>Many years ago, a old friend of mine purhcased a new Panasonic Smart TV. It was when &quot;Smart TVs&quot; were just becoming a thing.<p>I hooked her TV up for her; wiring it into the ATT uVerse modem directly. Other devices worked, but this one did not.<p>After resetting the modem, factory resetting TV, and making sure the ip address on the TV&#x27;s menu were displaying properly and matched the router&#x27;s config (they were), as a young naive tech nerd, I just said:<p>&quot;Looks like they sold you a dud. Thankfully you kept the receipt!. Either way, you still have warranty to get it replaced.&quot;<p>My friend replied: &quot;Shouldn&#x27;t I call them first before taking it back?&quot;<p>I said I didn&#x27;t think it would help, but go ahead.<p>About 30 mins laters, she was talking to Panasonic tech support and they asked her to manually enter the DNS entries [I believe it was 75.75.. so Comcrap&#x27;s], and voila, the TV was online again.<p>We were very happy it was an easy fix; but that day I deftinely did a LOT of reading on DNS servers.<p>Till this day, DNS entries are something I always check over when troubleshooting (as well as setting my router to Cloudfare&#x27;s).')
