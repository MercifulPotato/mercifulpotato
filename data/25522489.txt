I&#x27;ve had a few, but they are few and far between. I&#x27;ve also had a few that I&#x27;ve gotten to name a range by first naming something comfortably above where I suspect their range is — to which the reply is then to talk me down to that number.<p>(And, in the cases where I&#x27;ve done this, I&#x27;ve found out the recruiter&#x27;s range was well below my own BATNA…)')
