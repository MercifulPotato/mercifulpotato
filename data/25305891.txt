The analogy is much more informative for people deciding to learn Chinese than your any of your 發&#x2F;髮 → 发 examples and analysis. Clearly there are distinctions between traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese, your earlier posts contain many valid examples and analysis which are suitable towards a Chinese etymology audience rather than the general English speaking audience who are curious about Chinese. FWIW I&#x27;d teach my kids traditional Chinese, but overexaggerating the difference between the two variants is not helpful for Chinese learners.')
