It&#x27;s a theological paper arguing against forms of Christianity that are based on the world-view of whiteness; instead Christianity should move toward a &quot;decolonial option&quot;. The paper&#x27;s arguments are based on the famous theologian Karl Barth and his commentary on Romans 2, so it&#x27;s not easy reading.<p>Is this bogus? If you consider theology bogus, then yes. But the paper is highly relevant to current US politics with the influence of evangelical churches and their embrace of a white-centered model of the world. (Although it doesn&#x27;t explicitly get into politics.)<p>One irony of linking to this paper is that religion is highly marked by earnestness, and this paper even more so. The paper&#x27;s author is clearly genuinely interested in this subject as a &quot;theology nerd&quot;. She is writing not for personal gain but to make the world a better place.')
