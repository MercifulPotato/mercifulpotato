You are allowed to use trademarks in certain circumstances. You can’t imply a relationship that doesn’t exist, but AWS saying - this is a hosted version of Elasticsearch would probably be okay (but IANAL).<p>Where they’d get into trouble is if they said they offered a hosted Elasticsearch, but under the hood it was something else. But, even then they could probably say that their offering was Elasticsearch compatible.<p>The real question is: was AWS misleading customers? I don’t make any claims one way or the other about this specific case. But I wanted to point out that you don’t always need permission to use another’s trademark.<p>From [1]:<p><i>&gt; Nominative use permits the use of a trademark – even in commercial contexts – if it is the most accurate way to refer to a good or service without misleading consumers as to its source.</i><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;google.github.io&#x2F;opencasebook&#x2F;trademarks&#x2F;#fair-use-defense-to-trademark-infringement-nominative-use" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;google.github.io&#x2F;opencasebook&#x2F;trademarks&#x2F;#fair-use-d...</a>')
