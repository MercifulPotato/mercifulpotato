We ran into an issue a few years ago where saving a PDF with forms in Preview would set some style setting so that in most other readers, the form fields would have no background color and use white text, making them unreadable. They were still perfectly readable in Preview, but had the style issues in Chrome, Firefox, Acrobat (and Reader), and Foxit. We have a project where we programatically fill in PDF forms using PDFtk and one day, our editor just starting spitting out empty PDFs. After troubleshooting, we traced it back to the style changes Preview was making after another dev had accidentally done a CMD+S on the template file and committed the template.<p>In short: NEVER save a PDF with Preview. You should probably just avoid opening it in Preview period, frankly.')
