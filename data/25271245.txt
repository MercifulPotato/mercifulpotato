Giving judges and juries even more latitude than they have already would completely shatter that.</i><p>Such a claim might be valid for crimes such as murder, where we would indeed expect sentencing to fit the crime and not to be adjusted for certain individuals because of factors irrelevant to the crime.<p>But most cases aren&#x27;t like that. Most cases involve civil disputes between parties based on non-repeatable individual circumstances that don&#x27;t lend themselves to one-size-fits-all, bright-line rules the way criminal prosecutions usually do. In cases like that, if there&#x27;s going to be fairness at all, it <i>has</i> to involve judges and juries exercising non-repeatable individual judgment based on the non-repeatable individual circumstances of the case. Yes, there will be legal principles involved that could apply to many cases, but there will always be unique aspects to the facts of an individual case that can only be assessed by human judgment.')
