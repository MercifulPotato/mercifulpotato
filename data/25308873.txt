If you have a team that can agree to that, then all the arguing over formatting completely disappears. You&#x27;re trading trying to find some arduous compromise across the entire team with &quot;whatever Prettier does&quot;. In my experience people are at first disappointed they don&#x27;t get exactly the formatting they want, but once everyone gets used to it and formatting discussions completely stop, it&#x27;s a nice relief.')
