Everything in the body signals electrically, and biological matter being piezoelectric has been known (probably not popularly) since the late 60’s.<p>Indeed, I am finishing up my dissertation applying electrical engineering theory to model cellular evolutionary biology predicated on digital signal processing theory to demonstrate natural selection progressively evolves adaptations with faster sampling rates of environmental radiation for greatest BIBO system stability.')
