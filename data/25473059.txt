It is, in fact, much better than I expected. On the other hand, Microsoft has thus far only had slightly modified AMD chips in their Surface Laptop, and poor performing ARM-designed Qualcomm chips in their Surface Pro X. Maybe I&#x27;ll be bad at predicting the future, but I do not expect excellent performance out of Microsoft&#x27;s Surface chips in the next 365 days. Probably longer.<p>In the meantime, more Windows computers will be sold than MacOS, and they will have mostly Intel chips, but an increasingly large number of AMD chips.<p>AMD has survived with less diverse revenue streams and much worse product portfolios. I&#x27;m optimistic for how they&#x27;ll do over the next several years.')
