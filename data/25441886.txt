Item(by='harperlee', descendants=None, kids=[25442288, 25443464, 25441902, 25442657], score=None, time=1608122827, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25441664, text='If you mean Common Lisp, I&#x27;d say install SBCL and start playing with with the repl. Choose the editor you know best; even notepad is useful to copy and paste expressions to&#x2F;from the repl. Any editor that&#x27;s suited for programming will have a way to send expressions to the repl with a keystroke, which is much more comfortable. So basically, just pick VSCode.<p>With that, you&#x27;re ready to go. Take <i>just one</i> book and work through it, you don&#x27;t need <i>the best book</i>, but a book will be better structured and more complete than multiple blog posts from different people. Practical Common Lisp (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gigamonkeys.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gigamonkeys.com&#x2F;book&#x2F;</a>) is good and freely available. I used ANSI Common Lisp (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;acl.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.paulgraham.com&#x2F;acl.html</a>), from Paul Graham (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=pg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;user?id=pg</a>), long time ago and it&#x27;s also good.<p>If you are open to non-common-lisp lisps, I&#x27;d say pick up clojure instead of common lisp, it&#x27;s more modern and thus you will find more community and up-to-date resources. Clojure for the Brave and True is a book that has been praised, but I did not read it. It has some jokes and humorous examples that might or might not suit you.')
