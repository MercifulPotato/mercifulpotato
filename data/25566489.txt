Some careful shopping can net you an LTO-5 (1.5TB native capacity) library unit (one that can be upgraded to newer generations) for under $500, with new tapes $10-15 each.<p>The nice thing about LTO as a format is its relative predictability and ease of acquiring the parts, even the very obsolete ones. It&#x27;s all SCSI or SAS, most of the interesting stuff happens at the hardware level, with a bog-standard API. Your average backup app, whether it be Backup Exec or mtx&#x2F;tar&#x2F;etc. on Linux doesn&#x27;t need to care about the media format. Unlike actual &quot;enterprise&quot; shops with datacenters and support contracts and such cruft, where the primary concern is &quot;does it work&quot;, it is fine to buy older units second-hand. They are plentiful and cheap.')
