Half of our stack is in go using grpc, but the other half is nodejs. We tried protoc-js&#x2F;protobufjs neither of them works with even a slightly more complicated setup. A simple import sometimes can cause invalid code, or just simply breaks the build. The best solution is now to use stephenh&#x2F;ts-proto which works great, except the lack of grpc and json_name (which is must because we often use json for node services) support.')
