Most self-proclaimed preppers advocate atrocious &quot;us or them&quot; social darwinist ideologies and have policies that could get them and others killed. For example, many of them think it&#x27;s a good idea to go camping in the woods in case of a natural disaster, which almost never makes any sense. They also frequently talk about shooting strangers instead of helping them and stockpile ammunition instead of antibiotics. They also should worry more about dental care and less about other people.<p>I&#x27;m sure there are exceptions, but as rule of thumb I&#x27;d stay away from any US prepper as far as I could in case of a genuine emergency like a Yellowstone outbreak or a worldwide pandemic.')
