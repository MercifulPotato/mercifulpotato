His advice was to redline everything, sign it, and return it with the package. If the employer had balked he’d have written a letter in response, but that didn’t happen.<p>So that’s been my routine ever since - non-competes and any non-compete language get a red pen through them, signed, and returned.<p>I’ve never had a single company even mention it, let alone push back.')
