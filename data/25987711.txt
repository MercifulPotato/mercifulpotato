Of course it isn&#x27;t for 98% of people.<p>1. I did say it was usable, I am pretty sure most people could use it, although it wouldn&#x27;t be a great pleasure (an personally I loathe these &quot;addictive&quot; mobile interfaces). One could get real work done with it.<p>2. I did say there was a gui for this. You don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to type that if you don&#x27;t want to. There are multiple gui front-ends with categories, descriptions, screenshots, ratings, etc. Courtesy of appstream metadata and packagekit, that both abstract away platform-specific package manager subtleties and provide &quot;modern&quot; store metadata.<p>3. This way a contrived example, there are simpler tools if all you want is record &amp; play back.<p>4. &quot;fun&quot; is very subjective, that was part of my point.<p>Oh, and while we&#x27;re on it, most distribution repositories are in fact walled gardens with a curated software selection (the audacity example above is part of it).
