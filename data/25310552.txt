This view supposes that the workers simply extract wealth from the company, rather than exchanging wealth for their time, which also has innate value to the worker.<p>Per this view, if a worker worked 100% of their time, they would have achieved their optimum goal of extracting the most wealth possible. But nearly all people who have made that trade would tell you they are depressed, feel run down, and probably think about blowing their brains out on a regular basis.<p>At some point, the plumber wants to go home, too. Now, maybe it&#x27;s true that they&#x27;ll take 1 hour to complete a job at a comfortable rate rather than the fastest-possible rate of 45 minutes, and maybe 4 jobs get completed that day instead of 5 as a result. But it is also true that the 4 jobs may be done with a greater attention to detail. Ever have a maintenance worker track filth into your residence with reckless abandon? What is the value of a more rested, present, and thoughtful worker?<p>You may argue that for a plumber, there is no value added in that. But I would argue that the value is there, even though the business owner can&#x27;t extract it as revenue. It is there in the quality of the work, the happiness of the worker, and the happiness of the customer. It makes for a better world, and if you value your employees and customers as people, you&#x27;ll see that interests are aligned.<p>All of that said, the economy is a thing. If your business is in a highly competitive market, it&#x27;s easy to wind up with thin margins in a race to the bottom. But if that&#x27;s the case, is it not the responsibility of the business management&#x2F;ownership to either find a way to be competitive short of exploiting workers, or otherwise exit the market and pursue another venture?<p>At the lowest level, workers will be trained for and work the jobs that are available to them, and the jobs available will be dictated as a function of the the local demand for that service or product. If a small, poorly run, exploitative plumbing company can&#x27;t find the margins to operate because they are competing with better services, they should cease to exist. The demand will remain the same, and their exit from the market place will result in growth for their competitors, and the jobs will be recreated.<p>If you are a plumber by trade and run your own plumbing company and can&#x27;t find a way to exist without exploiting your workers, you should exit the market as a business owner and work for another company.  Otherwise, your business isn&#x27;t plumbing, but exploitation itself.')
