We also have Slack channels in case they have problems.<p>Why we leave them alone: because I don&#x27;t like it when someone immediately engages us asking us a bunch of questions when we start using something, or try and up-sell right when I&#x27;m discovering the product. I also don&#x27;t like energetic chatbots popping up on different tabs of the same website, making all kinds of sounds wanting to get my attention to help me. Back off, I&#x27;ll close that site and will not visit it again.<p>We give people time so we could at least observe what&#x27;s broken. Did the person not start using the product immediately? Why? Was the user unsuccessful accomplishing a key task with a key feature of the product? Why? Is it a problem of discoverability, or is it just that it is not our target user? How can we improve that either way?')
