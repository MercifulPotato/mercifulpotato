Ironically, NTT contributing to a no-bullshit rock-solid open source tool like Postgres is par for the course -- it&#x27;s great that they&#x27;re pushing innovations inside Postgres, but technically from an outside lens it&#x27;s a conservative place to invest.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.postgresql.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;NTT" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.postgresql.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;NTT</a>')
