I have one and was able to write and upload MicroPython programs from Linux. The calculator simply appears as a USB storage device when plugged in and you drop text files in the right directory. No other calculator brand I&#x27;ve found can be interfaced with using Linux. You can also write or edit Python programs on the calculator, although it&#x27;s not a good experience, it is possible.<p>Oh, the fx-CG50 is also powered by AA&#x27;s, thus making it an eternal device.')
