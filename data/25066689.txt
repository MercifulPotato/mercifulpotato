There was a point where it seemed like Geocities was ubiquitous and would be around forever, and now it&#x27;s gone.  Internet services don&#x27;t have a great track record for longevity.  When YouTube finally goes kaput, much of its content will likely be lost, since I don&#x27;t see Google going through the effort of offering archivists a dump.<p>Though, I&#x27;m kinda skeptical that even much digital data will last for centuries, unless formats and storage media ossify at some point on some long-term stable standard.  The trend towards cloud storage makes things even more precarious.')
