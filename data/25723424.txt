INCLUDING among facebook&#x2F;twitter. Both floating unverified stories and suppressing stories that haven&#x27;t been proven false.<p>&gt; explicitly sow discord<p>again... all the same is allowed from the left. Biden is allowed to claim &quot;police treat BLM worse&quot; when facts say the opposite... details that go against &quot;trump mob violent&quot; (IE antifa&#x2F;blm individuals and groups in the &quot;mob&quot;, cops letting protestors in, etc) are suppressed...<p>You want a slippery slope? allowing &quot;facebook and twitter&quot; to determine truth is THE slippery slope. They are biased and have been proven wrong repeatedly.<p>There is no &quot;trying to climb out&quot;. Giving them unfettered power is digging the hole deeper.')
