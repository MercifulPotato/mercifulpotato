This not a problem of reading comprehension or not understanding hyperbole or sarcasm. The problem is Bannon himself ruled out the figurative, hyperbolic meaning of the saying when he said it. Here&#x27;s the complete quote:<p>&quot;Second term kicks off with firing Wray, firing Fauci. Now I actually want to go a step farther...I’d actually like to go back to the old times of Tudor England, I’d put the heads on pikes&quot;.<p>So please explain to me. What does &quot;heads on pikes&quot; mean if the person who said it has discounted the &quot;fire in disgrace&quot; interpretation of the saying? This is a serious question. What do you think it <i>really</i> means, taking the entire quote into context?<p>(funnily this is a rare instance where a quote that sounds fine out of context takes on a sinister note when surrounding quotes are included)<p>EDIT: I see downvotes, but no answers to what I thought was a very simple question.')
