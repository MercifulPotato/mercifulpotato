As far as I can tell, tipping is justified by guilt-tripping everyone by saying &quot;the food industry doesn&#x27;t pay its workers enough so it&#x27;s your responsibility to make up for the difference&quot; instead of saying &quot;the food industry needs to pay its workers a real wage and give customers the real price&quot;. If tip is not optional, then make it not optional, but don&#x27;t guilt-trip people into feeling required to do something optional.')
