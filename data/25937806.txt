There is nothing special about a whole foods plant based diet, except that it is like infinitely more healthy than the standard American &quot;diet&quot; (or you could also call it &quot;slow and painful way to die&quot;).<p>The problem is that vegan or vegetarian diets will scare away many people for no good reason.<p>Anyway, if you want something that actually works, look at the AIP diet: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thepaleomom.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thepaleomom.com&#x2F;</a><p>But yeah in general I agree. It&#x27;s pretty amusing how the HN crowd talks about measuring and temporary fixes like &quot;intermittent fasting&quot; but not at all about actually ending the poisoning by food... Yeah sure, you can do all sorts of stuff to prolong your life while stuffing yourself with poison. However the most effective way is still not to eat the god damn poison in the first place.
