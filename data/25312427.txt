If everyone who was going to die in March dies in the first week of March, but none die in the remaining three weeks, this will show a death spike whilst the number of monthly deaths is unchanged. If someone at the end of their natural lifespan dies a few weeks earlier or later than usual, this is not a national concern.<p>2019 was a weak flu season.<p>We need to examine this data across broader time scales to avoid the hysteria we are currently experiencing.')
