Open file manager, click any file and you are there. There isnt much for &quot;collaboration&quot; when you can just talk face to face.<p>I really want to use nextcloud for managing files but I could not find a satisfactory answer.<p>Oh, I have a daily file backup meaning I can get any copy of a file from last year so that is covered.')
