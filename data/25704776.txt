If all you wanted was Linux (or often &quot;Ubuntu compatible&quot;) then why not just have a raw Makefile?<p>It doesn&#x27;t log what it attempted, or why it failed.<p>It can&#x27;t find out how to link binaries (always awesome to set up som execsnoop (because no logs, remember) only to see that it tries to link with &quot;-llibfoo&quot;. In what world could that be correct?. And again it doesn&#x27;t log how and why it chose that)<p>I could go on, but it&#x27;s too much for a comment field.')
