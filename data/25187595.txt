But many cars have been stolen just by tampering with the lock.<p>As a nascent technology for cars as is this one, it is expected to have some flaws. I imagine that when locks were designed they were not the securest thing in world to protect your stuff.<p>Of course we can do better in terms of security, there is always room to improve. It looks like there is a great flaw here that could get a fix, but I would not dismiss this technology just because of this.<p>Where there is a lock there will always be a key.')
