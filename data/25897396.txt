One being mRNA and the other an inactivated virus or vector vaccine(each with their respective adjuvant) - would we get a synergism? One that might give a final response that is better then either?\nOr would we end up with a 75% or lesser response?\nI think an analysis of her antigenic state via blood sameples over the next 3 months would be worth looking at.\nWe have seen that coronus virus vaccines fade in efficacy, so a synergistic approach mighe have merit. The Russian Sputnik vaccine uses two  different adenoviruse vector for shot one and shot two. The theory being that the human adaptive immune response might suppress the initial adenovirus vector if it sees it in shot two - that is their theory. Russia has capable immunologists and they whould not be tarred with any cold war aspects.')
