Because I took time to learn how it worked, not just make believe.<p>Yes, and:<p>&gt; <i>why I started taking too long in doing any tasks</i><p>I actually test my code, which makes me appear <i>A LOT</i> slower than my &quot;fast&quot; coworkers. So while I rarely do rework, my apparent &quot;velocity&quot; (Agile FTW) looks much worse.<p>I mean actual tests. Including <i>negative</i> tests. Which requires knowing how the system I&#x27;m changing actually works.<p>My last few gigs, I don&#x27;t recall any one else testing their code, much less doing negative testing.<p>Multiple times, coworkers will discover that their code in production didn&#x27;t actually work. Could never work. Ever. Like the &quot;cache&quot; which never updated its entries.<p>One of the curses of having been a QA Manager, doing actual QA &amp; QC &amp; Test, is I&#x27;m embarrassed when my code doesn&#x27;t work. Which has become a career limiting character flaw.')
