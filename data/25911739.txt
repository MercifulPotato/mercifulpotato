Original developer owns all copyrights (CLAs).<p>2. There&#x27;s no other contributor but the original developer.<p>MPLv2 and EPLv2 resist close sourcing the already open sourced bits to the same extent as xGPL, except xGPL is intrusively more viral than these two.<p>Also, I read somewhere that GPL lets one impose strange restrictions:<p>1. A vendor distributes binary of GPLd code to &quot;X&quot; (among other non GPLd things), and can impose upon &quot;X&quot; that if &quot;X&quot; does share vendor&#x27;s GPL code without approval, &quot;X&quot; would breach contract (not necessarily of GPLd code, but of other non-GPLd things).<p>2. A vendor  &quot;rents&quot; &#x2F; &quot;lends&quot; binaries to &quot;X&quot;, in which case the vendor doesn&#x27;t have to share the binary&#x27;s GPLd code.<p>IANAL.<p>Edit: Clarification.
