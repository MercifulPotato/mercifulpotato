At least on the enterprise end (which is presumably where GCP wants to make a significant chunk of its revenue), sales can be equally driven by what&#x27;s essentially &quot;ship shiny&quot;, it&#x27;s just that the rewards are even more immediate (collect commission).<p>Salespeople will gladly hound engineering teams to pound out an MVP for whatever their particular prospects want this quarter, and a shiny MVP is often enough to close a deal so long as it holds up in a demo with managers whomever has purchasing power. Once that&#x27;s done, sales is happy to forget about that product, or at least convince themselves that it working in a demo means it will work well in production (they lack the technical competence to see the inevitable holes that will appear down the road if the MVP isn&#x27;t developed past minimum viability).<p>If next quarter&#x27;s customers want a different set of features, well, sales will push for those, often to the detriment of fleshing out existing functionality or ensuring they&#x27;re stable and maintainable. They&#x27;re insulated from any pain that results from half-baked products if the people tasked with actually using products aren&#x27;t those with purchasing power, and in the enterprise context, they usually aren&#x27;t, and are themselves insulated from line workers who could tell them they&#x27;ve essentially bought a lemon, or more the promise of functionality instead of actual functionality.')
