The &quot;shipping beats perfecting&quot; mantra is very much at play here. This is due to the amount of time it would take to achieve parity. At the end of the day, the new solution ends up looking like a step-back.<p>Such a practice combined with the mentality that software engineers should do their own dev-ops can easily lead to an environment of spaghetti applications where every developer working on the new platform does things slightly different because the replacement solution wasn&#x27;t complete and had to be addressed by countless band-aids by engineers across the band of talent.<p>Furthermore, for the features that were able to achieve parity, you&#x27;re now forcing your entire organization to re-learn the new development process. The docs our abysmal and the software engineers that developed the original solution have moved on since the hard work of &quot;productionalization&quot; remains and they&#x27;re not interested in that.')
