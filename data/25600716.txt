Perhaps that all do that(?), but it&#x27;s noticeable when I&#x27;m pasting in a URL and want to change the beginning part of the URL.<p>Example: server-abc.example.com, need to change to server-def.example.com - changing the A then moves the cursor to after the .com, which is also beyond the end of the input box, and thus invisible.')
