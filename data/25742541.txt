Anything can be interpreted as a computational process.<p>Searle: &quot;Thus for example the wall behind my back is right now implementing the Wordstar program, because there is some pattern of molecule movements which is isomorphic with the formal structure of Wordstar. But if the wall is implementing Wordstar then if it is a big enough wall it is implementing any program, including any program implemented in the brain.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s why Searle asks &quot;who is the user?&quot; At some point things have to stop being observer relative and have an intrinsic meaning or essence of their own.<p>&gt; Got one: the brain!<p>That&#x27;s circular reasoning. The point is that qualia are not something which, in principle, can be the subject of computation. There is no way to represent the fullness of sensation itself, like the redness of red or the softness of silk, as information. So how can our brains be &quot;computing&quot; it?')
