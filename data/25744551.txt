I&#x27;m not saying that the difference is huge, just that I&#x27;ve noticed it. The Americans I&#x27;ve worked with seem to get a little bit more done, generally speaking, than the Canadians. Not enough to make up for the difference, but still. And of course we&#x27;re talking about distributions of productivity here. One of the fastest developers I&#x27;ve ever worked with was French Canadian.<p>I know Americans that worry about healthcare costs even if they have healthcare insurance, but now that I think of it, very few are from California so perhaps the laws or norms are different there.<p>Also, the big companies in the Bay Area aren&#x27;t really what I&#x27;m talking about. Google tried to recruit me almost a decade ago and I turned them down. I don&#x27;t want to be a cog in a machine that big. I&#x27;m comparing your typical 50 person startup to a typical 50 person startup in Canada. The salaries are about the same, but in their respective currencies. I could make $200k USD in America or I could make $200 CAD in Toronto. <i>Shrug</i>.<p>Thanks for the response.')
