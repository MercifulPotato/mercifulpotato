Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609290034, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25573725, text='&gt; But owning shares mean owning a part of a company? Does that mean that when a companyâ€™s shares are invalidated, then the company is now worth zero, and anybody can buy it for a penny? Are the owners forced to sell everything for a penny, or they are allowed to choose, when to sell and at what price?<p>In real life, bankruptcy usually ends up essentially invalidating the shares of a company.  Depending on the method of bankruptcy, the company continues to exist, but the owners of the existing shares loose any claim to anything.  If &quot;invalidate stock shares&quot; of a public company became some kind of sanction for improper behavior, it would probably be coupled with some kind of process to transfer ownership?<p>Invalidating all shares in a company without further process to reallocate ownership is an interesting hypothetical.  I suppose the organization would become something like abandoned property and escheat to the government.')
