There is no &quot;workers rights&quot; argument for a union at Google.<p>It is purely a hard-left power grab, just like at Kickstarter when they unionised for the pure, noble purpose of forcing their employer to allow fundraisers that were threatening violence against conservatives (and thus had been taken down as a ToS violation).<p>As a former Googler myself (not for quite some years), I see this as the inevitable end result of always kowtowing and giving in to ever more radical left extremism. It started with nice but trivial sounding language about how there should be more women in tech, and it ends with hiring endless full time activists like Timnit Gebru.<p>If Google is ever to regain its former glory, it needs a serious purge.  There won&#x27;t be one: instead I suspect it will become a cautionary tale spoken about quietly throughout the world, for many decades to come. The lesson drawn will be: don&#x27;t hire SJWs or else you might end up like Google did, with managers being deposed by a unionised mob demanding endless and ever-spiralling purity warns.')
