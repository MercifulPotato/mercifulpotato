They don&#x27;t have a lot of debt for a car manufacturers? Maybe look up the basic facts next time.<p>The difference is that Tesla had a clear buissness plan to profit that they executed step by step. And the only reason they lost money is because they were expanding production capacity.<p>The analysis of the cars clearly showed that they had great margin on the cars, by far the best in the industry for BEV.<p>The same can not be said for Waymo. Its basically burning money and not even a clear plan on how this can eventually be recaptured. Tesla already makes money with teams that work on this stuff.<p>&gt; In the meantime legacy car manufacturers are catching up with Tesla&#x27;s offering<p>Wait, are you somebody from 2014? Because we have been hearing that since then and its still not true. And even if it were, it would not be a thread for Tesla, its a thread for ICE vehicles.<p>&gt;  but Tesla has lost its top spot in markets it led until recently.<p>Tell that to the 18% global market share in terms of EV sales. Its more if we are talking BEV. And its even more if we are talking revenue. And its even higher in terms of profit.<p>The facts actually say that Tesla has been expanding its global market share. But of course if you only read media articles that say &#x27;in August Tesla fell to second spot in Lithuania&#x27; and BS like that, then you end up being misinformed.<p>Tesla also a has 3 gigantic new factories coming online next year, plus they easily have the best strategy for battery scale.')
