Some enhancements require JS.<p>Mostly built by one dev in (copious) spare time.<p>My motivation is to preserve the knowledge of building compatible Web apps, to allow <i>anyone</i> to access my site, and to embarrass the big websites which complain if your Chrome is a couple versions behind.<p>I believe in aiming for 100%, not 95% accessibility, and here are some scenarios I&#x27;ve tested with:<p>* Older devices like my beloved iPads running iOS 7 and 8, which won&#x27;t upgrade past that.<p>* Vision-impaired users with screen readers.<p>* Library computers stuch with IE and very old Firefox.<p>* Restricted access connections, browsing (and posting, and voting) via Google Translate.<p>* Slow connections and slow devices forced to browser without JS.<p>* Text-mode browsers Lynx and Links which were my only option at the time.<p>* Device without a keyboard available (I have several on-screen keyboards to choose from)<p>* Device without my keyboard layout of choice. With JS, I have two translit options at this time: phonetic-Cyrillic and Dvorak. NoJS support to come.<p>* Retro browsers from a long time ago with their unique beauty and features, e.g. Mosaic, IE3, Netscape, IE6, Opera 3, etc.<p>Some may consider these to be &quot;edge cases&quot; not worth a bother, at less than 0.1% of the visitors. I guess they might also consider a wheelchair ramp unnecessary, since it only gets used like once a year. I consider all these scenarios to be opportunities.')
