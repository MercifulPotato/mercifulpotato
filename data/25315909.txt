Item(by='rndgermandude', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607186915, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25315386, text='I&#x27;d argue that Rust is as portable as C++, if not more so, in the sense that there are no real barriers in the language itself that limit portability. It&#x27;s harder to write un-portable code in Rust than in C++, because a lot less in idiomatic rust is undefined or food-gunable.<p>Of course when it comes to practical portability today then you&#x27;re right as there are plenty more C++ compilers for different platforms than Rust compilers (then again, there are more C compilers than C++ in that regard). This may eventually change over time, tho, but it sure is something to consider today.<p>PS and edit: I don&#x27;t mind you disagreeing with me, but would anybody care to illuminate me as to what your disagreement is about?')
