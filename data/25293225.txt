It has often been said that data is the new currency. Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done. On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts. On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data. At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.<p>We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.<p>We work mostly in Scala and Spark.<p>Apply at hiring-dev@narrative.io')
