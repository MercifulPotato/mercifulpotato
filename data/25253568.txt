That is they see the attempted sacrifice and how much worse (better for the other player) the board is afterwards and don&#x27;t take it. Thus most piece losses are a blunder, and they know that the opponent knows how to win (unless they make a return blunder, which is unlikely).<p>That is at the high levels. I play my down positions, because I&#x27;m not playing anyone that good. I learn a lot and my opponents often enough will make return blunders I can take advantage of. (I typically lose anyway, but it works out often enough to be worth trying)<p>One other consideration: in a tournament situation it might be better to resign and take a nap. You can then come into your next game well rested while your next opponent might be worn out from his last game. A loss and a win is better than a low odds chance at a draw but probably a loss and a game that you play tired and so have decreased odds of a win and might lose as well.  Psychology like this can be important.')
