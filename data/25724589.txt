Item(by='StanislavPetrov', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610339871, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25715436, text='&gt;This is clearly a strawman argument and frankly such an already polarized statement that I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s any point replying.<p>Unfortunately objective reality is extremely polarizing in 2021.  Calling for murder and violence is illegal and should be prosecuted under the law.<p>&gt;The real mystery is why nothing was done to this point.<p>Its no mystery why monopolistic tech giants have moved in unison to silence and censor anyone who opposes the narrative pushed by the ruling elite.  Extremely low-information people take this to mean silencing Trump and his ignorant followers.  Informed people understand that voices across the political spectrum, from advocates for Palestinian rights to journalists who push back against war propaganda, have been silenced by tech giants at the behest of powerful interests.  Fortunately, low-information people who numerically dominate our society and mindlessly bleat the propaganda they have been programmed with have nothing to fear from the new totalitarianism.  Until of course they get branded as a &quot;Nazi&quot; by having the wrong friend or the wrong relative, or being at the wrong place at the wrong time, or being flagged by a nameless, faceless algorithm that has been &quot;flawlessly&quot; programmed to seek out &quot;Nazis&quot; and ensure that they aren&#x27;t able to participate in society.  Of course when you are unpersoned by a tech giant, and your bank account is cancelled, and you are put on a no fly list and you are restricted from participating in society in every other way, you can always contact the powers-that-be and easily get the situation cleared up, just like all the people who are summarily banned from Google or Facebook without an explanation, right?')
