Did you know that Beats Solo 2 have this strange problem where at some point one of the ear-cups would stop functioning on Bluetooth and the way to fix it is to stick some aluminium foil into the audio cable jack? It&#x27;s so ridiculous and I am amazed that someone the internet discovered this solution and the solution is working for the others, including me.<p>Apple&#x27;s products don&#x27;t break down by themselves but Beats do.  My pair had the faux lather completely peeled off, the retracting mechanism on the one side lost its tik and I have aluminium foil stiffed inside the cable jack so I can listen in stereo.<p>They came as a promotion when I bought my Macbook few years back, which still functions flawlessly.')
