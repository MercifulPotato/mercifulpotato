Focused primarily on industries and jobs where minorities overwhelmingly find themselves. School closures favor children from households that can afford a computer for each child; requiring a parent to stay home, namely a responsibility falling upon women who are dropping out of the workplace at an unprecedented rate. So what then happens to those households who don&#x27;t have that privilege? Do you care?   \nThe people paying the cost of public health are children, women, poor, and minorities.<p>Meanwhile I haven&#x27;t given anything up, so it&#x27;s very easy for people like us to sit here while earning our full income from home and say, &quot;Yes, this makes sense. It is totally worth it.&quot; It&#x27;s worth it to us because we aren&#x27;t paying the cost. These stay at home orders and quarantines have overwhelmingly and profoundly impacted people who were already struggling without offering them a path forward. Rest assured the economic uncertainty from shut down was a catalyst behind the BLM protests. The people impacted by shut down are predominantly poor and minorities, and the fact we haven&#x27;t considered how to share that burden before stabbing in the dark is what makes them racist.<p>At the global level, malaria kills almost a million people every single year, mostly children under 4. There&#x27;s no herd immunity and it has and will continue to happen for decades. The WHO anticipates due to new covid travel restrictions on malaria relief workers an additional 3 to 4 hundred thousand deaths due to malaria will occur in Sub Sahara Africa alone. Surely malaria is a pandemic that shadows covid by any measure, except the measure where it overwhelmingly affects poor black people. Meanwhile the second our society is faced with something which mostly kills old white people, the average age of which exceeds the average human lifespan, we&#x27;re cancelling school and creating a generation of illiterate 2nd grade children while their parents are left with no way to feed them.<p>So yeah the reaction to covid has been first and foremost selfish, and given the government is a historic institution of race, these orders are themselves the children of our racism.')
