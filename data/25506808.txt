HDR (10 bits per component) 4K60fps 4:2:2 video is around 10Gbit per second of data.<p>Of course data bandwidth is only a small part of the problem of correctly reproducing an analog signal, but it gives you the orders of magnitude we&#x27;re dealing with.<p>I currently use a cheap ASUS 4K display. It&#x27;s more good enough for coding, but I wouldn&#x27;t trust it for any sort of graphical work. The viewing angle is pretty bad, so depending on what part of the screen I&#x27;m looking at I see colors differently, and some gradients become more or less visible depending on which part of the screen they&#x27;re on. Contrast is pretty bad, making even some videogame display poorly: depending on the location and time of day contrast seems always too high or too low.<p>You can buy a good sub $100 pair of earphones and a sub $50 DAAC and they&#x27;ll be good enough to do 99% of any audiophile work you could ever want to do reliably. If you want to do serious graphics work without having to constantly adjust for your display you&#x27;ll have to go for something a lot more expensive than an entry-level monitor.')
