If you want a toaster, then google &quot;Toaster X review&quot;. If all you  can find is reviews on sales sites, ignore them. If you can find an in-depth review on toaster-aficionado.com with full disclosure of sponsorships etc - great.<p>People are just lazy to expect to see a set of stars on a product page informing them on whether a product has good quality or not. Just give up that expectation.')
