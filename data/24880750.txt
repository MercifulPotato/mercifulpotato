Their FAQ [0] says things like:<p>&gt; How do I determine how many messages are in queue?<p>&gt; This isn&#x27;t possible. [...] rather than provide incorrect information the library avoids providing any view into this data.<p>&gt; How can I retrieve a list of all connected peers?<p>&gt; This is not supported.<p>Those kinds of decisions are very scary for production environment. We&#x27;ve had to debug network connectivity problems before, and it just possible what all the interfaces Linux kernel provides. I cannot imagine doing it with library which hides stuff from you on purpose.<p>[0] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.zeromq.org&#x2F;area:faq" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.zeromq.org&#x2F;area:faq</a>')
