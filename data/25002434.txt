Just type in your code, hit run and (assuming you haven&#x27;t made any errors) it simply works.<p>Yes, these tools might not be the most robust ever, or suitable for all problems, but they do allow you to get up and running <i>very</i> quickly, with the minimum of boilerplate and ceremony. If what you mainly want to do is get people into computers by making objects fly around the screen and blow up, they&#x27;re absolutely perfect.')
