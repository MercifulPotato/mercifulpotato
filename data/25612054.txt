Churches, charities and other non-profits are also exempt.<p>Just to confirm - am I reading this correctly in that, this massive corporate secrecy legislation does not apply to the vast majority of publicly traded corporations in the US? If they had just not included those exemptions, this would have been extremely beneficial for everyone right?<p>Why would we want to allow anonymous corporate shell organizations which are deemed to hide funds if they are tied well known US corporations, as opposed to some shady criminals? Isnâ€™t the crime the same either way?')
