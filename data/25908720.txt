It&#x27;s not a crazy thing to ask for when you&#x27;re launching literally hundreds of satellites into LEO.<p>Plus, the last thing SpaceX wants is a news story about killer satellites raining debris on innocent citizens.  Remember that each satellite launched has to be deorbited eventually, so if they&#x27;re launching dozens of sats per month they&#x27;ll eventually be deorbiting dozens of sats per month.  If they don&#x27;t fully burn up each one will have a chance of hitting someone.  Sure the chance may be very small, but when you&#x27;re rolling the dice dozens or hundreds of times per month eventually you&#x27;re going to land on snake eyes.')
