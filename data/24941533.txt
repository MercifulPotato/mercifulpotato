It was one of the few shows that I was really excited about.<p>Am I going to cancel my Netflix subscription? Probably not, they still have all the Star Trek franchises where I am, and Friends.<p>Given that I&#x27;m almost never in a country where I can watch the broadcast television (digital nomad), streaming is the only option.<p>Would love a (legal) service that allowed me to watch AU&#x2F;UK TV from anywhere in the world. Currently it&#x27;s possible to do this sometimes with the channel apps and a VPN, but this is a gray area at best.<p>I get that there are content licensing issues, but the shows that I&#x27;m mostly interested in don&#x27;t really have these problems. Things like the Great British Bake Off don&#x27;t really make it outside the UK.<p>I also get that the advertising is focused on local audiences a lot of the time, but surely this is solvable with streaming.')
