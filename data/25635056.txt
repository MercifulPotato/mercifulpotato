Or the person behind this is 150 years old and was living under a stone, or is someone that obviously has 0 knowledge about Blockchain”<p>“maybe try to properly host an html page before advising multi billion businesses...”<p>“I feel like these analyses are always very well researched and set-out, but the authors lack any formal qualifications at all.
