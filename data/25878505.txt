The L4 and L5 points are nominally self stable, if you put something there it won&#x27;t wander off. (this isn&#x27;t true of the L1 point which is more dynamic). To do station keeping you need reaction mass and working thrusters. That level of infrastructure requires some maintenance, whereas you could put an empty&#x2F;abandoned ISS in the L4 or L5 point and it would just sit there for no additional cost.')
