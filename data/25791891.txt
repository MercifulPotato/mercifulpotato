For most websites running in 1 datacenter that means a massive population of the world is going to feel that latency.<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not sold on using LV and websockets for everything (such as transitioning from page A to B, etc.). Hotwire Turbo Drive &#x2F; Frame uses HTTP which means you can cache responses and send back 304s when the content doesn&#x27;t change. HTTP feels like the right protocol to do this, and then you can save Websockets for when you need to broadcast relatively small amounts of new &#x2F; updated &#x2F; removed content to 1 or more connected clients. That&#x27;s what the Hotwire model provides.')
