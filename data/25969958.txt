Some might have some form of feed-in tarriff with solar on the roof, but that&#x27;s totally not the same.<p>Secondly - there is not enough information here to provide real advice - do you mean that you are normally connected to the grid, but need to survive an interruption of 24 hours? In that case the generator suggestion might make sence. Or do you mean that it is a total off-grid location that needs to be self-sufficient, in which case the generator idea is idiotic.<p>Just saying &#x27;Africa&#x27; is not enough, look for solar irradiance map and and figure out your annual solar incidence. That will inform how you size your solar panels - their power rating are given under standard incidence of 1000W &#x2F; m2, so you can basically multiply annual irradiance to figure out how much power they will collect in a year.<p>For example a single 300W panel in the middle of Sudan will give you 720 kwh per year, or ~ 2KW&#x2F;h per day. Same panel in Gabon will givey ou half as much. Then you have to account for seasons, in UK we get almost 8 times less sun in winter than in summer - you can&#x27;t compensate for seasons with batteries, so you need more panels.<p>Batteries compensate for periods of bad weather and nights - they need to be sized according to weather and importance of the load: what happens if there is some unusual bad weather and power runs out, how important is the load? Are we going to be stuck without a TV, or is someone&#x27;s life on the line? There is also a balancing act - you can compensate for bad weather by getting more panels or more batteries.  Example of a battery bank: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.photonicuniverse.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;catalog&#x2F;full&#x2F;359-24kWh-48V-500Ah-AGM-deep-cycle-battery-bank-with-metal-racking-24-x-2V-batteries.html?gclid=CjwKCAiApNSABhAlEiwANuR9YA6_oD-YHj87AvgmvyHuWZErHJUwErK-oN75BOENTR9OEadDrTI2yBoCfMoQAvD_BwE" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.photonicuniverse.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;catalog&#x2F;full&#x2F;359-24kWh-4...</a><p>Then there are furhter spesifics -&gt; is space at a premium? Is the load DC or AC? With DC you don;t need an inverter and you avoid losses.<p>Here is a UK centric calculator, just to sanity check some numbers: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;energysavingtrust.org.uk&#x2F;tool&#x2F;solar-energy-calculator&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;energysavingtrust.org.uk&#x2F;tool&#x2F;solar-energy-calculato...</a><p>Generally you will have local firms that specialise in installing solar and they will do a better job of providing advice than NK.')
