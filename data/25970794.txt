Simply stating <i>that</i> it costs resources, or even just stating <i>how much</i> resources it costs, is completely meaningless on its own.<p>Pixar movies cost resources, prolonging life with medical treatment costs resources, chocolate candy bars cost resources, operating the Olympic Games costs resources.<p>In each case, various people believe the resource costs are worth it to get the thing that is produced. Same for bitcoin, same for ads.<p>You can’t <i>just</i> say they cost resources. If you’re advocating these things shouldn’t exist, you either need to get into the specifics of why they offer value but just not enough to offset their resource costs, or why they don’t offer value, <i>and</i> persuade others to agree with you.<p>Judging by the success of ads and bitcoin, I think, “these things consume resources” is a pretty weak and useless argument. It would not matter if the resource costs were astronomical or tiny, it’s a specious chain of reasoning <i>in principle</i>.')
