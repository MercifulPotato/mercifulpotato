He goes so far as to even say: &quot;I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be unwise.&quot; I am quite sick of the usage of the paradox of tolerance being used as an attack against a free, pluralistic society.')
