If your keys are named the same in both tables, say `user_id` then you can simply say<p><pre><code>  SELECT *\n  FROM parent\n  JOIN child USING (user_id)\n</code></pre>\nI personally think naming your primary keys with their full name instead of calling all of them `id` or `key` is better practice also.')
