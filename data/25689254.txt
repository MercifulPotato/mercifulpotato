Item(by='umvi', descendants=None, kids=[25689369], score=None, time=1610134756, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25689051, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t know how many people need to storm the capitol under the instructions of the loser of a recent election<p>Not OP, but I will stop thinking people are hysterical if they can provide a single shred of evidence that the people who stormed congress were &quot;under the instructions of [Trump]&quot;. A tweet, a video, anything that proves the storming of congress was a pre-meditated move by Trump to stop the electoral count.<p>Saying &quot;oh, well Trump didn&#x27;t come out and say it, but he chose dog-whistle terms that activated his sleeper agents&quot; isn&#x27;t going to cut it.<p>Also the part that is rich is the implication that a rag tag handful of protestors have the ability to overthrow the government just because they broke into a building for a few hours.')
