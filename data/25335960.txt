You&#x27;re already up to giving away half of what you make in California.<p>If you make enough in regular income that essentially all of your income is taxed at the maximum marginal federal and state, sure.<p>But virtually no one does that , one, because, first, you have to make a huge amount of income for that to be the case, and, second, if you make enough income for that to be the case, you probably have plenty of opportunity to structure how you make income so that, again, it&#x27;s not. (Of course, while France’s top marginal income tax rate is “only” 45%, it makes a lot more of it&#x27;s revenue from non-regular-income taxes than anyplace in the US, with a 20% standard VAT rate and a 42.2% top tax rate, including surtaxes and social charges, on capital gains.)<p>&gt; Meanwhile you have to pay taxes on physical property like your house, and your house is valued at 7 figures if you live in the Bay Area<p>You don&#x27;t have to pay full-value on the house except in the year you bought it, assuming market appreciation of &gt; 2%&#x2F;annum because prop 13.<p>&gt; Finally, there was a VAT the last time I lived there<p>There has never been a VAT in any part of California. There is a sales tax, which is not a VAT, which is not a VAT, and the maximum sales tax rate in the state is 10.25%.')
