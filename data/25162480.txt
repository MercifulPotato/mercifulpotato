At no time does Apple claim it&#x27;s a Bluetooth speaker.  If someone wants to believe it&#x27;s a Bluetooth speaker, that&#x27;s their fault for failing reading comprehension.<p>I don&#x27;t expect Apple to put a big red sticker on HomePod boxes reading, &quot;THIS IS NOT A BLUETOOTH SPEAKER!&quot; any more than I expect an electric car to have a big red sticker on it reading, &quot;THIS WILL NOT RUN ON DIESEL FUEL!&quot;')
