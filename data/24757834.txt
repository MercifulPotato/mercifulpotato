And in the neighborhoods springing up around here, they are using pre-fab framed walls (still using wooden studs (which are cheap and plentiful), but they arrive on site as whole walls).<p>Before framing, there&#x27;s site prep, foundation pours (probably some early HVAC and plumbing as well), floor joists, and floor sheeting. After framing, there&#x27;s sheeting (the outside), roofing, putting in windows&#x2F;doors, waterproofing (can be avoided with some more expensive sheeting options), and siding (which includes caulking the edges of the siding, and around any wall penetration).<p>Then there&#x27;s insulating the outer walls, framing the interior walls, plumbing, electrical, HVAC, electrical, carpeting&#x2F;flooring, drywall, trim, paint, landscaping... and probably a dozen other things I don&#x27;t know about.<p>Optimizing only the framing - something that&#x27;s already been pretty well optimized - isn&#x27;t going to change prices much. What&#x27;s really needed is a way to be ship entire finished walls.<p>(Seriously, look up some videos about &quot;Larry Haun&quot; and watch him and his brother frame an entire floor in under a day, using mostly <i>hand tools</i>).')
