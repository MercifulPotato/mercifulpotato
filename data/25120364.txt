Lin Zexu [1] carried out destruction of opium stock at Humen [2]. It was mostly successful in destroying the flow of opium from one its major import source. And disturbed the traders. Eventually results into the 1840&#x27;s Opium War which requires Britain intervene [3].<p>You describe what happened but not why. Merchants inside and outside of China wanted to exchange goods and imperial China wanted to restrict this. War was the result.<p>&gt; one can reasonably state that Chinese people in 1840s are totally incapable of independent thinking<p>It&#x27;s interesting that you say this because this is China&#x27;s <i>current</i> position, that Chinese people in 2020 are too dumb for democracy. It&#x27;s just another excuse used by those in power to subjugate the population.<p>Embracing people&#x27;s lack of knowledge and encouraging them to find good ideas on their own is a feature, not a bug.')
