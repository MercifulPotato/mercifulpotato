Investors are a whole different story, and it&#x27;s wise to de-couple financial considerations from job satisfaction as much as possible.  Being resentful that my work passively benefits investors would be a silly distractionâ€”they will be there seeking returns via investment regardless of where I seek employment. What really matters to my financially is my own salary, equity and the upside of the company where I am devoting most of my time.')
