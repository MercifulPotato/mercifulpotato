It&#x27;s about using objects. You don&#x27;t have to define new classes to do OOP. Just use existing classes and objects polymorphically!<p><pre><code>    url_layout.format()\n    resp.raise_for_status()\n    resp.json()\n    session.add()\n</code></pre>\nAll those calls are dynamically dispatched - the essence of object oriented programming. This is what allows you to not worry about:\n * which string implementation `url_layout` uses\n * which HTTP protocol, encryption, authentication, chunking `resp` uses\n * what database is connected to `session`<p>You cannot avoid using objects - that&#x27;s how all modern operating systems work.<p>Using classes without the need to call them polimorphically just as a nice namespace for methods is a separate issue.')
