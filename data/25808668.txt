He would have had to actually want the organ as the instrument in the piece for how it is, not just for offering a greater range than an early pianoforte.<p>So it could well be that he would have preferred to use the organ&#x27;s range earlier but just not wanted that instrument in his music. And that&#x27;s not necessarily an insult to pipe organs - I think they sound lovely, watching somebody play well can be as enjoyable as almost any other instrument, and I&#x27;m a big fan of them in their place. But their place is pretty niche really - there&#x27;s lots of lovely (but religious) choral works that use one, due to churches historically, and there are nice things written for organ. But it&#x27;s pretty rare for organ to be the keyboard instrument of choice in orchestral music, chamber music, etc')
