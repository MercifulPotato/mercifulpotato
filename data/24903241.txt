It&#x27;s not a truth-seeking process, it&#x27;s psychological manipulation.  A growing minority of people are recognizing those tactics for what they are and rightly rejecting them.<p>And for the record, unconscious bias training has not been shown to have any correlation with actual discriminatory behavior, and the the researchers who developed the test reject how it is being used in these training sessions.')
