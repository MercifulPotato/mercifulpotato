You could - if you chose to - make quite a nice income out of sending out phishing emails on our open email system. Likewise for randomsware, only more so. And so on.<p>iOS may have other flaws, but worrying that your iPhone is going to be locked by a Bitcoin hacker isn&#x27;t one of them.<p>And realistically, users <i>are</i> idiots - at least technically. We&#x27;ve all heard of PC users who click on every random thing and end up with twenty-odd toolbars and almost every possible virus. The only reason phones aren&#x27;t the same is because security is locked down.<p>These are consumer devices. They are not hacker devices. If you want an open hacker device, go build one and see if you can persuade people to buy it.<p>You won&#x27;t - of course - because in userland locked down security is a feature, not a bug. And users care more about <i>not</i> having to pay a ransom to unlock their own phones than they do about running with root privileges. Not having to think about this is <i>valuable.</i><p>Having said all that, there&#x27;s definitely room to negotiate the costs of all of this, and also to open up selected services that can be proven to be secure. But those costs, the access to useful non-risky APIs for devs, and access for third party service providers, are all <i>different issues</i> to the core validity of the model itself.')
