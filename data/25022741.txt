I think he might not have pushed the green new deal so hard by himself, maybe. My point is this: For somebody sympathetic to the Democrats, Biden appears as a rather centrist person. He isn&#x27;t advocating for abolishing private health-insurance for example. But if you ask a Republican voter (not even a Trumpist), I&#x27;m not sure they would say the same. Or they believe that the party would force him to be more left.<p>I&#x27;m not so sure with regard to the votes. 2016, yes, I believe many people on the left were not happy with Clinton and did not vote. This time, we had record vote participation, and I believe that&#x27;s from both sides, so the result should reflect the true political will in America. It&#x27;s likely that the coasts would prefer a more progressive candidate, but I think on average, the US is somewhere between Biden and Romney.<p>I like the picture of the pendulum. While Obama was quite centrist, the USA made great advances in personal liberties. Gay marriage and so on. The world was changing too fast for many. Or they felt that their problems weren&#x27;t in the focus as much, or at all. So the pendulum swung back, and we had Trump. We need to dampen the swinging to make steady progress, and I think Biden might be good at that, maybe especially because of his age.<p>Personally, I am somewhat wary of some of the more progressive ideas. I&#x27;m not a big fan of single-payer healthcare, seeing the results in England. I generally think that a market-run system is better than a government-run, but that markets need firm rules set by the government. ACA was pretty good, but long term, America has to get away from the employment-coupled insurances. And covering preexisting conditions necessarily means mandate (or mandate through the backdoor).')
