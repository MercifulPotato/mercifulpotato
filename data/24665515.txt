Item(by='Skunkleton', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601663295, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24658331, text='&gt; Marriage on the other hand is very personal - it would be ridiculous to expect people to marry into other races&#x2F;castes&#x2F;ethnicities as the norm - it never happens that way in any part of the world no matter how advanced - people generally prefer the partnership of people that they share most in common with.<p>This mentality is the exact point GP is trying to make. If your preference is for people of your own caste&#x2F;race&#x2F;etc. then those divisions will be reinforced. I don&#x27;t think anyone here is saying that you shouldn&#x27;t marry based on your own preferences. Just that people not considering caste as part of marriage decisions would be a good signal that caste is losing relevance.')
