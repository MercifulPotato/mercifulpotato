Although Gamaleya is now working with AZ&#x2F;Oxford to see if substituting one of their doses for one of Oxford&#x27;s will produce much better results, which I never would have expected.<p>This is based on the theory that the immune system response to Oxford&#x27;s virus vector is mostly negating the benefit of the second dose taken 21 days after the first.  Gam-COVID-Vac gets around this by using different viruses for each dose, and has 90% efficacy results from their Phase III trial.  Unfortunately, no one can yet manufacture it in anything like bulk quantities, but they have set up manufacturing partnerships with a whole bunch of countries from India to South Korea.')
