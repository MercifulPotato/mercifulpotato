But I don&#x27;t think the reasons can be waved away as simply &quot;lack of regulation&quot;. There are dozens of variables: some related to the different market environment, like having to support dozens of languages to reach the whole European market vs being able to reach more than 300 million users just with english in America; some related to European bureaucracy making harder to start businesses and raise capital; some related to the culture in the US being more entrepreneurial...<p>In any case, American companies being better at disrupting the market doesn&#x27;t really take away from the fact that it&#x27;s lead to a monopolistic situation, and that said situation is having unwanted consequences.<p>&gt; Google is better at ranking search results than any parliament or regulator on the planet.<p>The point is not that a regulator should rank results, but that there should be a set of enforced good practices regarding how the search&#x2F;ranking system and the company&#x27;s personal interests can interact, how should the data extracted from users be handled, etc.<p>In theory, if we end up deciding that social networks, messaging systems, internet search and the like have become so necessary to consider access to them a basic right, I wouldn&#x27;t be opposed to developing public-funded alternatives freely available to the public.<p>In practice however, I fully agree that the chances of public bodies feature matching private alternatives are almost nil, and that&#x27;s just one of the many points that make it unfeasible. So we have to settle for making sure that private actors play clean, and possibly funding potential alternatives to help the market be more diverse.')
