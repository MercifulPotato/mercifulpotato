They have their terms of service, but the terms of service have some ambiguity.  In fact, Witted deliberately left some ambiguity, for two reasons.  First, you can&#x27;t absolutely codify human interactions - human communication is too complex.  Second, Witted <i>wanted</i> the ambiguity, because it gave Witted more power.<p>Now President Harris is running for re-election, and she is aware of how much power Witted has.  She wants to rein it in.  Witted therefore finds some grounds for declaring Harris to be in violation of Witted&#x27;s terms of service, and kills her account.  That leaves the Republican candidate, Romney, a channel to voters that Harris can&#x27;t adequately respond to.  Romney wins the election.  (There&#x27;s talk about Witted being biased, but that resonates less with voters than what Romney can do with a Witted feed that Harris can&#x27;t answer.)<p>Now, you say, that shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to happen.  I agree.  But how are you going to stop it, without giving the exact same power to someone else?  And who are you going to trust with that power?  The government?  Absolutely not.  The EU commission?  Equally not.  But who?<p>I assert that there is <i>nobody</i> that you can trust with that power.  But the power already exists, and we&#x27;ve just seen it used.  Now what do we do?  (Preferably before 2024 rolls around...)<p>---<p>[1] Actually, Witted would be a pretty good name for a social media platform.')
