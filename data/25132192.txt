Item(by='arbuge', descendants=None, kids=[25132300, 25143494, 25133213], score=None, time=1605663473, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25130755, text='&gt; Among this powerful elite which include all Central Committee members and provincial standing committee members, the share of women has gone up from a dismal 7.6% to a still-dismal 8.4% from the 18th CC to the 19th CC.  Among the post-62 cohort active in the 19th CC, only 11% of the elite are women.  To be sure, as more cadres in the post-62 cohort enter the vice-provincial elite, the share of women may rise, but it would be surprising if this cohort had more than 15% of women in the end, which, again, is still dismal.  The small share of women among the more promising members of the post-62 cohort suggests that the gender pattern in the CCP elite will continue with the dismal status quo of one female Politburo member at each congress, along with two to four full Central Committee members and a handful of alternate members.  This status quo may well persist until the 22th Party Congress in 2032, based on current trajectories.<p>I count four &quot;dismals&quot; :-)')
