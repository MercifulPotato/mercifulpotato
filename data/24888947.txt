Item(by='Balgair', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603652744, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24886779, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t see any investigation of whether IQ can be altered through nurture (which I think it can).<p>Invert, always invert.<p>Looking at &#x27;nurture&#x27; as a positive action may not cover all the cases of increased IQ. Generally, yes, I think that investing more time into others is going to increase the IQ score (for many reasons). I think this is a great thing we all should invest in.<p>However, there is the edge case where a <i>lack</i> of nurture will also increase it. The adversity is overcome and the person becomes more &#x27;IQ-y&#x27; as a result. Ramanujan come to mind as a perfect example of a person overcoming large adversity to achieve great status.<p>These edge cases aren&#x27;t particularly repeatable, of course, but they are instructive. These people are the very end of the &#x27;long tail&#x27; of these statistical constructs and give great insight into what it takes besides pure luck.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Srinivasa_Ramanujan#Early_life" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Srinivasa_Ramanujan#Early_life</a>')
