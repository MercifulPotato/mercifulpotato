I thought it was bogus and it turns out that it is.<p>I haven&#x27;t been an active investor for 15 years so it took a little time to fire up my investing analysis tools. This is what I found out.<p>Index funds are highly incestuous. There is a high correlation across the top index funds because they largely have the same stocks. The exceptions seem to be reits, oil, foreign, and financial index funds.<p>The rest of the index funds all seem to be heavily weighted in big tech stock.<p>So - if that is true, why not buy the heavily weighted stocks directly and do your own financial analysis on them? For instance, I look at past 5 year sales growth. Then I look at yoy sales growth. Then I look at P&#x2F;S over the last 5 years (to see if it is out of whack). Then I look at PEG over the last 5 years (to see if it is out of whack). Then I look at gross margins. Then I look at dividend yield. All of this data is available for free.')
