You use it to learn a part of the language which needs repetition-based learning, while learning other parts of the language - and experience indeed is a very important focus of that learning process.<p>Also nobody tries to suggest you can learn programming by practicing language keywords.<p>So I don&#x27;t understand what is the problem. We knew this all along, we are using learning by experience for as long as I can remember, nobody even thought of reducing learning to Anki cards.')
