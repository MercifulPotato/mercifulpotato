Microstepping isn&#x27;t &quot;bad&quot;. The biggest issue with hobbyist setups is that they have problems with the higher step frequencies required.  If you have a good controller and driver you should probably go for higher micro stepping resolution.  It will give you smoother motion (less vibrations&#x2F;unintended frequencies) and better positional accuracy.<p>Anyways, for your use case it sounds like that isn&#x27;t relevant.  What positional accuracy do you need?  What screws are you planning to use?  Start there.  Most likely a full or half step setup is more than enough for your purposes and just make sure you set the motion parameters right...  The cheapest solution for X&#x2F;Y positioning is going to be something like fixed voltage (just using some transistors to switch the stepper motor phases) and stepping via software at slow speeds.<p>What&#x27;s your budget?  What&#x27;s your more precise requirements? (working area, accuracy, speed etc.?)  What can you build yourself vs. buy?  Depending on what you need and what you&#x27;re comfortable building it&#x27;s either a trip to your local hardware store or just buy a cheap off-the-shelf 3-axis CNC kit.')
