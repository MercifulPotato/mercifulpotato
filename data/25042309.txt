You can have a lot of core strength and good arms, but if you eat a lot of puddings, the muscle will be covered in enough mass that you&#x27;ll just look fat. (Especially in a portrait you&#x27;re just sitting for, rather than flexing for.)<p>As for incompetent knights, I&#x27;m genuinely confused: how did they survive in the role for any length of time? (Especially when the only talent pool they would have to recruit underlings from are the very same people they&#x27;re oppressing. I always figured competence at protecting the outlying villages—where everyone&#x27;s families live—during invasion, was kinda the reason anyone bothered to work for them at all, rather than towns responding to recruitment attempts exactly the same as invasion attempts, with stoning, boiling oil from the rooftops, etc.)')
