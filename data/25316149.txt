While open source is legally indistinguishable from free software, time has proven that open source software can be designed in non-free ways. Examples:<p>- Bloating codebase so much that it can&#x27;t be audited, extended or forked easily<p>- Tightly controlling the development<p>- Open shims for opaque blobs<p>- Hiding documentation and troubleshooting information<p>Freedom is more about intent than definitions.')
