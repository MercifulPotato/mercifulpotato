They would hate me for wasting their time they could use to learn something practical. To me Vim seems a crazy alien technology of particularly questionable usefulness (even for a keyboard-centric user)<p>I know tons of developers and system administrators that use vim on a daily basis (that includes me).  While I agree that I would not necessarily recommend it for a beginning student, it is entirely unfair to describe it as having &quot;particularly questionable usefulness&quot;, and &quot;only suitable for fun and for looking cool&quot;.  I and many others use vim for real work, not for &quot;looking cool&quot;.<p>Yes, the learning curve is high, and it requires investing some time to learn.  My experience is that the time I spent learning it was well worth the investment.  It&#x27;s not for everyone, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that it not for anyone.')
