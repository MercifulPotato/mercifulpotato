Sure, it has its uses, but if did nothing else, I doubt it would see much use. What&#x27;s extremely, extremely compelling to me personally, though, is that for the price of half a CD a month, I get access to almost everything I&#x27;d ever want to listen to, on all my devices, everywhere, without any friction whatsoever. Even if I really wanted, I could never replicate that with Winamp on my own.<p>As to the rest for your argument, I&#x27;m basically with you and I think you have an important point, I guess you&#x27;ve just made it in a needlessly incendiary way. There are many things to be said in favor of capitalism, but I&#x27;m severely disillusioned with the way the currently-favored brand of capitalism is shaping out on the internet and in computing in general.')
