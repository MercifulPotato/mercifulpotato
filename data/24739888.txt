Because while both want the money, Apple&#x27;s entire argument is predicated on the &quot;privacy and safety&quot; of only going through their payment processing, whilst Epic&#x27;s entire argument is predicated on that requirement being monopolistic and unfair and that third party processors must be allowed.<p>Neither wants the other&#x27;s <i>system</i> to hold, even if the money is being held somewhere until the end of the case.')
