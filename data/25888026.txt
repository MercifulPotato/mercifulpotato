Either we expect GCC 4.9 to produce correct code, or we don&#x27;t. &quot;Mostly correct&quot; is poison, and should be avoided whenever possible.<p>If we expect GCC 4.9 to produce correct code then patches should be backported to GCC 4.9. (I mean, we expect it to produce correct code, right??)<p>If we don&#x27;t expect GCC 4.9 to produce correct code, why are some mainline distributions compiling their kernel with GCC 4.9? Why is the linux kernel accepting bug reports from people who have compiled the kernel with a known buggy version of GCC?<p>The article made the same point - the problem here is that people are running into a GCC bug that was fixed years ago. The two solutions are to either backport GCC bug fixes to gcc 4.9 consistently, or stop depending on gcc 4.9. The kernel devs + gcc authors should pick one. The ambiguity wastes everyone&#x27;s time.')
