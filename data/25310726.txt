I believe shadow banning should be made illegal, but that companies should be free to decide if they want to block certain viewpoints. If a company blocks something like QAnon, then that is part of free market to create a new niche for people that are into fringe conspiracies that allows those viewpoints. Additionally, if a company wants to block liberal ideas then a market can exist for those who share similar ideas. The idea that these companies have to allow all speech is ridiculous, and I don&#x27;t see people trying to enforce the same idea of free speech in other places of business like grocery stores, restaurants, etc where someone could start shouting some conspiracy about Democrats eating babies in the basements and not be asked to leave.')
