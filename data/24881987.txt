This was not a toxic client.<p>I knew exactly how much was in the business bank account.  There were no secrets about the state of the business.  I knew how it had arrived at the state it did as well, and its development and investment history.<p>The developer I was replacing had just died, before the product was ready.  He was a good friend.<p>I could either take it on and try to make it work or not.<p>They weren&#x27;t underpaying due to failure to value me.  They were underpaying because we mutually agreed the project was worth it, and there was the pot of money that there was.<p>So I took on that risk on full knowledge as (replacement) employee #1.  Yes, that&#x27;s a business risk.')
