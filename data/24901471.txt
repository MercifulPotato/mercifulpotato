Item(by='LockAndLol', descendants=None, kids=[24901612], score=None, time=1603746710, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24900692, text='&gt; I get the impression our political generation is systemically mismanaging for at least 20 years, and this crisis is the first of a level that makes it extremely obvious in all our countrys at the same time.<p>The new generation won&#x27;t be any better. There simply aren&#x27;t enough people who care enough to enter politics or do something about the situation. The system hasn&#x27;t changed and the people that enter politics will still largely be those who do it for personal gain.<p>We all like to complain, but the majority won&#x27;t do a thing because it cares more about which series, useless gadget or trend was released recently. And when we (the majority) do go to the polls, we vote for personal gain, not for the good of others.')
