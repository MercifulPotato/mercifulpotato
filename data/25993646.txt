Item(by='matriculate', descendants=None, kids=[25993694], score=None, time=1612212294, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25992735, text='I’m likely going to get downvoted to oblivion but as good as the video player application is, the development experience when trying to incorporate the SDK into your own software is utterly miserable.<p>I’ve given up trying to use it after searching for a solution and not being able to find one and asking in the support forums. I presented a clear description of the issue and example code and was rudely told to not ask developers to write my app for me. It’s happened a few times in exactly the same way over the years. Each time, I foolishly think it will be improved and spend even longer polishing my question, making sure the same old code builds etc. It’s always the same. Miserable.<p>Charitably, I see so many messages along the lines of “I wantz to build video app- pls helpz” which must get tiring but not as disappointing as asking sensible questions and proving source code.')
