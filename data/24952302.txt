The original hummers had a pickup style so hopefully that&#x27;s next.<p>Edit- I&#x27;ve always missed the true small trucks like the 90&#x27;s era rangers and b2000&#x27;s. I feel like that&#x27;s an excellent place for a new ev truck startup to begin. The new rangers and colorados are as big as the old f-150&#x27;s.')
