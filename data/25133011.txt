I would honestly say they are more related than you think.  If you can&#x27;t fit a narrative to your architecture or what you&#x27;re doing, it will be hard to understand.  It&#x27;s important to know the &quot;story&quot; of what you are building: where is the data going?  Who is the user?<p>If you come up with an architecture that is complicated, just keep working on it and editing, like writing, to make it make more sense.  You need good editors &#x2F; code reviewers on both sides, and they will make you a better reader and writer.<p>If you struggle with writing skills (not all people are good at some particular language) I find being able to make a good picture is even more essential.<p>I think one of the things to state is that it&#x27;s not about writing something that sounds important.  It&#x27;s about writing something that people can understand.  Don&#x27;t get too stuck in the &quot;art&quot; part of it.  At least for me, simplicity is beauty.<p>Another way to try this is to sit down with someone and say &quot;explain what this does&quot; and then see what they come up with.  Some people are really good at talking, but not writing.  But being able to explain is almost as good, and sometimes more necessary than writing.')
