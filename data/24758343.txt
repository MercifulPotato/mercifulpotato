Proof that training works is the whole emerging cottage industry around interview preparation that is thriving these days.<p>Perhaps this is a bubble that will burst at some point, but I&#x27;m afraid the bar of ridiculousness will keep raising. If any of the FAANG companies started requiring to complete a marathon in less than 5 hours, they will still find great candidates that will train hard to achieve it.<p>The rationalization after fact would be something like the ability to complete a marathon correlates well with the ability to deliver a project or whatever, but they are just selecting for engineers that will do whatever it takes to get the position, no matter how silly the requirement is.')
