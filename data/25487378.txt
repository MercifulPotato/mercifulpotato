Only the characters are speaking, no influence and manipulation at all by the author. Dialog only, similar to a script for the screen, but without any script hints.<p>Everything happens in your head, you need to be in a flow to catch on. You cannot just put the book away for a while and continue then.<p>And the content is also revolutionary. The kid who exploits wall street and tricks the shenanigans of the business world, is lot of fun. Much more fun than his first, which is more Pynchon alike, very boring.')
