Most of the time it&#x27;s just disappointment, but we will often get a variety of flawed arguments in response to our reasoning, which I get is just frustration that they aren&#x27;t getting their request.<p>Edit for further comments:<p>If you&#x27;re honestly curious on the array of responses, usually it&#x27;s just continual expressions of disappointment that we aren&#x27;t.<p>Some of the more adamant users will do one or more of the following:<p>- insist our data is wrong<p>- insist our prediction is wrong<p>- insist the market is wrong<p>- demand the feature anyways<p>- insist it&#x27;s not that much of a development time sink<p>- ignore all the reasons and just post complaints<p>and of course much more.<p>It&#x27;s normal, of course, and it does tend to be a smaller subset of users, but there are enough that they keep me busy week in and out.')
