What I&#x27;m saying is it&#x27;s complicated, and we (the people &amp; our governments) need to have a discussion around youtube&#x2F;facebook&#x2F;twitter and private companies that are basically used like public utilities. It&#x27;s not their fault, but the fact is there is no real alternative to yt&#x2F;fb&#x2F;twitter unless one wishes to avoid a large part of the human population.<p>Of course youtube can remove whatever it wants, it&#x27;s a private company. This doesn&#x27;t mean that people can&#x27;t find this objectionable, and it doesn&#x27;t mean the only argument has to be &quot;well, just use another company&#x2F;site&#x2F;provider&quot;.<p>I think people here are -reasonably- concerned about YT censoring particular information and the precedent it sets. In this case you and I might agree with YT&#x27;s stance. Will we agree the next time YT decides to take a stance and censors a topic?')
