People use a variety of techniques to get scored higher and there&#x27;s always a certain percentage who will use such rote learning techniques, be it eastern or western.<p>I think what what&#x27;s missing in the discussion is the western focus on individualism as compared to east asian communitarianism. Both have their pros and cons and mutual dislikes.<p>There was a book by 2 high level western&#x2F;eastern women managers in Hewlett Packard that highlights this dichotomy. It&#x27;s a great read.')
