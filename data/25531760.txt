Image recognition may be a distant third, as it could prove very useful as a tool in many domains that have lots of visual data to sift through.<p>Voice recognition is neat, and it is extremely useful in certain niches, but it is generally far inferior to mouse+keyboard or touch or dedicated buttons in all cases where those are practical. It is almost unusable in public spaces. Text-to-speech is mostly in the same boat - extremely useful in some niches, not a game-changer in any way I expect.<p>Text generation is only &quot;realistic&quot; in shape, but for now remains a novelty. Picture generation is the same. They are at best at the level where it already costs pennies to obtain similar texts through human labor. Having conversations in a meaningful way is even farther.<p>Playing Go better than humans is a fun gimmick - an awesome achievement in some sense, but with 0 practical applications outside of Go.<p>Overall, there has been good progress in AI&#x2F;ML, but I don&#x27;t expect we&#x27;ll see any major changes too soon from this. Especially since the idea of actually seeing commercially available self-driving cars has been pushed back a decade or three compared to the initial optimism.<p>I&#x27;d also add that most of the progress in ML&#x2F;AI in the last few years has essentially been of a technological&#x2F;engineering kind. There haven&#x27;t really been that many deep scientific insights, we don&#x27;t necessarily understand any of these problem spaces better. We&#x27;ve just been able to match certain neural net architectures with certain problem spaces, and massively advanced in realistically-available computing power to actually train these nets on enough data.<p>But we haven&#x27;t gotten any new insights into stuff like language from GPT-3, for example. We haven&#x27;t even gotten any new insights into Go from AlphaGo!')
