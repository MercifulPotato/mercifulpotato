In the next few hours of light usage, some more crashes followed.<p>This has been my experience since KDE 4 too pretty much 4 out of 5 attempts i made to check out KDE, including trying KDE Neon (which included weird visual glitches that i never saw before in any desktop environment).<p>Though FWIW my latest attempt is openSUSE Tumbleweed running on my GPD Win 1 (which isn&#x27;t exactly a mainstream device, though it does have an Intel integrated GPU which has open source drivers, which helps a bit) and it seems to work fine there. I do very light use of it however, mainly launching games and such - normally i&#x27;d be using Window Maker, but GPD Win 1 needed a very recent kernel to boot and also RandR to be configured to rotate the screen (the &#x27;native&#x27; screen is actually in portrait mode but the computer uses it in landscape) and i didn&#x27;t want to bother with that at the moment i installed it so i grabbed the first non-Gnome-based rolling distribution that had official support for some form of desktop environment that i expected to have a GUI application to setup rotation... which basically meant KDE :-P.')
