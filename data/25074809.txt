The more knowledge you have, the more powerful it becomes.<p>Vim was my first editor in Linux. Before that I used Borland, VS(Visual studio) and MASM(Microsoft assembler) editors.<p>After learning regular expressions, I felt superman with Vim. I started doing incredible automated work that was impossible or very hard to do in anything else like VS, netbeans or whatever.<p>Then I learned Lisp, so I forced myself to master eMacs. It happened again, I felt super-superman once you understand Lisp and can use it to automate everything on the editor.<p>IDEs are great for starting to program. But if you plan on being a serious programmer I recommend that you download anki and start memorizing Vim or emacs or regular expressions commands.<p>That will make you also a super human, able to do things in way less time that everybody else.')
