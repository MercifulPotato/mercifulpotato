My grandma bought me Monopoly Junior, which was an entirely different game, and I was actually upset by it.<p>Years later, when 3D accelerator cards were coming into existence, I really wanted a 3dfx Voodoo card, since so many games required Glide (OpenGL and Direct3D hadn&#x27;t caught on quite yet) which was a 3dfx proprietary API, and instead I got a Rendition 2200.<p>The article mentions considering what YOU want, but that can backfire.  My dad loved electronic gadgets, and wanted to buy me a GPS device in 2010.  I had to show him how pointless that could have been since I already had an Android and had Google Maps in my pocket.
