Whether this is because Bing users are prone to suicide, or because some people are intentionally skewing auto-suggestions, this does raise a general problem with making your AI models from user data. Microsoft presumably has to censor certain results from the auto-suggest, but even they probably do not have the resources to find ever single instance where something in appropriate shows up.')
