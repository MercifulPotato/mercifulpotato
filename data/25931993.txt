I understand that you may be dogmatic about the desire for open standards, but the evidence is clear it&#x27;s not necessary (even with the EU requiring fast charger interoperability). My opinion is that this is very similar to those railing against software projects who have to go &quot;fair source&quot; instead of &quot;open source&quot; to protect their financial interests from others, and in the same vein, Tesla should be compensated for their investment in infrastructure.<p>If you don&#x27;t want a Tesla, don&#x27;t buy one. No one is forcing people to buy them, or to use their chargers (fast DC or otherwise). If jurisdictions desire Tesla to open their network for others, <i>compensate them for their private investment they&#x27;re demanding they open up</i>.<p>Regardless, I appreciate the conversation and the perspective as an electric vehicle enthusiast.')
