I would go look up lists of top innovative websites in a given month and just be blown away with the moving pieces and interaction.<p>But...from a consulting and a developer perspective, the marginal utility for increasingly artistic and engaging UI seems to be fairly low from a cost&#x2F;ROI perspective.
