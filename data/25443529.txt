It looks like you are managing the cart on the nextjs side. How are you generating the checkout page with the right items? I&#x27;ve resorted to creating a DraftOrder, but those don&#x27;t allow for discount codes so I also had to handle that on my end when creating the draft order. Email in profile if easier.')
