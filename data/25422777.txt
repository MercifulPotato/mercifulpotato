It&#x27;s not <i>wrong</i> to write down passwords. It <i>is</i> wrong to write them down and not secure them. Securing them is the same step that happens (or is intended to happen) with password managers. The passwords are, themselves, encrypted in some fashion so that they&#x27;re not (easily) accessible to others. If these passwords were <i>at least</i> put in a locked cabinet, I&#x27;d have felt better about it. A safe would&#x27;ve been even better (and this is assuming that they needed to be shared, we had security tokens that, if used properly, meant we <i>didn&#x27;t</i> need the passwords at all and each person would have a unique access token for better accountability).<p>It is moronic to write passwords down and stick them underneath the keyboard.')
