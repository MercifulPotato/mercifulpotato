You&#x27;re just restricted to one per table and only on the row key.  Instead you spend time finding the right row keys for each value that you&#x27;re going to want to look up.  Picking bad keys will still lead you to have terrible performance, since you&#x27;ll be looking up the wrong thing to get what you actually want.')
