My woodworking forum should be allowed to have a &quot;no politics&quot; rule. A Christian dating site should be allowed to ban atheists, like me. A social media app should be allowed to ban hate speech -- I don&#x27;t want government making it illegal for there to be communities without hate speech.<p>Unless you&#x27;re suggesting government should just ban hate speech? I don&#x27;t favor that, either, but maybe I should ask for clarity here.')
