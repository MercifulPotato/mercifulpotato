They&#x27;re people too. Their circumstances matter. Also, let&#x27;s not forget that not everyone even in a high-demand area is also high-income. Somebody has to do the &quot;lesser&quot; jobs, and for them housing is <i>even more</i> of a problem. Arbitrarily excluding certain metro areas because &quot;you&#x27;re a techie and can live anywhere&quot; is just counter to reality, and just seems like a way to skew the numbers.')
