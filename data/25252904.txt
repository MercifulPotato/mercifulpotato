I&#x27;ve participated since 2016, but haven&#x27;t yet completed all 25 puzzles, I usually burn out after about day 8-10 (partly due to the curve in difficulty).<p>I&#x27;m based in the UK, so the puzzles get unlocked at ~6AM which gives an hour or two before work if I wake up earlier than usual.<p>I think I&#x27;ll still take part this year, but at a more relaxed pace.')
