I live in Europe, and there are also anti-lockdown Covid-skeptics around here screaming &quot;The goverment has turned authoritarian and is slowly turning us into sheep!&quot; (luckily they&#x27;re in the minority). And surely they are or will be vaccine-skeptics.<p>It seems truth has become subjective. I tried to talk to a QAnon-spouting girl and posted links to Snopes or The Guardian. She said, &quot;Well, MSM is owned by the Rottschilds so you can&#x27;t rely on them to tell the truth.&quot;. I never asked where she read this, but she probably would&#x27;ve replied she figured this out by reading some random Wordpress blog or watching some nutter on YouTube.<p>I thought &quot;So, you believe those sources and think my sources are lying?!?&quot;. But wait, from her point of view, this sentence is also true! One could try asking them to check the reputation of their sources or dig deeper, but it seems this is an exercise in futility. When there are actual doctors arguing against Covid restrictions or publishing flawed studies on hydroxychloroquine, how do we trust who is reputable? (I&#x27;m talking about  Didier Raoult, who now also has conspiracy theorists championing him as someone the French government &quot;ousted&quot; because he wasn&#x27;t towing the party line).<p>Then again, there are utterly stupid conspiracy theories like the Wayfair one: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-53416247" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world-53416247</a> ; the idea that secret cabals would use publicly accessible online shops to traffic children is laughable, but the people who believe this sort of thing doesn&#x27;t get that the real human traffickers (is a sad fact that they&#x27;re out there) probably knows how to communicate in secret.')
