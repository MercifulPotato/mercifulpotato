I don&#x27;t know why North Korean defectors would be different.<p>&gt; <i>and their accounts of starvation, extreme poverty, and harsh authoritarianism all support one another.</i><p>This specific claim is about people going to die in droves to caves, not <i>just</i> about harsh authoritarianism or extreme poverty. That&#x27;s why it must be considered skeptically -- because it seems just like the kind of thing we&#x27;re prone to believing about North Korea given other news, but this is not enough to make it true. And once it gets repeated uncritically, it becomes the &quot;common sense truth&quot;.')
