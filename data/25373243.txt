Unlike server time, most advertisers are <i>okay</i> to collect their own data for advertising purposes, and this causes them to have an unwritten agreement to collect data. Unless there is a stronger stick to force them otherwise, it is in their best interests to collect data and you need to have active intervention to prevent it.')
