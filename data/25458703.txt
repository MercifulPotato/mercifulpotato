I sleep in 90-minute sleep cycles. I time my morning alarm thus (adding 10-15 minutes for initial spindown).<p>When I wake up, even if it&#x27;s 4.5hrs, my brain is typically going a mile-a-minute. There&#x27;s so much I want to accomplish, it&#x27;s hard to be mindful and go back to sleep (so I rarely do, <i>especially</i> if it&#x27;s &#x27;only&#x27; 6hrs vs. the 7.5 I seem to need).<p>I looked back at my sleep logs, and I&#x27;ve slept longer than 7.5 only a handful of times in 2020, and it&#x27;s always correlated with several nights of 1.5, 3, or 4.5 hrs.')
