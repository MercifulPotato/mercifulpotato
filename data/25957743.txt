This seems to be a uniquely north-American attitude.  Germany, or maybe Europe, is full of so-called &quot;Mittelstand&quot; companies that are good in what they do, have 500-ish employees, have been in the same family ownership for generations and provide a good solid living for everyone involved.  What is wrong with that?  It goes without saying that staying mid-sized doesn&#x27;t mean staying complacent, but you can innovate without growing huge.<p>Here in Ottawa, there was a debacle a few years ago.  A typical such company, Swiss Pastries, changed ownership or at least management.  The new attitude was &quot;grow at all costs&quot;, they overextended themselves, went bankrupt, and Swiss Pastries is no more.  Ottawa now has no local source of soft pretzels along with other delicacies that they made.  It&#x27;s almost a scorched earth approach.  If you can&#x27;t make the company huge, you might as well destroy it, because not being huge means you&#x27;ve failed.<p>The previous paragraph is based on reading a few news articles at the time.  If I&#x27;m wrong, I&#x27;m guessing it still makes a textbook example of &quot;go big or go home&quot; going wrong and I&#x27;d love to see more details.')
