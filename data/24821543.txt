So fast it&#x27;s more of how fast do I want to go, where do I want to be instead of working the clutch, shifter, and trying to plan ahead in a much slower car.  I quite enjoy waking up each day with 300 miles of range instead of trying to figure out when&#x2F;where to add a gas station to my errands.  My Subaru was quite needy, oil changes, checking the oil, head gasket problems, gas filling, brake pads, engine maintenance, warming up before pushing it, taking it easy before you turn it off (because of the turbo) etc.   I&#x27;m at 14,000 miles on the Tesla, and I&#x27;d have done 4 oil changes, 56 gas fill ups, and I suspect a few other scheduled maintenance trips already.<p>I moved to a new city and a nice big map has been a great way to visit a city and the being able to speak my music selections, destinations, etc has been a pleasure.  I now regularly visit 3 nearby cities (all within 30 minutes) for entertainment, tasty food, and hiking.  I look forward to time in my model 3, I wish everything worked as well.  I&#x27;m surprised at how primitive other nav systems are, is it really that hard to match top of the line Android&#x2F;IOS touch screens and graceful handling of things like pinch to zoom?')
