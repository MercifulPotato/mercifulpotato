To me personally, Lidar feels like an incomplete solution to 3D mapping when high res images from a smartphone camera can provide so many more data points from different angles.<p>My thinking was vehicles should have an idea where other vehicles are without the need for comp viz. Like beacons saying &quot;hey Im here.&quot; And we can try to calculate relative direction and distance. The vision bit should ideally come in to validate and confirm other things like road signs etc. Ideally we should add that data to mapping software andnthe car should know these things without &quot;seeing it&quot;.')
