Hobbyists don&#x27;t mind if everything is turned off but they would still want to keep the stored data. There would still be an opportunity to be overcharged on storage even with a dollar limit.<p>However, setting usage limits would be a solution for both companies and hobbyists. AWS could then calculate the maximum spending per month that is possible with the current settings. I bet they would never build such a calculator and the necessary usage limits because it makes it easier for customers to optimize costs.')
