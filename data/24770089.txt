Human tissue is full of water, and water is a <i>terrible</i> transmission medium for RF energy, with penetration depth decreasing as a function of frequency. This is why submarine radio is receive-only and operates at a rate of characters per minute [1], why fully in-ear Bluetooth earbuds tend to drop out more than other designs, and why I&#x27;m not actually worried about low-power GHz-range RF signals like 5G. I&#x27;ll get skin cancer from sunburns <i>long</i> before I&#x27;ll get any kind of cancer from thermal radiation that can&#x27;t even penetrate my stratum corneum.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Extremely_low_frequency" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Extremely_low_frequency</a>')
