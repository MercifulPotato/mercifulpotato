While they were waiting for a manufacturing process, they should have redesigned their CPU cores to get something better than this.<p>Moreover the enhancements in Ice Lake and Tiger Lake seem somewhat unbalanced and random, there is no grand plan that can be discerned about how to improve a CPU.<p>On the other hand the evolution of Zen cores was perfect, every time the AMD team seems to have been able to add precisely all improvements that could give a maximum performance increase with a minimum implementation effort.<p>Thus they were able to pass from Zen 1 (2017) with an IPC similar to Intel Broadwell (2014), to Zen 2 (2019) with an IPC a little higher than Intel Skylake (2015) and eventually to Zen 3 (2020) with an IPC a little higher than Intel Tiger Lake (2020).<p>So even if the main advantage of AMD remains the superior CMOS technology they use from TSMC, just due to the competence of their design teams, they have passed from being 3 years behind Intel in IPC in 2017, to being ahead of Intel in IPC in 2020.<p>If that is not technical superiority, I do not know what is.<p>Like I have said, I believe that Intel could have done much better than that, but they seem to have done some sort of a random walk, instead of a directed run, like AMD.')
