Losing a power grid is an emergency of a pretty high order of magnitude - a long period of time without power and society basically collapses. Limited refrigeration, limited communications, transport might look vulnerable too looking over the long term where it is likely we have to phase out gasoline and replace it with ... maybe electricity from the grid. This would need to be highly redundant and that is not going to be cheap.<p>I&#x27;ll opine that it should totally unacceptable for a city to be relying on distant foreign climes for their electricity. Mega-grids to help stabilise the thing over an hour or two, sure. But if I couldn&#x27;t drive to a big, 24&#x2F;7 electrical plant in a few hours I&#x27;d be feeling very nervous.<p>OPEC is quite bad enough, there is an enormous strategic problem with sourcing so much oil non-locally. We&#x27;d be much better off with decentralised local generation, and the world would be much more peaceful.')
