Bangladesh is not the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of formerly colonialized places. People in other places have developed different ideas from those you adhere to, rooted in their own experiences of colonization, prior views, and outlooks on international affairs. I get it, you prefer the culture you were most recently colonized by to your perception of what existed prior to that, and that&#x27;s a position I can relate to even if I don&#x27;t fully share it.<p>But you&#x27;re in no position to make that judgement for all other people, and dismissal of their sincerely held and closely argued points of view as &#x27;bananas&#x27; is trite and beneath your level of education and accomplishment. And while you may not have <i>met</i> any Bangledeshis who have explored such views, a simple search for &#x27;decolonization Bangladesh&#x27; turned up several thought-provoking reads, such as <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.collegeart.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;programs&#x2F;international&#x2F;haque.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.collegeart.org&#x2F;pdf&#x2F;programs&#x2F;international&#x2F;haque....</a> (on conceptions of beauty in art) and <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.e-ir.info&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;16&#x2F;decolonising-queer-bangladesh-neoliberalism-against-lgbtq-emancipation&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.e-ir.info&#x2F;2019&#x2F;08&#x2F;16&#x2F;decolonising-queer-banglade...</a> (on conceptions of propriety in sexual relations). Perhaps you would find it illuminating to assign yourself the exercise of writing a brief on the topic for an imaginary client whose views differed from your own.')
