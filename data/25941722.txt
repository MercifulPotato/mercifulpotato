We had two large code bases, one in perl, one in Java.<p>They both were bad times.<p>Java, because the java coders didn&#x27;t quite understand how threading worked, leaking all over the place. My job was to migrate the systems from AIX 64bit machines (that could deal with the memory leaks with only one restart per hour) to x86 Linux. It was kind of fun (because everything was pretty contained) until the stuff went into production, and the servlets died after 4-5 requests each under non synthetic load.<p>And Perl, because the perl coders thought it was of benefit to write code that nobody could read but the author, and that it was OK to have dependencies on very old and very new libraries at the same time.<p>I gotta admit, the Perl stuff ran more stable. But it was still hell to upgrade the machines or debug even the smallest issues.')
