I like it as a personal training log, and as a way to keep up with friends who are also being fit. The social aspects are really nice, as it&#x27;s fun to be asked about your run through X over the weekend, or to know who to ask about running routes in a certain park.<p>It&#x27;s also a nice nudge to go work out. &quot;I don&#x27;t have anything on Strava yet this week, I should go for a bike ride over lunch today&quot; is really helpful mentally.')
