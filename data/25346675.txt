Otherwise not. As you say, as far as <i>headphones</i> go you can get better for less. But if seen as a phone headset that also has some hi fi qualities, then it makes more sense to go with the ones from Apple.<p>I trust Apple to make that 100% integration with my iPhone whereas I don&#x27;t necessarily trust Sennheiser to. The third party ones will turn out to drop calls more frequently in iOS 15 or something similar. That&#x27;s the kind of issue you are paying to avoid.')
