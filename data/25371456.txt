Item(by='BeetleB', descendants=None, kids=[25372100], score=None, time=1607590964, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25371128, text='&gt; I would expect that if a researcher at your company came up with a paper that concluded &quot;Our work at this company is sexist, racist, and bad for the environment and we should abandon it&quot; that your company would prefer it not be published<p>I&#x27;m not really sure what your point is. At a very basic level: Of course they would not prefer it published. Just like they would prefer not to have transparency, pay competitive market salaries, give free lunches, have an HR department, etc. We all prefer things if we can get them.<p>I would, however, expect that if a company hired a researcher to study whether their work is ethical, then it&#x27;s silly to get in that researcher&#x27;s way. If my company hired someone to ensure their supply chain for manufacturing does not involve sweatshops, then it certainly wouldn&#x27;t look good if my company prevents him from saying so. If we aren&#x27;t prepared for uncomfortable truths, we should not hire people to look into them.<p>I honestly think there are other <i>reasonable</i> reasons to get rid of this researcher than what you are positing.')
