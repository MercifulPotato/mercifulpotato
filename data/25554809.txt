Computers aren&#x27;t new, we <i>know</i> what the workload might be. Javascript is a couple of decades old. The challenge is getting compilers to use it - which is much easier with non-AOT languages, where you can update the compiler for existing code without involving the developer.<p>Otherwise you end up using too many instructions to achieve simple things. Sometimes different semantics can be <i>much</i> slower; you can see this when emulating architecture A on architecture B, and why Apple&#x27;s switchable memory-ordering semantics are absolute genius.<p>Also, this is why GPUs and DSPs exist.')
