Look at the countries that acted quickly and had cooperation from everyone - they have many fewer deaths, and the impact of the pandemic has been much, much less.<p>We are only in this position we are in because people did not want to cooperate from the start.  This attempt to blame the side effects on people advocating for masks is not an accurate depiction of reality.  If people had done the right thing from the beginning, we wouldn&#x27;t be in the predicament.')
