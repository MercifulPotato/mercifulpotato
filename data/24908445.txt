Item(by='ravenstine', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603813094, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24906682, text='&gt; The solution is a platform that doesn&#x27;t have these mismatched incentives (either paid for, ran by donations, etc) but that otherwise has the user experience of the mainsteam platforms.<p>Isn&#x27;t it kind of inevitable that those incentives manifest themselves?  A company can run a centralized platform, do a good job of it, then get bought out for millions(if not billions) by a large corporation and redesigned to maximize ad revenue and the egos of those looking for greater job titles.  This isn&#x27;t exactly unheard of.  Decentralization would supposedly section this kind of thing off if it even happens at all.<p>You&#x27;re right that the average person doesn&#x27;t care about decentralization, let alone understand it.  That&#x27;s fine.  Before Facebook, people used forums supported by vBulletin, and those were effectively &quot;decentralized&quot; in the sense that they weren&#x27;t all owned by the same entity.  The only difference was that there wasn&#x27;t sharing of data between 2 or more web forums, like there could be with something that supports ActivityPub or the like.')
