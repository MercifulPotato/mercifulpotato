Item(by='Delk', descendants=None, kids=[25908918], score=None, time=1611589777, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25903721, text='They do have access, at least in theory and to some of the services.<p>But when people do become homeless in Finland, their problems usually run quite deep already, and they may just be quite difficult to help.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this is true but I&#x27;ve understood that in the U.S. homelessness might more often be a result of just financial downfall, while in Finland homelessness is very strongly connected to mental illness, substance dependence, or both [1]. Those people have pretty much lost control of having a normal life, or perhaps they never had one. That doesn&#x27;t mean they shouldn&#x27;t be helped, but it does mean helping them is likely to be an uphill battle.<p>Drug addiction does get judged harshly by the society in general; alcohol abuse is likely to be swept under the rug unless it causes obvious problems e.g. at work, but if it does, it gets judged as well, although not quite as harshly as drug abuse. I&#x27;d expect most social workers and medical professionals who work with the homeless to know better than to see addiction as just a moral failure, though, so the problem may rather be that it&#x27;s quite difficult to treat people who have a multitude of problems that run deep. Health care professionals might be wary of committing limited public resources in cases if they don&#x27;t expect it to bear fruit, so the mental health services might be limited to emergency care and general assistance by social workers.<p>I&#x27;m not intimately familiar with how those services work, though, so they might be more extensive than I think.<p>[1] That is, at least among the native population; another visible group of homeless are poor immigrants living in the streets. They probably just wanted a better life in a richer country or something, and their reasons for vagrancy are probably different.')
