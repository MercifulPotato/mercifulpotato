But here in the US, a single medical bill can wipe you out. And because we value free market healthcare, that means you don&#x27;t know what the price will be until <i>after</i> you receive treatment. You won&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re covered or denied coverage until <i>after</i> the incident. Because that&#x27;s how the Free Market(tm) works.<p>Be thankful if you&#x27;ve never had the luxury of spending months battling a massive bill you received because one of the ten random people you saw one night in a hospital was out-of-network despite being at an in-network hospital.<p>You don&#x27;t have to be a full blown socialist to see how fucked America is.')
