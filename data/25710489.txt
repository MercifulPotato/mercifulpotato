I voted for him in 2016, but didn&#x27;t vote for him in 2020. I don&#x27;t like most of his policies, but there are some of his policies that I do like. I liked Trump before he became president, I thought he was a hoot. So I understand his way of speaking and know that some journalists really like to twist what he says. He just doesn&#x27;t have the discipline to say things presidentially and talks off script in his very loose way.<p>I do however think his behavior has been deplorable since the election loss, and he blatantly incited a riot. He crossed a line and he deserves to be punished.')
