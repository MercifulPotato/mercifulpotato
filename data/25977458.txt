Germany f√ºr example has porous borders with Denmark, Netherlands, Luxemburg, Belgium, France, Switzerland, Austria, Czech republic, Poland. If they don&#x27;t in turn all follow this strategy we&#x27;d have to militarily secure all these borders and stop anybody from going through. This would cause an enormous hit to the economies and cost a lot of money in military gear and personnel to execute.<p>Now for the next scenario, say the whole EU + Switzerland + UK decide to follow zero Covid. Then we still have a boatable connection to Africa and a pretty large land border with Asia to defend. Despite the never before seen political coordination this would need, this would create very harsh humanitarian situations along those borders, even worse than what we&#x27;ve seen in recent years.<p>So all in all I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that easy to use island nation strategies for mostly land locked nations.')
