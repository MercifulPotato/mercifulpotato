For instance I think that the US money system is &quot;designed&quot; to serve as a medium of exchange, a temporary store of value, and a tool of government economic policy.<p>Bitcoin might have been designed with some other purposes in mind. It could also be co-opted by a government. For instance, I suspect that subsidized energy for bitcoin mining represents a government monetary policy, but I don&#x27;t know the extent of the influence or its real purpose.<p>Moreover, like a technology, people will use money if it&#x27;s useful to them. For instance people in countries with &quot;bad&quot; money will often use it for daily expenses, but move the bulk of their assets into instruments based on the currencies of the US, Europe, etc.')
