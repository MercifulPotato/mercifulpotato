Then try to post on the right time. I didn&#x27;t expect anybody to read this to be honest. I just posted it and got back to coding. Then I had a look and was amazed by the reactions. I posted it a few days ago on reddit&#x2F;r&#x2F;graphql but didn&#x27;t get much attention. Believe in yourself and try to write good content. Don&#x27;t try to get karma. Content is valuable if it starts an engaging conversation.')
