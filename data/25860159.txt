Namely, Twitter and co have groomed us to hate each other much more (more efficiently?) than traditional media--even cable news--had ever done. Of course, at this point traditional media are really stepping up their game. I&#x27;m assuming of course that we&#x27;re ready to admit our hatred issue and that we&#x27;re not still pretending that our hatred for the other side is good, moral, just, and indeed the only way to cure racism, cancer, etc? Hopefully I&#x27;m not being too optimistic. And it&#x27;s not just hate for the sake of ad clicks; previously lobbying was a problem and now we have lobbying plus social media giants selling influence over us (including our votes) to the highest bidder. Maybe this all boils down to ad driven revenue model such that we can address it with regulation, and the positive aspects of the Internet can remain?')
