While I agree that Apple’s ergonomics are especially poor, laptop keyboards and trackpads are fundamentally crippled from the get go due to size constraints.<p>If you’re working from the same desk every day, buy a real keyboard and external trackpad&#x2F;mouse for the sake of your own wrists. Save the built in keyboard for when you actually need the mobility.<p>I use a dedicated ergo keyboard (Ergodox EZ) 99.9% of the time, and my wrists thank me. But I also have the dedicated space for that.')
