I&#x27;m personally of the opinion that those looking to use notebooks as a programming environment would be better suited by something like Smalltalk. That is, something that seamlessly blends between stored programs and the runtime. You can see some progression towards this in VS Code (I believe there&#x27;s an issue about exposing variables evaluated in the ipython REPL in autocomplete), so I&#x27;m not terribly bullish on Jupyter-style notebooks being the next big thing.')
