I do remember finding it really didn&#x27;t work as well, though I don&#x27;t remember exactly why any more.<p>This isn&#x27;t a great response, I know. It&#x27;s just a data point for the theory that Word and WordPerfect are comparable in this respect.<p>(This is going back so long ago now. I was still at school! Maybe the problem was that you still had to interact with the GUI view to fix things? So you could still end up with the usual weird Word stuff, but no way to fix it, because you couldn&#x27;t get right in there and just manually shuffle the codes around like you could with WP.)')
