However, &quot;to be political&quot; is still a pretty wide range of possible missions. Who calls the shots about what you&#x27;re going to be political about, and which side you take? And when a group of employees disagree with the shots being called, what kinds of reactions are appropriate or not?<p>I&#x27;ll take a shot:\n- I think compelled activism is inappropriate. You know, the &quot;silence is violence&quot; stuff.\n- I think <i>expecting</i> to have power to set a company&#x27;s political agenda and expressing anger when you don&#x27;t get your way is inappropriate. That power belongs to the board. Employment and stock-options are not &quot;fractions of board seats&quot;.')
