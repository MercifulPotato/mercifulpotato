The form is very gender neutral, has a primary contact and a &quot;partner&quot;. I did the signup and I&#x27;m usually the one dropping our daughter off and picking her up, since I work closer to daycare so ended up being the primary contact. Yet still they 9 out of 10 times call my girlfriend. Very impractical, since most cases they want you to come and pick up your kid because she is sick and I work close by while my girlfriend is 2+ hours away.')
