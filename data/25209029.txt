And all winter. A huge burst of activity in the spring with tillage &#x2F; planting and&#x2F;or seed drilling &amp; spraying &#x2F; fertilizing etc. Maybe a couple passes over for herbicide application. And then combine harvesting in the fall and maybe some tillage and planting of winter rye, etc. Then some machine maintenance, outbuilding maintenance, accounting &#x2F; bookkeeping, seed and other inputs purchasing thrown in here and there throughout the year.<p>I can see it being as little as 15 hours a week if you averaged it over the whole year. But it would have moments of intensity.<p>But the reality is that most of these farmers around in my area are contracting out portions of this work, because owning the equipment ends up being a huge capital investment that only makes sense for very large plots of land.')
