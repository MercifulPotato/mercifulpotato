It was also a little cheaper.<p>I did btrfs &quot;RAID10&quot; instead of RAID.  Hardware RAID is always a hassle, btrfs is in-kernel, and it has all the nice modern data integrity features (two spindle rule, I have a timer that scrubs it periodically for to verify checksums, etc.) - I&#x27;ve been really pleased with that except for the lack of good automated monitoring&#x2F;notification tools for btrfs.<p>Documentation I wrote at the time, more about the backup scheme than the machine at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pappp.net&#x2F;?p=1627" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pappp.net&#x2F;?p=1627</a>\nI&#x27;m still using that setup, eventually I&#x27;ll need to swap some discs as capacities increase, but that machine has required zero fucking around since it was set up.')
