People who sit on zoning boards tend to own property in the area (or get money and support from such people), and thus it&#x27;s not in their interest to increase the supply of housing, as that would decrease the value of their investment. OTOH, the people who&#x27;d like to move into the area are not represented in the zoning boards.<p>One partial solution is to make zoning a national level decision rather than a municipal, like in Japan: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;urbankchoze.blogspot.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;04&#x2F;japanese-zoning.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;urbankchoze.blogspot.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;04&#x2F;japanese-zoning.htm...</a>')
