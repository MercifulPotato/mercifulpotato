Hence the Public has the Right of Regulating Descents, and all other Conveyances of Property, and even of limiting the Quantity and the Uses of it. <i>All the Property that is necessary to a Man, for the Conservation of the Individual and the Propagation of the Species, is his natural Right, which none can justly deprive him of</i>: But all Property superfluous to such purposes is the Property of the Publick, who, by their Laws, have created it, and who may therefore by other Laws dispose of it, whenever the Welfare of the Publick shall demand such Disposition.&quot;<p>It is the &quot;Property superfluous to such purposes&quot; that belongs to society.  Your interpretation was contrary tp that, believing it to mean ALL property belongs to society.  That is refuted by the very links you posted.<p>In Frankin&#x27;s second quote, he stated his belief, rightly so, that he was hesitant to create an aristocracy based on property.  He was arguing for a bicameral legislature and in the process admitted the rights of people to own property (the upper legislature composed of property owners).<p>Also, in Franklin&#x27;s second quote, you quoted out of context.  Immediately, prior to what you quoted, he spoke about property rights.  <i>We know, that, when one of them has attempted to keep a few Swine, he has not been able to maintain a Property in them, his neighbours thinking they have a Right to kill and eat them whenever they want Provision, it being one of their Maxims that hunting is free for all; the accumulation therefore of Property in such a Society, and its Security to Individuals in every Society, must be an Effect of the Protection afforded to it by the joint Strength of the Society, in the Execution of its Laws.</i>. His argument is that the purpose of a society is to <i>protect</i> property rights.')
