And for what reason? So that you can cater to the 0.00001% of the users because they hate javascript for no other reason than that they hate it?<p>Just like mobile-first doesn&#x27;t mean (or shouldn&#x27;t mean) &quot;only mobile&quot; but rather &quot;write with the smallest screen in mind and then add features for bigger screens&quot;, you can first write the basics of the site using pure HTML and then put the JavaScript on top. It&#x27;s not much more effort if done consciously.<p>&gt; Maybe not you, but I certainly use my browser for that kind of purpose as one example of several that won&#x27;t work with javascript disabled.<p>But that&#x27;s not really relevant to the argument here. The author of the article doesn&#x27;t say &quot;all websites including those that mimic native apps should work without CSS and JavaScript&quot; - that would be nonsense of course. Certain web-based apps will simply not work at all without JavaScript, that&#x27;s fine, and it&#x27;s fine if that&#x27;s a reason for some person not to use them. But personally I think that websites (in particular those that are not &quot;apps&quot;) should provide as much of their functionality as possible without requiring JS, where it&#x27;s doable. A photo editing app certainly doesn&#x27;t fall into that category, I think everyone is aware of that.<p>&gt; Yeah maybe having an alternative for drag n drop helps disabled users but just removing javascript doesn&#x27;t help them at all.<p>That&#x27;s also not what I said and it wouldn&#x27;t be graceful degradation. I&#x27;m all for having JavaScript that improves the usability of the site, as long as disabling it (or network failure preventing it from loading) won&#x27;t break the site as a consequence. That, I think, is the key point here.')
