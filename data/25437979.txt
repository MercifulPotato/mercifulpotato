I mean I am learning some core concepts along the way which I definitely appreciate and the reason I am continuing, but to become proficient I need to apply them without the hand-holding.  Because those Coursera assignments have evolved to be computer-graded and easily approachable and so they actually do most of the thinking for you.<p>Also I feel the modern approach is not vectorized Python but something like Keras or Tensorflow 2 or anything that is maybe higher level or will allow me to keep the computation on the GPU&#x2F;TPU and not going back and forth to the CPU like I assume numpy must be doing.')
