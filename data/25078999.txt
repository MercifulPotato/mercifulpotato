Quoting:<p>&quot;The U.S. Supreme Court could also still potentially invalidate Pennsylvania’s extended mail-in voting deadline, which allowed mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day to be accepted as long as they were delivered by Friday, Nov. 6. That ruling would only affect approximately 10,000 ballots, elections officials have said—which are being segregated and are not included in the current vote count—and thus invalidating them would not affect Biden’s win in Pennsylvania.&quot;<p>The idea being that it doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with who won or lost.
