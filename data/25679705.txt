It&#x27;s a location based discussion application, so anyone within 2km of each other can post and discuss topics. I thought it would be really helpful during Covid since people are pretty lonely and it&#x27;d be nice to see what other people in the area are up to. I tried posting about it, but I&#x27;m not really sure how to generate user interest in a product like this and would really appreciate some help. Thanks a bunch for any advice :)')
