These issues could result in topology information that is inconsistent and lead to message loss, timeouts, and errors.<p>&gt;<p>&gt; In early 2017, we decided that it was time for a reboot of the server implementation of RAMEN protocol to continue to scale. For this iteration we used the following technologies: Netty, Apache Zookeeper, Apache Helix, Redis and Apache Cassandra.<p>Yet another example of why starting with Java, .NET or similar stacks avoids rewrites.')
