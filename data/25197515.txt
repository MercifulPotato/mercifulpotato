I&#x27;ve not used Ed on an ICL but presumably it&#x27;s the same as the usual UNIX version.<p>What&#x27;s the problem getting people to understand the commands? Is it that these days everyone is bought up on GUI pull-downs and that no one&#x27;s prepared to take the time to learn them? Or perhaps part of it is that what I mentioned, there&#x27;s too many different editors around and most will prefer ones without seemingly difficult&#x2F;cryptic commands?<p>To me, learning commands&#x2F;keyboard shortcuts is always preferable to just menu operation.')
