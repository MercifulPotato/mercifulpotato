For example it&#x27;s really difficult for me now to explain to our new hire why two completely unrelated fields are stuck in one table and one is NULL for 95% of the time.<p>The wide table thing is also kind of certified by someone inside of Vertica so I guess it does make sense. I&#x27;m not actually working in data team so I don&#x27;t have the CS knowledge to prove or disprove it. Fortunately our new data lead is going to convert everything into Kimball so we are going to have solid proof eventually.')
