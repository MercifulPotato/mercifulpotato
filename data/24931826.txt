Without a common background (raised with similar upbringing, same religions), your implicit rules can diverge greatly with the others. Not to mention born in different era will play a big role in this. Some people simply don&#x27;t grow with the changing time.<p>That&#x27;s why it is more favorable in today&#x27;s environment to have explicit rules like CoC. At least it brings people to the same understanding quicker.<p>It does carry risk though. When living in a world with more explicit rules, people tend to treat anything not in the rule to be OK, and ignore most implicit rules. That will rush more rules to be explicit, also, written poorly without broader debates and discussions during these rushes.')
