It was a nice break from SPD&#x27;s regular violence against protesters.<p>Why didn&#x27;t the city&#x27;s electeds attempt to move back in sooner?  Because something about gassing their own citizens was politically unpopular for some reason.  Note that this was summer, most Seattlites don&#x27;t have air conditioning, and teargas spreads in the air.  People I knew on Cap hill were coughing despite having all their windows closed (and sweltering).')
