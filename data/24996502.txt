Anyways, HEAD requests don&#x27;t count, so hopefully the client can utilise those (or be modified to). [&#x2F;EDIT]<p>And yes, Maven has a design much better suited to having a local &quot;proxy&quot; (in fact, it always does that on localhost anyways), but the setup looks pretty straightforward and I really don&#x27;t see much reason to not use it on all dev, test and CI machines. I&#x27;d also use it in production, but even if you&#x27;d prefer not to, production servers don&#x27;t pull that often and updates are usually done through hooks, not constantly polling a repo.<p>So basically, from my perspective (handful of servers, each with some 20 containers) this change will be thoroughly annoying, but will force me to set up caching which will make things much faster and also decrease the reliance on an external service for day-to-day operation. Not a fan of it, but yi completely see the reason why they did it.')
