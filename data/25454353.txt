On the other hand, perhaps the diagram has correct proportions but they&#x27;re misleading: the combustion area might be roughly spherical rather than cylindrical, and we&#x27;re just seeing the cross section that shows its maximum area.<p>edit: actually, this is covered in their FAQ:<p>&gt; What is the compression ratio?<p>&gt; For the X Mini 70 cc spark-ignited prototype, the compression ratio is 9:1. The diesel prototypes have operated at between 14:1 and 18:1, and should be able to go higher, to 25:1 or more.')
