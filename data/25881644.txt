My own case is such that I wash each shirt (button down shirt) and underwear shirt after every use. I have to. I guess my fast metabolism contributes. I tumble dry the underwear shirts but not the shirts.<p>Washing certainly takes its toll. In my case, wear shows both &quot;technically&quot;, as the fabric and details weakening, but also as a general decline in freshness. And i don&#x27;t mean fresh-as-new, but rather pure whites turning yellowish. They become unfit for my work context.
