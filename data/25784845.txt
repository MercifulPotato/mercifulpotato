Now that everyone&#x27;s working from home and glued to desktop screens, I really think that browser extensions are the new HUD for productivity.<p>I&#x27;m working on a browser extension that helps me discover new stock to trade when I browse the web. Say I like to shop on lululemon.com. I may not know that it&#x27;s a public company, or that I can easily buy its stock even though it&#x27;s a Canadian company. My browser extensions tells me that I can trade LULU, and other fun facts about the stock.<p>How do you discover new stocks to trade? I&#x27;ll trade my free extension for your feedback :)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.shan.io&#x2F;stock-inspector-discover-new-companies-etfs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;finance.shan.io&#x2F;stock-inspector-discover-new-compani...</a>')
