We see teams and organizations using MLflow. What we don&#x27;t see though is individual researchers&#x2F;engineers&#x2F;data scientists pick it up and use it.<p>From the people we have talked to who use MLflow, we hear it gets the job done, but individual contributors don&#x27;t love it.<p>We really believe that widespread adoption comes from making something individuals love and use every day. That&#x27;s the reason Docker was so successful, for example.<p>The lack of flexibility really resonates. That&#x27;s the reason we&#x27;re trying to be small and not too opinionated. We&#x27;re something we can drop into your in-house system as a component, kinda like lots of deployment systems are built around Docker.')
