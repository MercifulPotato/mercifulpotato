Unfortunately I jumped ship too quickly and found myself in a job I hated, with a manger who (while not as vocally abusive) was just as bad. </i><p>One time, long back in my career, my then-boss jumped down my throat in a meeting for no valid reason. I clearly remember thinking to myself, &quot;Is this it? Is this the day I tell this asshole to fuck off, and walk out the front door?&quot; I decided not to, but I was in full-on job search mode the moment that meeting ended. It didn&#x27;t take more than a couple of weeks before I gave notice. The next job was for less money, but it was basically my dream job at the time. It was the best move I ever made.<p>There&#x27;s no moral or lesson to this story. I just thought I&#x27;d share it.')
