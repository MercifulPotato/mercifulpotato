Meanwhile you can choose the exit node, which you often can&#x27;t for your ISP, which means you can choose one operated by someone you trust.<p>And even if you don&#x27;t, what are they going to do to a TLS connection?<p>&gt; and I don’t think Firefox started doing tracking prevention before Safari did<p>Tor Browser is based on Firefox, so the anti-fingerprinting work they do regularly gets merged back into Firefox proper. Moreover, Firefox has had some of the best anti-tracking addons since forever, but you can only have those if you actually have Firefox.<p>But Tor Browser is still more stringent about certain things, e.g. they always reset the window to a standard size when you open it so the page can&#x27;t track you based on that, which Firefox itself doesn&#x27;t do because it&#x27;s kind of annoying to the user. Which is another reason why there is benefit in having multiple browsers -- they each have different trade offs.<p>&gt; They have a different business model but I’m not entirely clear on what their technological innovation is?<p>They do a lot of good work on ad blocking, and are willing to be a lot more aggressive about it, since it aligns directly with their incentives.')
