I just bought a little ESP32 board, and while I&#x27;m having fun with it, it&#x27;s a bummer that it&#x27;s using an oddball ISA (xtensa).  I really want to build for it in rust, but the xtensa llvm and rust forks are beta-ish quality, and there&#x27;s no working wifi driver yet.<p>With the RP2040 based on ARM, rust should work on it after someone works up a peripheral support crate, which shouldn&#x27;t be too hard if the RPi Foundation releases SVD files.')
