We reach for the dependency <i>first</i> instead of carefully analyzing our requirements and making an engineering decision. I&#x27;ve seen it countless times, fallen victim to it a few times myself. It&#x27;s really easy to do. No one stops to ask, &quot;perhaps we do not need a hard dependency, and need to include that 15kb library, but rather just need a few functions from it?&quot; or &quot;perhaps a simple algorithm would indeed suffice.&quot; We mindlessly reach for complex regex engines to solve simple parsing problems, try to garner &quot;functional programming cred&quot; by reaching for a series of collection functions from our favorite 50kb utility package when a simple c-style for loop would have not only sufficed, but indeed got the job done much faster.<p>All this results in bloated, unoptimized javascript bundles. To top it off, we under cache, and aggressively cache bust, and ship unminified bundles with oodles of source maps because of &quot;developer experience&quot; I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I see, to this day, a fortune 500 company bundling an entire unminified javascript framework. Wirth&#x27;s law indeed.<p>Hope this was a little less empty. These are my observations having done this for a few decades now and managing developers these days.')
