The most important step here is selection of the right thing to juggle. Nothing adds more difficulty (well, maybe riding a unicycle). The hackysack was made for this. The heft and size are perfect, especially when you move to having two in one hand and one in the other (the juggling starting position). After that, it is all muscle memory. After I got the basics, I would go out in the yard and just do laps while juggling. Before a week or so I was able to juggle fairly well with three identical objects, then figured out doing different sizes and weights together. At some point, I realized girls were not going to be impressed enough by this skill to overcome the other deficiencies I had, and I stopped. :)')
