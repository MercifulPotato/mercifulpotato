But I&#x27;m still confused about your struggle to implement fizzbuzz in an interview. Fizzbuzz doesn&#x27;t need you to understand 4 web frameworks and a nosql database. Its like, 5 lines of code. What happened?<p>&gt; Is he experienced? Does the conversation flow naturally? Do you feel he is a loyal, dependable person who can clearly communicate? Well I would say that covers 90% of the issue. Hire the guy, see how he performs.<p>Interesting idea but unfortunately this isn&#x27;t a viable strategy. There&#x27;s a mountain of people who are perfectly charming but can&#x27;t program, and we need to screen them out. And there&#x27;s plenty of great programmers with awkward social skills who we would love to hire.<p>A few years ago I interviewed an Indian developer with broken english, who&#x27;d spent the last 10 years working on Oracle internals. She wasn&#x27;t charming or a good conversationalist and her resume had obvious typos. I had very low expectations - but when I interviewed her I realised her technical knowledge was top notch. It took both me and my boss to bat for her for the client to give her a chance. But she ended up outlasting everyone else on her team. The company we placed her at absolutely adore her now. If I didn&#x27;t go deep on technical content, I wouldn&#x27;t have known that and we would have passed her up.')
