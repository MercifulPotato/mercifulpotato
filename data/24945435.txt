I&#x27;d counter that democracies with a hyper-informed and engaged electorate absolutely exist in the world, even if it&#x27;s just on the local level or just with regard to specific issues.<p>Also, while a highly educated person might have a much better understanding of foreign affairs, they may have a poor understanding of what it feels like to come home to a decrepit apartment just to watch your children get skinnier. Even though they might be more informed and have better solutions for the problems they care about, they&#x27;ll prioritize different issues.<p>If the average voter is poorly informed, the obvious solution to me would be to work on that issue directly, not on chipping away at what little power they have.<p>It&#x27;s kind of counter-intuitive, but getting people to turn up to elections is often the first step in getting them to build informed opinions, read up on issues, and take their civic duty seriously. This is what people are hoping for when they try to improve voter turnout; they believe that many of our society&#x27;s ills could be helped by fostering a more civically engaged populace.')
