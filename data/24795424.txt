It feels artificial and forced, like some foreign state is having their way with public influence in our country and by extension the world. Sickening. Free speech should be free, and I&#x27;m surprised people in the tech industry feel opposite.<p>I wonder, do they really feel this way? Or do they pretend, to go with the flow and not be labeled a racist?')
