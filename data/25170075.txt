Too many such stops and starts and your brain will be fried.<p>For me that&#x27;s not true. The biggest &quot;energy drain&quot; is when I rush reading something and get fuzzy about what is being said. Understanding the text becomes harder and harder and a lot of will power is required to keep reading the text that no longer makes sense. Re-reading a paragraph 2-3 times or stopping to think more about what was written helps. So the fewer times I stop the more my brain will get &quot;fried&quot;.')
