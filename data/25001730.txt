Intercom is a mediocre product but their pricing does not make sense whatsoever. I exchanged about 20 emails (while being very slow) with their account rep only to find out even they don&#x27;t understand their own pricing.<p>Here&#x27;s some hot mess that&#x27;s going on:<p><pre><code>  * They A&#x2F;B test their pricing page with completely different models. I&#x27;ve seen at least 3 different versions.\n  * They charge by &quot;active users&quot; over last 90 days. A person is considered active if they&#x27;ve logged in to the site or was sent an email.\n  * The pricing for products and add-ons are all over the place. In some places, they have an add-on listed as $199 (Product Tour) while others places have it as $119.\n  * They try different &quot;bundle&quot; packages but yet it&#x27;s impossible to tell what products or add-ons are actually included in each.</code></pre>')
