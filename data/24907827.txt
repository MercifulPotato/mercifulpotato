Item(by='KozmoNau7', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603809381, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24905781, text='A fleece jacket or something similar plus a basic rain overcoat and rain pants can be had for not very much, even discount supermarkets will usually have something on sale.<p>Similarly a backpack doesn&#x27;t have to be fancy, I know people who go camping with old laptop backpacks (preferable the beefy ones that can fit a 15.6&quot; mobile workstation) or similar not very outdoorsy gear. Of course something along the lines of a $450 Savotta Patrol Pack would be superior in every way, but that&#x27;s nice to have, not need to have.<p>Perfectly adequate tents, sleeping bags and mats are widely available for not a lot of money. Will they eventually break, sooner than high-quality gear? That&#x27;s almost for certain, but the point is to get out there and <i>do</i> something, not to have the fanciest possible gear.<p>The one area where I would prioritize getting something a little nicer would be boots. A good pair of boots will greatly increase your comfort levels and protect your feet and ankles from damage. Again, I know people who go camping in sneakers, but actual hiking boots will be infinitely superior in rain and mud.<p>I would highly recommend subscribing to Steve Wallis on Youtube. He&#x27;s a very down-to-earth guy who goes camping just about everywhere, with just basic gear and a positive attitude.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;thestevewallis&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;c&#x2F;thestevewallis&#x2F;</a>')
