And how quick these people who constantly complain about &quot;MSM fake news&quot; were to spread it all over the internet without any fact checking on their end?<p>It wasn&#x27;t even a mistake, it was clearly intentional. The photo of Q Shaman was intentionally cropped to remove the QAnon sign, and the phillyantifa website was clearly listing white supremacists. The people spreading that knew all this, yet they still decided to spread it.')
