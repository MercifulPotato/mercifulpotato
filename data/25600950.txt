Im an Army vet and barely interacted with Navy folks while I was in (except for that one time, on a FOB in a country far far away ...), and Iâ€™ve become quite enthusiastic about naval history and combat. Always fun seeing this stuff here and learning about the other side of the house, especially the more technical reviews of how operations run.')
