I’ve been using google phones since the Nexus 4 and everything after that one has had some weird bugs come up sooner or later. In most of them, the camera bugs that come up when you need the camera the most and you miss the moment because you just got a black screen, or “the device is not ready” because the flashlight was on, or slowness after an update, random reboots, etc. I got used to them and figured out the workarounds, but I realized that they were not normal after I convinced my aunt to get a pixel and I had to hear her complaints.<p>I’ve jumped to iPhones and I don’t think I’m looking back. It’s not WOAH at all, it’s still just a phone, but I haven’t had to compromise or get used to any weirdness.')
