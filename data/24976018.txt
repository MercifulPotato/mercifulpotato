Before teaching I worked as a firmware engineer for a little over 2 years. Currently teaching IB Computer Science (SL&#x2F;HL Y1&#x2F;Y2), Robotics, Design Technology and Game Programming at the American Embassy School New Delhi. To keep my skills sharp while teaching I completed Georgia Tech&#x27;s OMSCS program and have been developing side-projects like a Thai language memory game released on the Play Store using React Native. I think I&#x27;d be a great fit somewhere working in the education space given my experience.')
