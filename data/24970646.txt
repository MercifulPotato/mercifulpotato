It was crashing, and I had the crash address, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out how it got there.  So I attached a logic analyser to the memory bus, triggered it on the crash address (or maybe on some symptom of the crash; it&#x27;s been a while).  I had the trigger point be at the <i>end</i> of the saved trace.  I then could see what the address bus had been up to (that is, what instructions were fetched) for some time before the crash.  That got me enough information to find and fix the problem.<p>You couldn&#x27;t do that today, because everything is too small to put a chip clip on, and the processors cache instructions, so the program counter is not directly visible on the address bus.')
