I believe anyone with a DRM module that does not protect it is at risk of losing their license with the content owners. That basically why DRM exists to begin with.<p>Blaming the content service is easy since they&#x27;re user-facing, but it&#x27;s shallow. Content-related restrictions are, in my experience, almost always dictated by the content owner. Region locks, availability windows, use of DRM, DMCAs for anti-DRM, etc, are all at the requirement of the content owners.<p>I don&#x27;t think these modern Internet-based service providers care about that stuff much, they have little incentive to. It&#x27;s driven by contracts.<p>Incidentally, this is <i>always</i> the reason behind region locks. Service X or content Y isn&#x27;t available in your country? Don&#x27;t blame the streaming service, blame the content owner.')
