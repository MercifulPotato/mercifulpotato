(Spotify initially removed a handful of episodes before removing whole shows.) On Sunday night, Apple followed suit, removing his podcast from iTunes for violating its rules against hate speech.<p>&gt;&gt; Apple’s move was followed almost immediately by a rash of similar moves. Facebook removed Jones’ pages, citing repeated hate speech violations. YouTube followed suit, terminating an account that had 2.4 million subscribers. Pinterest came next.<p>&gt;  I was talking about the damage he&#x27;s caused<p>Exactly how much damage has he caused?  Serious question.<p>&gt; and why people shouldn&#x27;t just shrug and say, well, he&#x27;s &quot;thinking for himself&quot;<p>People also shouldn&#x27;t accept their subconscious heuristic predictions about the thoughts of others as representative of reality - this is a wise strategy not only when it comes to people who have a different skin color than you.<p>&gt; ...as if there&#x27;s some independent virtue to coming up with nonsense that outweighs the damage that coming up with nonsense can do.<p>Present your numbers and we can discuss.<p>&gt; I can probably &quot;uncover&quot; real conspiracies by claiming that every single government action is a lie or a false flag. At some point, I&#x27;ll be correct. That doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m actually performing a public service, a mindless chatbot could do that.<p>Are you suggesting that &quot;claiming that every single government action is a lie or a false flag&quot; is what (the average) conspiracy theorists do?  If you don&#x27;t mind, could you please state, in detail, which specific conspiracy communities you frequent, and how much time you spend there per week&#x2F;month?  I have a hunch that you&#x27;re running purely on intuition and stories that you&#x27;ve read <i>about</i> conspiracy theory communities, as most people here clearly do.<p>&gt; If he&#x27;s not lying[0] and actually was psychotic when he said those things, then we should not take any of the conspiricizing he says seriously because it was literally the product of his own disordered thinking.<p>This is some interesting logic.<p>&gt; [0] he is<p>This is some interesting mind reading.  You know who are often big believers in ESP?  <i>Conspiracy theorists</i>.')
