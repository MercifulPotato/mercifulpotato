They are mostly separate activities.<p>Pfizer doesn&#x27;t have to &#x27;spin&#x27; anything, they are a legit partner in the deal, they can do the release in the US, they will have their brand up there, their name, do the interviews - and they don&#x27;t have to do anything tricky, they can surely mention their &#x27;no name partner&#x27; and win $1 Billion worth of free PR.<p>A tiny Germany company, knowing nothing about communications, will miss the opportunity to tell the world who they are, to tell their story, to make their name known to another generation of researchers and scientists who might want to work with them, to a generation of bankers, business people who will be 2x more likely to want to &#x27;take the call and or do the deal&#x27; because of their reputation.<p>1&#x2F;2 of business is communicating, the only successful businesses that don&#x27;t understand this are the one&#x27;s that hit on it accidentally.<p>Pfizer is already a global brand, this is <i>the moment</i> of a lifetime for &#x27;the name of the company I already forget&#x27; (see what I mean?) - I had to re-look it up - &#x27;BioNTech&#x27; - it&#x27;s very much make-or-break. If this vaccine is legit they need to start talking about themselves <i>now</i>.')
