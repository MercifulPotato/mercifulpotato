In the Stack Overflow 2020 survey, 26% of people said they were using a Linux based OS [0]. This number has been gradually increasing over the years so further growth is expectable. It&#x27;s less than one percent less than the Mac OS share of 27%, but I&#x27;m not sure how much noise there is.<p>So Linux is usable enough for a growing community of developers, and many laptop&#x2F;computer vendors targeting the developer market offer GNU&#x2F;Linux as a preinstalled option.<p>As a result, at least for software people, Linux <i>is</i> a real privacy preserving alternative on the Desktop. HN is a software forum, and the blog post was also made with people educated about software as the recipients. So I think the post you are replying to should be understood not in a global context but in a context of the IT crowd.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s not beautiful that Linux is less of an alternative to people who need to use complicated niche ISV software, but generally any industry can make the move if there is a subset of users pushing towards GNU&#x2F;Linux.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;insights.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;survey&#x2F;2020#technology-developers-primary-operating-systems" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;insights.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;survey&#x2F;2020#technology-de...</a>')
