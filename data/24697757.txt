You can serve your website from many different domains but as long as the site_id in your script tag is the same, the hash remains the same.<p>The site id is included in the hash to prevent cross-site tracking. Otherwise the hash would act almost like a third-party cookie and people could be tracked across different sites.<p>&gt; Not really keen on the use of the IP address.<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s not ideal. We do check the X-Forwarded-For header so as long as the proxies are being good citizens, the client IP is present in that header.')
