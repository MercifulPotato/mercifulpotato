I am glad you brought this up.<p>I&#x27;ve never been bullied by a peer or near-peer. That is, I was never in a situation that I could not handle. In my entire life I&#x27;ve only seen <i>one</i> case where another child was bullied by older boys and I knew that was bad.<p>BUT when you mentioned teachers, I thought of a middle-and-high school teacher&#x2F;coach who held a grudge for reasons unknown. In response I skated by in his freshman biology class and, in general, wouldn&#x27;t give him the time of day.<p>So yes, teachers can indeed act like bullies. But I think most people don&#x27;t think of bullying per se as being something <i>teachers</i> or other authority figures do but instead something that one&#x27;s <i>peers</i> or near-age peers do.')
