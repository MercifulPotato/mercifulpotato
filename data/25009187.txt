(Btw, once upon a time, my Experian credit score dropped by like 150 points after a mysterious debt appeared on my credit report; turns out someone else’s debt was mistakenly put on my file. Luckily my name wasn’t also “mistakenly” sent to some collections agency. Definitely scared the shit out of me.)')
