A piece of the software that constantly has bugs is a sign there&#x27;s high technical debt that needs to be addressed. New features consistently not working could be a sign of a problem in the team&#x2F;org itself (not the right people, enough people, or enough time allocated).<p>Even with all the best practices, big faults will make it through sometimes -- that&#x27;s just the nature of most software dev. I think the best way to handle them is be transparent, but also be <i>specific</i>. &quot;Fix bug where entire database can be corrupted&quot; will cause you a lot of grief (rightfully so). Something like &quot;Fix critical data corruption bug when saving a record containing specific trailing unicode characters on systems with libzip 1.3.3 or earlier installed&quot; is much better and helps reinforce that:<p>1. You have thoroughly investigated the problem<p>2. The scope of problem is limited, and doesn&#x27;t affect all customers (even though it could be most)<p>3. It&#x27;s understandable how such a bad bug could happen and why testing didn&#x27;t catch it')
