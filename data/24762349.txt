Owning a car (a couple of year old, not luxury) could be $400 month (deprecation, parking, insurance, gas, fixes, etc). Taking Uber to drive the same trips will cost you let say $300&#x2F;month. Please don&#x27;t read too deep into a specific number, this are all guestimates (they obviously wary in different places). As a result, you save $1200&#x2F;year, which is nice. You are asking why I am optimizing for 1&#x2F;10000 case and how much is that worth? Well... Here are a couple of scenarios, you need to drive a kid to an emergency room at 1am or super important business meeting popped up out. How much is it worth you? May be such events happens once in several years, but the price tag on them could be way-way higher than your savings. This is exactly why I used word &quot;insurance&quot;. Why does anybody buy insurance? The probably is 1&#x2F;10000 to get into trouble. The issue is that the price tag of this 1&#x2F;10000 is too high to ignore.')
