So I updated the template which didn&#x27;t solve the issue. Then I tried to find out what changed and it wasn&#x27;t just a few lines of code, but more fundamental things.<p>In the end, I just took a completely fresh version of the template and rebuild the documentation by copy and pasting the relevant parts.<p>For context: Initially I build the documentation in November 2018 and the update happened in April 2020.')
