There&#x27;s a number of different suspect or convenient sequences out there.  All of the evenly-spaced sequences could be considered suspicious if you go broadly enough.  A detail I tried to add back in up-thread: The sixth ball is from a separate pool of 20 balls.  So 50c5 * 20 is the total number of possible draws, and there are 14 directly in-order sequences.<p>But the main point was the methodology.  (1 - (1 - chance_of_sequence)^(n_draws)).')
