Everybody seemed to find it so inspiring, but I just found it kind of sad. The whole thing about being a Disney engineer seemed like such a manufactured dream. I don&#x27;t want to criticize someone who died too young, but it just all seems so empty to me. I don&#x27;t understand why a tenured professor who has all the freedom in the world would choose to go out of his way to work for such an evil corporation. It&#x27;s kind of funny that Disney ended up being the embodiment of all the villains in their movies.')
