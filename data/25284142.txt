Item(by='pdonis', descendants=None, kids=[25284519], score=None, time=1606958874, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25284059, text='<i>&gt; they didn&#x27;t solve the physics problems created by the engine position</i><p>The engine position, in itself, isn&#x27;t terribly unusual; the 757 and 767 both have engines in similar forward positions on the wings and have a similar pitch up moment due to the engines at high angles of attack. So do a number of Airbus models. Designing flight controls to deal with this issue is not new and has been well tested.<p>The particular issue with the 737 MAX was that Boeing wanted to <i>change</i> the engine position on an existing aircraft, <i>without</i> requiring a new type certification and pilot retraining. That meant that the flight controls had to not just properly account for the engine position, but to do so <i>while keeping the same stick force curve vs. angle of attack as existing 737 models</i>. That is what drove the MCAS software system that caused all the trouble. If the plane had been designed as a new type from the start, the engine position would not have been an issue; and the redesign is basically doing what a new type design would have done, as far as I can tell from the documents the FAA has published.')
