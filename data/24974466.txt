Our mission is to help people everywhere pursue their lives with greater clarity, purpose, and passion, so our product was developed by a team of leading behavioral scientists, researchers, and technologists. We&#x27;re already transforming the way companies approach talent development at high-performing organizations like Airbnb, Genentech, Mars, LinkedIn, and Workday among many others.<p>We are an agile development shop that lives and breathes lean startup and DevOps principles, and have built culture of engineering quality where each team member is empowered to have an impact on our mission. Our stack is primarily Ruby on Rails, Ember.js, Postgresql, AWS, and Docker and our principles and practices include:<p><pre><code>  - Comprehensive test coverage (&gt; 95%)\n  - Maintaining up to date dependencies (minor dependencies upgraded within 1 week of release, major dependencies 1 month)\n  - Continuous Deployment (ship early, ship often)\n  - Performance as a feature (&lt; 250ms 95th percentile API response time)\n  - &quot;Just in time&quot; Architecture (invest in architecture in lockstep with product initiatives)\n</code></pre>\nWe provide amazing benefits (flexible vacation, volunteer days), but if you ask the team they’ll tell you that the greatest benefit we offer employees is an incredibly meaningful mission and transformative work.
