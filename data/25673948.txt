For comparison, there were many hospitalizations every single night of the 90-ish day Antifa seige of the Oregon federal courthouse.<p>In Oregon, Antifa were blasting officers with fireworks, going after them with hammers, polearms, shields, etc. We didn&#x27;t see that in DC either. Instead we find the police generally getting along with the overwhelming majority of protesters.<p>Even 9 guns is nothing worth mentioning statistically. If those people had been interested in causing serious harm, almost all of them could have shown up with AR-15s. Hundreds of thousands of people with AR-15s could easily overpower any troops that could have been sent into the area. The fact that we didn&#x27;t see this once again plays against the media&#x27;s claims of a coup attempt.')
