So yes, eventually you may be forced to buy to cover your short, if don&#x27;t have enough cash you are able or willing to tie up as collateral. This can create a feedback loop as short-sellers buy and drive the price further up, forcing other short-sellers to buy, etc., the so-called short squeeze. I have no idea if this is happening now.')
