It&#x27;s a good start, though to make it fully accurate you have to add the right attributes to each endpoint. It works pretty well.<p>What I find really irksome about the .NET openapi tooling is the client generators use RestSharp under the hood which doesn&#x27;t support HttpClient. There&#x27;s no way you shouldn&#x27;t be using HttpClient in 2020. So companies leveraging openapi to generate their SDKs  are generating sub-par code.')
