Item(by='cmrdsprklpny', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608563777, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25490825, text='I have an app, metro.drone [1], on the App and Google Play stores that I created with LÖVE2D. While I haven’t seen many other examples, I’ve seen a lot more cross-platform game engines than UI-explicit engines, many of which have (at least limited) GUI capability. I’m relatively new to programming so part of what attracted me to LÖVE2D instead of something else was the simplicity and modularity; LÖVE2D-compatible packages existed for exactly what I needed with metro.drone. I’ve come to the broad conclusion that it’s more about choosing the right ecosystem for a project than the right ui toolkit; I was originally going to use Elm but it didn’t have a good synth library.<p>I should again recap that I’m a novice programmer, so this should be considered more a description of my thought process than advice. :)<p>[1]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dmitrivolkov.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;metro.drone" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;dmitrivolkov.com&#x2F;projects&#x2F;metro.drone</a>')
