If you ban people (especially political leaders!) from complaining that the election was stolen, what happens is that the <i>next</i> election <i>will</i> definitely be stolen, and no one will be able to do anything about it. Then that whole political side throws their support behind some military figure instead of a reality TV star, and that&#x27;s how the <i>real</i> coup happens and how democracy dies. Game Over.<p>This stuff has been thought over <i>very</i> thoroughly, a long time ago. It&#x27;s not nearly as trivial as y&#x27;all seem to think it is.')
