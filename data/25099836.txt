There&#x27;s a bunch of interesting maths behind it, but it&#x27;s better to start with what it actually does, and why you&#x27;d want to use it first. If you want to know more about the how, there&#x27;s some further reading suggestions below!<p>Yes, yes, yes, yes! Anybody teaching really has to understand that if you need a formula to explain a concept, you haven&#x27;t understood the concept yourself OR you simply don&#x27;t know how to explain it yet.<p>Sure, there are exceptions (there always are), but in my experience, lecturers, teachers and academics reach for formulas to &quot;explain&quot; things too quickly. Formulas are not explanations. They serve as PROOF that what you explained actually works.')
