No affiliation but they&#x27;ve been around &amp; had good low price tiers for a while now, easy to use, worked great, all with APIs for on demand. I think it&#x27;s all openstack based? Maybe? Love to see.<p>Lot of great &quot;lowendbox&quot; providers these days. And some not so great ones! Few offer the array of services you expect from a cloud provider (attachable storage, networking, ipv6, &amp;c). Great to see folks who do!<p>These days I&#x27;m mainly on by-thr-month boxes but I appreciate having some short-term load providers I respect &amp; trust.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lunanode.com&#x2F;pricing" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.lunanode.com&#x2F;pricing</a>')
