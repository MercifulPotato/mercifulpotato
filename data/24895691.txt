Some people prefer Standard ML&#x27;s syntax, though I actually prefer OCaml&#x27;s (most likely just a result of me learning OCaml first).<p>The module systems have some small differences, but are very similar (I believe OCaml&#x27;s was inspired by SML&#x27;s).<p>Standard ML is also standardized (hence the name), and there are multiple implementations, whereas OCaml is basically defined by its single implementation.<p>But OCaml does have a larger ecosystem, Opam, more features (first-class modules, polymorphic variants, etc.).')
