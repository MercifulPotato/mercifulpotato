I&#x27;ve actually built similar models for myself to build that intuition.  They&#x27;re so helpful and generally hard to find. I agree that scale is generally poorly taught.<p>I personally think having even a modest intuition for how to map physical knowledge to its appropriate &#x27;scale&#x27; (time&#x2F;space, from plank to universe) is one of the most straightforward ways to be &quot;smart&quot;.  And a great way to get to know the limits of our knowledge.<p>I still haven&#x27;t seen a video that matches my intuition.  Which is unfortunate.  I want to build a version of your scaler there, but for VR that you can slide up and down along at least time&#x2F;scale axes - and maybe additional ones too.')
