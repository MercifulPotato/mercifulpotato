But sub-optimal standards are very often preferable to <i>unpredictable</i>, and are definitely preferable to having to juggle multiple conflicting UI conventions at the same time when multitasking. That&#x27;s why we still have QWERTY, and why all the surviving scrollbars are on the right, and why pie menus never caught on.<p>You say you test UI designs professionally, and claim the higher ground of having empirical evidence. But it still sounds like you&#x27;re using worthless methodology by focusing only on your one app at a time and ignoring how it fits into its environment and the user&#x27;s broader workflow. Is that correct, or have you actually quantified the overall productivity loss an app introduces by violating the user&#x27;s expectations and habits?')
