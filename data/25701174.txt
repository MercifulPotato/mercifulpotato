Just because Haskell isn&#x27;t advertised as the &quot;data transformation&quot; language doesn&#x27;t mean it does better or worse than any other language at it.<p>In my personal experience of using Clojure, Haskell and Python for data transformation and parsers, Haskell does the best job for both. So this is the second time you hear it ;) Anyway, we are just throwing anecdata at each other. Personal stories are still useful for programming experiences since &quot;which is better&quot; isn&#x27;t that easy to measure. I would be happy to hear more about your experiences with Clojure.')
