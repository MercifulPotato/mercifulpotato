Name-based systems explicitly track renames with metadata; git does not. git calculates renames dynamically based on content.<p>And as a result regularly fucks up tracking renames, or plain refuses to do it without nonsensical workarounds if you copied or moved a file and modified it in the same commit. It also makes browsing histories, blaming, or tracking merges through renames incredibly expensive.')
