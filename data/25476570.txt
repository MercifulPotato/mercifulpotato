Item(by='BlargMcLarg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608374606, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25475402, text='&quot;from_file&quot;, &quot;by_name&quot;, etc. are fairly needless here. Most people are apt enough to grasp the first argument relates to the last word of the function name. Use properly named variables so a summary can take care of it, or only omit the noun, &quot;get list of profiles from&quot;.<p>Get itself is a terrible prefix and could be omitted, especially if you keep &quot;from&quot;. &quot;list_of_profiles_from(X)&quot; isn&#x27;t any less clear. Alternatives like &quot;read_list_of_profiles(file)&quot; exist.<p>&quot;List_of_profiles&quot; can be changed to &quot;profile list&quot;. You already did it with &quot;concatenate_profile_lists&quot;, showing inconsistency. Alternatively, depending on the context, &quot;list&quot; itself can be omitted entirely, and just state &quot;profiles&quot;.<p>&quot;merge_married_profiles_into_list_of_pairs&quot; can arguably be shorted to &quot;merge_married_profiles&quot; depending on IDE and language: that last bit should be clear from the returned value. Even without, it can still be shortened to &quot;pair_married_profiles&quot;, as the context should make it obvious if we look for more than 1 married couple, there will be some kind of collection. Additionally, your naming has one problem: &quot;merge_married_profiles&quot;. With all the verbose naming, it is still not clear what  &quot;married profile&quot; is. I&#x27;ll assume it means &quot;pair profiles of married couples&quot;, where you might as well say &quot;pair_profiles_of_married_couples&quot;.<p>&gt;Programmers like to think they&#x27;re smart and original.<p>It is <i>because</i> they think to be smart and original, they fall into the trap of overly verbose naming. Not from a lack of it. Have you looked at a legacy Java code base? Many of them can be slashed in half <i>just</i> by renaming variables to something that keeps the meaning, or draws meaning from the context very obviously. These guys are going against their own mind&#x27;s natural ability to read context, or worse, conditioned themselves to learned helplessness.')
