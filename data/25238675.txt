This is all very deterministic.<p>What the researcher <i>subjectively</i> observe however is another matter. If the universe splits, so does the researcher. The problem of observing outcomes turns into an anthropy problem: if I split myself in two copies, in which copy am I likeliest to find myself into? I&#x27;m not sure making bets about that even makes <i>sense</i>: which copy I find myself into has no bearing in the final state of the universe.')
