How things actually are split would be up in the air.<p>Of course YouTube would need ads. My point was that YouTube doesn&#x27;t need to be in the same company as search, not that YouTube doesn&#x27;t need ads. The ad network would likely need to be split into the new companies that are formed so all the parts that need their own ad network could have it.<p>Chrome likely could not survive on its own unless search paid for it like they do with Firefox. I am not sure all the products&#x2F;services that Google has and their individual ability to survive without Google. That is something that would need to be determined by the people involved with a breakup.')
