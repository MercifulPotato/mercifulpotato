Some observations about that:<p>Westervelt noticed problems with Roost but tried to gently correct those and give her second chances.<p>Westervelt noticed problems that were recurring: that is, even after being nudged and given a second chance, Roost made the same mistakes more than once.<p>Roost now does something that ended up being very public.  Now, finally, <i>conveniently</i>, Westervelt decides <i>this</i> is the last straw, and cuts her loose.<p>I&#x27;m not saying Roost is a saint, or that Westervelt is being disingenuous.  In general, people try to do the best they can with the information they have at the time.  But I think it likely that Westervelt&#x27;s decision was <i>also</i> influenced by the fact that this storm was public and heated, and if she&#x27;d done nothing, that might have blown back on her.  There&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with that, but let&#x27;s at least acknowledge that&#x27;s what could have (and IMO probably) happened.')
