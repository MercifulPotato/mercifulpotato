It was status symbol, a tool for virtue signalling, a luxury first and a car last. A ton of these friends were cross shopping the Tesla with a Civic, Corolla or a Prius. Because for these non-car enthusiasts, if not Tesla, they couldn&#x27;t imagine spending that kind of money on a car.<p>It is similar to how Apple convinced non-traditional customers to buy a $500 watch or how Beats convinced your average person to splurge $300 on headphones that didn&#x27;t even sound great. The first adopters ordered their cars 3 years out, before they&#x27;d even seen one reviewed.<p>The blind-ness comes from the numerous contradictions that Tesla represents.<p>The Tesla is fast, but it is bought by non-enthusiasts who never speed. The Tesla is green so it&#x27;d appeal to sustainability activists. But Manufacturing consists a bulk of carbon footprint, so if you cared you&#x27;d get a used car. Tesla also has toxic and exploitative work practices that someone who loves sustainability would generally disavow.<p>Teslas are great cars and provide a very different value proposition. But, the reason Tesla is doing well is not because it beat the Germans at their own game (as the articles want to imply). It is because they played a different game all together.<p>Tesla - &quot; Exploration and <i>exploitation</i> &quot;')
