That doesn&#x27;t give me much confidence about support while Macs get more and more esoteric hardware configurations.<p>As for #2, perhaps, but we&#x27;ve already seen what happens when Apple adds their proprietary hardware to existing x86 systems with things like the T2 chip or the Touchbar. Support for either on Linux is still poor and nonexistent. Full integration with hardware and software on Apple&#x27;s end means that they don&#x27;t have to worry about compatibility like 3rd party hardware manufacturers do.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Dunedan&#x2F;mbp-2016-linux" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Dunedan&#x2F;mbp-2016-linux</a>')
