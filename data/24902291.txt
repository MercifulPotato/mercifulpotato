Which, exactly as the OP said, is a metric that can be manipulated by doing more testing.<p>The whole reason we emphasize positivity rate is to try to compensate for the inherent bias in reporting raw case counts.<p>There have been <i>far more cases</i> than we have ever formally detected with testing. There’s plenty of room to increase that number by testing more people, but it will not affect hospitalizations or deaths -\nwhich is exactly what we’re seeing.')
