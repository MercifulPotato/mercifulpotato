Item(by='thatwasunusual', descendants=None, kids=[25558943], score=None, time=1609160975, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25558341, text='&gt; It&#x27;s still useful to determine a theoretical &quot;worst case&quot; that could occur due to usage of promises here.<p>I disagree. It&#x27;s not useful if the benchmark is both unrealistic and only applies to theoretical cases. As said: no sane developer would ever do this kind of calculation &quot;async.&quot;<p>The author of this benchmark could have spent the exact amount of time writing an article that benchmarkes towards realistic and practical situations, like reading&#x2F;writing from&#x2F;to disk, communicating with an API, a database etc.<p>You could argue that the benchmark is _only_ about the async&#x2F;await&#x2F;promise overhead, but that doesn&#x27;t make sense either: everything you do in a script, application and what not is basically &quot;overhead&quot; at some point. For example, if you want to calculate the fibonacci out of 10 given numbers, just do it with a calculator and store the result in an array. Anything else is overhead. Actually, using an array is probably also overhead, depending on the situation at hand.')
