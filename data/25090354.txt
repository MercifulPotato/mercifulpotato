The country was designed to be a union of semi-autonomous states, not a single entity. The president is still elected democratically, but the state&#x27;s votes are what matter, not individuals. If we went by the popular vote, it would be a minority of states imposing their will on the majority of the remaining states. You could argue that that&#x27;s preferable, but acting like Republicans are using &quot;this one weird trick&quot; to get electoral votes is ignoring why the country was set up the way it is.')
