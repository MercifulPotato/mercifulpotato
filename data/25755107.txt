There&#x27;s more energy in the atmosphere, and that can lead to warmer weather (on average this is the case) but it also means there&#x27;s more energy to whip up storms or move regions of hot or cold air much further, to places that are not used to them. So unusually cold weather can in fact be a result of climate change.')
