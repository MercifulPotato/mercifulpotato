Now I can see how to fit in the information (accurate? I don&#x27;t know) that someone else on HN said - that owners of large blocks of stock are driving the price downwards at times by selling to each other. If this is true, then the simple thesis of the Infinity Squeeze is wrong and explains why short sellers keep piling in. Somebody is going to lose money somewhere...<p>But I have no idea, I am not in finance and don&#x27;t take anything I say as fact.<p>Sociologically, there are a whole lot of different things driving it and I look forward to the book examining all those aspects.')
