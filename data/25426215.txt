Item(by='throwaway535', descendants=None, kids=[25426388], score=None, time=1607998191, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25425683, text='&gt; I’m an immigrant, and I’ll never stand for any kind of reparations for descendants of former slaves. Invariably this will come out of tax dollars to which I’m contributing by way of income tax. Why should I be charged for wrongs - however horrible - in which neither myself nor my ancestors were involved?<p>Why should you be a contributor to the wrongs of this country&#x27;s past? Simple, because you are a member&#x2F;resident of this country, and this country benefits from them. I could be wrong, but I don&#x27;t see any complaints about paying of any war debt accrued by the US from entering WW II or the Vietnam war, but you also pay towards that. It&#x27;s accepted that current us citizens who benefit from the previous actions of the country, also have responsiblity for the previous decisions of the country.<p>An enormous part of the reason why this country is so financially successful is because of slavery and stealing wages for so long. That&#x27;s why the US was an agricultural powerhouse, that&#x27;s why the north industrialized so quickly, that&#x27;s why we became a major economic power in the 20th century.<p>And even you yourself admit you see all of those benefits, and reap them. You came to this country presumably for those exact reasons. You&#x27;re as you say an immigrant, and the reason you chose to come here, and not stay where you were was because of exactly the benefits this country accrued by leaning heavily on slavery during it&#x27;s critical period.<p>The fact you had negative experiences while here (and I&#x27;m sorry you did), doesn&#x27;t invalidate or outweigh the fact that you came here to benefit from America&#x27;s benefits, and that you have benefited from them.<p>American education does an incredibly poor job of covering the financial windfall of slaver in the US. And (extremely reasonably) people from other countries who move here never learned about it back home.  To give some perspective, <i></i>the value of &quot;human capital&quot; held as chattel slaves, was more valuable than all industrial and transportation capital in the entire country<i></i>.[1] That&#x27;s how much value was present. I&#x27;d highly recommend anyone who hasn&#x27;t really read about slavery to really read about it. Unfortunately there was an intentional concerted effort in the middle of last century to downplay the scope and impact of slavery in the US and a lot of those vestiges are present because it was very successful.<p>There is way more here than the simplistic arguments that are made online in chat forums. I&#x27;d recommend looking into it. While not ideal, this essay is a decent place to start if you&#x27;re curious.
