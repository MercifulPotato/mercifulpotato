It&#x27;s possible to live by yourself without anyone. The question is the quality of that life. I&#x27;ve seen many, many, many people struggling with their daily problems to the point of suffering anxiety, depression and many other mental disorders and feel a lot of relief just by talking to someone else.<p>I agree with your point of being difficult to make friends the older you get but I for one, love to learn about others backgrounds and stories. If that lead to a new friendship I very much welcome it.')
