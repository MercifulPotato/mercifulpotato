These get way more wear and tear than normal electronics being exposed to sweat, sunscreen, etc. On top of that these must be safe for long skin exposure and comfortable across many head shapes and sizes.\n * High quality magnets with custom speaker design for low THD and large frequency range.\n * 2 custom ASICs built for sound processing and low power bluetooth and 10 audio cores each.\n * 10 microphone array for ANC and wind noise cancelation.\n * Multiple accelerometers + gyros head  tracking with spatial audio.<p>It you remove one of those components, I&#x27;d be surprised if Apple still shipped this. At least 40 people worked on designing and engineering this new headphone. There are not many companies in the world with the right kind of talent for this and Apple happens to be one of them.')
