Obviously that didn&#x27;t happen.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t that be natural to expect because of efforts to extend its lifetime?<p>If this study has a positive effect on policies, etc. I think it&#x27;d also be natural to expect that it lives longer than 2064. I interpret 2064 as being the end of its lifetime only if we do absolutely nothing more to prevent it.')
