The average driver in the USA drives 13,500 miles per year (far more than the average driver in the UK&#x2F;Europe!)<p>That&#x27;s about 37 miles per day, so about <i>12.5 kWh</i> per night on average at ~3 miles per kWh. And remember, those who are driving long distance are probably going to be using fast chargers on-route, so their domestic charging demand will be lower.<p>Secondly, even if they did need 40 kWh every night, that only equates to 4 kW over a 10 hour charging cycle. Easily manageable by avoiding the typical late afternoon &#x2F; early evening peaks. Most grids have a lot of spare capacity between, say, 9PM and 7AM.')
