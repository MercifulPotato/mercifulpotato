If a car manufacturer&#x27;s sales decline, do you want your tax money to go to fund their company as corporate welfare or do you want your taxes used for hospitals, schools, roads etc? Why are we wasting billions of needed dollars to maintain the lifestyle of the owners of CAFOs (concentrated aninal feed operations, that is, big industrial animal farms -subsidies don&#x27;t go to small farmers for the most part-)\nLook up Agriculture Fairness Alliance if you want to see the data and learn more about the very critical and urgent task of ending these absurd destructive subsidies and instead help farmers transition to sustainable and healthy business models that will allow us to avoid the worst consequences of climate change if we do switch fast enough<p>So yeah I am shocked that this very urgent matter is not being discussed and challenged yet at a mainstream level')
