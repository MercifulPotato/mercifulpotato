My guess is that they made a good portion of $113M from this (it&#x27;s best for customers to drain their bank accounts) so no need to cry for them.<p>edit: and I&#x27;m reading that this would happen within the warranty period. It&#x27;s best for customers to keep them from getting their device fixed during the warranty period.')
