But if you are expecting to fund a real search engine with a few hundred thousand dollars you are insane. It will take a ton of development and a ton of hardware to create an index that isn&#x27;t a pile of garbage. This isn&#x27;t 2000 anymore. You need to index &gt;100 billion pages and you need it updated and you need great crawling and parsing and you need great algorithms and probably an entirely proprietary engine and you need to CONSTANTLY refine all the above until it isn&#x27;t garbage. Maybe you could muster something passable for $1B over 5 years with a strong core team that attracts great talent. If Apple actually does this, as they are rumored to, I bet they dump $10b into it just for the initial version.')
