That sucks. It also sucks that stuff got busted. I&#x27;m sure some people will get arrested and charged with things. But these are things solved with money.<p>No one was injured. My point is that saying it was &quot;violent&quot; implies that there were people hurt. I was reading with horror to see how many had died. That was why it stuck out to me when there were not even injuries.<p>It is as simple as that. Using a word that does not imply something that didn&#x27;t happen -- it is just good writing, it&#x27;s not pushing an agenda. Replace &quot;violence&quot; with &quot;riots&quot; and it has a much more generic implication. Simple.')
