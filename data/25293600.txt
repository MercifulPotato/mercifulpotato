The technical improvements you make may be kept under wraps to gain a competitive advantage; and policy agenda work is essentally part of PR strategy, it&#x27;s accepted if and only if that agenda benefits the strategic interests of the company. Tenure in academia offers some freedom of research (though not even then abolute), but when working for private companies, you don&#x27;t have that freedom unless you have a specific contract asserting that, and even then you&#x27;d be wary of biting the hand that feeds you.<p>Like, if you want to expose climate change risks, it&#x27;s not going to work out while employed in an oil company, and if you want to advocate for regulation of ML research while working in a company that would be bound by this regulation, this is certainly something that the management would be expected to care about.')
