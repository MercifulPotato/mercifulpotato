Market manipulation arises out of context. When you start tweeting about how you should totally sell a stock that you have a short position on, then you start stepping into illegal behavior.<p>In other words, the capital firm that got short-squeezed by the idiots at &#x2F;r&#x2F;WSB were also doing something illegal. It&#x27;s not the case that the short is legal but the longs aren&#x27;t. Alternatively, if the argument is that &#x2F;r&#x2F;WSB isn&#x27;t market-manipulating, they just think the stock is undervalued, then the hedge fund can use the same argument. &quot;We think this stock is overvalued so we shorted it&quot; is how they&#x27;ll explain it to the SEC.<p>And that&#x27;s not an invalid position: GME has been suspiciously overvalued way before any of the parties involved started holding positions. It&#x27;s a retail-heavy business in pandemic season with multiple year-over-year same-store sales cuts. What that means is that, for each one of their stores, on average, they sold 30% less product in Q3 2020 than they did in Q3 2019. And even if you think, &quot;oh, that&#x27;s just the COVID economy, they&#x27;ll be back&quot;; Q3 2019 sales were already 20% down from the year before. This is a company nobody wanted to buy games from even before a novel coronavirus decided to close a good chunk of their stores.<p>The fun fact about that above explanation is that it provides plausible deniability for someone trying to juice the market in a particular direction. Hell, if &#x2F;r&#x2F;WSB hadn&#x27;t caught the hedge fund with their pants down, they probably would have gotten off scot-free. However, the financial vigilantes dumping fat stacks into GME don&#x27;t have the same kind of excuse - they explicitly coordinated in public fora to manipulate stock price, so it&#x27;s an easy target for an SEC that really doesn&#x27;t get the budget necessary to prosecute the complex kinds of financial crimes they&#x27;re tasked with.<p>So, from a legal perspective, both parties are in the wrong. From an enforcement perspective, &#x2F;r&#x2F;WSB is a soft target.')
