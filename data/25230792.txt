I am currently using a paper notebook. Why? Because, while inconvenient, I can use it in any situation, with any medium. I can write down an email task I got, IM conversations, phone calls, paper articles, websites I&#x27;d want to read (although I&#x27;ll email myself the link), things I want to buy. I have one place to look at, and really only one. Old stuff that is done or rejected gets marked and crossed out, remaining readable.<p>I&#x27;ve wanted to do things digitally, but nothing really encompasses more than a single thing. You get email apps that maybe can define tasks from an email. Rarely more than one task per email. This is siloed from the bookmarks in my browser. Actually, more than one browser, so multiple bookmark lists. But using this even as a simple &quot;to read&quot;-list doesn&#x27;t work, because I cannot add books, printed articles or PDFs to the usual bookmark list. Adding annotations is something to dream of. Mobile or desktop support is often broken or absent.<p>I&#x27;m currently trying out org-mode plus git. But I&#x27;ve tried a lot and I&#x27;m not getting my hopes up.<p>For people looking for customers: I wan&#x27;t everything integrated. Don&#x27;t assume everything to be the Web. Don&#x27;t assume Gmail as my mail provider. Don&#x27;t assume that I work primarily from my desktop or mobile device. Don&#x27;t assume I&#x27;ll write everything in word. And the kitchen sink ;)')
