That is more than enough time to drive from their manufacturing location in Wisconsin (this might be a cold storage faultily and manufacturing elsewhere - I&#x27;m not sure) to anywhere in North America - so long as wherever you drive to already has people lined up to get the vaccine.<p>The above won&#x27;t be hard to do for the first 3 months at least: just give the shot to health care workers as they come in for their scheduled shift. What gets hard is when you want to do a walk-in clinic: you need to figure out how much to order without knowing how many people will show up.<p>Note, don&#x27;t take the above as a statement that Pfizer will (or should) ship at higher temperatures. While it works out on paper that they can, they have been putting effort into arranging really cold shipment for a reason: it is best to give the entire time stored at higher temperatures to the end clinic. Human logistics are the hardest part of this and this and really cold shipment gives more flexibility to the hardest part.<p>In any case: with both vaccines the hard part is ensuring people get their second dose on time after starting the shots!  This is by far the most difficult logistical issue with either vaccine.')
