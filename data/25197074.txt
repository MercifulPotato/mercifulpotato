For the software solution you have to trust the computer and its file encryption utilities. For the hardware solution you have to trust the USB stick.<p>Although one could assert that data coming from an untrusted computer might be already compromised. It might not be the case for an air gapped system.<p>Or you can trust different aspects of the computer at a different level. You can trust it for its normal functions but maybe it doesn&#x27;t get regular updates for file encryption utilities and USB mass storage drivers. Sometimes you still need to fetch data from it using trusted USB devices.<p>Threat models can be complicated, also it makes sense to apply defense in depth.')
