It&#x27;s more a function of how parking in downtown is virtually non-existent.  So if you want to go there, you need to take a taxi or public transport (or have someone drive you, which is a luxury most people don&#x27;t have).<p>Taxis here are insanely expensive and, while the public transport system is very good, it doesn&#x27;t go everywhere.
