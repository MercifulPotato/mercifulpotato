The only reason miners are operating is because they expect a reward that is greater than their expenses.<p>That means block rewards plus TX fees need to be greater than the cost of running the network. Block rewards are effectively a tax on existing holders through inflation of supply, but that will go to zero in the long run. As the rewards decreases, TX fees will need to increase, which means the average TX will rise. This will increasingly make using BTC prohibitively expensive unless the block size is increased so as to allow more TX per block.<p>But if the scenario should arise where revenue no longer covers the costs of being a miner, the whole economic model breaks down. This could even get to the point where going rogue, and attempting to exploit the network with the hash power, could become more profitable for a miner.')
