Item(by='IronRanger', descendants=None, kids=[25435941, 25436087, 25436414, 25436569], score=None, time=1608070195, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25435652, text='The major underappreciated factor for this release is the impact of COVID lockdowns - particularly enforced WFH - on the final development of this title.<p>For me this is the single factor which has lead to so many of the problems inherent in the game. You cannot just pickup a multi-hundred person digital interactive art project (ie. a video game) and shift it online overnight.<p>Still, I think CDPR were right to release the game. Its good enough, content is complete, and they need to have the product on shelves before Christmas and before people lose interest in last-gen consoles.<p>Having the product out there will motivate its staff - still stuck at home in Lockdown Poland - to work on the very public bugs.<p>Its also interesting that Poland seems to have had basically the same COVID case and death profile as Ukraine, despite Ukraine having a significantly less strict lockdown (bars, restaurants, workplaces never shut this Autumn or Winter).')
