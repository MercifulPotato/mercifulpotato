For instance, gunpowder and paper both spread from China to the Middle East before making their way to Europe. The concept of zero (as a digit) is also widely acknowledged to have originated from India. And even these are just anecdotes, not to be taken as proof or refutation of a broader trend.<p>&gt; The earliest discoverer is given the credit as long as there is some evidence of the dissemination of the discovery.<p>Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not always the case, especially once the associated names become ingrained. Sometimes there&#x27;s co-credit even for independent discoveries, something nothing.<p>Some examples, from <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_examples_of_Stigler%27s_law" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;List_of_examples_of_Stigler%27...</a> :<p>- Chernoff bounds were actually named because of a notable paper that used them, even though Chernoff simply failed to credit Rubin because he thought it was a minor lemma (since it&#x27;s an application of Markov&#x27;s inequality).<p>- Floyd-Warshall is named after two independent discoverers, even though there&#x27;s a third independent discoverer.<p>- Gaussian elimination was well-known (and present in textbooks) at the time that he said he used &quot;common elimination&quot;.<p>- The Ising model was given to Ising by Lenz, his doctoral advisor.<p>(There are plenty of other instances, e.g. Cooley-Tukey FFT, Reynolds number, Schottky diode.)<p>Some other examples:<p>- Watson and Crick get most of the credit for discovering DNA&#x27;s structure, even though they leaned heavily on Rosalind Franklin&#x27;s work (she died from ovarian cancer, probably due to x-ray radiation).<p>- &quot;Arabic numerals&quot; were invented by the Indians.')
