As you progress (and decide if the hobby is even worth doing), you pick up some of those $10 a tube paints and realize the purists weren&#x27;t wrong, they DO paint better, but they won&#x27;t make you a better painter.<p>Personally I have a $99 AKAI MPC-Mini with only one octave worth of keys and have only dabbled a bit with it connected to my PC, but its infinitely better than Smule on the iPad and eventually with an app or through lessons on Youtube, one could absolutely learn the skills needed to play a composition an actual piano--all as the GP said, from the comfort of your own home, at your own pace.')
