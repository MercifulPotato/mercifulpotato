Item(by='notsuoh', descendants=None, kids=[24720536, 24719669], score=None, time=1602168482, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24718676, text='I work at a company that has an infosec division and I don&#x27;t know how we got so lucky with the people there. They&#x27;re seriously legit low level kernel type programmers who seem to be able to reverse engineer anything given enough time and are able to seriously reason about what&#x27;s going on in security. The types of people who speak at and headline at the largest security conferences, etc. Again, no idea how we got so lucky to have a great crew.<p>I&#x27;m not an infosec person myself. But my experience is that upwards of 80% of the ones I interact with who aren&#x27;t like the people I mentioned above are just hangers on because they like the group or being associated with &quot;infosec&quot; because it sounds cool or something. Maybe it&#x27;s because you don&#x27;t need to be an engineer to regurgitate OWASP vulnerabilities and tell people to use password managers, but perhaps that&#x27;s enough to, after you look around the room of infosec people, feel like you&#x27;re an &quot;infosec person.&quot; To be clear, that stuff is important, but not anywhere close to sufficient. So a lot of applications for our roles come from these people, who just sit on twitter all day and retweet the Taylor Swift security person, but they&#x27;re totally not technical and have done nothing of note other than write compliance plans.<p>My hypothesis is that it&#x27;s all this noise that makes hiring good infosec people difficult. If I&#x27;m hiring a kernel programmer or SRE I seem to get much more signal in my applications, but hire someone for security or infosec and there&#x27;s too much noise from people like above.')
