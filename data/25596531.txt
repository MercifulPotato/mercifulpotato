You&#x27;ll still be using a symmetric key rather than asymmetric, which means that compromises can be made worse (I get root on one server -&gt; I get user passwords as they log in -&gt; I have access to everything that they have access to now), and you&#x27;ve invested a lot of effort to secure it rather than just `PasswordAuthentication no`, `ChallengeResponseAuthentication no`, done.')
