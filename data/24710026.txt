If a task slips by a week, now it&#x27;s worth half points, and quarter points the week after that etc. The motivation to &quot;get it over the finish line&quot; is also going to slump exponentially for anyone optimizing for rewards points, isn&#x27;t that what we&#x27;re trying to avoid in the first place?')
