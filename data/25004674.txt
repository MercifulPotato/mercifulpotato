Our Prop I says it’s for something, but the board of supervisor who’s pushing the idea admitted there’s no guarantee the funds will go to what it was put on the ballot for. The money from Prop I will go into the general fund. Why is this important? The city has a huge pension liability they’re not able to renegotiate and keep from obligations to keep paying it. The city’s budget for next year is somewhere near $13b. Yes billion. For a city of 800k, our budget is $13b.')
