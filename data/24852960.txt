As a kid in 1984 in NJ I went to a high school where an english teacher claimed to have psychic abilities. At first I was enthralled but as I leaned toward scientific thought I grew skeptical. In english class with that teacher we ended up having debates as a project. I chose to debate the non-existence of ESP. James Randi lived in NJ at the time and I wrote or called (I don&#x27;t remember) him to learn more to debunk these abilities. To my surprise, he invited me (and my father) to visit him at his home. He shared with me his thoughts, taught me an illusion (to use in my debate), and even shared that he had a file on my teacher who had claimed psychic abilities publicly and that he had failed Mr. Randi&#x27;s tests. Thank you James Randi for your time, patience, education, and encouragement to pursue scientific thought.')
