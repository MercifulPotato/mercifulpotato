Food provides value in that you can eat it to survive. Housing provides value in that it provides shelter from the elements. A goat provides milk and you can eat it. Barter systems typically involve the trade of two such goods. The problem is that such goods typically spoil with time, which is a primary advantage of fiat currency -- it is not subject to physical constraints.<p>Historically, people also used things like salt, which had intrinsic value (for preserving and flavoring food) but didn&#x27;t spoil. But the use becomes so abstract that its pointless to haul salt around. Eventually you transition to precious metals, which also have <i>some</i> intrinsic value (for engineering various goods) but much less concrete. Then you transition to effective &quot;gold IOUs&quot; (gold-backend currency).<p>The idea of having a currency completed untethered to anything of value is relatively new. One of the most interesting aspects of bitcoin is proponents fervently advocate for <i>one</i> element of the gold standard (a fixed supply), but not the other (something physical of utility).')
