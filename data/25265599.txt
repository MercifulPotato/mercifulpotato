You don&#x27;t want a corrupt culture. At the time you&#x27;ve hit billions of dollars of corruption, it&#x27;s like termites hollowing out your house structure or COVID19 shutting down your country for 9 months. If killing those first few termites costs THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS or you were spending A MILLION DOLLARS for each COVID19 case coming into your country to definitely get it under control, it&#x27;s a bargain.')
