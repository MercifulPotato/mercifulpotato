But does it scale to teams of hundreds of designers?<p>This comment seems to come out of nowhere. Cyberpunk isn&#x27;t written in UE4 to the best of my knowledge. But rant time! I love ue4 blueprints. I think they&#x27;re the bees knees because documentation of things is so hard, but blueprints make that so easy! The ability to grab a bunch of nodes and collapse them into one node means you can comfortably make your top level view of things just a series of collapsed nodes with long form descriptions in full sentences. So your high level stuff is basically pseudocode.<p>Most people don&#x27;t do this of course. But then most people don&#x27;t write good code, and lots of people writing blueprints  one sees in the wild don&#x27;t even know how to code to begin with.<p>Blueprints are, imo, what people really want when they think they want jupyter notebooks for data science.')
