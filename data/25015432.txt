I started playing the games off of the cassettes included with the machine and at some point I typed &quot;List&quot; for the first time.  That opened a world that redirected my entire life.  I started trying to understand the code and alter the games so I could cheat.  Then tried to replicate how the games worked, then made new games, and on and on.  The accessibility of that process is rare today.<p>While countless computers have come and gone in the ~40 years since, I still have that PET in my basement.')
