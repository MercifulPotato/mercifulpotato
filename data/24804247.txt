I <i>almost</i> would like to see it happen, if only because it would have precisely the opposite effect expected by all the people whining about being censored. Though, I suppose you can&#x27;t be censored if the channel itself is extinguished.<p>More practically, the technically literate would go back to the world of Usenet, mailing-lists, and minimalistic forums like HN, hopefully inventing distributed reputation systems in the process. I have this vague idea for PGP web of trust-like signing of Usenet posts (published as hidden posts when readers +1&#x2F;-1) which are then SPAM scored based on the depth of the attestation chain to the reader&#x27;s own trusted posters, which may have been seeded from one or more centralized databases of group maintainers, similar to the current registration system for moderated Usenet groups except you could freely choose alternative registrars.')
