It just wasn&#x27;t seen as in the realm of the possible.<p>This totally seems to be the case. I&#x27;ve had way more problems to the connection from home being slow then I&#x27;ve had because of the corporate network. This also seems to be true for everyone that I&#x27;ve worked with. At this point I don&#x27;t think there would be much benefit to upgrading the corporate network it&#x27;s just not where the bottleneck is.')
