The velocity changes,  particularly when the system is under stress.<p>If the government doubled the money supply instantly,  for instance,  the real GDP would increase by (say) 5% immediately because people would activate productive capacity that was not there.  It wouldn&#x27;t double,  however,  because it takes time go to grow.<p>If velocity were constant prices would (almost) double right away.  If the influx of money caused velocity to drop,  however,  the system could absorb extra money right away.<p>(Compare that to the theory of the Great Depression that when inequality puts all the dollars in the pockets of misers who save instead of spend,  demand collapses.)<p>Another theory of inflation is that inflation happens if people expect inflation to happen.<p>If I think that prices are going to go up 5% next year,  I am going to ask for a 5% raise,  my employer will expect to raise prices 5% next year so it is ok...<p>People today do not believe in inflation so that governments can borrow and&#x2F;or print a lot of money without provoking it.<p>That condition could go on for a long time until the psychology changes,  in which case inflation returns.')
