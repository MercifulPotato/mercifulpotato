Where I live (Japan), AFAIK, theft from cars is practically non-existent. Leaving things in your car visible is not an issue. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever seen a pile of glass from a car window busted the entire time I&#x27;ve spent here (14 yrs) where as in SF, several times, I&#x27;d walk by Dolores Park or down Folsom and see a pile of glass every 3rd car space.<p>Once you get used to it living without such theft it&#x27;s hard not to see places that have lots of theft from car issues as more 3rd world like than 1st. And it&#x27;s sad that people get so used to it they take it as normal. I used to. In California had my car broken into 5 times and even stolen once.')
