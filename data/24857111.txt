But do you mean to use conspiracy in a pejorative sense?<p>I think its pretty obvious that people &#x27;breathe together&#x27; and formulate plans that work best for them.  So with us, at the individual level, and so with those who have all the money and operate at the macro level.  Are you saying that conspiracies don&#x27;t happen?  What is your method of finding the true ones?<p>The answer is that we require unfiltered information, and open communication with others.  We need to personally engage in verifying claims.  We can only confirm or deny whatever claims are made, if we have the information.  If that is unavailable because of censorship we can only verify very little.  This is where we are today.<p>As we can only verify very little, the problem is that we are not getting the information.  Who is restricting information then?  Is the world&#x27;s leading, corporate-sponsored, search indexer (google), preventing the free flow of information?  Well, yes it is.  So we can say google is part of the problem, not the solution.')
