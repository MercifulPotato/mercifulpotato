And I felt more disconnected.<p>After a while, though, it just sort of filtered the events down to those I cared more about. My good friends still reach out directly and vice versa. I think it took a while for that to start happening though.<p>I&#x27;ve lost touch with many acquaintances, but if I&#x27;m being honest it&#x27;s probably better that I don&#x27;t expend energy on those people.
