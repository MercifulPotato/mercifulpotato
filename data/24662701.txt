Notting Hill Carnival is pretty much the definition of what that represented - a cultural celebration of one community being opened up to and enjoyed by others. I grew up close enough to hear the bass vibrating my windows and went almost every year despite not having any links to its origin communities. Despite this, it played an important part in my life and I feel these experiences informed my political&#x2F;social outlook.<p>Cultural appropriation is a genuine phenomenon, but the difference between attending carnival and culturally appropriating it is a subtle one. For me, it comes down to intent and this is very hard to prove.<p>Am I doing it in solidarity - sharing a celebration with people who&#x27;s neighbourhood I share and supporting their cultural expression? Or am I impersonating other communities for my own enjoyment? To a third party, it&#x27;s can be difficult to tell the difference.<p>&gt; Cultural appropriation doesnt seem to be a problem anywhere else but the USA.<p>I feel that the countries which have historically dealt with the realities of a multicultural society better have less issues with cultural appropriation - cultural segregation leads to ownership and identity issues. But that certainly doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t exist outside the USA. There is a context in which what Adele did is fine, and one in which it isn&#x27;t - one photo won&#x27;t tell you which it is.')
