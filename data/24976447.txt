A formal analysis&#x2F;discussion of election forecasting is in this paper: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stat.columbia.edu&#x2F;~gelman&#x2F;research&#x2F;published&#x2F;jdm200907b.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stat.columbia.edu&#x2F;~gelman&#x2F;research&#x2F;published&#x2F;jdm2...</a><p>Edward says that Nate&#x27;s prediction should be interpreted as:\n“If nothing else changes between now and the election, Joe Biden has a 85% chance of winning.” (Silver’s argument)\nBut the problem is this prediction is not testable as election only occurs once at the end. Thus, one should use Nate&#x27;s early predictions as pure entertainment.<p>Nate&#x27;s final predictions show that they are well-calibrated across all of his political predictions but it is hard to estimate how accurate his model predictions are just for <i>presidential elections</i> given he has predicted only a few so far (unless one assumes all elections have similar uncertainty, which is clearly not true).')
