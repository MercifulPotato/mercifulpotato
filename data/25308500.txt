I’m not sure what to think. It seemed absurd to submit a paper for internal academic review one day prior to a major deadline. Yet today we’re hearing that it’s common (I can believe that; standard big company stuff) and that Google hasn’t been doing academic reviews at all until very recently &#x2F; possibly this incident.<p>So it feels like, suddenly, the cornerstones of the arguments against her are vaporizing before our eyes. This could go badly for El Goog unless they stop making official statements on the matter.<p>Saying nothing would have been better than giving a convenient post for all the former Google employees to come out of the woodwork and say “That’s not true! Google never did academic reviews; they solely checked whether business IP was being exposed.”<p>It’s ironic that people are painting her as unprofessional in that context; I’d be frustrated too, if that’s really the situation.')
