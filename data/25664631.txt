I seem to remember there was a massive Jewish proletariat that went straight to the camps. German Jewish population might have fared a little better economically (but that remains to be proved with numbers) but I believe most of Eastern Europe Jewish population was NOT rich. So I get your point but I am afraid things are little more complex. (Any sources about the topic welcome)')
