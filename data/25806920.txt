Item(by='edflsafoiewq', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610843494, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25806393, text='The notation is from math; the point of it is that you can manipulate it like a normal expression, but it&#x27;s &quot;anonymous&quot;; o(1) means <i>some</i> function that goes to zero, but we don&#x27;t bother with a name, just recording the asymptotic behavior.<p>For example, f&#x27;(x) = lim (f(x+h)-f(x))&#x2F;h can be rewritten with an error term f&#x27;(x) = (f(x+h)-f(x))&#x2F;h + o(1), and then you can manipulate it more freely, say like f(x+h) = f(x) + hf&#x27;(x) + o(h). There&#x27;s no need to drag out a bunch of useless names, each qualified by a set membership, to do this. I mean e(h) in o(1), e2(h) := h e(h) in o(h), etc.<p>The failure of &quot;reflexivity&quot;, eg O(f) = O(f), is because the anonymity hides whether the two O(f)s are referring to the same function (ie. exactly what a name would tell us).')
