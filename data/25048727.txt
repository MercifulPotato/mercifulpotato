It it possible that quarantine is worsening those hardships? Sure. But when you claim that COVID related hardships are due exclusively to quarantine you are basically invalidating their experience by saying that a chronic condition alone wouldn&#x27;t cause these issues.<p>I didn&#x27;t claim that but I don&#x27;t think that matters to you.  All I said was that it&#x27;s hard to tease out the difference between covid caused hardships and covid treament caused hardships.  Cancer doesn&#x27;t make your hair fall out on its own.<p>&gt;Your comment would have been totally fine as a top level comment. It is a believable theory that quarantine is worsening mental illness. Your problem was the context in which your comment existed and the way you were effectively dismissing OPs experience out of hand.<p>I didn&#x27;t dismiss his hardships.  I didn&#x27;t even dispute them.  Stop putting words in my mouth.  I only pointed out that (similar symptoms in other people who have had covid) might be caused by how we&#x27;re treating it (quarantining people and so on) not the disease itself.')
