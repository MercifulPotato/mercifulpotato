You can&#x27;t send someone a hyperlink to a phone. Unless these group links are some special protocol that does some sort of P2P link to the creator&#x27;s phone (which would presumably then have to be on all the time for it to work).<p>More importantly than group links is what happens to Signal when someone realises that they can change people&#x27;s public keys on a whim. Although the app is supposed to display a notification in that case, they can also change the app on a whim.<p>Fundamentally, I just do not see how Signal&#x27;s social goals (which are laudable) are compatible with their chosen implementation. Marlinspike&#x27;s arguments about centralisation vs decentralisation and the moving ecosystem <i>are all valid</i> yet in the end it doesn&#x27;t matter. He identified a problem and basically ignored the where his chain of logic led, i.e. that he would need to figure out how to keep up with a moving ecosystem in a decentralised way. Otherwise, the end game is easy to anticipate: they bend and start swapping public keys silently, either due to police pressure, or pressure from internal activist employees, or pressure from Google&#x2F;Apple.')
