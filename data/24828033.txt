I really sometimes omit periods in one-sentence text messages, but sometimes I don&#x27;t, and it wouldn&#x27;t come to my mind to ascribe any semantics to this.<p>My personal nitpick is people writing a stream of one-sentence messages without punctuation instead of a longer structured message - that definitely carries the connotation of unstructured thinking to me - but it doesn&#x27;t have much to do with full stops per se.')
