As I said in another comment in this thread, I understood the role of computers to be helping humans with tasks they wanted to do by doing things that computers were good at. If that happens to include revolutions or fundamental changes, fine, but it definitely includes a lot of other things too.<p>You are right that the particular examples of audio software capabilities do not in and of themselves bring anything in particular to <i>music</i>.<p>But the timestretching stuff has totally changed how huge numbers of people now <i>make</i> music, because they can work with audio that is in the wrong key and&#x2F;or at the wrong tempo, without really thinking about it.<p>Do I think that this results in an aesthetic leap forward for music itself? I do not. In fact, probably the opposite in many senses. But that is true of so many human technologies, not just software. Some people would even argue that the advent&#x2F;invention of well tempered tuning (and the concomittant move away from just intonation) hurt music in the west, and that was just as much the result of &quot;sufficient engineering hours&quot; as anything in the software world.<p>Also, just to correct you, 20 years ago, I guarantee you that nobody, absolutely nobody, believed that you could ever do polyphonic note editing. When Melodyne first demonstrated it, most people who knew anything about this just had their jaws hit the floor. It was absolutely not an &quot;utterly conceivable consequence&quot;, even though in retrospect of course it now all seems quite obvious.')
