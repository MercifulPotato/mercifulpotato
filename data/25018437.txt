Election Fraud is a well researched problem (by republicans too), and it&#x27;s been shown again and again that it is an incredibly small problem. You are talking about a couple thousand confirmed cases [1] in elections where tens of millions of votes were cast. Claims of election fraud are not new.<p>A bigger problem is voter suppression, through ever growing extraneous requirements (such as Harris County, a population of 5 million, only have 1 ballot drop off, due to a law to prevent more than one drop off per county). Voter supression however does not get anywhere near the same amount of attention.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.heritage.org&#x2F;voterfraud" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.heritage.org&#x2F;voterfraud</a>')
