This is best case scenario.. worst would be a 2 minute ad before the video starts.<p>video on the web isn&#x27;t a &#x27;solved problem&#x27;. What if I want to play a video that uses indexed color? No video codec I know of supports that. Can I trust that the video I just encoded in h264 with ffmpeg will play on the web, or, or do I need to test first to see if it will play? Will it work on all browsers? Is my codec listed on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cconcolato.github.io&#x2F;media-mime-support&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cconcolato.github.io&#x2F;media-mime-support&#x2F;</a> ? and on and on. the simplicity of a gif makes perfect sense here.')
