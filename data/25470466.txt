It&#x27;s a common mistake to think that quantum teleportation is a new way of sending information. It&#x27;s really a way to use classical communication in order to leverage entanglement to bypass various limitations of quantum mechanics.<p>So, the two people communicating would e.g. start out together and create a pair of entangled systems A and B. The person in possession of system B would then travel far away. The person in possession of system A then decides that they want to teleport a new system C to the person far away. They do this by placing system C next to system A and then performing a measurement on the combined system A+C causing these two states to become entangled. We now have an implicit entanglement between system C and system B that is far away. The person in possession of system A+C now picks up the phone and calls the other person to tell them what the outcome of their measurement on A+C was. The person far away then uses this information to determine a way to manipulate their state B in a certain way (the particular way in which they need to do this depends on the outcome of the measurement of A+C). Once that manipulation is complete, the system they have in their possession (B) is now in the quantum state that C was originally in. The system C, unfortunately has been destroyed in the process.')
