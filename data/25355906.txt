Somehow, there continue to be threads full of arguments that amount to &quot;It should be possible for &#x27;good&#x27; network admins to intercept traffic from devices that don&#x27;t trust them, but &#x27;bad&#x27; network admins shouldn&#x27;t be able to intercept traffic from devices that don&#x27;t trust them&quot;. That&#x27;s fundamentally not possible; any mechanism usable by &#x27;good&#x27; network admins can be used by &#x27;bad&#x27; network admins. (Leaving aside that &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;bad&#x27; are relative.) And worse, people get so invested in their local network interception that once it becomes clear that isn&#x27;t possible, some will start arguing that their local network interception is more important than general Internet security.<p>That&#x27;s not the distinction at all.<p>It&#x27;s that you should be able to set up interception on the local network at install time, but all other interception should be blocked.  It&#x27;s <i>extremely</i> possible.')
