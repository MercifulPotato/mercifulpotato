To list a few pairs: destructors and exceptions, templates and inheritance, templates and headers, encapsulation and headers, namespaces and operator overloading.<p>At least at the moment, Rust&#x27;s many features are mostly orthogonal and work well in combination. But in some sense, that makes the learning curve even harder, because you can&#x27;t focus on an &quot;accepted subset&quot; as you would in an existing C++ codebase.')
