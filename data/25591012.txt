You&#x27;re attempting to copy the fascism of the Republicans onto the Democrats. This might have worked better if it weren&#x27;t for the Republicans&#x27; neglect over the past executive term; with hundreds of thousands of Americans dead or rioting because they&#x27;re tired of starving and being shot, it is increasingly obvious that the Republicans are incapable of leading.<p>Neoliberalism is terrible, yeah, but your conflation of neoliberalism with neoconservatism is puerile and unhelpful.
