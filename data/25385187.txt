We can maybe handle thoughtfully evaluating all sides for one or two issues <i>if</i> we are getting honest information from all sides.<p>When you have one or more sides deliberately trying to mislead, they have a huge advantage. First, since they aren&#x27;t burdened by the need to actually be correct, they can generate a wider variety of arguments and do so in greater quantity than those who are arguing in good faith.<p>Second, we have a variety of built in cognitive biases. The people trying to mislead can purposefully craft their arguments to hit those, increasing the chances we&#x27;ll believe them.<p>On top of all that, social media&#x27;s algorithms for determining what to show us are trying to maximize engagement, and the things that most engage us are the things that fit in with our cognitive biases. They have a huge amount of behavioral data on us, which has made them very good at picking out and prioritizing stuff on our individualized feeds that will hit those biases.<p>You can&#x27;t really think for yourself without high quality information, and because they are based on maximizing getting your attention social media tends to mostly show you low quality information. In short, the way social media sites like Facebook are designed makes it nearly impossible to get accurate information from them no matter how much you try to think for yourself.<p>There was a recent article in Scientific American covering research into this, &quot;Information Overload Helps Fake News Spread, and Social Media Knows It&quot; [1].
