I worry that the Roam-like notebooks instead lead you to making a &quot;Personal Wikipedia&quot; of your knowledge, where many notes are just the stub of an article, because it&#x27;s so easy to do.<p>I worry that, if I used this, instead of a 2-3 big pages on Topic X, I&#x27;d have 50 little notes on Topic X, which, yes, I can find through backlinks, but I would not have felt like I had synthesized.<p>Thoughts?')
