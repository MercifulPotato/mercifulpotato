Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603865143, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24914011, text='&gt; Steve Simpson and Harvey Friedman are on record on the Foundations of Mathematics mailing list saying, essentially, that HoTT is a waste of time [0]. The other set theory experts I know agree with them but haven&#x27;t said so publicly. My impression is that this is a fairly common view in the set theory and foundations community.<p>The set theory and foundations community, i.e. the small minority of mathematicians who manage to do effective work on mathematical foundations in ZFC, are precisely the people who we&#x27;d expect to be most anti HoTT. It&#x27;s not necessarily wrong, but it&#x27;s like concluding that OOP is pointless because you&#x27;ve talked to leading C programming experts.')
