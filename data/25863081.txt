If Google Play Services are not installed, Threema checks for new messages using polling. The polling interval is configurable between 5 and 30 minutes and may cause additional battery drain and data usage.&quot;<p>but, apparently doesn&#x27;t transmit any messages via fcm:<p>&quot;Threema uses Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to inform Android users about incoming messages in the background. The app then fetches messages directly from the Threema servers, decrypts them and displays a local notification. Neither contents nor details about messages are transmitted via FCM (the FCM payload is empty), and all of Firebaseâ€™s tracking and analysis components have been removed.&quot;<p>perhaps signal does something similar?<p>on ios, it apparently encrypts notification messages instead:<p>&quot;Threema uses the Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) to inform recipients with iOS about new messages while the app is closed or in the background. The APNS message contains a payload that has been encrypted with a symmetric key, which is negotiated between the app and the Threema servers and is not known to Apple.&quot;')
