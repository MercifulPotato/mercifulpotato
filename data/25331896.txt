This is not a foolproof method, and multiple people can conspire to change the journals at a later date. However, it is a better system than where people don&#x27;t do this.<p>Don&#x27;t think in binary. Think, whether this system provides better validation&#x2F;certification than where auditors&#x2F;inspectors come by at the end of the year to check records. Perhaps, it&#x27;s harder to systematically cheat the system if you have to announce your data to the world daily, then if you wait till the 11th month, and cook your books so everything works out.<p>I doubt this removes the role of auditors&#x2F;inspectors, but it might supplement them.')
