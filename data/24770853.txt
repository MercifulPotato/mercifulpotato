I mean, who are you, the word police? There is no such thing. Trump can say whatever he wants, that&#x27;s freedom of speech babyyyyy! So he can for example say &quot;census schmensus&quot; and that will totally be protected speech. :)<p>edit just to be absolutely sure this is not misunderstood: &#x2F;s')
