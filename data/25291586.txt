Item(by='leetcrew', descendants=None, kids=[25294036, 25292134], score=None, time=1607016486, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25291196, text='&gt; I&#x27;m also willing to bet that people who support complete legalization are users either casual or frequent (not necessarily addicts) so there&#x27;s a personal agenda going on here as well.<p>this is kinda unfair and also close to an ad hominem argument. people don&#x27;t generally advocate for anything unless they have some sort of personal stake. I don&#x27;t currently consume anything that isn&#x27;t legally available, though college was a different story. I support legalization  because several of my friends have already died from tainted drugs, not because my habits would change if more drugs were legal.<p>in practice, I find the &quot;think of the children&quot; argument quite weak here. when I was in high school, alcohol and cigarettes were far harder to obtain than almost anything illicit.<p>edit, just noticed this:<p>&gt; The current opioid epidemic is the result of legalization through medical usage.<p>how can you even compare abusing the trust people have in their physicians to push drugs whose risk profile the manufacturer lied about to legalizing them for recreational use?')
