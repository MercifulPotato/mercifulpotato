It&#x27;s true that it will be a while before wide Rust adoption happens in the game industry (if ever) and C++ will stay around for a while.  As for tech in games moving slowly... there is some truth to that but some things also move much faster than web dev due to new consoles cycles with new hardware capabilities. It will take a LONG time for a SV startup to fully embrace WebGPU even when browser support is decent, on the other hand every AAA game engine has HW raytracing support')
