He had an iron-clad alibi, but the police and FBI weren&#x27;t convinced. In court one of the bank tellers said Talley definitely wasn&#x27;t the robber. Nonetheless Talley lost his job, his wife and his family and was held in prison for months.

She provides the studies and footnotes them. As Fry says:<p>&quot;If you&#x27;re searching for a particular criminal in digital line-up of millions...the best-case scenario is that you won&#x27;t find the right person one in six times...&quot;. That is not nearly good enough for law enforcement and the courts.<p>-from &quot;Hello World&quot; by Hannah Fry')
