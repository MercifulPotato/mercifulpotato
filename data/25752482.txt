Although to be honest, I&#x27;ve found the compliments I&#x27;ve gotten over it more rewarding and motivating than any donations. If the donations significantly increased somehow than I think that might flip, but either way I&#x27;m enjoying working on it.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;makeworld-the-better-one&#x2F;amfora" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;makeworld-the-better-one&#x2F;amfora</a>')
