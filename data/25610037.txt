It looks like the press release is worded correctly but it&#x27;s possible it&#x27;s been edited. But every news org out there seems to have the word &quot;quote&quot;, which shouldn&#x27;t have passed any editor&#x27;s desk without adding [sic] if it was indeed issued mistakenly, or fixed otherwise. But nobody gives a crap anymore about language or editing.')
