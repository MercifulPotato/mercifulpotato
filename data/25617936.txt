There is not whitespace and Python has nothing at all to do with the question. Similarly, an explanation of what a semicolon does in JavaScript does not answer the question.<p>I also can&#x27;t answer the question for them as I haven&#x27;t kept up with newer JavaScript standards, but I thought it important that you realise you misunderstood something here.')
