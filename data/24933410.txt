At least that does ensure it&#x27;s an ASIC, not an FPGA.<p>Besides lack of V extension, I&#x27;m sad about the seemingly artificial limits (8GB RAM onboard instead of slots, so you can&#x27;t easily make a workstation out of this) and the still outrageous price.<p>I think that it has its market niche (developers working on risc-v ports), but most of us are better off trying RISC-V cores on an FPGA or emulator.<p>I&#x27;m hoping China will solve the cheap RISC-V SoC situation by releasing some cheap chip SBCs can be built on, at some point soon.<p>Lowrisc used to be all about doing that in an open hardware manner, but it seems the moment they got some funding, they got distracted into experiments (e.g. pointer validation stuff) that have little to do with achieving the original goal.')
