Item(by='chrisseaton', descendants=None, kids=[25548057], score=None, time=1609021167, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25546846, text='I think people only say &#x27;partner&#x27; when they specifically mean &#x27;romantic not spouse&#x27;. I&#x27;d say it rarely means &#x27;business partner&#x27; these days. People would generally say &#x27;co-founder&#x27; or something instead. Are people even technically partners in business anymore? Makes me think of Marley and Scrooge.<p>It generally means &#x27;boyfriend or girlfriend&#x27; but over the age of something like 25 when boyfriend or girlfriend starts to sound a little awkward to some people&#x27;s ears. People get married a lot later these days, or not at all if they don&#x27;t wish to.<p>Of course people may use it to mean anything they want. But it&#x27;s simple - if someone refers to their guest as &#x27;partner&#x27; do them the courtesy of also using that term.')
