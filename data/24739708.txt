If you went out to write a secure banking website in assembly code you&#x27;d come back in 20 years with something even more bloated than we have now. Why? Because the first thing you&#x27;d write is a higher-level programming language suited to actually building websites. Then you&#x27;d write a web framework on top of that web.
