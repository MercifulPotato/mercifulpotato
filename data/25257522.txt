Genetics is a field of research. The <i>genome</i> is a sequence. And yes, that sequence can be modelled for various purposes but without a specific purpose there’s no point in doing so (and furthermore doing so without specific purpose is trivial — e.g. via markov chains or even simpler stochastic processes — but not informative).<p>&gt; <i>There are plenty of inferences that you would want to do on genetic sequences</i><p>I’m aware (I’m in the field). But, again, I was looking for specific examples where you’d expect ML to provide breakthroughs. Because so far, the reason why ML hasn’t provided many breakthroughs in less about the lack of research and more because it’s not as suitable here as for other hard questions. For instance, polygenic risk scores (arguably the current “hotness” in the general field of genetics) can already be calculated fairly precisely using GWAS, it just requires a ton of clinical data. GWAS arguably already uses ML but, more to the point, throwing more ML at the problem won’t lead to breakthroughs because the problem isn’t compute bound or vague, it’s purely limited by data availability.<p>I could imagine that ML can help improve spatial resolution of single-cell expression data (once again ML is already used here) but, again, I don’t think we’ll see improvements worthy of called breakthroughs, since we’re already fairly good.')
