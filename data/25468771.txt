Couldn&#x27;t we synthesize and distribute the protein itself and inject that?<p>Question 2: what happens to the cells that take in the mRNA and make the protein? Do they just make a certain amount of it, then go back to normal?<p>Or do they keep making it for the lifetime of the cell, and stop doing whatever that cell is normally supposed to do?<p>Or do they get killed doing this, much like if they were infected by the virus (except, of course, that unlike the with the virus, what they are making is not viral, so the maximum number of cells that would be killed making the protein is equal to the number of mRNA strands in the injection)?')
