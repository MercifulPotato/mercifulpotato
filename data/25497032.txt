Item(by='chokeartist', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608571333, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25496310, text='&gt; I think this has turned into a cultural issue unfortunately, and once it&#x27;s culture all reason, sensibility, and middleground is lost.<p>I strongly disagree. While we all have our own personal political views and deltas to varying degrees, many people that I know on both the left and the right (U.S.) are increasingly distrustful of data being &quot;harmless&quot;. They know it is not harmless.<p>Prime example: Hunter Biden&#x27;s laptop fiasco. Even if you love or hate the guy, NO ONE wants to be subjected to that level of public embarrassment and privacy invasion.<p>I believe that personal privacy in the 21st century is an issue that either hurts us all or helps us all - perhaps one of the few issues right now that easily crosses boundaries. Another example I will use: Everyone hates Facebook. And for good reason.')
