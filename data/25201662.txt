In the motorcycle version of Driver&#x27;s Ed, they taught us to simply think of changing gears as the same motions you&#x27;d make to wring out a wet cloth. Thinking that way automatically improves the timing and flow.<p>Once you&#x27;ve practiced enough, you simply stop thinking about any part of the gear changing steps. You don&#x27;t even need the speedometer or tachometer when gearing up or down anymore because you already know how it sounds and feels. It becomes a subconscious process.<p>But that initial visualization of wringing out a washcloth makes it really easy to figure out. Soon enough, you have muscle memory and don&#x27;t have to think about it - you just do it.')
