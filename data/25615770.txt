Don&#x27;t be Slack &#x2F; Teams :)<p>What I mean by this is if you support it, support it correctly rather than &quot;markdown as keyboard shortcuts&quot; that some products do where if you make the simplest of editing changes, your &quot;markdown&quot; isn&#x27;t recognized.<p>2. Devs want to consistently use Markdown across their entire suite<p>At my last job, we were switching to Azure DevOps.  They support Markdown in the developer workflow (PRs) but rich-text-only for Tasks (to be non-dev friendly?).<p>At my current job, I&#x27;m involved in developer productivity and have been interviewing people to collect input for where we want to take development.  We currently use Phabricator which uses Remarkup.  This is a source of frustration because its not quite the markdown they use everywhere else.<p>From these, I&#x27;m thinking Markdown Pages would be the top choice since it allows developer-only interactions and marketing-only interactions to stay within what they are comfortable with,')
