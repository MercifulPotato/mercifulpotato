And usually those are at least as much horror stories as any heavy customizers.<p>Really, as much as it&#x27;s not in the vendor’s interests, big bang implementation of this kind of software that becomes immediately central to a wide array of business processes is probably a bad idea for the same reason that big bang software system replacements usually are, even when there is no existing software system being replaced. Incremental, iterative improvements to business processes and supporting tools are probably a better idea. But big-bang, notionally close-ended projects are more succinct “achievements” on manager&#x2F;executive CVs resumes, and no one is courting buyers and giving out swag for continuous improvement.')
