Not some monster like BIND. At least that worked well for me, though not in combination with AD, which I simply haven&#x27;t tried. But I <i>think</i> that would work also, because why not?<p>@home I used pdnsd, MaraDNS and dnsmasq in the past which did that trick for me, where dnsmasq was the best performing solution, though not the most convenient, that would have been MaraDNS, and pdnsd today seems ancient and bitrotten.<p>Anyways, Linux is like Lego, and you prefer already assembled kits.
