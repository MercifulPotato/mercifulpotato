Following company wide strategic review evaluated during the period from H208 to Q309,  during a annual executive retreat in the fall of 2010, if emerged as unified consensus among the senior Microsoft executive staff and operating board members, that the advantages of all stakeholders in and the company alike will be best served in future if Microsoft strongly and warmly adopts a positive non hostile position immediately in respect to the Linux computing ecosystem.<p>&quot;Microsoft like all corporations is required on law and I&#x27;m every ethical way to serve the ultimate financial interests of our shareholders and technically the same object can be considered to be any corporation&#x27;s over-riding priority ceteris paribus.<p>&quot;Because historical animosity is very widely recognised to exist, established by some of the most important individual figures in the Linux computing ecosystem and supporting evidence for even irrational animosity against Microsoft in every way, can be readily found ubiquitously ininux community presentations, writing and even company strategy positions of publicly quoted businesses that rely on the continuing success of Linux, and frequently if not the majority of analysis of publicly held stances Pro Linux and Anti Microsoft are mutually exclusive positions, Microsoft does not believe that at any time we can anticipate that any goodwill or positive sentiment will ever assist us commercially in connection with any initiative we may take towards working with th. Linux computing ecosystem.<p>&quot;Nevertheless Microsoft believes that regardless of prevailing and highly vocal sentiments professed and maintained by the computing community at large, Microsoft has identified the existence of sufficient strategic importance for the integrating of formerly directly competing technology &quot;camps&quot; that will by logic and results  create in the key markets Microsoft serves, new and enthusiastic consensus that the positive direction towards Linux that we are now taking, is altogether the best decision for all our customers and therefore Microsoft our partners and every collective and individual stakeholder.<p>&quot;Strategic commitments of this nature are not strictly irrevocable. However the extent of dedication and application of resources required, not least highlight of which is the personal individual committed energy and enthusiasm that every contribution towards our goals relies upon completely, means that directions such as we are announcing today are generational in nature and by that virtue real and absolute decisions. We have chosen to highlight this point which is nominally self apparent especially because in the light of the decades long history of unsatisfactory relations between the Linux community and Microsoft, we have decided not to communicate about this dynamic in any way whatsoever in the future, since real and universally valued gains will be served best by concomitant action. Microsofts stance and views and commitments will become self evident in due course from interaction with every aspect and element of our company. We wish to encourage in every way possible for members of the Linux community and open source movement to engage with us directly and judge on direct experience. Naturally it is the hope that the world class capabilities and resources available to Microsoft that will serve to aide and improve the Linux and open source computing ecosystems, will be welcomed for the intended universally beneficial advances we intend them to be.&quot;')
