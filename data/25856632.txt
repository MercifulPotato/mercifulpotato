In logistics there is a relationship between service and cost).<p>I spent a few years in IT as a Product Manager (or a similar role), and I viewed my primary role as protecting my team from the barrage of shit that I got, so that they could focus. This involved making sure I was politically the first point of contact and reducing back-channels (some are fine, but not ones that change functionality, involve significant work or are too distracting), placating the people requesting functionality or fixes by understanding how serious the dependency&#x2F;issue was, triaging it and either placing it on the roadmap or saying no. We also had an engineering manager that could be the contact for specific bugs who could then triage and pass it on.')
