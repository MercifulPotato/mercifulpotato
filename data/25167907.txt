That could be sharing caches, running Raft, or talking to a transactional store. Even if it&#x27;s just to keep my UI in sync between the desktop and mobile site, you have costs.<p>But since so many sites have social aspects now, you need to be able to communicate between accounts, which means interprocess communication.<p>The Amdahl&#x27;s law fraction is at least logarithmic to the number of users, but more likely to be proportional to the &#x27;surface area&#x27; - sqrt(n). Every new server gets you a little bit less oomph than the one before.')
