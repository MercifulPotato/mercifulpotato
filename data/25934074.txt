From a social perspective though, I don&#x27;t consider that a reason to withhold my ire towards people like Shkreli. Choosing to be a bad person because someone else might be worse is still a choice to be a bad person, so while your pragmatic reasoning might work well when it comes time to determine a legal response, I don&#x27;t feel that encouraging people not to hate Shkreli is helpful in encouraging good social norms.')
