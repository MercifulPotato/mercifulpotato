Kubernetes is overkill for 95% of applications, especially single founder SaaS businesses.  Clickhouse may make sense for an analytics product but caring and feeding it is non-trivial (see: ZooKeeper dependency and all the problems you get once you move to a distributed database).<p>Most people would be better off with a single beefy machine running Linux, Postgres and whatever web app framework they know.  The whole &quot;cattle not pets&quot; thing is fine once you obtain product market fit and your product needs to scale up.  At that point you&#x27;ll have time and money to do it - before then you&#x27;re just wasting cycles.')
