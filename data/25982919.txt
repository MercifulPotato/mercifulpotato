I used to turn my nose up at recreational drug use, because I thought of it as a purely pleasure-seeking activity. One day, I took some MDMA out of curiosity, and found that within a few hours I had a strong sense of empathy for everyone else in the room. It amazed me that it was even possible to feel that way -- I actually wanted to interact with people rather than shy away from them. It left a strong impression on me, and made me wonder whether some people naturally walk around feeling that way by default.')
