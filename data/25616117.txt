VS Code has a &quot;WSL Remote&quot; mode that works really well (where a vscode server runs in Linux and the windows GUI access it &quot;remotely&quot;). I even use the Windows Github app for the occasional GUI-assisted commit, and apart from being slow its fine.<p>I&#x27;ve had only two problems with this set up:<p>- Occasionally VS Code Typescript features slow down, but it fixes itself a few days later (maybe after a restart). I presume this is due to the WSL Remote, but not certain.<p>- The occasional line endings snafu, but this is more of a tooling issue.')
