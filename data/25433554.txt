There&#x27;s certainly a threshold to break out of my own thought &#x2F; reality bubble.  However, I&#x27;ve caught myself exploiting the &quot;positives&quot; of this, in that I still only have so much social energy.  Even when events go well, I tend to get worse at managing my social time.  However, finding outlets for being social that I actually enjoy and don&#x27;t find tiresome is a risk worth taking.  Generally, I&#x27;m glad that at this point I&#x27;ve sort of stopped caring about being &quot;like-able&quot;, &quot;cool&quot; or socially &quot;known&quot; in my circles.')
