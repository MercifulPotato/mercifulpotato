If I didn&#x27;t fumble the maths (0.9^4 * 0.9^8), that would mean only a FIFTH of the energy!<p><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><p>I&#x27;m keeping my eye on wooden wind-turbine stuff like Modvion (side note: Modvion are combining wood turbines with a modular, which is really smart as wood is less dense and therefore causes more trucking problems and costs, and making the design modular means they can potentially reduce trucking costs to <i>cheaper</i> than conventional designs instead of more expensive, while simultaneously benefiting from the sunk costs of wood being limited to the size of a tree unless you combine materials together), but they&#x27;re building a preliminary tower that won&#x27;t come online until ~2022, so it&#x27;s not tech that&#x27;s viable <i>today</i>.<p>Also, as your article says: Financially speaking, <i>nobody cares</i> unless there&#x27;s a solid tax on non-recyclable materials or carbon emissions. Wooden turbines are more useful in the real world than they are in the artificial market we live in, which refuses to acknowledge the large cost of our carbon emissions.')
