Nope, it’s just not true.&quot;<p>This is such a great quote. I honestly hate people that spout nonsense like anything is possible if you just believe, and that if you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s that you obviously don&#x27;t believe enough&quot;<p>Well, it is the same with, you can do anything if you want it enough.\nTrue, but in a tautological way.<p>You want to levitate, but can&#x27;t?
