Generally I agree with those people when it comes to LinkedIn style articles etc. e.g. [0] is a prime example.<p>But this one really resonated with me and comes across as extremely genuine hence my surprise at the reaction.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24901940" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24901940</a>')
