Except Google&#x27;s influence does not seem to be growing. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s fair to say it&#x27;s peaked. GOOG and FB are the 2 FAANG stocks I won&#x27;t own. GOOG because people don&#x27;t seem to love their product any more and they don&#x27;t seem to have the leverage FB has. FB because the company is run by a complete douchebag. Both have a lot of regulatory risk. Though if I&#x27;m honest, Amazon and Apple do too.')
