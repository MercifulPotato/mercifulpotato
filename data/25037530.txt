I settled on an HP because it was a good combination of cheap&#x2F;decent reviews.<p>Setting it up was such a pain in the ass, including instructions telling me to install what I later found to be the wrong setup program. Now I have two separate programs (one that I can change printer settings including changing wifi networks, and another to use the scanner). It doesn&#x27;t seem right and I feel like I should only need one, but whatever it works right now and I don&#x27;t plan on changing anything until the printer or I die.<p>That feeling of dread and uncertainty is all too real for me.')
