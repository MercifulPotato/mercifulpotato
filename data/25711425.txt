Item(by='KMag', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610260276, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25711056, text='I absolutely agree as far as arrests and convictions for violence, incitements to violence, and conspiracies to commit violent acts.<p>However, I think deplatforming is a poor long-term solution.  Deplatforming on mainstream platforms inspired and fueled the rise of Parler.  Deplatforming gets rid of all carrots and all future sticks the mainstream platform has against a given extremist.  I think 1-month to 3-month suspensions are more likely to keep followers around, where the mainstream platform has an opportunity to suggest a mixture of center-left and center-right content to them, and provide carrots to rehabilitate extremist publishers.<p>As I&#x27;ve posted elsewhere, taking Parler offline is probably a necessary short-term solution to an acute threat, but I think it&#x27;s rarely the right long-term solution.<p>Edit: I&#x27;m fine being downvoted, but if you have a good counter-argument, please post it or a link to it.  Try to change my mind instead of just venting your anger.')
