And, indeed, historically tech companies were in the suburbs rather than the city itself. Boston basically didn&#x27;t have <i>any</i> major tech employers within the city limits for a period even though there were many in the suburbs. So even people who may not want to actually live in a major city might still want to be within an hour or two of one.<p>I&#x27;d argue it sort of has played out. A handful of companies are willing to pay almost anything for the people they want, especially if they&#x27;re located in SV. Pretty much everyone else has shrugged their shoulders and moved on. And it works because 1.) Hiring is a very inexact process and 2.) Not everyone want to work for one of the big tech companies for various reasons.')
