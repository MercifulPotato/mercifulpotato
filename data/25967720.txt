It isn&#x27;t hyperbole. It just so happens that you are living in your own bubble where you coincidentally are in agreement with powers that be. Or you aren&#x27;t vocal about your opposition to things online. Both of which don&#x27;t test the limits of free speech. People feel Censorship is real when they test the limits. And those are in plenty. Maybe when you test those limits you&#x27;ll understand what Censorship is all about.')
