Corporations and LLCs that already existed before the law’s adoption must disclose their ownership information to the Treasury Department within two years.\n[...]\nThe Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network will collect the data and provide ownership details to law-enforcement agencies and banks upon request.<p>The legislation has limitations.
