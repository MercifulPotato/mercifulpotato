I wanted to ask your opinion on a product we thought is necessary: The way we see it is that no matter where you live, your salary should be based on your skills, not the place you are living. \nWe want to do something about that developers (with a comparable skill set) earn so differently due to their location.<p>Superpayr analyzes your skills and puts a global price tag on them. We want developers to earn the same based on skills not based on location.  What&#x27;s your opinion on this? Do you think you can get behind this?')
