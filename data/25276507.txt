Truck drivers are among the first that will be completely automated away.<p>The other thing to keep in mind, is that we automate <i>tasks</i> not jobs.  The effect of this is that workers become much more productive, it is possible to do the same work with fewer people.  One truck driver oversees a fleet of trucks remotely, ready to take over if needed.  The good news is that these should be higher paying jobs than the original, because they are more productive and higher skilled.')
