I don&#x27;t see why it would be any other way?<p>&gt; Apart from kernels and drivers (where Rust seems an outright no-go),<p>Rust works great in these scenarios. We&#x27;ll see about some higher profile examples, like Linux. Work there is ongoing. Only one way to find out.<p>&gt; C is traditionally used for higher-level language runtimes and compilers&#x2F;interpreters&#x2F;VMs. But Rust&#x27;s borrow checker is a bad fit for just about any text book algorithm and technique in that space.<p>There are a <i>ton</i> of projects in this space. After all, the Rust compiler, for example, is one of the two OG massive Rust codebases. But there&#x27;s also tons and tons of projects here.<p>&gt; Hell, even Rust devs themselves say implementing a DOM is about the worst use case for Rust.<p>Sort of, but also not <i>really</i>. Implementing a DOM would be <i>easier</i> if Rust had inheritance, is usually what is claimed. Yet, Servo was still built, and nobody would suggest that the DOM was a hard blocker here.')
