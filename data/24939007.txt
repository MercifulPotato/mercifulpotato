I can assure you my desire to learn hasn&#x27;t changed a lot.  The ability ability absorb new stuff has diminished, but it&#x27;s made up for by the shear number of patterns I&#x27;ve learnt over the years allowing me to discover the mechanism they are trying to explain far faster than I was able to do it when young.<p>The end result is now I happily sit down with my son and enthusiastically try to get through machine learning papers (something he needs to keep up with).   I still pick it up, well pick up at least the bits either of us understand, faster than him.<p>I agree with another poster here though.  My tolerance for the learning fluff that may not be useful in 5 years time has all but vanished, and yes the prime example of that is JavaScript frameworks.  Nothing wrong with a good JavaScript framework of course but as I heard a speaker introducing his framework say, they have the lifetime of split milk.')
