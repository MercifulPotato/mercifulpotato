They were going to pay like 25% or something silly like that.<p>So we went sliding scale uninsured, and despite being in the top end of the scale, I ended up paying about 1&#x2F;3 less than I would have through insurance. I probably still ended up subsidizing some kid who needed fillings worse than I did, which was the only silver lining in that whole stupid affair.')
