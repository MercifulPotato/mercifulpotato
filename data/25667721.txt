Reagan was just following the playbook. It&#x27;s all right there, out in the open. It goes like clockwork because the real backer for both sides -- mega-corporatism -- wants it. The &quot;culture war&quot; conflicts are considered unimportant, as they have no effect at all on the substance.<p>Trump is the first on his side to step out of line. It will cost them, but maybe not much. The goal now will be to get people distracted again, so the real work of eliminating people&#x27;s influence may proceed.')
