It literally concludes with:<p>&gt; The time has come to challenge the maxim “finish the course.”</i><p>The fact that the article <i>claims</i> that it has made a case for not telling patients to finish the course does not mean that claim is correct. It isn&#x27;t.<p><i>&gt; The article says more research is needed, but suggests patients, perhaps in consultation with their doctors, should discontinue use when they feel better.</i><p>And, as others have already pointed out upthread, this suggestion is not justified by the research discussed in the article. What <i>is</i> justified by that research is <i>prescribing</i> shorter courses of certain antibiotics when a shorter course has been shown to be sufficient for those particular antibiotics for the particular infection being treated. But that is not at all an argument for not telling the patient to finish the course that has been prescribed. In fact it&#x27;s an argument <i>against</i> it, since the whole point of prescribing a specific course for a specific time is that that is the time that has been scientifically shown to be sufficient. Stopping the prescribed course early just because you feel better, even if it&#x27;s in consultation with the doctor, goes against the actual science. What the actual science says is to take the specific circumstances into account <i>when prescribing a course of antibiotics in the first place</i>.')
