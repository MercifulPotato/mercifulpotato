The reason is, if you can&#x27;t digest something and get sick, you can&#x27;t hunt, and so you&#x27;ll probably die. I think sharks are the weird one here - one factor probably being they&#x27;re pretty dumb, and the other being they have a pretty tough digestive tract.<p>They are also cold blooded so it takes longer for a shark to starve.')
