Oh well.<p>Oh, you wanted to run that Snap, but the cache is invalidated or cleaned, and no internet connection? Oh well. Sucks to be you.<p>Oh crap, you need to do that one final fix real quick in that one program, but oops! I just force pushed out a functionality breaking security update! Sorry bout it!<p>It may not seem so important from the casual user perspective, because you may not sample different configurations or distribution channels as devs&#x2F;maintainers&#x2F;admins, but you&#x27;ll hit it one day, and you&#x27;ll be as pissy as we are. Why doesn&#x27;t this shit just work?<p>And the answer is, because it isn&#x27;t magic, and it has to get to you somehow. Again, I hedge on the side of being deliverable with the simplest set of abstractions possible, and I&#x27;m old enough to remember when complex things actually came with manuals; so I prefer that delivery and understanding the ins and outs of the tool. You don&#x27;t get that with FlatPak or Snap without cracking open the container which is far beyond most average computer users, and I place value on people being able to easily learn <i>how</i> to program, utilize, or reason about computers better, something that no container will ever teach you; especially given that in order to understand them you need to already be pretty deeply immersed in the mechanics of computing.<p>On the other hand, a zipped workspace with some tooling, READMEs and documentation can make for hours of discovery and familiarization with system fundamentals.<p>It&#x27;s an approachability thing, and we&#x27;ve totally lost touch with it as a modern industry in my opinion.')
