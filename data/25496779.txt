If you&#x27;re going to lose money, you don&#x27;t exercise the options.<p>I had some in-the-money options.  I operated on what you might call the principle of least regret.  I wanted to get at least something from them, in case it went down.  But I wanted to get more if it went up.  So I sold part of my options when they were in the money.  Then, after it went up some more, I sold some more.  Then, after it went up some more, I sold some more.  I finally sold it all in about five or six waves.<p>Could I have had more money if I had waited to sell?  Sure... or I could have gotten nothing, if the stock had done something other than what it did.')
