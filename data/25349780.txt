You have one service that generates customer facing output, you may have another service that powers analytics&#x2F;dashboards you may have yet another service that ETLs data into some data mart. Why wouldn’t they touch the same table&#x2F;subscribe to the same topic (since they just need read-only access to the data)? Genuinely curious what the problem is except for bottleneck&#x2F;performance; and if it just bottleneck then wouldn’t scaling horizontally solve it?')
