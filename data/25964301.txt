My biggest concern with these plays, at this point, is that they&#x27;re not taking into account the possibility of bankruptcy. There&#x27;s a ton of &quot;they have to buy it, if we hold all the shares then it&#x27;ll go to the moon, 1k, 2k, 4k&quot;.

No, actually; they know what&#x27;s most likely to happen, which is, everyone is going to forget about this in about three days. Gamestop&#x27;s stock isn&#x27;t good. These new shorts are not priced like &quot;I think its going to go below $7&quot;; they&#x27;re priced like &quot;I think its going to go below $200&quot;.')
