This makes the theory behind machine learning easy to understand.<p>&gt; Second, and the most important is the mindset. In Physics, people are maneuvering between rigorous theory and actual data, trying to connect them sensibly. Machine Learning is very similar.<p>&gt; I may be biased about the alignment of Physics and machine learning. Still, I know at least 20 Kaggle Grandmasters that have Physics majors.')
