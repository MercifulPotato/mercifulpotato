(It&#x27;s faster than rush-hour driving, but that&#x27;s about it.)<p>Worse than flying?<p>I can take the train from Wash. DC to New York City Penn Station, visit my friends who live in the city by walking alone, and then come back home in time for dinner. (Broadway, Time Square, and Wall Street are all walking-distance from Penn Station)<p>The closest airport to NYC center is LaGuardia Airport, off of the island. Then you have to spend money on an Uber (or take the train!) into the city anyway. (Cheapest to Uber to the Purple line, then take the purple line into the city).<p>------------<p>The Train&#x27;s competition is a Bus. There are PLENTY of cheap busses that travel the route.<p>--------<p>Even if you&#x27;re off of Manhattan in say... Brooklyn. I&#x27;d rather be at Penn Station than LaGuardia Airport. Penn Station has a direct subway line to Brooklyn. Its non-obvious how I&#x27;d get from LaGuardia to Brooklyn unless my friends spend time to pick me up (or I take an expensive Uber)')
