Slow loading of textures when switching armor through, in the inventory menu.<p>Once had a T-pose flickering for a few milliseconds while driving a bike.<p>My computer is a 4 year old system with a 1080 card, and I have not touched the graphic settings beyond turning off motion blur. I have had a few glitches but so far only one bug that actually annoyed me and force me to repeat content. After a long period of unsaveable and unskippable exposition scene, which I see as a bug in itself, I had a race condition where I tried to take control of a turret just as the turret died and I got stuck in the dead turret interface without any option to exit it. Those are the bugs that I suspect they are working to fix in the first few patches.')
