Tried doing this:<p>- installing the linked &#x27;imaging edge webcam&#x27; software.<p>- restarting<p>- hooking up my sony camera (it&#x27;s compatible per the list) over usb<p>- opening Quicktime Player, going to &quot;new movie recording&quot;, selecting &quot;Sony Camera (Imaging Edge)&quot;<p>- Instead see a logo for the software (instead of the camera output) but no connection.  Tried futzing with opening camera in Movie mode, AUTO, with&#x2F;without SD card, etc.<p>Dear Sony, if you&#x27;re reading this please take your time and do the approach the parent commenter suggested of updating the camera firmware so it can act as a true USB webcam. I expect the experience to be more along the lines of:<p>- Plug in USB<p>- See mode selection screen on camera (you already have this).<p>- Select &#x27;Webcam&#x27;<p>- Things just work.')
