There are a few exceptional subreddits, but &#x2F;r&#x2F;programming, &#x2F;r&#x2F;learnprogramming, &#x2F;r&#x2F;webdev, and &#x2F;r&#x2F;compsci all have a low signal:noise ratio because all of them are majority undergrads or professionals who have under a year in the field. As other people have noted in this thread, dev.to has the same problem.<p>I haven&#x27;t found a great answer for the question of community  these days, outside of checking in on the blogs and newsletters of various developers. I&#x27;ll have to check Code Project out though.')
