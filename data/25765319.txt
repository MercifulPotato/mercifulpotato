But enough computing power doesn&#x27;t exist on the planet to iterate through all the possible states.<p>The word you&#x27;re looking for is &quot;deterministic&quot;, rather than solved.  Solved is usually used to mean the exhaustive computation <i>has</i> been done.  Deterministic would mean it <i>could</i> be if enough computing power existed, but for chess it doesn&#x27;t.')
