We are Netlify for the backend and in fact our next post will be titled &quot;Netlify for your frontend, Micro for the backend&quot;. We think there&#x27;s really a need to do what Netlify did for frontend to the backend and just help people build APIs and services super fast.<p>The M3O Docs have some content about getting started with things quickly <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.m3o.com&#x2F;getting-started" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.m3o.com&#x2F;getting-started</a> but we need to add more. The open source docs are a great reference <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;micro.mu&#x2F;reference" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;micro.mu&#x2F;reference</a> and otherwise we&#x27;re working on some sample services in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;micro&#x2F;services" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;micro&#x2F;services</a>.<p>Well luckily M3O is M[icr]o so I think we&#x27;re going to get away with it for the long term :)')
