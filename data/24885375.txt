I am unsure if you find this an acceptable compromise, or something you thought about when you recently bought Quest 2, but I am very sure I do not find this acceptable in any sort of way. There&#x27;s just no excuse for the need of ID verification just to be eligible to play a game on a device.<p>Regarding your point of unifying it under a single account, sure, but does that account need so much data just to function? And on the other hand, why not just be able to create a partial account? A facebook account is so much more than just some random account, why would I need such an intricate account to play a game? So in short, yes in a technical way it&#x27;s logical, but in every other way it&#x27;s like shooting a mosquito with a bazooka.')
