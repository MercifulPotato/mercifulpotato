I could just hit esc and reset and be back faster, but then I don&#x27;t see an explosion, nor have a chance to see messed up physics breaking the universe.  I&#x27;ve also coordinated orbital collisions to do the same, but there it&#x27;s more because it&#x27;s <i>extremely</i> challenging to achieve at any reasonable velocity.<p>I have no desire to crash real planes or blow up space stations though.  The closest that gets to the real world is &quot;I like fireworks&quot;.')
