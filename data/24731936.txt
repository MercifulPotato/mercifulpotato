It&#x27;s the basis of all knowledge in society.<p>I object already!  Knowledge does not reside in society.  A library cannot know, nor can a computer.  Knowledge that state that a man or woman over something in the objective world and can be objectively confirmed.  You and I can know.  It is not a societal exercise.<p>You raise the flat earth.  And you say:<p>&quot;I used the absurd example of Flat Earth to illustrate the point of non-obviousness of personal verification&quot;<p>Well, having given a bunch of detailed examples to show why it is not possible to prove a spherical earth, why do you call it an &#x27;absurd&#x27; theory?  How was the earth being a sphere proven to you?  You are supporting my point that people believe they know but are in error.  Belief has no part in knowledge.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t object to you saying &#x27;I believe the earth is spherical&#x27;, or &#x27;my hypothesis is that the earth is a sphere&#x27;, or that &#x27;a sphere is the best theory to explain the movement of the planets&#x27;.  All good.  But to say &#x27;you know&#x27;, when you were only taught and shown imagery on a TV - that&#x27;s overstepping things!<p>Did you &#x27;know&#x27; that the film &#x27;Independence Day&#x27; was true too, seeing as you saw that on TV?  Or did you know it was false, because someone told you it was fiction.  Why are you happy to assume film images are false, but news images are true?')
