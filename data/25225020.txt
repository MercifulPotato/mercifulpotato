Item(by='nobody9999', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606442923, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25224297, text='&gt;If you are examining your own writing critically, it is worth critically examining the writing of others that you admire, and those you might disagree with.<p>I couldn&#x27;t agree more.  In fact, I find that my own prose has benefited greatly from reading those who write well.<p>&gt;This kind of criticism is supposed to be constructive, so it should not be taken as an attack.<p>Your point is well taken, however your characterization (&quot;Everything is wrong&quot;) is even more extreme than what Pullum said in the piece you linked.  He said &quot;almost everything is wrong.&quot;<p>What&#x27;s more, <i>all</i> the links you posted are quite critical of <i>The Elements of Style</i> and are not representative of the many other voices out there (cf. [0][1][2][3][4]).  I&#x27;d expect that one might attempt to balance the criticism, rather than just piling on.<p>That&#x27;s not to say I reject outright the criticisms of Pullum and Pereltsvaig.  Rather, they both make interesting points.<p>However, from the standpoint of a <i>lay person</i> who wishes to write cogently and concisely (that is, most of us) rather than a grammarian or professional writer, <i>Elements</i> provides useful advice and numerous examples of good writing.<p>Are the recommendations contained therein universally apropos?  Certainly not.<p>That said, for most people who wish to get a better sense, not only of <i>how</i> to write more clearly and concisely, but also what such writing looks like, <i>Elements</i> provides a wealth of suggestions and examples.<p>Whether or not you disagree with some of the recommendations in <i>Elements</i>, it stresses clarity, concision and direct expression of ideas.<p>That many will go beyond those recommendations doesn&#x27;t invalidate the value of elucidating good writing habits, and utilizing them to provide cogent examples of the same.<p>Writing styles are inherently subjective, and a text  like <i>Elements</i> is and can be a worthy supplement to reading widely and honing one&#x27;s own style.<p><i>The Elements of Style</i> isn&#x27;t a tome with a litany of prescribed and proscribed methods and techniques.  Rather it&#x27;s a slim (only 52 pages) volume focused on expressing ideas clearly and concisely -- a goal it achieves for itself.<p>I recommend that you read it[5].  It shouldn&#x27;t take more than 30-45 minutes.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.poynter.org&#x2F;reporting-editing&#x2F;2018&#x2F;why-strunk-white-still-matters-or-matter-or-both&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.poynter.org&#x2F;reporting-editing&#x2F;2018&#x2F;why-strunk-wh...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ragan.com&#x2F;helpful-writing-habits-from-strunk-and-white&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ragan.com&#x2F;helpful-writing-habits-from-strunk-and...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proofreadingpal.com&#x2F;proofreading-pulse&#x2F;writing-guides&#x2F;strunk-white-still-good-advice&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;proofreadingpal.com&#x2F;proofreading-pulse&#x2F;writing-guide...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.writingclasses.com&#x2F;toolbox&#x2F;tips-masters&#x2F;strunk-white-11-composition-principles" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.writingclasses.com&#x2F;toolbox&#x2F;tips-masters&#x2F;strunk-w...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;english.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;2909&#x2F;what-s-purportedly-wrong-with-strunk-white-s-the-elements-of-style" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;english.stackexchange.com&#x2F;questions&#x2F;2909&#x2F;what-s-purp...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gutenberg.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;37134&#x2F;37134-h&#x2F;37134-h.htm" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gutenberg.org&#x2F;files&#x2F;37134&#x2F;37134-h&#x2F;37134-h.htm</a>')
