Item(by='oarabbus_', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608321329, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25467353, text='&gt;1) Some players expected this to be cyberpunk-themed RDR2&#x2F;GTA5. It turns out it&#x27;s nothing like that, it&#x27;s more like a new Deus Ex game.<p>Funny, I didn&#x27;t want to buy it before, but now that you say this, I might actually buy this thing. I never found RDR&#x2F;GTA style games very fun other than 15 minutes of mayhem at your friend&#x27;s house. Whereas the Deus Ex games are a masterpiece.')
