The freedom in this case means never being colonized by other countries. The irony is we have never been freed from them,and all the propagandas are made so that we must feel indebted. There&#x27;s a song playing every Dec 5 whole day on almost every street saying our value is less than a speck of dust under their feet. Your kids are taught to sing these kind a songs every day as well in some schools.<p>Secondly you are not taught to question, and rather criticized for questioning. Not sure if any of you have been in a class with a Thai student, but I bet they all are quiet. In a family, you must never question your parents or you will be punished. These royal families (plural because there are many) have a pronoun like your royal father mother etc, so know your place.<p>3rd, they are very coupled to religious institutions and it&#x27;s like a heresy to even talk about them. Any bad happened to those anti monarchy people are believed to have conducted bad karmas. It&#x27;s stupid, but there are many stations that would revere them as the reincarnation of the Buddha.<p>Last for now but there are more, they have high influence on the military and Thai conglomerates. The king even has his own unit, brainwashed to just serve him. Thai conglomerates will marry their children with the royal families just to gain more power and respect.<p>There are more but gotta get back to work now.')
