That’s probably ok for social level spread tracking (with wide error bars) or low volume contact tracing (where quarantining a few extra people is worth it). It’s far better than nothing of course, but it’s also far short of what we expect from something like a pregnancy test.<p>But as a means to sign people off as safe to travel? Yeah, not so much. So many people have had the “one negative test so I can go party” only to discover what a false negative is.')
