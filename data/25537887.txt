You don&#x27;t need them until someone tries to rob or kidnap you or a member of your family. You don&#x27;t need them until you are, like in Venezuela or the Czech Republic historically, in opposition to a dictatorial government. There is a real reason that every single authoritarian government in history has disarmed its populace.<p>Vigilance against authoritarianism is the same thing, because authoritarianism rarely happens over night. It takes years, sometimes decades. And if you&#x27;ve built up a network of cameras powered by facial recognition on every street corner, you&#x27;ve now built the apparatus for an authoritarian-leaning government to harness.')
