The neonazis have been infiltrating the military there, too, to the point where they had to disband an <i>entire</i> special forces unit, because it was too far gone to be cleaned up.<p>Honestly, the liberal fixation on gun control seems a really short sighted to me, given that kind of infiltration and the general right-leaning nature of law enforcement and the military [1].  It seems far more likely to me that liberals (and minorities) would someday need to rise up against an oppressive government than conservatives would be, even though conservatives like to fantasize about that kind of thing more.<p>[1] Proven very clearly by the events in Kenosha: police shot an unarmed black man in the back, but didn&#x27;t even stop an armed white kid who just shot three people.')
