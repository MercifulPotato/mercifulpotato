Contrary to common belief, we can improve both at once – by incentivizing failed results, and by funding “Red Teams” that would aim to refute existing dogma or would be entirely outside it.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know - the mechanism that creates the problem with reproducibility is that all teams are &quot;Red Teams&quot;. What is published is what is unexpected, what deviates from a common understanding, but nothing confirming what we would expect. Most of what seems new and exciting comes out to be just random accidents - that is natural, but it is a problem only when we put too much weight to them.')
