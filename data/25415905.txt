Check it out and shoot me some questions and feedback. Thanks!<p>PS:\neven though it&#x27;s in private beta, if you sign up for iOS you&#x27;ll get the TestFlight link automatically - we&#x27;ve configured that. As for Android, I&#x27;ll have to send the invite manually as Play Store doesn&#x27;t allow such automation.')
