Walmart and Amazon have considerably greater than 35% turnover. Yes, 35% turnover is fatal if you&#x27;re trying to do specialized, high-skill work. However, most businesses are not doing specialized, high-skill work. They&#x27;re doing the routine work of delivering the goods and services that people need every day to live their lives. 35% turnover in that situation is arguably an advantage because it prevents bonds from forming between employees. It&#x27;s a lot harder to organize and form a union to demand rights when you don&#x27;t even know if that person you&#x27;re talking to is going to still be there a month from now.')
