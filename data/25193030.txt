If you are a patriot, then working for a company like Lockheed Martin may be seen in your own eyes as good. Same with FB, it is connecting the world (Trademark Zuck).<p>Coal Power is bad, for the environment but it is good for society as we need electricity.<p>So there are two perspectives to this, how you judge yourself and how others judge you. The internal is based on your own views, and the external is based on 7+ billion views and there will always be conflict in both.<p>So to answer your question<p>&gt; Who decides what &#x27;bad&#x27; is?<p>Everyone and no one. It is a paradox, and the original `No` answer to this question would be simplistic and out of touch with reality. The better question is, if I know the company I am working for is against my moral, ethics then does that make me bad?')
