I became more confident of that when, at one point recently, I realized - hey, I&#x27;m drinking some 10+ cups of black tea every day, and I did that since being single-digit years old. Turns out I may have been unconsciously self-medicating for as long as I remember.<p>BTW. I suffered from the same type of spiral you described in the past. I&#x27;ve managed to mostly overcome it for now, though I took it from the other end - I&#x27;ve manged to minimize &quot;feeling bad about myself for not completing work that I was generally more than capable of doing&quot;, to the point of preventing the positive feedback loop. I wish I could do something about the focus part, though.')
