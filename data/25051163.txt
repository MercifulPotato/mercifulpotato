Having everything you use in hot caches means any applications starts in a couple hundred of milliseconds, and everything is as fast as your RAM and CPU are, especially if you&#x27;re running an OS that has a good implementation of file caching (e.g. Linux).<p>Having more leeway means I never have to close anything if I forget to. I might have my dev environment chugging along in a desktop workspace, while I&#x27;m in another with a few dozen browser tabs, talking on Discord with a full screen game running on the other monitor.<p>That&#x27;s what a Â£150 module of 32 GB of RAM gives me. But actually I&#x27;m running 64 GB :-)')
