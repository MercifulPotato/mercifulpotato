However, I think your argument is based on the premise that people only decide to kill others as a result of a carefully reasoned decision. This is not the case. There are plenty of legitimate ways one can take action after being wronged by the government, from appealing to a higher court to going to the media; killing people is not one of these.<p>People who kill others in situations like these rarely come to their decision based on fact and rationality. As much as we need more accountability, putting government officials - or anyone else - in a potentially life-threatening situation at a time where armed terrorists regularly make death threats based on baseless conspiracies is not a good way to do that.')
