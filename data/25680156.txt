We also spend public money on forest management, wildlife bridges to create reasonably sized habitats, etc.<p>It&#x27;s also a while out. We have bigger issues today than &quot;who&#x27;s gonna suck back out some CO2 once we cut emissions sufficiently&quot;. We&#x27;ll get to that in due time.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, if you have unavoidable emissions today that you want to compensate, and want to also fund the people working on CO2 capturing technology, see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;climeworks.shop" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;climeworks.shop</a> for a pay-what-you-want option. I don&#x27;t really believe in planting trees (which is way cheaper per ton of CO2 it claims to absolve you of), and these machines apparently emit &quot;only&quot; 10kg for every 100kg of CO2 captured (90% effective sounds reasonable), and it&#x27;s accounted for who claimed which share of the machine&#x27;s captured volume so it sounds directly effective to me. It&#x27;s just that the scale is peanuts and will remain so until public bodies and companies start to run out of emission reduction options and decide to use it - but at that point we better have this tech geared up.')
