We really need to stop treating the Earth like its just a magnetic rock. It&#x27;s far more than that and the earth undergoes these field changes every interval with profound impact on life on earth.<p>You and I are all made out of Earth and the things we eat and breathe are all Earth itself. When you die your body decomposes and it becomes soil and nutrients for plants which in turn feed the ecology which where our food comes from. So its hard pressed to just dismiss this as &quot;spiritual pseudoscience&quot;. It is precisely this type of shallow thinking in Western ideology that is responsible for the global climate crisis. Your culture has thoroguhly destroyed earth and the next generation will pay the price because of your ignorance.<p>There&#x27;s just no way that we can brush off this phenomena with pedantry.<p>edit: HN has a serious pedantry problem. Anything that challenges conventional wisdom is villified and attacked by nitpicking minor details that many only have surface level understanding.
