According to [1], whether a crime has maximum sentence of over 1 year is precisely how the US government determines what crimes are and are not felonies:<p><i>In the United States, where the felony&#x2F;misdemeanor distinction is still widely applied, the federal government defines a felony as a crime punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year. If punishable by exactly one year or less, it is classified as a misdemeanor. The classification is based upon a crime&#x27;s potential sentence, so a crime remains classified as a felony even if a defendant receives a sentence of less than a year of incarceration.</i><p>Also, no, I wasn’t referring to post-release supervision (which is usually referred to as parole or supervised release).  Many hundreds of thousands of people every year receive a <i>sentence</i> of probation for felonies, primarily because countless “tough on crime” measures have increased maximum sentences for minor crimes, which automatically turned them into felonies where they used to be misdemeanors.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Felony" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Felony</a>')
