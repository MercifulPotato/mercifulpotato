There&#x27;s a limit on the number of &quot;active&quot; groups you can be in at a time, typically 16. Groups were used for permissions for directories on network storage and our version control system at the time. As far as I&#x27;m aware, I was the only person at the company affected because I touched so many different repositories, I was a member of around 20 groups. I had to bounce between them using newgrp (albeit without passwords as in TFA).<p>I forget the exact reason for the limit of 16, but I think it was an NFS limit.')
