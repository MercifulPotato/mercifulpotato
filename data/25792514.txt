I didn&#x27;t mean to downplay the interests of people here wanting to have civil discussions about politics. I&#x27;ve too seen very civilized discussions here involving politics recently. I&#x27;ve also noticed an uptik in political posts. Most of the ones that have 1000+ comments have the most number of downvoted comments I&#x27;ve seen here on HN. Most of those comments don&#x27;t seem to have a genuine curiosity about political science.')
