I don&#x27;t actually disagree that most of the BLM protestors were peaceful, as BLM did not explicitly encourage property crime and violence. Antifa however did, and the worst crimes were mostly committed by antifa members and not BLM.<p>There is alot of odd cognitive dissonance in your comment which I appreciate proves your own point, you were presented with evidence that goes against your own world view, but instead of &quot;stopping and thinking&quot; you just decided to outright dismiss it instead of acknowledging it.<p>You stated you didn&#x27;t see any evidence of violent assaults on police officers in portland, yet I gave you an example of a protestor assaulting a police officer with a hammer and instead of addressing it, you resorted to projecting a false narrative of ad-hominem and assumptions of my world view which are actually incorrect.<p>The funny thing about human biases is they actually effect us all, including you, and thank you so much for proving this. Its made my argument here easy.<p>Hopefully you take some time to &quot;stop and reflect&quot; how cognitive dissonance can corrupt your own world view when your presented with evidence that goes against it.')
