Item(by='cheph', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601719477, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24670786, text='&gt;  Well LXD, Docker and k8s have a lot of overlap in functionality and features, so itâ€™s just disingenuous to say otherwise.<p>Tractors and cars have a lot of overlap also. They are still different things and people who want one normally do not consider the other as an alternative.<p>&gt; For over 90% of startups Docker with k8s is just not necessary and tie them to managed version of specific vendor or cloud provider with higher costs and a lot of overheads.<p>This has not been my experience but at least there are managed k8s offerings from multiple vendors with some intersection of functionality. Sure different vendors have different extensions but there is only one LXD vendor and the support for LXD is kind of flaky in my experience whereas I have ran 3 different k8s distros on my fedora laptop without really breaking a sweat.<p>&gt; In majority of the projects LXD provides much better infrastructure.<p>If you are happy with what LXD provides, and if you can actually use it, then great use it. I have yet to be in a situation where I could use it or where I really wanted what it offers. I tried installing it via snap, I tried installing it from copr, I tried manually installing it, then I concluded that I don&#x27;t actually want anything from it that I cannot get elsewhere.')
