I guess I look at value&#x2F;cost. I drive a $2,000 car and use a $1,000 phone because I get a lot of value for the extra $500 in the phone, but wouldn&#x27;t get more value out of having a nicer car. Like you, I also find it nice to worry less about the car because the replacement cost is low.<p>But I view the value of smart watches in the $100,000+s if not $1M+s. How much is your health worth? How much is it worth to passively keep an eye on your heart rate, and stress levels, and oxygen levels, and sleep levels? Granted, I still think it is very early for smart watches, and the value we are getting now is ~1% of the value we will be getting from them in 5-10 years (if they aren&#x27;t replaced by a &quot;smart tooth&quot; or &quot;smart necklace&quot; etc). But I think at this point the value is definitely there and easily worth 10x+ the cost.<p>Making a single actionable decision based on data received from a wearable could have a life changing impact.<p>And again, speaking in probabilities here, and it depends if you look at the data and adjust your life based on it, but I think expected value of these is huge, and probably the best single health measure anyone can take.<p>I would say try the cheap one, and think about upgrading if you like it.')
