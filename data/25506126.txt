Again, the question of whether anonymity emboldens trolls is not the force of that article, it isn&#x27;t about their behavior, it is about yours.<p>&gt; &quot;But merely &#x27;branding anonymity as bad&#x27; isn&#x27;t going to stop the cyberbullying misogynists.&quot; You are correct, which is why the spokesperson for this crisis is Amanda Hess. No one is trying to stop cyberbullies, there&#x27;s no point, they don&#x27;t shop and no one wants to look at them. Hess has entirely misunderstood what the medium wants. The whole game is to get women-- not the cyberbullies, not criminals, but the consumers-- to voluntarily give up all of their privacy, while paying lip service to privacy at home-- knowing full well women that women will pay money not to have the kind of privacy they have at home. Voluntarily exposing yourself makes you a targetable consumer and targetable consumable. Is it worth it?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200420063821&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thelastpsychiatrist.com&#x2F;2014&#x2F;05&#x2F;cyberbll.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web.archive.org&#x2F;web&#x2F;20200420063821&#x2F;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thelastps...</a>')
