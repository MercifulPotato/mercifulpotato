I was very unenthusiastic when I heard that the first semester was taught using Snap, but I was wrong.  Snap is a pretty awesome way to introduce someone to programming (much more powerful and reliable than other block-based programming environments I&#x27;ve tinkered with like the Kano kit).<p>The one really terrible thing about the current iteration of Snap (that I think would be trivial to solve?) is that you have to remember to save your work. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a normal thing for people to think about on the web in this day and age, and I have seen many students (and my own children) lose large amounts of work due to this.  It&#x27;s extremely discouraging.<p>Other than that though, the snap language&#x2F;environment is quite nice.')
