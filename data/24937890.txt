I haven&#x27;t interviewed for a job since 2005. The three f&#x2F;t jobs I had before that I had to interview for, but I was the only candidate they considered (because of professional connection). The other interviews were required to comply with HR policies (apologies to the candidates who didn&#x27;t really have a chance).<p>I don&#x27;t think my experience is unique or even unusual. I have hired friends and former colleagues with only <i>pro forma</i> interviews because I already knew what they could do. I&#x27;ve been hired the same way. At almost every place I worked other people there got their jobs through a connection.<p>Maybe the difference is I know quite a few people who have hiring authority, possibly as a function of my age.<p>I stopped working f&#x2F;t jobs in 2011, have freelanced full-time since then. I don&#x27;t interview or submit proposals for freelance jobs either. Usually I&#x27;m the only consultant the company is talking to, the others waste time on discovery and proposals and &quot;process&quot; whereas I&#x27;m ready to get to work right now.')
