So low-difficulty chess programs tend to be very unsatisfying to play against.<p>Something I have always been interested in trying is writing a chess engine that makes human-like moves. So the evaluation function would try to emulate what a human would do, maybe with a few depths of evaluation, instead of playing accurate moves that never miss simple combinations.')
