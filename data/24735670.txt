Especially when we are talking about medical treatments that can affect the decisions someone will make with respect to their health and possibly even risk their lives.<p>Certainly a scientist can say &quot;I very much hope that HCQ is an effective cure for Coronavirus&quot; but that is very, very different from being &quot;Pro-HCQ&quot;.<p>When I hear &quot;Pro-HCQ&quot; that implies to me a very strong suggestion of treatment, i.e. - &quot;You should take HCQ as a treatment for Coronavirus infection&quot;, which is extremely different from, &quot;I hope that the research shows that HCQ will be an effective treatment for Coronavirus, and I am doing a study with the goal of showing that this is the case&quot;.<p>Does that make sense?')
