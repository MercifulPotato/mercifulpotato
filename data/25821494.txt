This is also why there is no truly immutable implementation of `List` in the stdlib, although the interface itself it read-only (but it can still point to a value that is being mutated somewhere else).<p>I agree that true immutability - or code that is more obvious about avoiding side-effects - could be useful, but I don&#x27;t think that was ever the goal.')
