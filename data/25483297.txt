Seems like it happened in 2015, which is why it seems that windows updates have been more unstable in the last couple of years.[2]<p>I really want to like windows, but Apple&#x27;s M1 and Linux&#x27;s community make it hard to ever love windows again.<p>Oh well, I guess I will be using Macbooks for the rest of my life. Which, actually, isn&#x27;t so bad I guess.<p>FWIW - I would say this is unacceptable on microsoft&#x27;s part. Windows is the default operating system of corporate america, department of defense, etc. Imagine if an update would brick Wells Fargo or the US Army.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=S9kn8_oztsA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=S9kn8_oztsA</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;former-microsoft-employee-talks-about-getting-fired-2014-7" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.businessinsider.com&#x2F;former-microsoft-employee-ta...</a>')
