The email exchanges were a bit convoluted because they involved a lot of backreferences to previous events or other screenshots. I wanted to tell the story in an interesting way while presenting the raw evidence instead of just summarizing everything and asking the reader to assume I&#x27;m being fair, but I can see how all the screenshots and blockquotes might have made it feel cluttered.')
