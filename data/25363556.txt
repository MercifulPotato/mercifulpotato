Item(by='epakai', descendants=None, kids=[25364151], score=None, time=1607543125, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25363071, text='&gt; For a solid 4 years one party accused the other of rigging an election and it was considered news and reported on nearly non-stop. Now the tables are turned and the formerly accused party is claiming the other one rigged the election.<p>Except that&#x27;s not what the Russian collusion accusations were about. I still find it hard to believe when I see polls that actively suggest people believe votes or voting machines were directly manipulated in 2016. This is not the narrative I experienced while following the election and subsequent Mueller investigation.<p>The information I consumed made it clear that there were questionable staffing, unusual meetings, and a foreign disinformation campaign associated mostly with benefiting Trump&#x27;s campaign. In any case the current admin knew the stakes, and knew the issues but failed to safeguard against it. Still they claim there is widespread fraud, but fail to provide convincing evidence. Now they have pivoted to suggesting changes made during a pandemic could invalidate votes.<p>The specific crimes are laid out in the Mueller report [0]. A bipartisan Senate committee confirmed the intelligence findings that lead to the Mueller report even while Senators were publicly denying it [1]. Again I don&#x27;t understand the claim of &quot;rigging&quot;. This wasn&#x27;t pushed in the circles I frequent or I considered it hyperbole at the time. There was a clear disinformation campaign, hacking attempts, and questionable contacts with the Trump campaign.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;storage&#x2F;report.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.justice.gov&#x2F;storage&#x2F;report.pdf</a> (the 6-page executive summary is an adequate reading if you want the gist of it)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;policy&#x2F;cybersecurity&#x2F;493889-bipartisan-senate-report-reaffirms-intelligence-community-findings-that" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thehill.com&#x2F;policy&#x2F;cybersecurity&#x2F;493889-bipartisan-s...</a>')
