Most of that business is shipping to stores&#x2F;restaurants though. Wineries and microbreweries are starting to do home shipments, but if and how much still varies by where you live.<p>There might be some local couriers willing to buy and deliver booze to you, but they&#x27;re probably doing it at their own risk.')
