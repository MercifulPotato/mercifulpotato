When it&#x27;s small scale and the varieties aren&#x27;t selected for industrial efficiency, many fruits and vegetables taste like they&#x27;re from another world. Coming from another country, the biggest appeal is eating strawberries and blueberries that taste like the blueberries and strawberries I remember as a child and tomatoes and cucumbers that have actual flavor that can carry a salad without globs of &quot;dressing.&quot; I think I&#x27;ve had a proper blueberry <i>once</i> in 20 years and only because it was some celebrity chef known for obsessing over his ingredients.<p>Thankfully, I have family members living out this dream so I don&#x27;t have to do all the hard work myself :)')
