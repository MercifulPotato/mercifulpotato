Very interested in linear operators and the relationship between differential&#x2F;finite difference operator, falling&#x2F;rising factorials, stirling numbers, bernoulli numbers, etc.<p>I&#x27;m hoping math will get me a more interesting job than java programmer but I enjoy the math for its own sake anyways.')
