Item(by='faitswulff', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610896124, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25810945, text='&gt; Nothing about federated services that make it intrinsically less usable.<p>I didn&#x27;t say that. I <i>would</i> say that <i>Signal</i> is more usable than Element, though. While I was commenting, I installed Element and the UX is just not as smooth as Signal - even the quick start instructions aren&#x27;t as simple: &quot;go to matrix site, click through to Element, read instructions to return to site to configure, install app, register username&#x2F;pwd, forget about configuration step because it&#x27;s apparently not necessary after all (?)&quot; vs &quot;go to signal.org, install app, verify phone number.&quot; It&#x27;s not terrible for technically capable folk, but the friction is why it&#x27;s not as popular as Signal.<p>And while <i>argumentum ad populum</i> is a <i>logical fallacy,</i> practically speaking it is a boon to be popular in most things.<p>Judging by your last paragraph, it comes down to a matter of values - is decentralization important to you? Then hands down, Signal will lose. But for a large number of people who don&#x27;t care about decentralization, they will do what&#x27;s popular and easy. OWS, I presume, wants to make sure the easiest, most popular solution is also secure.')
