I don&#x27;t agree, then give a simple example that shows you can measure productivity and you immediately switch to measuring productivity. I don&#x27;t think you introduced any realism at all, you were just wrong at the start.<p>By the way, I&#x27;ve never seen someone be rewarded 2x the pay for being 2x as productive without a commission model.<p>And if they are on commission, nobody cares how much time is spent in the office.<p>&gt;Point is you expected to do an honest day of work for your pay with a good effort. That&#x27;s the social contract which may well be changed in the future, but so far it isn&#x27;t.<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true. I&#x27;ve worked construction jobs and you&#x27;re expected to do what you&#x27;re expected to get done in a day of work, not work hard necessarily. Sometimes you work hard, sometimes you don&#x27;t. A lot of time is spent uselessly. I found the same thing in corporate environments.<p>An honest day&#x27;s work for an honest day&#x27;s pay would actually be pretty unusual, especially given that for it to be honest the workers would have to understand the labor market implicitly, what they could get at competing companies and what their labor was actually worth to the company employing them. Most of the time none of that happens.')
