Much appreciated!<p>Does each new Lambda cold start pull the entire image from the repo? Or if I derive from Lambda base images am I likely to get some of the layers already cached?<p>I&#x27;m trying to think about how the data transfer costs are going to each time the Lambda is instantiated.  I didn&#x27;t take this into account with Fargate and got burned when trying to trigger images on demand in a similar way.<p>This could replace my whole SQS &#x2F; CloudWatch Events &#x2F; Fargate setup using Lambda if I can figure out cold start costs ($ not time).')
