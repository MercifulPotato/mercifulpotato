No one has done it on a large scale against a powerful adversary on their home turf in 60+ years (I don&#x27;t include the US into Kuwait or Basra etc).<p>To do so against an advanced, well trained military (possibly with the US in the background&#x2F;helping) would result in huge losses for China. The window to cross the straight is probably only three months or so of the year. No doubt they could try smash it from a distance, cut off supplies etc and force concessions but a full on invasion would be dam tricky. Cyber attacks and Spetsnaz style sabotage may also help, especially as Taiwan has had a lot of spy scandals. However the Taiwanese people I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of working with are clever, cunning and courageous - those guys might lose but they are gonna give you a bloody nose trying to get in. Plus then the insurgency that follows would make Iraq look like a school yard bun fight. They have had decades to think purely about how to defend their own soil and a huge amount of people with both military training and advanced technical skills - who knows what tricks they might have up their sleeve or in the basement (Yun Feng missile for example can reach most major Chinese cities and has a fairly small warhead yet they didn&#x27;t order many of them...Hmmm I wonder why?...Possibly it&#x27;s older nuke program which was very advanced or the very large &quot;defensive&quot; chemical and biological program etc.)<p>Ultimately this is about the Communist Party looking for a balance. It doesn&#x27;t want to lose face by losing Taiwan too much but at the same time but it would get a dam bloody nose trying to cross the straight...and then trying to occupy such a country. The end result likely to be a weakening of the party. Never forget Communists have shown themselves to be more concerned about the survival of the party than the people. Them taking a massive coin-toss strategic risk is unlikely, unless they feel pressured into doing it.<p>There are lots of people saying China would definitely win, so here is an interesting counter example to that.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foreignpolicy.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;25&#x2F;taiwan-can-win-a-war-with-china&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foreignpolicy.com&#x2F;2018&#x2F;09&#x2F;25&#x2F;taiwan-can-win-a-war-wi...</a>')
