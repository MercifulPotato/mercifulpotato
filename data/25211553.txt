The list of leaked certificates changes daily, so any good implementation is going to check again at least several times a week. If you download the entire database, you&#x27;re just consuming hundreds of megabytes of bandwidth&#x2F;storage but aren&#x27;t removing the need to refresh&#x2F;expire the cache.<p>I&#x27;d argue the two biggest flaws Apple&#x27;s system has is bad fault tolerance and also no user accessible opt out (even if just for emergencies).')
