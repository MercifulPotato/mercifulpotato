I&#x27;m not sure what that has to do with Gary Numan. CDs came out in 1982. Gary Numan&#x27;s first hit #1 on the UK charts was in 1979. He released a 2017 album that charted at #2. He has released music consistently for over 40 years, and there are multi-volume tribute albums of people covering his songs. And he had a side career as an aerobatic flying instructor to fall back on if everything went south. That&#x27;s not a struggling artist.<p>The point I&#x27;m reading in this is, if someone like that is getting next to nothing back from his music being used to make people money, what chance does an actual struggling artist have?<p>Although I also appreciate Mick Jagger&#x27;s point about the music business where he says that prior to 1970 you didn&#x27;t make any money from record sales because the record companies just simply refused to pay you.')
