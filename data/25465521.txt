When I make changes to a file,â€¦<p>This is somewhat contradictory. Of course, everybody works on states. But as you write yourself, you make <i>changes</i> to a file, you don&#x27;t create a full new version from scratch every time you add a semicolon.<p>So, if you &quot;make changes&quot;, you actually <i>do</i> &quot;work on diffs&quot;.<p>&gt; Further, diffs only make sense if you have the full version of the files, pre-diff. Without that full file state, diffs could operate in all sorts of incorrect ways.<p>That actually is an argument <i>against</i> Git: because Git doesn&#x27;t model diffs, yet tries to simulate them, Git merges and rebases do all sort of incorrect things. For example, even the following simple example is not correctly handled in Git:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pijul.org&#x2F;manual&#x2F;why_pijul.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pijul.org&#x2F;manual&#x2F;why_pijul.html</a> (see the figure &quot;git merge vs pijul merge&quot;).')
