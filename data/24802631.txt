Item(by='ardy42', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602867237, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24802298, text='&gt;&gt; I really wish, that when COs like Amazon decided to productize a thing they either offered the core developer(s) enough $ to work on it full time (if they wanted) or a job to do that with a guarantee that as long as it was a product, and they wanted to work on it, they&#x27;d be allowed to continue.<p>&gt; It seems like you&#x27;re arguing that people should get both the good will of having an open source license and the profits of a closed source license. Which comes across as disingenuous.<p>It isn&#x27;t.  Linus Torvalds and all kinds of other people are paid to work on the Linux kernel, sort of like how the op suggests, and if that hadn&#x27;t happened Linux would probably be a shadow of what it is now.<p>The alternative is to have some guy slave away for another&#x27;s profit, and eventually burn out (which happens to tons of open source developers).')
