I was given about 5 minutes notice and told my employment was ending effective immediately. When I asked why, I was told they could not discuss it for legal reasons. When I asked if I was being fired, I was told &quot;no&quot;. When I asked if I was being laid off I was told &quot;no&quot;. When I asked for a letter of recommendation I was told &quot;no&quot;.<p>The Position was Director of User Experience at a mid-size software and services company (~70 employees). My team–JS devs, copywriters, and designers–and I had been high performers for years with stellar reviews, raises, etc. At the time we had been twiddling our thumbs for 9 months because backend development, which we worked with very closely, was so far behind.<p>The writing was on the wall, obviously. I know why they did it. It was business. My position was a 6-figure line item in a budget sheet and wasn&#x27;t producing tangible value. My team&#x27;s output (user experience design and front end development) wasn&#x27;t being utilized due to back end development delays.<p>The execution really rubbed me the wrong way, though. I had been at the company for six years and had been told by the CTO (literally 72 hours before the HR meeting) that I would &quot;always have a place here&quot;. I had received a number of similar reassurances by the CEO&#x2F;Founder for months leading up to termination. These were all in response to my asking about the development delays on the other team affecting mine. The manner in witch I was terminated was very disrespectful and hurt my feelings.<p>I&#x27;m mostly over it now, but I have lingering trust issues of upper management. Which is probably fine, honestly. I have been successfully relieved of my naïveté. It only took 12 years in the industry.')
