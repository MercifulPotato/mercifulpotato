Item(by='CuriousNinja', descendants=None, kids=[25970536], score=None, time=1612004242, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25959165, text='&gt;It just means that if there were, say 100 shares of a company, and 120 shares sold short, it would be &quot;120%&quot; short. But all this means is that there are 220 shares &quot;owned&quot; by others. And thus, to cover, the &quot;shorts&quot; need only buy back 120 of those 220 shares<p>Can someone please explain how the original 100 shares turned into 220? Does this mean that after borrowing a share and shorting it, the original owner and the one who shorted can both sell it?')
