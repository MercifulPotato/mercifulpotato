The program I studied did cover an engineering design process. We were taught to quantify design requirements (subject to a static load of this much, must be within these dimensions, and so on) and use a combination of calculations, simulations, and prototypes to check we are meeting those design specifications.<p>I am assuming that you would have done something similar in aerospace. If so, have you carried over any of that into software development? Do you have any guidance or D design documents you can point to? The D specification is the final product, but Iâ€™m trying to gain a better understanding of how one gets to that final specification.<p>Thanks for your time!')
