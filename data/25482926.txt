She says she considers deals starting $10k. I never watched one of her videos, can&#x27;t tell how often she does brand deals.<p>vblog (daily? blogging): 4m views, 35k USD<p>main channel: 27m views, 40 videos in 2020, 170k USD<p>medium.com articles: 25k USD, one article was viewed 1m times and and accounted for 19k USD of the earnings. Another article 4k USD, most only 80-300 USD.<p>Some talk about RPM (revenue per 1000) going down to 5 USD in spring (COVID related), now 10 USD.<p>Her thinking why Youtube paid out more in 2020 than 2019: (1) two ads instead of one.
