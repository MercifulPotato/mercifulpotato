If a small handful of you within the company develop expertise, you can guide others. And what&#x27;s more; if you do pick up F#, many skills are transferable to other FP jobs (like Scala). There&#x27;s a leap-of-faith element involved, but it has been paying us dividends.<p>Also, I really like this post: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fsharpforfunandprofit.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;low-risk-ways-to-use-fsharp-at-work&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fsharpforfunandprofit.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;low-risk-ways-to-use...</a>')
