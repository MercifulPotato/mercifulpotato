I would be surprised if even 10% of web devs do real performance testing on other hardware (i.e. with actual measurements).<p>Example: <i>Why is the Google Cloud UI so slow?</i> <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25357409" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25357409</a><p>It&#x27;s not limited to Google either.  Try ordering food on a web app on your phone, etc.<p>For example I just loaded doordash.com in Chrome&#x27;s mobile view, and it made 110 requests and consists of 7.7 MB of resources.  It took 1.12 secs to load on a core i7 desktop connected to a wired network.  How long do you think it will take on a phone with a slower CPU over a wireless network?  For a web page that shows pictures of food.<p>FWIW I worked at Google for over a decade, and this was a problem that got worse over the entire decade.  People talked about making the network slow to fix this systemic problem, but it never happened (at least while I was there).  You also have to test on different networks, although admittedly the M1 doesn&#x27;t make your network faster so that problem won&#x27;t be exacerbated.<p>I still stand by the original statement; the M1 will make the web slower, assuming it&#x27;s adopted by a bigger fraction of  web devs than consumers (which seems very likely).')
