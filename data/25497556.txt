It&#x27;s not a monthly. By exaggerating the pace they&#x27;re.. uhm... bridging the gap or something.<p>Controversy is even more engaging than novelty. Maybe a pop science article gets you sucked into the pre-clovis camp of a paleoanthropology controversy. Now you are engaged in paleoanthropology. Three years later, a possibly butchered snake skeleton is found and you go &quot;aha! I was right! They ate snake soup! Clovis people didn&#x27;t even <i>like</i> snake!&quot; It&#x27;s a little cheap, but it&#x27;s also fun. Why not.<p>People enjoy having opinions. No one loves sports without having a favourite team, strong opinions regarding training schedules and sports rehabilitation practices... an occasional gamble. Most know that they&#x27;re not really experts, but they enjoy being in the fray nonetheless.<p>Pop science magazines aren&#x27;t supposed to be textbooks or encyclopedias. We are fortunate to have wikipedia for that. Give me a little sauce, a little clickbait. I might not always admit to it... but sugar tastes good.')
