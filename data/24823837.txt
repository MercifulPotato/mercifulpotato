Many spammers are not exactly the most clever folks and often neither check the effectiveness of their links, nor if they are removed within a few hours anyway. Instead they simply send automated tools to your site, which they often do not even create themselves.<p>In addition to that, there are a couple of reasons more, why spammers sometimes even actively chase nofollow links. For one, many people believe a certain amount of nofollow links is part of a &quot;healthy&quot; link profile: having 99% follow links might be considered a &quot;bad signal&quot; by Google, because nofollow is just so common, you are expected to have many nofollow links.<p>I will not judge this theory, but the theory does exist and is followed by some people.<p>Plus, the fact that it seems Google simply started considering nofollow as a kind of hint, not a decision, did not help the spam situation either.<p>Regarding whether the nofollow helps with at least avoiding the penalty, even if you are still spammed, nobody knows whether this might work. Google is usually uptight about what it does or does not do.')
