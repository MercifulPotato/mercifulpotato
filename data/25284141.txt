If opposing counsel has <i>evidence</i>[0] that the personal devices have relevant communications not already provided, they can file for a subpoena to have you turn over personal electronic devices. Your counsel can file a counter-motion, and you&#x27;ll probably have a hearing.<p>No where will there be a warrant, unless you&#x27;re in criminal proceedings.<p>Like I said already: as far as I know, litigation holds and discovery are fairly common, and what you&#x27;re describing is not. To clarify, this is all assuming you use a work profile and a personal profile.<p>[0]: I don&#x27;t necessarily mean evidence in the legal standard, but they need some basis for this. &quot;A feeling&quot; isn&#x27;t enough.')
