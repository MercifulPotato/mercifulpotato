I already bend my arm at the elbow when using the trackpad. However, I find the finger position painful if I&#x27;m using the trackpad intensively for a while (think lots of scrolling during random web browsing).<p>A few months ago I have discovered the joys of using a trackball and I think a great setup would be to fit the that between the halves of a split keyboard. I suppose a Kinesis Freestyle or similar could accommodate that.<p>That being said, even though I absolutely love the mbp trackpad and find the keyboard ok-ish (I have an older, 2013 model), I don&#x27;t like using it with an external screen. It feels somehow off.')
