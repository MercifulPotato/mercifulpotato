It&#x27;s fair to say the President was outmatched by the job. If he wanted to be a dictator, he was incompetent.  But the damage to the immediate office of the president is worth considering. No honest person wants to work close to this man, and that&#x27;s new.<p>2. The media, in new and unusual ways, has abandoned the goal of neutrality in reporting.<p>3. The university and corporate culture is overwhelmed with demands for every discipline to consider the &quot;Whiteness problem.&quot; What does this description remind you of in American life right now?<p>&quot;Then, suddenly, I was plunged into all the new activity, as the university was drawn into the new situation; meetings, conferences, interviews, ceremonies, and, above all, papers to be filled out, reports, bibliographies, lists, questionnaires. And on top of that were the demands in the community, the things in which one had to, was ‘expected to’ participate that had not been there or had not been important before.

We distrust our formerly-shared institutions. We distrust science if it contradicts political norms.<p>It&#x27;s been a bad year.')
