As other comments have said it doesn&#x27;t really stack up with teams&#x2F;slack, but the video system is pretty good. It works well enough, an has seen consistent improvements over the year. Doubt any company would specifically choose google chat, but I know that many that already have deals for g-suite are using it. The thing is pretty much every company has a contract for office or google chat these days. Hard to imagine paying for slack when you&#x27;ve already got these free apps available.')
