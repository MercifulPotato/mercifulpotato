It&#x27;s possible they&#x27;ve got two people working each shift, but that doesn&#x27;t match my experience and when I asked for a tower tour a few years ago, I specifically had to wait for a day where they had multiple controllers in the tower. (They are a contract tower [NFCT] equipped with D-BRITE but primarily controlling traffic visually, if that makes a difference.)<p>14 CFR ยง 65.47 provides for a maximum of 10 consecutive hours.')
