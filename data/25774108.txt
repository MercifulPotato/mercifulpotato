Item(by='mockingbirdy', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610616423, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25769570, text='I agree, it&#x27;s basically risk-free here with paid education and the social safety net.<p>I’m also from Germany. There <i>is</i> significant wealth inequality, but making €40-60k pre-tax a year is very attainable for most developers here. In Switzerland, it’s even higher (€60-70k+) and they have to pay fewer taxes (with a higher cost of living).<p>But the „average life“ in Germany for a developer is very good. About 4-5 weeks of vacation every year, no expectations of working more than 9-5 (at the average employer), and after 1 year working at a job you’re eligible for unemployment insurance which means you get 60% of your net salary for 1 year if you’re unemployed.<p>With regards to attaining riches:<p>You can live comfortably with €2000&#x2F;month net as a single (and easily with €3-4k with two incomes and two small kids in a smaller city), so for most people, it’s possible to save 500+€&#x2F;month (most don’t because of lifestyle inflation, but that’s a different matter). With side hustles (small freelance work) you can easily save €500-1000&#x2F;month which means that after 5-7 years you are able to save €80,000. Continuously investing in stocks, pension plans and ETFs (what most Germans also don’t do) means that you can accumulate half a million euros by the age of 45-50.<p>And this is the average developer, no 10x rockstar. Having a net worth of €700k to one million euros when you’re 67 years old with a very good work-life-balance is nothing to be ashamed of. With more ambition, you can freelance for €75&#x2F;h which translates to a six-figure income. With that, it’s possible to build a net worth of 2-3 million over 20-30 years.<p>For people who want to be a millionaire in 10-15 years, this is not very attractive. But when you consider the work-life-balance and the labor rights, it&#x27;s easy to see how people would choose that. For high-achievers, I would also recommend working in the US or Switzerland. But for average developers, it&#x27;s not that bad of a deal.')
