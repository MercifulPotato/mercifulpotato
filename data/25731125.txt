I find that tons of Haskell code involves do notation which is basically code that embraces monadic side effects which sort of defeats the purpose that this article says of pushing side effects to the edge.<p>Really in order to “push side effect to the edge” people need to avoid using monadic composition as much as possible which I see Haskell programmers rarely doing in practice.')
