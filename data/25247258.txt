That is, narcissism is not &quot;thinking you are superior&quot; as casually described on the internet, but &quot;obsessively thinking about how others see you, and your every action is about making yourself appear the way you want to be seen&quot;, particularly to the extent of not caring about other people and their lives and feelings beyond making sure they reflect the desired image back.<p>Now in light of that definition, consider Mother Theresa&#x27;s scandals&#x2F;criticism[3], such as Christopher Hitchens saying[3] &quot;<i>[Mother Teresa] was not a friend of the poor. She was a friend of poverty. She said that suffering was a gift from God. She spent her life opposing the only known cure for poverty, which is the empowerment of women and the emancipation of them from a livestock version of compulsory reproduction.&quot; [...] Hitchens said that &quot;her intention was not to help people&quot;, and that she lied to donors about how their contributions were used. &quot;It was by talking to her that I discovered, and she assured me, that she wasn&#x27;t working to alleviate poverty&quot;, he said, &quot;She was working to expand the number of Catholics. She said, &#x27;I&#x27;m not a social worker. I don&#x27;t do it for this reason. I do it for Christ. I do it for the church.&#x27;&quot;</i>&quot;<p>And you can see a definition of narciccism where she was more interested in her image as a Christian, than in the suffering of other humans. See this claim: &quot;<i>According to a paper by Canadian academics Serge Larivée, Geneviève Chénard and Carole Sénéchal, Teresa&#x27;s clinics received millions of dollars in donations but lacked medical care, systematic diagnosis, necessary nutrition and sufficient analgesics for those in pain;[118] in the opinion of the three academics, &quot;Mother Teresa believed the sick must suffer like Christ on the cross&quot;.[119] It was said that the additional money might have transformed the health of the city&#x27;s poor by creating advanced palliative care facilities.[120][121]</i>&quot;<p>That is, she was more interested in the image of Catholicism, holiness, piousness, suffering adequately to uphold the image of Christ(liness), rather than putting that aside and treating people with the best available medicine, at the expense of peity, etc.<p>(You might not agree with these claims, but you can at least see &quot;a definition of narcissism that could label Mother Theresa as narcissistic&quot;).<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thelastpsychiatrist.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;08&#x2F;just_because_you_see_it_doesnt.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thelastpsychiatrist.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;08&#x2F;just_because_you_see...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thelastpsychiatrist.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;10&#x2F;the_story_of_narcissus.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;thelastpsychiatrist.com&#x2F;2012&#x2F;10&#x2F;the_story_of_narciss...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mother_Teresa#Criticism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Mother_Teresa#Criticism</a>')
