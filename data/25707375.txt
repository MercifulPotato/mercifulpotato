If Trump wishes to sue Twitter or the US Government, he is more than free to do so.<p>However, I think both his case and yours is undermined by the very, very strong circumstantial evidence that after his lawyer, Giuliani, called for &quot;trial by combat&quot; and he said that he would personally lead the crowd in a march on the Capitol on Jan 6th the violent insurrection actually took place is a very strong argument that he incited the uprising.<p>Furthermore, the fact that even as these Trump supporters were occupying the Capitol he said that he &quot;loves them&quot;, that also undermines any argument that he did not incite sedition.')
