While HGP and many other sequencing projects have been invaluable to academic research, and it&#x27;s truly useful for a number of diseases, the main result of the HGP, in my mind, is that it made clear to everybody how much harder the genotype-&gt;phenotype problem was than what the geneticists who set up the HGP anticipated.<p>Medically speaking, there isn&#x27;t enough evidence to support the cost of doing WGS for individuals in most circumstances, or even storing large amounts of WGSs to do large-scale population-level analysis.')
