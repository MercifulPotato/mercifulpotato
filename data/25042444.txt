It&#x27;s typically more important to be able to solve a quadratic equation through guessing, factoring or completing the square. Because these things teach you something about how mathematics works, regurgitating some formula serves no purpose, you can just ask Wolfram|Alpha instead. And even if you can&#x27;t complete the square etc., I&#x27;d much rather people understood the conceptual side of it instead of remembering formulas.')
