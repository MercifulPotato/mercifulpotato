But find them extremely polluting for the environment in loud sound(trains are terrible at this), toxic chemicals (volatile asphalt compounds, wheel dust, fumes and specially petrol oils in the case of trains), lights and so on.<p>It is also very bad for the environment because it divides the territory in two and animals and humans could not cross easily like they did in the past for millions of years. You can not cross or it is extremely inconvenient crossing whole cities because of trains.<p>On the other hand, trains make transportation way cheaper and territories to prosper.<p>I also find electrical posts ugly and dangerous stuff.')
