The common advice here is usually something around the lines of Fastmail or ProtonMail with a custom domain. Well, I&#x27;m an unemployed student in a third world country where the minimum wage is 150 USD&#x2F;month. Considering a .com domain registered with Namecheap plus a Fastmail or ProtonMail plan with custom domain support, that would cost around 6-8 USD&#x2F;month. For comparison, the only subscription I currently pay for (besides bank fees and etc) is Spotify, which costs me 1.5 USD&#x2F;month with the student plan (I actually split this with a friend).\nWith that said, what would be the best cost-benefit setup for a safe, personal email service? Thanks.<p>[1]: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=24965432')
