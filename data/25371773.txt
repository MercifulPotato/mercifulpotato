By a mile.<p>You can&#x27;t bury your hand in the sand and pretend that everything is fine. It&#x27;s not.<p>Almost every browser out there is dying, everything is being taken over by Chrome&#x2F;Chromium&#x2F;Blink. The alternative is Webkit&#x2F;Safari, which comes with its own limitations.<p>Firefox&#x27;s market share is 5% and dwindling. Web developers have stopped caring about Firefox. Many sites are slow or barely working in Firefox. Firefox bugs aren&#x27;t being fixed.<p>Soon I&#x27;ll be forced to use Chrome because the alternatives won&#x27;t allow me to do my job.<p>Open Source browser alternatives can&#x27;t keep up. And even though Chromium itself is Open Source, it&#x27;s not a complete browser for the modern web (see DRM).<p>So we&#x27;re all going to be using Chrome or browsers built by corporations with the same incentives as Google (Microsoft also has an ad network, Opera is now owned by a semi-shady Chinese VPN company). And these browsers are gutting ad blocking.<p>Plus ads are getting smarter and we&#x27;re not that far off from a point where ad blocking in its current form is no longer efficient. See for example stuff like the DNS over HTTPS changes.<p>And if it would only be about this, you&#x27;d be missing the point by &quot;only&quot; half a mile.<p>The other half a mile is that many people are forced to use a certain browser. At work, at school, etc. Or they don&#x27;t know how to change their browser or what a browser even is. We&#x27;re all in this together, the internet is one big network.<p>And for regular people, modern browsers are just as bad as Flash. Maybe even worse, at least Flash had a modicum of design as a platform. The web platform is a huge mishmash.')
