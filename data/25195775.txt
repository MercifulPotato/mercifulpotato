I can&#x27;t say too much but the AWS team confirmed it. But I appreciate how something like you describe could happen.<p>I like the idea of an MD5 hash. Although I&#x27;m not too certain why an IP would be a bad thing to log for 24 hours. From a privacy law perspective, the MD5 hash is considered PII. And if we see an IP address in an access log, we know that an IP visited one of the tens of thousands of websites Fathom runs on, but we don&#x27;t know which one.<p>Edit: Something else, with MD5 there&#x27;s no way of finding patterns with the IPs, so you&#x27;d have to play whack a mole. Whereas raw IPs allow no real privacy invasion whilst allowing pattern detection')
