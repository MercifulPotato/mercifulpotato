But I can hold both ideas in my head (&quot;RH, don&#x27;t do that&quot;, &quot;You, don&#x27;t pick RH&quot;)<p>But apparently Interactive Brokers is now doing the same. Much stronger argument to be made there. They&#x27;re a pay service, with supposedly big-boy ideas about their clients, right?<p>EDIT: Also, note that Robinhood&#x27;s decision isn&#x27;t just affecting their own clients. They&#x27;re screwing the wider market by restricting the pool of buyers. People who have no relationship with RH are now seeing their holdings lose value because fewer bids are making it to the books. I&#x27;m a TDA client. I didn&#x27;t agree to Robinhood&#x27;s TOS.')
