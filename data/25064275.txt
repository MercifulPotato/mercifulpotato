While African-Americans were the most common target, Asian-Americans[0] and Jews were sometimes the subject of these warnings&#x2F;threats. The cities that put up these signs and highway billboards became known as Sunset Towns (although in the last 2 decades the term &quot;Sundown town&quot;[1] became more popular[2]).<p><i>The Negro Motorist Green Book</i> was a travel guide that was written to help black people plan roadtrips. It acknowledged that &quot;the White traveler has had no difficulty in getting accommodations, but with the Negro it has been different&quot;. The Green Book warned about Sunset towns and had pointers for finding friendly lodgings. Sunset towns weren&#x27;t limited to the Deep South: New England and California also took part in the practice, and Route 66 was notoriously difficult for black travelers.<p>Afroman immortalized a Californian sundown town and its racial housing covenant in his song &quot;Colt 45&quot;[3]:<p><i>Well, it was just sundown in a small white town<p>They call it East Side Palmdale<p>When the Afroman walked through the white land<p>Houses went up for sale<p>Well, I was standing on the corner sellin&#x27; rap CDs<p>When I met a little girl named Jan, I let her ride in my Caddy<p>&#x27;Cause I didn&#x27;t know her daddy was the leader of the Ku Klux Klan</i><p>[0]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;1.bp.blogspot.com&#x2F;_BLlJwLdIRpk&#x2F;RZ1Bfy6G8CI&#x2F;AAAAAAAAABE&#x2F;tb6Vm6QYSk0&#x2F;s400&#x2F;RoseHill.jpg" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;1.bp.blogspot.com&#x2F;_BLlJwLdIRpk&#x2F;RZ1Bfy6G8CI&#x2F;AAAAAAAAAB...</a><p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sundown_town" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sundown_town</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;ngrams&#x2F;graph?content=sunset+town%2Csundown+town&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2019&amp;corpus=26&amp;smoothing=2&amp;case_insensitive=true" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;books.google.com&#x2F;ngrams&#x2F;graph?content=sunset+town%2C...</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SH2ukQdF-0U&amp;t=1m21s" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=SH2ukQdF-0U&amp;t=1m21s</a>')
