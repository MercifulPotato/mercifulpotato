After a short discussion, I suggested to use a (.*) regex to solve it, without seeing the code, that was the best I could do. Another call 30 min later, I suggested the same but on a different level. At the third call I told them that if they need to keep doing that, something is deeply flawed and they should rewrite it. No more calls came :)<p>I kinda see where this sentiment is coming from and it&#x27;s really hard to convince people otherwise. People see movies like Rain Man and they see scientists with huge blackboards and they can&#x27;t understand a thing so it must be a work of a genius.')
