As a land war the German navy for instance was largely uninvolved so you need to consider how many tanks was a battleship worth. How critical was a lost factory or oil field etc.  And in that context while Germany gained some men from their invasion of the USSR* a major goal was the acquisition of oil in the caucuses, because having been cut off from other sources they would have likely lost with or without the invasion.<p>In the end it was the loss of aircraft factories more than aircraft that really cost them the air war.  While we think of WWII as a modern war, Germany used 2.75 million horses in WWII.  Fuel, raw materials, and industrial capacity for engines where tight.<p>*~230,000 of the deaths on the eastern front where originally from the USSR but fighting for the Germans.')
