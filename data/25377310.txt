Item(by='yowlingcat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607627932, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25376043, text='&gt; The reality is that some people can just do more per day than others.<p>Is that really the reality? As far as I can tell, the reality is quite the opposite -- that sustainable levels of work across all knowledge work industries drop off a cliff past 8 hours a day, and for deep work 4 hours a day. Working on a side project after work possible for short sprints at a time, but somewhat impossible if you have an engaging day job where you are making good forward progress on your career.<p>On the other hand, if your day job is well paid but rather dull (quite common in tech), working on a side project is a nice way to retain creative and intellectual fulfillment, agency, and ownership in some capacity in one&#x27;s life -- it can be an artistic outlet and worthwhile in itself. Beyond that, it can be nice transition to a startup. But I think this idea that some people &quot;can just do more per day&quot; makes the fallacy of thinking progress happens a day at a time. When it comes to side projects or new companies in incubation, that&#x27;s not always the case. Explaining it away with an argument that is biologically untenable seems questionable to me.')
