Item(by='Animats', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605977705, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25169936, text='<i>Preferred method to learn morse code would be to learn one bit at a time very well.</i><p>There&#x27;s an approach to learning Morse code where you hear single letters sent at about 40WPM, with a long pause between letters. The idea is to learn each letter as a sound bite of its own, not dots and dashes. As recognition improves, the pauses between letters get shorter, until you&#x27;re listening to real 40WPM code.<p>I thought from the original article that this was going to be a scheme for taking notes in Morse code, maybe with a key strapped to your thigh.')
