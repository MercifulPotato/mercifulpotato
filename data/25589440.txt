It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if the next version of Windows (desktop or server) also includes IE, fully supported for its 10 year lifecycle.<p>There were a lot of clickbait articles in the past year about various Microsoft services dropping support for IE, but it will still be part of Windows, and still get security updates.')
