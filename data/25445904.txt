That&#x27;s the main point (in my case).  I&#x27;m really tired of having variables with ugly names like &quot;alpha&quot; and &quot;beta&quot;, when I could have simply α and β, just like they appear in print.<p>&gt; Why use a miniature vocabulary of symbols when you can use English?<p>Because that&#x27;s the vocabulary which is <i>already</i> used in math, and I do not wont to change mathematics to adapt to the limitations of programming languages.<p>See, I don&#x27;t coincide at all with your point of view, but allowing greek leters in variable names would not keep you from using your preferred naming conventions.<p>EDIT: it&#x27;s not really &quot;difficult to type&quot; either.  For example, in linux if you add<p><pre><code>    setxkbmap -option caps:ctrl_modifier\n    </code></pre>\nto you keyboard configuration, then you can type greek leters by preceeding regular keys by CAPS LOCK.')
