I&#x27;m a German who, like most Germans, does not like Trump.<p>The article is about Twitter exploring new ways to shape interactions with the content from Trump, a retreating politician, on their platform.<p>This development is far more relevant to me than the largely US american pro&#x2F;contra Trump debate, as my own societies discourse is dependent on those very same platforms.<p>I therefore believe that it is completely wrong to justify Twitter&#x27;s continuing trials on discoursive influence over the notion that it&#x27;s alright since Trump might be a particularly bad actor.<p>I think that&#x27;s off topic and misses the point.<p>I just thought I&#x27;ll explain since the thread appears to be very heated right now. People might attribute up &amp; downvotes to a far smaller set of reasons than they should on a platform as global as HN.')
