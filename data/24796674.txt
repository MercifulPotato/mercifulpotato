Item(by='anonymousab', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602814004, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24795355, text='&gt; All of the recent (4+ years) cameras have a &quot;share to mobile&quot; feature, where the camera acts as an AP, and your phone connects to pull photos from it. You can either pick the photos to transfer on the camera or on the phone, and it works pretty well for posting to social media, or instantly sharing.<p>In the case of Nikon, the proprietary app for doing this was quite terrible, across all of their cameras that I tried it with. They released a firmware that opened up things up in the past year, though; better late than never.\nThere have been brute-forced reverse-engineered alternative solutions but they have always been a pain to set up, use and maintain.<p>I suspect the other manufacturers&#x27; apps wouldn&#x27;t be much better.')
