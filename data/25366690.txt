How can we tell?<p>It&#x27;s far more than mere &quot;bitching&quot;. Way more than that. The Royal Society&#x27;s motto is &#x27;Nullius in verba&#x27;, which means &quot;take nobody&#x27;s word for it&quot;. Think about it.<p>Of all places to hear that blend of anti-science, I wasn&#x27;t expecting to read it here.')
