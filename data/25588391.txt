You&#x27;re meant to hold it steady on your outstretched palm, then pull your hand away swiftly. Younger kids can find this too hard, which causes them to resort to tossing it up in the air. The resulting collisions (which are much harder than the collisions during flight) could easily cause the type of damage described.')
