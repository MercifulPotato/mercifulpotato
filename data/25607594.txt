Amphetamines are a class of drugs and there are both legal and illegal ones...it doesn&#x27;t immediately equate in my mind to crystal meth.  But it does immediately equate to &quot;keeps you awake&quot;, which seems appropriate.<p>It also seems a bit unfair after 6 years and 500k downloads.  Had Apple made an issue of it originally, the author might have built all the goodwill and ratings with some other, more acceptable name.<p>The internet is a pretty big place to have to launch a product.  Picking a name that suggests a purpose seems like a big win to me and coming up with a string of words that won&#x27;t offend <i>someone</i> is a pretty big challenge these days.')
