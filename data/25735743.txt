You can play without registering, all features are available to everyone for free, and the site is open source. It&#x27;s a good clean website without ads or tracking.<p>(I used to be bitter about chess.com, thinking they&#x27;re just cashing in on their domain name and charging for features because they can. And that may be, I don&#x27;t know. But I have seen them organize some good chess events, so they might not be all bad. I think they pay streamers to use their site though, a practice I&#x27;m not too happy about.)')
