Right now, Google has all the incentive of directing traffic away from quality websites and onto pages that fit their plans. AMP gets promoted to reward publishers who publish content in a strict Google -flavoured format. Pages with Google ads can be promoted if Google detects good ad engagement in them. Websites are totally diluted with ridiculous amount of useless blabla become SEO is the way. Just try to find <i>any</i> recipe these days. Virtually all pages make you scroll through 50 paragraphs of foreplay before the actual content appears.<p>I dislike Apple. I&#x27;ll never buy Apple.
