Econ 101 is often naive and wrong, but it should be the default prior you work from unless you have a compelling case to the contrary. That is, you shouldn&#x27;t be looking for resources that make the case for an unregulated rent market, the burden of proof should be on the people who want to regulate rent, and I have never seen a compelling refutation of the naive econ 101 view for rent control (in the case of SF and other tech hubs that I presume HN is most interested in).')
