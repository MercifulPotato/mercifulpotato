Item(by='gdx', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602957755, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24807471, text='&gt; why can&#x27;t the results be explained by &quot;Some babies dislike certain toys and prefer new toys over those they dislike.&quot;<p>It actually is explained this way in the paper: &quot;If infants do exhibit choice-induced preference change, they should prefer the novel toy and avoid the previously unchosen toy.&quot;<p>The thing is, they are not only testing for this &quot;obvious&quot; conclusion. Each subsequent experiment tries to invalidate the previous one&#x27;s conclusions. They thought of 4 experiments, and maybe even more could be done.<p>&gt; It&#x27;s swap methodology is also unconvincing. Why couldn&#x27;t the baby simply be avoiding a toy that was effectively taken away?<p>This is a good reasoning â€” if the infants are aware of the swap, their thinking could be &quot;I chose that and didn&#x27;t get it, now I don&#x27;t like it &#x2F; don&#x27;t want it anymore&quot;. Even then, it still points to the same direction: the infants are changing their preferences based on their first choice, now rejecting something they wanted but didn&#x27;t get.')
