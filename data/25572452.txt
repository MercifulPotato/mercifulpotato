If we are talking say 100+ DOT-111 tank car‘s that’s 3,450,000+ gallons which isn’t going to simply fly into the air instantly.  The phase change from liquid to has takes significant energy at the scale which takes time.<p>Again it’s a question of scale, you don’t think of say molasses as fast moving liquid but increase the scale to 2.3 million gallons and you can be talking about a 25 foot tall 35 mph wave.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Molasses_Flood" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Great_Molasses_Flood</a>')
