If you notice such a case, the thing that will actually help your fellow user is to let us know about it at hn@ycombinator.com so we can take a look. You can also vouch for a [dead] comment that shouldn&#x27;t be deadâ€”the fact that banned accounts sometimes post good comments is the reason we created vouching in the first place.<p>(In the case of <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25398463" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25398463</a>, we could probably unban the account if they were willing to change the trollish username. I&#x27;ll email to check if they want to do that.)<p>What&#x27;s not so helpful is to post complainy comments about &quot;mods deleting comments&quot; and &quot;echo chambers&quot;: they&#x27;re not accurate, the fill the thread with offtopicness, and in the case where a user shouldn&#x27;t be banned, they don&#x27;t do anything to help that user.')
