A lot of my notes &quot;expire&quot; a few days after taking them, but others I will need years later.<p>For most of my job I take physical notes. I don&#x27;t love it but it&#x27;s easy for me to grab a pen and paper just about anywhere I am. Where I struggle is doing something with those notes after the fact.<p>When I am at my computer, I usually just keep a plain text file going for the day and just save it for the date. I also have Teams recordings, screenshots, and other stuff that I have to just put in a folder. I don&#x27;t have tagging or anything and keeping up this information just isn&#x27;t working.<p>Any tips?')
