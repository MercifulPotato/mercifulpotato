It takes some time to get up\nto speed again, but nowadays I type using all fingers evenly\n~95% of the time, simply because in contrast to the\noff-the-shelf design it makes correct typing far more\ncomfortable while requiring quite some finger gymnastics to pull\nit off any other way.<p>Of course due to the different design it&#x27;s not quite as\nflexible, for example it&#x27;s not great for gaming and mainly\nshines when the mouse is used sparingly. But as I mainly work\nwith text it&#x27;s been a great experience for me.')
