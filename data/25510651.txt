As someone developing part-time with others on a community mesh network if you somehow can use a wire use the wire. no discussion. 802.11ax (wifi 6) does improve quite a lot, but in the end there a quite a few requirements to reach 1.3gbps. noise, distance, mimo-antennas, driver-issues, fresnel-zone should be free, enough free channels to blast 80mhz of wifi data through the air at 1024QAM - all devices must speak wifi 6 - then there is latency due to aggretation and due to the high bitrates the distance is usally very low.<p>On the one hand you have reliable 110mbyte&#x2F;s on wire vs. maybe sometimes a little bit more via wifi.')
