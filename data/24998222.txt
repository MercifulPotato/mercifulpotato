My own playing around with CUVID and NVENC support in ffmpeg a couple of years ago worked out quite well. I found that I could take 1080p H.264 footage, decode it, overlay a text display, and re-encode it back to H.264.<p>I saw no problems with the video quality if I used -profile:v high -preset:v slow and set the output bitrate equal to the input&#x27;s average bitrate.  With those settings, I was able to reencode at about 130 fps - handy when the raw footage was 9+ hours at 25 fps. Yes, that&#x27;s &quot;slow&quot; on the GPU. :)')
