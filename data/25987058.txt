Turned out to be because of base64 encoding. Which is an RFC standard. However, several people in the thread insist that this is a problem.<p>Theo de Raadt, the founder and leader of OpenBSD says in the thread:<p>&gt; Maybe it should be blocked.  Then the users there can tell them to fix it.<p>&gt; Would have no downside for me.<p>I guess this may be what happened?<p>Really weird IMO. But at the same time I kind of see their point. They have a setup that works for them. And if they want to keep that system the way that it is, it is up to them. Still sad for people that use ProtonMail that they are blocked from even reading the list though if I understood the GP here correctly.')
