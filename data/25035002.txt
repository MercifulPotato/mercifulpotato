I don&#x27;t know (I assume it is public but I don&#x27;t know how to look this up).  Different countries may have different contracts.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the contract was only that X doses would be provided to the US market (as opposed to shipping to the market in Mexico...). In this case the government is only buying a spot in the shipping queue, and not any doses.<p>It could be that the doses were bought by the government only for the government (military and politicians), and the rest of us are on our own.  (this seems unlikely - doctors should be first in line, but an obvious extension is the doses are for doctors&#x2F;nurses and the leftover for the above)<p>It could be the government is buying all doses for their country and will distribute them for no extra charge. This is probably what Europe has done&#x2F;will do - because they tend to have government health care for anything considered essential.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if all 3 of the above were in use by different countries. There is disagreement as to which is best on a political level.')
