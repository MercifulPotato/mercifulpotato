The whole thing was not acknowledged because the leaders were embarrassed and probably afraid of repercussions for not realizing they were pouring that much money down the drain. (this was at a small company). Then I was sidelined by the CEO (a marketing guy) because I wasn&#x27;t &quot;senior enough&quot; to do the job, whatever that means. I wasn&#x27;t good enough, but the system I built for them is apparently still running several years after I left and looks the same.')
