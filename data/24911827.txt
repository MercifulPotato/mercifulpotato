I&#x27;m a Python guy, but Tcl is <i>NOT</i> that bad.  Do not blame the horrible software engineering at Altera and Xilinx on Tcl.  Those companies make more than enough money that they could sit down with Tcl and Tk, spend some time on the code, and have a quite decent tool.  Instead, they keep their bitstream completely closed to lock out competitors and saddle the world with shitty tools.<p>I&#x27;m <i>really</i> surprised that Lattice hasn&#x27;t tried to go around Xilinx and Altera by doing exactly that.  You would think that an open bitstream format and a couple million dollars thrown at academic researchers (Lattice makes about $200 million per quarter in gross profit) would produce some real progress, but I digress ...<p>SystemVerilog, on the other hand, was specifically created because Verilog and SystemC got loose to the end users and the EDA companies were not going to make that mistake again.  So, yeah, SystemVerilog is pretty bad.')
