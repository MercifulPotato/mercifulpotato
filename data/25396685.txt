WhatsApp chat connections are terminated on the FB edge like most other FB traffic and it shares FB&#x27;s common CDN for media. AS11917 might be some legacy stuff or, as was mentioned, special policy stuff. But assuming things are as they were a year or two ago most of your WA traffic is via AS32934.<p>Source: also worked at FB&#x2F;WA.')
