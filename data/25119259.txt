They made $874 million in profits in Q3 out of which ~$543M came out as stock-based compensation for Musk (a non-cash expense but has to be reported on GAAP-profit line). This is unusually high and is due to the recent run-up in stock price.<p>They were definitely significantly profitable net of regulatory credits in Q3. Their automotive gross-margin in Q3 was ~23% excluding regulatory credits. Such margins are unheard of in the auto industry.')
