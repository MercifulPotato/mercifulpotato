MySpace was already a thing, several other social media sites but today they&#x27;re mostly dead while FB is not.  Luck <i>does</i> have a lot to do with it.  I feel trying to quantify luck though will get us no where.  Trying to &quot;correct&quot; for it, even more so.<p>&gt;The people like Newton and Einstein who actually had revolutionary ideas were not even close to billionaires.<p>Do you think they should be?  I cannot think of a reason... but I do understand what you mean.<p>&gt;I am not sure why you feel that &quot;taxing rich people&quot; makes everyone worse off.<p>I think it would be hard to quantify it but yes, I do think people are &quot;worse off&quot; - not by much though, if you&#x27;re going by metrics like salary.  I&#x27;m thinking about all the advances we&#x27;ve made.  I don&#x27;t see half the stuff happening if not for the ability for excess money to be invested.  I mean, the very thing we&#x27;re talking on for instance (and yea maybe it could have been on some other site like FB or reddit) but those are also because of investing.<p>&gt;60 years ago a man with a high school diploma could support a middle class life for a family of 4. Taxes on the highest earners were much higher than they were today. 60 years before that there was no federal income tax and people worked 14 hour days in dangerous conditions while Carnegie and Rockefeller amassed wealth on scales not seen until today.<p>I don&#x27;t see how the two are related though.  There were a lot of things different about back then vs today.\nI would like to see the focus be on rent and CoL as I see those as way more of a problem than if Jeff Bezos has $50b or $100b. (his wealth has fluctuated like crazy with covid and divorce).<p>&gt;But yes I agree with you that a tax on each market trade is lol stupid. But I think it is a straw-man argument<p>I&#x27;m glad you agree and also glad its not like twitter or reddit where we have to try to score cheap condescending shots in to &quot;argue&quot; lol... but alas.  I would say if its the very thing presidential candidates like Bernie and Andrew Yang are saying they would like to get done, I would consider that beyond a straw man.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;markets.businessinsider.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;stocks&#x2F;why-bernie-sanders-financial-transaction-tax-would-hurt-main-street-2019-7-1028390075" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;markets.businessinsider.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;stocks&#x2F;why-bernie-s...</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.yang2020.com&#x2F;policies&#x2F;financial-transaction-tax&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.yang2020.com&#x2F;policies&#x2F;financial-transaction-tax&#x2F;</a><p>It is also what people are pushing as a solution for student debt.<p>I agree the 100% tax <i>is</i> a strawman though! ... Unless a significant figure proposes it, I will always say that&#x27;s a strawman lol')
