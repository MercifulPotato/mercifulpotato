I was also annoyed at the local government for not fixing quality of life issues. But off late, I am increasingly disillusioned by the tech industry and the loudmouth tech execs and VCs on Twitter. They complaint all day about SF. They are constantly looking for validation and affirmation of their self importance from local leaders. They probably believe that everyone owes them something. And I started to realize that people forget why they moved to SF to begin with. It was because it wasn’t a wasteland of mono culture of office parks and white collar workers. And now every day they decry what they moved into.')
