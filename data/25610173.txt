Imagine movie and TV show castings being done through that platform.<p>You may have a serendipity graph with N edges and M vertices of actors&#x2F;directors&#x2F;musicians&#x2F;producers&#x2F;photographers who&#x27;ve always wanted to work with one another on some project some day, and then people get old or die.<p>What if you have a &quot;Group Tinder&quot;, and then based on parameters such as affinities between these entities, the scripts fed into that platform, you automatically get recommended &quot;teams&quot; to carry out the project. These are recommendations and you could then experiment with these teams in reading sessions, but you at least get an initial state you can iterate through and tweak. People rarely get the role they read for anyway, but I think it would speed up the initial phase&#x2F;reading&#x2F;casting and help people converge towards the final casting.<p>Or why have a final casting, you could &quot;fork&quot; a script and do it with another team and have multiple &quot;distributions&quot;. Not &quot;remakes&quot; but &quot;forks&quot;.<p>Nobody said we cannot increase the probability of serendipity.<p>Now, imagine endeavors that share this workflow, where people with particular and complementary skills get together to collaborate on something. Not necessarily heists. But one abstraction above that is asking the question: is there an ontology for collaboration, and can it and its engine be built in order to allow to launch verticals like these almost effortlessly.<p>Why: if there is such a thing, you could launch a 100 experiments with almost zero cost for everything that requires rig-up&#x2F;rig-down - band together&#x2F;disband type of collaboration, as they would leverage the same ontology and API, and only the &quot;front&quot; would change.')
