Item(by='ssivark', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610024745, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25670464, text='+1, it’s crazy to imagine letting someone control the platform and influence the nature of conversations one can have.<p>Likewise, never used WhatsApp, and communicate with close friends and family via Signal. Once Matrix matures and robustly supports voice&#x2F;video and group calls, I’ll look towards using that more actively and nudging folks towards that. For the moment, Jitsi is a good solution when needed.<p>(I happen to be on Discord too, but that’s mainly due to topical communities rather than social messaging. I would love for those to eventually move to Matrix too.)')
