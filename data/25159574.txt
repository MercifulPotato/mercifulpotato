Fortunately, the Code variant of the font goes for a curved tail on l, so that it’s sufficiently distinct.<p>(However, if you try to enable both the Code and Poly features—Poly meaning “don’t be a true monospace, make characters like l and i a little narrower and characters like m a little wider”—you end up with a slightly narrower flat-bottomed l glyph, rather than a curved tail. See this, for example, in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrismorgan.info&#x2F;blog&#x2F;make-and-git-diff-test-harness&#x2F;#figure-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;chrismorgan.info&#x2F;blog&#x2F;make-and-git-diff-test-harness...</a>, which is set in Code + Poly. Disable the `code { font-feature-settings: &quot;ss01&quot; 1, &quot;ss02&quot; }` CSS rule to see the effect of removing Poly—you get the curved tail l glyph back again. I’ve been meaning to sort out a better glyph for the combination, but I haven’t gotten round to it yet, because it’s annoyingly difficult to actually do that sort of thing.)')
