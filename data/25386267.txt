I had a corsair void pro and &quot;upgraded&quot; to the corsair virtuoso. The virtuoso is aluminum construction, looks far more professional, sounds a bit better, and has better battery life, but it&#x27;s much heavier AND has LESS padding. It feels like it&#x27;s trying to dig into my skull in no time. They would be much better if they sacrificed a little bit of sleekness to pack much more foam in the headband.')
