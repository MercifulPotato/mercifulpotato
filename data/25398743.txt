I think I agree that could be considered covert unkind speech in media and advertising. The barrage of things telling people they aren&#x27;t good enough or preying on insecurities would have detremental effects. Personally, I enjoy the kind-spirited effort behind this, I&#x27;ll be putting this in the header of my running notes .md file.')
