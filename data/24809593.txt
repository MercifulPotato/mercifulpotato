Looked up the best time to post, labored over the wording in the title, everything. It got like three views and disappeared quickly into nirvana.<p>I was super discouraged and didn&#x27;t feel like writing more about this topic (probably dumb after just one post but hey that&#x27;s how I felt).<p>Then, a few days later, some random person re-posted my blog post to HN. This time it exploded and landed on the front page, giving me a couple hundred subscribers alone. Until now I have no idea why the difference was so huge.<p>This experience taught me that luck is just insanely important. Not sure how this conclusion helps though.')
