Item(by='nsajko', descendants=None, kids=[25712748], score=None, time=1610267008, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25710055, text='One interesting thing with interesting implications regarding the (Wikimedia Foundation and its) Wikipedias is that getting to know them&#x2F;it and how it functions is very involved.<p>This is what I&#x27;m getting at: I tried to present some criticism of Wikipedia in this discussion. However, a lot of my comments are kind of vague because I failed to give specific examples. Consider why this is so:<p>Discussing a specific example would require both some (sometimes rare) knowledge of the subject at hand and knowledge of the arcane processes through which a Wikipedia is governed and through which the disputes are resolved.<p>This means that I would need to invest a lot of time explaining everything for someone to be able to understand the example, but, on the other hand, almost nobody (if not perhaps already a Wikipedian and familiar with the subject matter) would be willing to invest enough time to really understand the example and all the connected issues anyway.<p>Thus substantial criticism of Wikipedia and its processes never gets to the public at large. I think that even most of Wikipedia&#x27;s contributors hold little understanding of how Wikipedia actually works (socially) because the majority are very casual. And don&#x27;t get me started on the incompetent contributors who meddle with articles and topics that they don&#x27;t know enough about.<p>Another issue is that Wikipedians probably won&#x27;t want to associate their Wikipedia identity with their HN identity (and similar).')
