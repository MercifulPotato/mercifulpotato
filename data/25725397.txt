I have seen people claim to feel physically unsafe whenever someone raises the question of how specific women&#x27;s sports should handle participation trans women, and I have seen other people claim to feel physically unsafe when someone suggests raising taxes to fund more public services (immediately reaching for comparisons to the USSR in the 1930s).<p>Is the test then whether someone feels unsafe as a result of the speech?  Or whether a &quot;reasonable person&quot; would feel unsafe?  And so on, and so forth.<p>There&#x27;s really no good way to win completely here: either some people are going to feel unsafe, or you have to have _quite_ draconian speech restrictions to try to avoid that (and probably still fail).  You might be able to do something that works for neurotypical-enough people, but that&#x27;s the best I can see.')
