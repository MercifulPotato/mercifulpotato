What happens on the Soviet side?  After the United States&#x27; announcement the Soviet press and Soviet sympathizers worldwide gasp loudly in horror.  &quot;How cruel are Americans, really?  Is the barbaric act of murdering and butchering an innocent young man the only thing still able to keep their president from destroying our Earth?&quot;<p>The Soviet General Secretary soon receives a report about what the new policy means tactically.
