Or why would anyone get this instead of Swiss-made Threema? Which was audited, has a web version (even if it&#x27;s super crappy), has contact discovery, and is open source. I can not find a single advantage of Teleguard (even the name, it just reminds me of Telegram) over either Matrix or Threema. Or perhaps Wire if you don&#x27;t care about Amazon handling your data.<p>The faq for &quot;why use this&quot; says it uses the best crypto ever: salsa20. That isn&#x27;t better or worse than aes in terms of security and it&#x27;s also missing a few components (surely they haven&#x27;t reinvented digital signatures using a stream cipher). And they say it complies with the law, like okay yeah that sounds pretty standard.<p>Frankly, it looks shady. No profit model, inconsistent text styles, weird reasons given for why it should be better, a brand name whose abbreviation conflicts with an established competitor (seems like a throwaway name), no source code &#x2F; f-droid release, handful of downloads on Google Play Store, and claiming with a straight face that literally no user data is stored - what, does it not store incoming chat messages until my device comes online? It just isn&#x27;t true.<p>Don&#x27;t know if this is a Show HN (it&#x27;s not labeled as such) or just someone who randomly found it, but I&#x27;d be curious to hear from the developers what the thought process is here.<p>Edit: checking out the company behind it, they have paid privacy products. I guess it&#x27;s not as shady as it first seemed, but it&#x27;s also not quite ready for launch given the competition&#x27;s state of maturity. It&#x27;s a hard market to get into I think, it might make more sense to fork Signal and make it use usernames and European servers to at least have something to work off of.')
