Or rather, it&#x27;s another set of perverse incentives in the industry.<p>To get a job, devs need experience in relevant tech. No company is willing to train their devs - they all have to hit the ground running. So devs have to have demonstrable experience in the tech that lots of companies use. Companies need to hire devs, and don&#x27;t really care what tech is used. But using what everyone else uses makes their hiring easier because it&#x27;s easier to find devs who want to work on that tech. So they advertise for devs with experience in a hot tech. The devs see this and try and move their internal projects to use the hot tech so that if&#x2F;when they look for their next job they&#x27;ll have experirence in it.<p>The devs are just trying to stay relevant in a rapidly changing tech scene so they can get their next job.<p>The companies who employ them don&#x27;t care what tech is used, but find recruiting devs to be easier if they&#x27;re working in the latest hot tech.<p>The key point that could change all this is if companies were willing to train their devs in the tech stack they&#x27;re using.')
