Asking a hundred questions simply means it’s more likely your study will “succeed” in the sense of finding something to report that aligns with your agenda. Statistically, take any sample size. If you measure enough factors, you are bound to find some bias in your sample size.<p>Instead, a better study would consider actual science. Microbiology, biochemistry, etc and form measurable hypotheses instead of this spray-and-pray pseudoscience')
