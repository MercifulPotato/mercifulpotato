Google provided links to the news websites and a title+first sentence blurb, and then presented their own ads on the aggregation page.<p>They didn’t steal or reprint the full text of the article, they didn’t crawl the site and use a GAN to summarize it  (and remember - this is half of what modern journalists do anyways) - they provided a useful service that drove traffic and clicks to these ingrates.<p>But they wanted more and petitioned the courts to give it to them. This doesn’t seem like much of anything other than gatekeeping the established news media.')
