Browser dev history has been littered with poor implementations. I want to say Chrome still stores shit unencrypted, but this is just what I recall off the top of my head from reading tech news. I&#x27;m no expert, and that&#x27;s pretty much my point. I trust keychain and don&#x27;t want to write a phd thesis on how secure the other options are.<p>I like the ios integration. Other browsers offer this, but it&#x27;s just another account to worry about - do i trust this company, will they still be around (and still be trustworthy) in ten years? browser history is the most personal thing I do on a computer so this matters a lot to me. (I guess both of these points are just tldr walled garden)<p>The lack of good adblocking kills it for me. It&#x27;s too much of a sacrifice, even with a pihole running at home.<p>Also, as you said, they move slowly. Not just with shiny new tech, but also basic privacy things like if I type &quot;old.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;embarrassingThingsImInto&quot; or whatever, why are they still defaulting to http, and waiting for the web server to decide to upgrade the connection (leaking the initial request)? Why is defaulting to https hidden away in the developer menu? Developers are the only people these days who should be dealing with http anyway, and in those cases there&#x27;s probably a &quot;.local&quot; at the end they could use to make a determination.')
