We&#x27;ll see if publishers are now motivated to try to make their native sites equally fast. I&#x27;m not holding my breath, though. I assume they&#x27;ll stick with AMP because they don&#x27;t want to re-architect their sites, or don&#x27;t have the technical bandwidth to do so.<p>But this way Google appears more neutral with &quot;objective&quot; page performance measures, rather than explicitly favoring any single standard.<p>EDIT: the URL and title have since been changed by mods to a Google blog post.
