I tried moving my extended family off WhatsApp onto Signal a couple of years ago and it failed miserably because the app wasn&#x27;t nearly as easy to use, and they had all their friends on Whatsapp. Has anyone here had any success moving a large group of people onto something like Signal or Telegram? If so, do you have any tips?')
