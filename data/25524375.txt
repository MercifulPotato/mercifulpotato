I used to listen to Joe Rogan&#x27;s podcast sometimes (on Overcast, which is awesome)... since he moved to the vastly inferior Spotify platform, I don&#x27;t listen to him at all.  The platform is pure shit for podcasts, so I&#x27;ve cut Rogan out of my life, and saved many hours per week in the process.  Not that his $100M is going to notice my absence!')
