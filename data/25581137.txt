For example, look at how much support certain ideas had among young folks in Germany in the 1930s.<p>Anyway, both opposing points of view, while having some merit, are simplifications. Both old and young people should be allowed to vote, and you&#x27;ll have to find a sensible cut-off at what age to start.<p>Of course, then it depends who actually turns out to vote, and I believe the younger folks could have been a bit more active on the day of the brexit referendum. (Of course there were also other reasons why &quot;leave&quot; won, including blatant misdirection and cheating by the leave campaign.)<p>Talking about disenfranchisement - what baffles me the most though is that UK expats living in Europe, who had a disproportionately high stake in the outcome of the referendum, were apparently not allowed to participate.')
