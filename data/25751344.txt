I&#x27;d provide an example, but to do so would just inject my own biases.<p>I&#x27;m sure anyone reading this can think of at least 5-6 &quot;reactions&quot; by the other side which had no precipitating action -- regardless of which side they&#x27;re on.  It starts to seem a little silly to worry about the reaction on the other side, when that reaction is likely to happen anyway.<p>There are good, principled reasons to avoid censorship.  Concern about what irrational actors will do in response is not one of them.')
