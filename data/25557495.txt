You can build a tall structure that collect the sunlight hitting the side of it, but obviously that&#x27;s going to block said sunlight from a correspondingly large area of ground in its shadow; at extreme latitudes where the sunlight mostly comes in sideways you get more concentrated sunlight that way (at the cost of an even bigger shadow), but I doubt it&#x27;d be worth the overhead.')
