Purdue is responsible for what? 8% of the opioids that were pumped into the medical industry by Big Pharma. Max. (And that&#x27;s being generous.) That means 92% of the problem was not sanctioned <i>at all</i> by our &quot;Justice&quot; Department. So they slap the hands of one of the small fries come election time, and we&#x27;re dumb enough to keep voting for them. Both sides engage in this nonsense too, that&#x27;s what&#x27;s so disheartening.<p>There is obviously too much money up there to go after the big guys. I get that. But at some point, man, can&#x27;t we strap on the gloves and try to do the right thing? For once? This whole &quot;Justice&quot; Department action is a slap in the face to communities dealing with the opioid crisis out here in flyover country.')
