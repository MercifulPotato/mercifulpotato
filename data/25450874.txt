The real answer is a dissertation on enforcement actions and circuit court behaviors, which I was not going to write and there is no one answer.<p>Regarding patents, the article of the constitution is an instruction to Congress to secure rights for a &quot;limited time&quot;. So maybe you needed to explain that since I guess it isn&#x27;t common for people to know what the constitution says, in my world I just assume that.')
