I&#x27;m still kind of astonished at what those humble little 100-megahertz MIPS things can do.  It feels like it took serious chutzpah to build a 3D product suite on this platform .. but yet, SGI did okay for a while.<p>I always wish they&#x27;d made a titanium laptop.  If someone at SGI had any real artistic integrity, they would have done this the moment the world caught wind of Steve Jobs&#x27; fire at Apple 2.0 .. but yet again, another highly talented pool of people, subjugated to the military industrial complex, just sucked all the sex out of the box.')
