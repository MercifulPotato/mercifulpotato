I mean, perhaps you wouldn&#x27;t have predicted the level of success, but it was clear that the iPod was all the experience they needed to pull off the iPhone, and it was also clear to anyone who used phones that if they could get the internet to work well there was a big market.<p>In contrast, I would say there&#x27;s very little evidence Apple can pull off a majorly successful server play. It&#x27;s not impossible, and I think the trends are potentially in their favor, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t play to their strengths. Apple&#x27;s biggest strengths are very consumer oriented, and the trade-offs they typically make are not great for an enterprise crowd (expensive hardware, willingness to abandon legacy compatibility, etc.).<p>There&#x27;s probably a smallish market for very specialized servers that Apple could fill well, and maybe they will. Long term maybe that could translate to a wider market if they really make an effort. But I think it&#x27;s at the very least a significantly longer time horizon than the iPhone.')
