PID controllers deal with a scalar setpoint, scalar measured variable, and scalar control output and adjust frequently. How is that helpful at all in choosing this subset? It&#x27;s certainly not a straightforward application of standard literature that the authors completely ignored, as suggested by siscia&#x27;s grandparent comment.<p>&gt; So in this example, it might be that you distribute your requests to servers based on how over or under loaded the servers are.<p>They had a working approach to distributing requests to servers, described at the beginning of the article. It&#x27;s sessions (aka connections or channels in Google&#x27;s literature) they&#x27;re focusing on.<p>Responding also to siscia&#x27;s grandchild comment:<p>&gt; Or you can spin up more machines. The integral and derivative part will tell you when spinning up more machines or when to tear down the one you already got!<p>You&#x27;re describing something like Google&#x27;s autopilot, which I just linked to in another comment. A PID controller might make sense there, but it&#x27;s only tangentially related to the problem described in this article.')
