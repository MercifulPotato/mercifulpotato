Memorials are one way we transmit community norms and values.  So removing a shameful symbol can be part of the process of building consensus around the historical events and policies that it symbolizes.  It serves as a visible focal point for issues that would otherwise be invisible to many people. But I definitely agree that in terms of making real, concrete impact in peoples lives, taking down a statue is pretty much irrelevant.')
