You were over some saturation threshold and the law of diminishing returns kicked in hard.<p>(3) The ads were valuable to you but not in an easily measured way. Maybe you could coast on brand awareness inertia for 6 months or a year before it affects sales.<p>This case seems to have decent evidence for at least part of it being #1, but not necessarily all of it.')
