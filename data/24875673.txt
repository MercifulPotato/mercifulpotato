Why would anyone need gofyourself-dl to download your container code? And what does Google have to do with the creation of youtube-dl, which is used to download stuff hosted on Google&#x27;s website? And you talked about publishing code, but where does youtube-dl publish the videos it downloads?\nOr are you just implying that not executing all of Google&#x27;s code and not watching a gazillion ads to download and view videos is some sort of &quot;theft of IP&quot;? Or is it that youtube-dl doesn&#x27;t automatically delete the video after watching? I seriously don&#x27;t get it.<p>&gt; don&#x27;t for a second think the RIAA is thrilled with that mechanism<p>What would they prefer doing? Arrest people who are using youtube-dl to listen to music? Go after people who are rehosting music from youtube on their website?')
