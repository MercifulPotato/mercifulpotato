The point is to have a simplified language that represents a series of commands operating on a bank of memory. Like this:<p><pre><code>    SET 1 100  # Set memory[1] = 100\n    SET 2 500  # Set memory[2] = 500\n    ADD 3 1 2  # Set memory[3] = memory[1] + memory[2]\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s easy to explain what each individual step is meant to do and you can build up to more complicated instructions. It allows children to see the persistent effects of running the program, mutating the state of the memory, eventually introducing the instruction counter itself as a state variable.')
