Many people do. Blanket stating that that is not an option is kind of weird.<p>I use Firefox every day. The author tries to make it sound like the old days where a lot of websites simply didn&#x27;t work without IE (for instance, because they needed ActiveX exposing the internals of your OS). I never run into Chrome-only sites. Heck, it&#x27;s 2021 and I regularly use Firefox to run Office 365 on Linux.')
