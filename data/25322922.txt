There is a real need for a good style sheet for responsive web. If you were to create it, and I’m sure it will be easy for you to do, you could get a very popular product. Sorry if it is unsolicited, no need to listen to it, it is given with good intentions after spending over 50 hours myself on getting up to speed on doing a responsive web site from scratch.<p>Reset &#x2F; normalize may not be the best terms to use, but effectively that is what you are doing. I’m not going to go into more depth on this.<p>Sorry if I’m being harsh, but I rather be honest than give some cursory congratulations. As I said earlier, your documentation is very well done but there isn’t much this style sheet does otherwise.')
