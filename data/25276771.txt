For the most part, people prefer their own room, bathroom, and possibly kitchenette&#x2F;sitting space. Along with flexibility about checking in and out. Not always of course. Sometimes you need to adapt if you&#x27;re off the beaten path. But I&#x27;m pretty sure that if you surveyed most people, especially business travelers, they&#x27;re not really looking for a speare room or bed in a private home.')
