Some of us work for companies, some have our own clients.<p>I&#x27;m thinking scenarios like:<p>* During your first sit-down with your team lead, he&#x2F;she expresses some concerns.<p>* Your client runs out of funds mid-project, but you still need to insist that they pay you.<p>* During code review, a senior dev finds fault with a dozen things you&#x27;ve done, but you&#x27;re sure it&#x27;s a difference of style, not a right&#x2F;wrong approach.<p>* A customer you have been interacting with goes over your head to your boss&#x27;s boss.<p>* The designer has made a pretty design that makes it a huge pain to implement. They refuse to budge on even small changes.<p>* ???<p>I&#x27;d love to hear some situations you experienced in your career.<p>Things that could have blown up if you had said the wrong thing, but which you managed to turn around by saying the right thing.<p>Does anything come to mind?')
