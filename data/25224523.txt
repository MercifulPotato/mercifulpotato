In the tiny user-space entry point I check if sys_batch is working and if not I fall back to just a loop of userspace making syscalls.  That also checks a BATCH_EMUL environment variable to force that emulation mode for benchmarking purposes { so I don&#x27;t have to unload&#x2F;reload the module. :-) }<p>So, user code would always just work, but work faster on kernels with the module loaded.')
