Something you can export as, but not the thing itself.<p>Yes, and sorry because rereading my comment I wasn&#x27;t clear, but this is what I meant. I view Spreadsheets as the <i></i>view<i></i> (but also an editor of the view), but I don&#x27;t mean people should be working with XLS files (TSVs seem to work the bestâ€” I personally hate tabs but may have lost that battle). I do think though of Spreadsheets as the primary view, and so always design my data structures with the understanding of &quot;how will this interoperate with spreadsheets&quot;. JSON is the pits.<p>IMO 2-D DSLs with Spreadsheets as the primary view&#x2F;editor paradigm are the future.<p>I think Spreadsheets are 1, if not 2 OOM better than notebooks for doing actual work (notebooks can be good for presenting results in a narrative):<p><pre><code>    - non-linear for both humans and machines (allows for really creative and fast out-of-order parsing techniques on the machine side)\n    - concise signal with high information density\n    - unlimited cursors\n    - fantastically easier for version control and multi-player experiences\n    </code></pre>\nI maintain a list of all data science tools to try and stay on top of best practices, and when I see a tool is notebook first, I think &quot;good, less work for me to track this one because they aren&#x27;t getting the core things right yet.&quot; (Though often times notebooks will have really innovative orthogonal features).')
