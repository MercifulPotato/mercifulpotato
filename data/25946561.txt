It&#x27;s not a strange headline at all. Companies with large market share routinely curb their own actions to limit or bow to government pressure that is always present.<p>Intel would have eaten Nvidia and ARM a long time ago if that were not how things worked. Intel has been under 24&#x2F;7 government pressure for decades. They&#x27;re not allowed to behave the way Nvidia and AMD are allowed to behave, they&#x27;re not allowed to acquire companies that some of their competitors are allowed to acquire. Intel has been on its knees bowing to government pressure for decades at this point, with two hands tied behind its back.')
