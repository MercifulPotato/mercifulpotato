Truth is Truth.<p>The problem is that the internet broke the newspapers and cable tv. The internet has been able to allow people to get to the truth. Look at that maga hat kid story; if this were 75 years ago. The newspapers would never have retracted. The change is that we can watch the whole thing and see how the media spun the story in a completely false way. As they have done for decades. The internet has ruined their long history of being able to spin stories. They know their enemy, it&#x27;s the internet.<p>Facebook, twitter, insert social media here. That&#x27;s their enemy and they&#x27;ll do everything they can to vilify their new enemy. That means every group will be attacked as effectively as possible. If all they can do is label you a discriminator of some sort. they will do so. Just look at presidential debate. The proud boys, whose leader is a black man, were labelled white supremacists. Last I checked, white supremacists dont follow a black man as their lead.')
