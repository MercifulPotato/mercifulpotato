Any semi-decent static type system has no problems modeling higher-order functions, and static types can easily be infinite via parametric polymorphism (&quot;generics&quot;).<p>&gt; <i>Static typing is either constraining, or it is a Turing Tarpit</i><p>You&#x27;re letting the perfect be the enemy of the good. Static type systems can be beneficial even when they don&#x27;t solve every conceivable problem.')
