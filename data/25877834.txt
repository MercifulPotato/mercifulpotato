Item(by='WorldMaker', descendants=None, kids=[25878464], score=None, time=1611359131, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25873272, text='One of my favorite parts of the &quot;curse narrative&quot; is the part where they had the foresight that &quot;HD&quot; TV resolutions were coming, decided to shoot in proper widescreen film and tried to keep the digital files for the special effects reworkable for when it was time to quickly remaster. But somewhere along the way Warner Brothers lost the digital files and the cost to remaster ballooned significantly and in this timeline we&#x27;ll likely never see a Blu-Ray release of the show despite it being filmed for something like it.<p>One of the twisty roads in that story is that one of the arguments that WB has for how they lost the digital files involves Sierra On-Line&#x27;s especially cursed attempt at a Babylon 5 videogame and that one argument is that one place that could turn up the lost files is somewhere in the cursed bowels of Activision Blizzard. (Just as WB and Activision Blizzard lost the contracts for NOLF and its sequels somewhere and no one knows who has the rights today.)')
