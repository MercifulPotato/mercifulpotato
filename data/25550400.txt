Chapel already contributes to that, as the article mentioned, because the player who got 4&#x2F;3 really got 4&#x2F;2. You get Chapel and a good 5 drop and your opponent with 4&#x2F;2 can just go ahead and concede on turn one.<p>But making it 5 takes it out of the opening hand most of the time. That’s why most of the best cards are 5.<p>I’m not 100% sure it shouldn’t be 3 or 4 but it definitely shouldn’t be 2. And I’m fairly sure that if it trashed 3 cards instead of 4 it would still be extremely playable (given how many times good players take worse trashing than that in the first round) and that the play testers back then just didn’t know the game well enough yet to understand.')
