While I&#x27;d love to move to a cheaper place (our work is all remote now), I can&#x27;t think of anywhere better and I&#x27;ve been looking hard.<p>Being near the ocean is a hard requirement. And weather that isn&#x27;t terrible (bay area weather isn&#x27;t actually very good, but it&#x27;s also never terrible). Where else could one go?<p>Florida could be nice but it is low land being taken over by rising oceans so not a great strategy. Washington state coast sounds promising but there is snow up there, so a hard no. Oregon coast is pretty inhospitable for water sports. Southern California isn&#x27;t particularly cheaper. Southern east coast (north of Florida) could work, but way too much racism so as a minority that&#x27;s a pass.<p>SF Bay to Monterey Bay is a sweet spot in the USA that is hard to beat.')
