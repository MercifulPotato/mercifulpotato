You have public transport and you can share a car (and expenses) with someone who has your same destination.<p>So, how does this work, exactly? So you set up carpooling with a coworker. And then one day you don&#x27;t sleep well. Luckily enough, they&#x27;re there to pick you up so you don&#x27;t have to drive! ...but what happens when it&#x27;s your turn to drive? You tell them, whoops, I&#x27;m tired today, so you&#x27;re going to have to drive and get your spouse to change <i>their</i> plans so that you have access to a car? Or maybe they&#x27;re always the one driving... what happens on days that they&#x27;re tired? They cancel and you both have to find your own way via public transit?<p>Like what are the specific logistics here, accounting for failure modes? Does it amount to &quot;spend $100 on Uber on days after a mediocre night&#x27;s sleep&quot;?')
