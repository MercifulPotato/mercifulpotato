These things are important, but they don&#x27;t reduce the daily operating complexity around deployments (applications) <i>on</i> the cluster. In other words, they take the pain out of running and setting up Kubernetes itself, but they don&#x27;t simplify using Kubernetes. I highly recommend using a managed solution unless you absolutely know what you are doing in terms of networking, security, and disaster recovery. They are not too expensive either, you&#x27;re still mostly paying for the VM nodes.<p>The only reason we&#x27;re not using a managed solution is because we have some specific edge networking and multi-cluster requirements that are hard to do with a managed solution.')
