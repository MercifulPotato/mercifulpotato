Junkies like their rituals.<p>I don&#x27;t know the youtube video you linked, nor will I watch it (I avoid Google as much as possible).<p>That said, I grind my $6.99&#x2F;lb French Roast twice (once with a burr grinder and once with a blade grinder) to ensure that it&#x27;s ground fine enough for my taste.<p>Is that a ritual?  Not really.  It&#x27;s more to make sure that my coffee is of a taste and consistency I prefer.<p>In fact, I&#x27;d prefer not to have to do all of that and sometimes will use the Bunn commercial coffee grinder[0] at my supermarket, which will grind to the level I want consistently.  I&#x27;d buy one, but they cost ~$1,000.00.<p>Is my activity a ritual or is it just making sure I get what I want?<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ebay.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;1100681870?iid=193368088995" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ebay.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;1100681870?iid=193368088995</a><p>Edit: Fixed spacing.')
