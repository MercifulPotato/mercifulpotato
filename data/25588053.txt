The Parrott and Reich study is the one commissioned by the Seattle Office of Labor Standards and City Council:<p>&gt; At this point, there’s no real point in groping through the wage, expense or hours calculations for either study; the underlying data in the Parrott and Reich study is garbage, and both studies skew their analysis and recommendations in the direction that favors the one who commissioned their study. Instead, we should be focused on the key policy questions, and forcing city officials to be transparent about who they are prioritizing in the policy decisions they are making in setting a minimum wage.  Once the policy questions are answered, there is enough raw data in the Cornell report to calculate out the proper minimum wage.<p>&gt; The key policy question, one that drives so many others, is whether the city should prioritize full-time drivers over part-time and casual drivers. As we’ve seen above, it affects almost everything: what expenses to include, how much the system needs to try to maximize paid hours for full-time drivers, the economic model for the companies. According to the Uber&#x2F;Lyft data set that Cornell analyzed, only 15% of TNC drivers are full-time, but for them the job is their livelihood. Should they be prioritized over people driving as a second job to help make ends meet or deal with emergency expenses?  Should the city try to increase the number of full-time TNC driver jobs? Should the city be picking winners and losers at all between full-time and part-time drivers?')
