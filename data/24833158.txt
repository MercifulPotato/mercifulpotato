While it does cover my game Dumuzid (probably the first roguelike focused around multitile monsters) it skips over another I made a couple years later which is a little more notable for placing 1st in 7DRL 2018: DEAD FACE (a turn based bullet hell with hacking and multitile mechs). <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jere.itch.io&#x2F;dead-face" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;jere.itch.io&#x2F;dead-face</a><p>Considering I made each of these games in a week I don&#x27;t think making such mechanics is particularly difficult. At least not technically. They do require some new kinds of design challenges (how to deal with getting stuck, what&#x27;s actually interesting about big enemies, representing tiles visually).  It&#x27;s a mechanic with a lot of unrealized potential.')
