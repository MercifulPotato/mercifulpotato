The important thing for servers, disk and network I&#x2F;O differs across ARM chips of the same ISA. Linux kernel abstracts it away i.e. stuff is likely to work, but Iâ€™m not so sure about performance portability.<p>&gt; Indeed. But Intel Xeon + Intel Ethernet integrates tightly and drops the Ethernet data directly into L3 cache (bypassing DRAM entirely).<p>This will be less of a problem on ARM servers as direct access to the LLC from a hardware master is a standard feature of ARM&#x27;s &quot;Dynamic Shared Unit&quot; or DSU, which is the shared part of a cluster providing the LLC and coherency support. Connect a hardware function to the DSU ACP (accelerator coherency port) and the hardware can control, for all write accesses, whether to &quot;stash&quot; data into the LLC or even the L2 or L1 of a specific core. The hardware can also control allocate on miss vs not. So any high performance IP can benefit from it.<p>And if I understand correctly, the DSU is required with modern ARM cores. As most (besides Apple) tend to use ARM cores now, you have this in the package.<p>More details here in the DSU tech manual:\n <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.arm.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;100453&#x2F;0002&#x2F;functional-description&#x2F;introduction&#x2F;about-the-dsu" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;developer.arm.com&#x2F;documentation&#x2F;100453&#x2F;0002&#x2F;function...</a>')
