I am no expert in software, let alone hardware, but I am always suprised how often I see professional developers bemoan the fact that their laptop &#x27;uses 12 gigs of ram&#x27; to run the OS + a few chrome tabs. A huge amount of devs don&#x27;t know how their OS manages memory, let alone the ins and outs of the design and operation of modern microprocessors.')
