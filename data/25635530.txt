I disagree that it&#x27;s appropriate to call it &quot;money&quot; (based on the fact that, by design, it has low acceptability - if enough people would use it for their daily transactions, the entire network would break down). I&#x27;m also really uncertain that it&#x27;s an appropriate store of value, and lean on the side of &quot;it&#x27;s not&quot;.<p>WRT guarantee... yes, let&#x27;s say I accept that you can send BTC to somebody regardless what laws the US passes. The question is, can you receive something in exchange? Because if you can&#x27;t then it means that the technology is not offering you any guarantee. So that guarantee can&#x27;t be the &quot;intrinsic value&quot;. (you don&#x27;t claim that it is - you just claim intrinsic value does not exist, which is a completely new discussion that I don&#x27;t want to get into right now)')
