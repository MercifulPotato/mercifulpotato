So $1.2k to run a candidate through the pipeline post-initial-qualification.<p>To get one candidate and come out superior, acceptance rate should be 1%. (i.e. 99 failures). But if there are 50 leads from the program, and you convert a fifth, that&#x27;s 10 candidates for a cost &#x2F; successful recruit of $10k which means you have 10% acceptance rate to break even.<p>Hmm, back of the envelope seems to do all right as a strat. Relatively cheap. I recall the last time we were hiring, we projected cost per hire at $35k with the bulk of that actually being the recruiter referral fee.')
