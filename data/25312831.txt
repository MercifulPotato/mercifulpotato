XSRF could be a problem if your server exposes sensitive APIs. But XSRF is not unique to this approach, and the techniques for defending against it are well known. And Electron has security issues of its own which are probably more serious.<p>Overall I recommend the daemon + browser approach. The &quot;benefit&quot; to Electron of only having to support one browser is rarely realized in practice because you almost always want a hosted version of your app as well, and that needs to support all browsers anyway. For example Slack and VSCode both have web versions.')
