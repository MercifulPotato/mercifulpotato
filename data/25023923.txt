There is plenty of important information that only comes through the news such as changes to the law, those can really impact you. Then there is the important into the future like the prevailing wind on privacy concerns.<p>It is mixed in with a lot of he said&#x2F;she said and other nonsense propaganda that really isn&#x27;t important. It is written to tickle those brain cells into thinking it is potentially urgent and&#x2F;or important however. I think its hard to tell what will become important anyway, knowing about something years before it happens (like privacy changes regarding software that seem inevitable at this stage) is going to be relevant to some people and just knowing when the law changes probably isn&#x27;t sufficient to do something about it well.<p>I don&#x27;t read the news anymore, I RSS the areas and topics I am interested in and it becomes hard to miss the big stuff. But cutting it out completely is impractical.')
