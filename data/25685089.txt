They are the platforms of private corporations driven by profit from advertising sales.<p>And they haven&#x27;t been shy about explaining <i>exactly</i> what you can and cannot do on <i>their</i> property either (cf. the relevant sites&#x27; TOS).<p>That many people <i>treat</i> them like public squares is a result of those people&#x27;s ignorance of or misapprehension about the platforms, not any subterfuge on the part of FB or Twitter.<p>And the only reason they have <i>any</i> influence is because those people <i>gave</i> it to them.<p>Don&#x27;t use those platforms and they have no influence over you.<p>In the United States at least, they have the right to censor whoever and whatever they like.  Whether that be Donald J. Trump or, anything concerning puff pastry or even tasty, tasty jelly beans.')
