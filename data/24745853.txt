It&#x27;s a genuine question. Say, in my country probably no more then a few hundred people exist who can recognize D&amp;D abbreviation. So one might say &quot;If you&#x27;re from X, you probably don&#x27;t know what it is&quot;, and I don&#x27;t see why that should offend me as an X-ian. I suppose there are substantially less female players then male players, so as a generalization the statement evaluates to &#x27;true&#x27;, and what goes next? How should one proceed to take it as an offence?')
