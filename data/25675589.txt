The manager would be overwhelmed and add cost to the company by asking for a colleague. It&#x27;s not easy to manage 50 people. But maybe the manager wants to diversify himself, so instead of 2 manager for 50 people, you&#x27;ll have... 20 managers for 50 people. You need a managers&#x27; manager. Where does it end? :)')
