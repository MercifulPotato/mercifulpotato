Rolling out a clearly half-baked safety critical technology to its customers (yes, I know it&#x27;s only a few beta testers) who are untrained is nothing but a tactic to generate hype and get more customers to buy that $10k FSD package.<p>This is on top of Tesla being the least transparent company out there in reporting safety data or their testing methodologies (Tesla&#x27;s quarterly safety report is a grand total of a single paragraph). Compare this to how transparent Waymo is [1], the difference in safety culture between Tesla and its competitors is stark. Not to mention how Tesla skirts around the rules by refusing to report autonomous miles with the excuse of classifying it as a driver assist system, while naming the technology &quot;Full Self Driving&quot; and Elon Musk hyping it up every chance he gets on how it will be Level 5-ready by end of the year.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;waymo.com&#x2F;safety&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;waymo.com&#x2F;safety&#x2F;</a>')
