Item(by='macspoofing', descendants=None, kids=[25162054], score=None, time=1605878715, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25159768, text='&gt;I think what people are missing is that this is a work of fiction. Any work of fiction is entitled to do whatever it wants really.<p>I think you may want to qualify that statement a little bit. The author covers this point as well: &quot;Imagine the equivalent of a game set in the American South or the Caribbean pre-1865 in which slavery was simply not present at all&quot;<p>Would you have any issues with AC:Confederacy game, where slavery is not a thing? Where the North is seen as evil, while South is seen as kind, gentle and chivalrous? That&#x27;s the scale of what AC:Valhalla did to their portrayal of invading Vikings vs the Anglo-Saxon populations.<p>&gt;Whenever I played Civilization as a kid and had “Mongolians build the pyramids” I never thought thats a historical fact<p>Did you read the article? The author points out a few historical inaccuracies (like the lack of mail armor being worn) but also mentions that those are not a big deal because he understands that this isn&#x27;t a historical simulation. That&#x27;s not a problem with the game, although it is nice and appreciated when the artist takes care to cover even the small details.')
