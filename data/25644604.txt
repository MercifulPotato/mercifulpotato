Item(by='BatteryMountain', descendants=None, kids=[25645983, 25644984], score=None, time=1609847786, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25643866, text='Uber!<p>My friend dropped her phone in the Uber vehicle about 1.5 years ago, so we phoned Uber support whom insisted that we log into their website to log a support ticket... BUT, in order to log into their site, you have to enter the otp sent via sms.. to the phone that is in the car. Took the support lady a few attempts to understand that we cannot log in.<p>We rand her phone twice, within 10 minutes of realising the phone is missing. First time it rang, second time he switched the phone off.<p>Eventually we managed to talk to the driver, but he insisted that there was no phone in his car. We never got the phone back. When we asked Uber support again what can we do, they rambled stuff about drivers being Independent Contractors etc. I personally haven&#x27;t used Uber since that day. She still uses Uber.<p>We couldn&#x27;t track her phone because it took 6 days to do a sim swap, again, needing to receive an otp from Google to login to track the phone, but by then it was off.<p>I used Uber Eats earlier this year and an order took 2 hours (it was obvious the guy is using more than one delivery app), same story from Uber support. Haven&#x27;t used it since.')
