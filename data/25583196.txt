Item(by='cmrdporcupine', descendants=None, kids=[25583512], score=None, time=1609346711, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25582952, text='Yes, exactly, this is always the same example I give (in my case the 401 here in Ontario, Canada) -- blizzard in the middle of February, lane markings covered, highly unpredictable road surface, spontaneous temporary lanes, cars working at a crawl, snow plows coming through that you have to move over for, and can&#x27;t pass, cars or trucks jack-knifed or half in the ditch. This kind of thing happens to varying degrees at least once a year, and I honestly don&#x27;t think that these scenarios are actually properly in the imagination of the primarily-California-based engineers who work on self-driving.<p>For context, the greater Toronto region is 6 million people, and Great Lakes region from here over to Chicago is multiples of that. Winter is 4-6 months. This is not an insignificant edge case for a small population, and if self-driving can&#x27;t handle it, no thanks from this driver.')
