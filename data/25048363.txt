Until that stops, the docs will stay piss-poor.<p>While I have often used a Mac for development and enjoyed it, I don&#x27;t often actually develop anything for macOS or iOS because, well, why would I risk my livelihood on Apple&#x27;s whim?  They regularly destroy developer&#x27;s lives with no thought or consequence.')
