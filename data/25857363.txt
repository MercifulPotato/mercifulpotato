It&#x27;s a big number but if 10k people listen 100 times that&#x27;s not huge.<p>Good music is typically listened to multiple times - if you really like a song and you listen 3 times a day you&#x27;re at 90 listens in a month already.<p>That&#x27;s probably not sustainable but you start to see how 1 million is impressive but also quite achievable.')
