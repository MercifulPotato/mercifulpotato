He achieved a huge amount in his life, and his time&#x2F;role at Reddit seems minor compared to other things he did.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;reddit.com&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1octb&#x2F;reddit_cofounder_aaron_swartz_discusses_how_he&#x2F;c1oewi&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;reddit.com&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1octb&#x2F;reddit_co...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;reddit.com&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1octb&#x2F;reddit_cofounder_aaron_swartz_discusses_how_he&#x2F;c1ofbk&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;reddit.com&#x2F;comments&#x2F;1octb&#x2F;reddit_co...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Christopher_Slowe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Christopher_Slowe</a>')
