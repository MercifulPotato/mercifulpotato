And I became a biologist. I can tell you it never stops to be amazing. For example after your jaw has dropped after you realized all cells have the same DNA, imagine where your jaw goes when you learn the implication of every cell having 2 meters of DNA! And the right parts are always accessible to the right cell at the right time. It&#x27;s beautiful.<p>Over time I learned that if you can imagine some process, it&#x27;s likely you&#x27;ll find it somewhere in biology (keep the laws of physics in mind though ;)).')
