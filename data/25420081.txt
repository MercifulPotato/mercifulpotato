If I lived somewhere close enough to have deserted woods (where there could be multiple cabins with trails) within a 20 or 30 minutes drive I think that implies a low cost of land.<p>If that&#x27;s true my first priority would be to have either a house big enough for a separate office or even enough land to have an office shack or floor above my garage. A separate work cabin that involves a commute doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to me.<p>It&#x27;s okay if you just didn&#x27;t go into detail but I don&#x27;t see anything about a kitchen, and the remote location kinda implies there isn&#x27;t anywhere nearby to get food. Nothing nearby is totally okay as long as I have somewhere to make or at least reheat food. Firepits aren&#x27;t enough if they&#x27;re the only method of cooking because it can be pretty gnarly outside and I don&#x27;t want making lunch every day to involve making a fire, dealing with rain, and getting smoky.')
