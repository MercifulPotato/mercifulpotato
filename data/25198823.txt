C&#x27;mon.<p>If I could find my electronics elsewhere and for a reasonable price, I would choose that but I can&#x27;t.

How can individuals work on the next generation robots, electronics, whatever if you can&#x27;t even get decent micro controllers and brushless motors in india?<p>And it&#x27;s not like big <i>indian</i> companies aren&#x27;t selling data back to china.
