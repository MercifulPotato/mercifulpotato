Still, the article seems to showcase some questionable points about the AGRA initiative.<p>The whole idea of introducing IP law for seeds to improve yields then show a 17% increase, just like the baseline, seems a monumental mistake.<p>The fertilizer situation is questionable too. If they put so many conditions then they should also guarantee some outputs. Otherwise there&#x27;s no risk for them, only the farmers. But I grant you that whole section seems a bit shallow.<p>You set a pretty high bar to criticise such huge initiatives. They can fail based on the externalities they create, not only as a model that guarantees an output given some assumptions.')
