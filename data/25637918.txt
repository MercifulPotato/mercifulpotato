There&#x27;s a lot of smart people who can think these things out, and do so for fun or professionally.<p>I guess we&#x27;re lucky the amount of smart people who actually pull things off is quite low, almost close to zero percentage points world population wise. At least in the west.<p>I personally think the worse one in recent American history, besides 9&#x2F;11 was the Las Vegas concert shooting. All that took was a half smart guy who operated alone, had plenty of personal resources, critically didn&#x27;t tell anyone (OPSEC) mostly because he was already a loner, and also critically didn&#x27;t have any exit plan. What&#x27;s interesting about that one too is there was no clear motive either - at least none has come out in the years since the shootings.')
