Nobody really knew anything about the virus at the time, except China, and the lied about it...but orange man bad.<p>He was also being impeached at the time and the Democrats were too busy with this to care about the potential spread of Covid-19.<p>He also talked about hydroxychloroquine, which his doctor was using at the time as a preventative measure for Covid-19.<p>Was it a cure?  No (he never said it was), but Doctors were taking it at the time and many were still were taking it before the vaccine.<p>Because everything Trump said is bad, it was equated with junk science and possibly lead to the deaths of many more people.<p>&quot;If he really wanted to, what stopped him? He was clearly fully capable of closing borders, given that he did close the border to China (too late) and Europe (also too late). Where was the closure to South Korea when the virus was spiking there?&quot;<p>Right.  He could easily just make decisions without the Democrats using everything in their power to stop him.  Where have you been the last 4 years?<p>Again, The WHO was warned about this back in December from Taiwan officials.<p>Trump has been stopped from making decisions every step of the way from the Democrats and then Demonized in the press (which spread false information to the masses).<p>You really can&#x27;t then blame him for making the wrong decision.')
