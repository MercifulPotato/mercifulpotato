If you create and submit small PRs and git-squash those PRs into the main branch, you&#x27;ll get the best of both worlds.<p>FWIW, the way I use git results in me committing <i>a lot</i>. I treat it as, essentially a save point that I can undo to if I need to. The history for my personal branches is a mess of broken tests and false-starts on code paths that just aren&#x27;t going to work. Useless for anyone but me (but fantastic for giving me an hour-by-hour breakdown of what I&#x27;ve been working on and what attempts I&#x27;ve made).')
