Unity still has a lot of very important features that are or were in Beta or unfinished state for a very long time, at least until very recently. DOTS, SRP and HDRP, to give a few examples [1]. If I strictly follow your advice I would have to virtually stick with features from 2015. Thanks, but no thanks.<p>These problems with Unity have been going on for about 5 years and the official line by their team is that &quot;we&#x27;re rewriting stuff and it&#x27;s going to be great, but in the meantime just wait&quot;.<p>--<p><i>&gt; Again, where are these breaking features &quot;all the time&quot;?</i><p><i>&gt; Don&#x27;t build your software, on other software, hoping to blindly chase every major release painlessly</i><p>So, you&#x27;re saying that there aren&#x27;t many breaking changes and updating is easy, but at the same time saying that people shouldn&#x27;t even think about updating an engine mid-project because it&#x27;s reckless?<p>Sorry, but you can&#x27;t have it both ways.<p>Notice how you&#x27;re blaming users for everything here: they can&#x27;t update because it&#x27;s hard, but at the same time we can&#x27;t complain that it&#x27;s hard because Unity is great and doesn&#x27;t have many breaking changes. Also there&#x27;s some whataboutism going on when you mention that Unreal and Monogame. This doesn&#x27;t matter since them both don&#x27;t have the crazy update schedule that Unity has where a major-upgrade is released every now and then.<p>--<p>[1] And btw I fully expect an answer like like &quot;Oh but you&#x27;re not up to date on those, feature X has been finished in version XXXX.X, you just haven&#x27;t upgraded yet&quot;. Well, guess what, there are breaking changes and I can&#x27;t easily upgrade.')
