I was recently helping a family member troubleshoot their over quota Google Photo backup, originally setup for full quality, since I thought 15GB was enough for life time. Was surprised to find they shot close to 60GB worth random shit in the last few years after putting them on my One family circle. I guess explosion in camera sensors and high res recording is making a lot of croft.<p>I think Google should start throwing some deduplication photos in Google Feeds everyday, help them clear up some space and help users clear up their gallery which is often filled with so much useless shit that it&#x27;s hard to use. There&#x27;s something about physical film where each shot was precious and developing photo came with it&#x27;s own sorting &#x2F; curation process. Online photo are pretty tedious viewing experience compared to physical albums, I know a lot of people who practice inbox zero but virtually no one who keeps their online photos kempt.')
