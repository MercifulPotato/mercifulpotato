Furthermore they are happy to tell you that their products, like Google Cloud Platform, are &quot;Secured by Titan&quot; but not which Titan [2].<p>This is frustrating because the Titan M is an absolutely brilliant device, with some real advancements to normalize embedded security, including an SPI interposer to monitor communications (a real leap forward) - and should not at all be conflated with a generic, whitelabeled, non-hsm product that makes no claims whatsoever and has been broken at least twice before [3] [4]. The Titan C is an even bigger improvement over the Titan M but not in anyway they care to disclose which may or may not indicate weaknesses in Titan M [5]. Likewise, OpenTitan[6] is crashing through barriers others didn&#x27;t even know were there in establishing verifiable silicon roots of trust but is ambiguously different than Titan M because of various foundry and PDK issues which may be as innocuous as having to run the chips through at different process sizes but who knows because while OpenTitan is verifiable; Titan M&#x2F;C aren&#x27;t.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duo.com&#x2F;decipher&#x2F;hack-the-titan-m-get-usd1-million" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;duo.com&#x2F;decipher&#x2F;hack-the-titan-m-get-usd1-million</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;products&#x2F;gcp&#x2F;titan-in-depth-security-in-plaintext" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cloud.google.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;products&#x2F;gcp&#x2F;titan-in-depth-se...</a><p>[3] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hexview.com&#x2F;~scl&#x2F;titan&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hexview.com&#x2F;~scl&#x2F;titan&#x2F;</a> - note the migration from the NXP A7005a to A7005c<p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engadget.com&#x2F;2019-05-15-google-recalls-some-titan-bluetooth-security-keys.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.engadget.com&#x2F;2019-05-15-google-recalls-some-tita...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;showcase.withgoogle.com&#x2F;titan-c&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;showcase.withgoogle.com&#x2F;titan-c&#x2F;</a><p>[6] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opentitan.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;opentitan.org&#x2F;</a>')
