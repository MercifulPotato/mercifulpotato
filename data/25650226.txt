There is a tertiary effect from potential lawsuits, but those are almost impossible to price into a business model.<p>If your bro culture allows you to succeed over your competitors at the cost of a million dollar lawsuit a decade down the road then it probably doesn&#x27;t make economic sense to change the culture.
