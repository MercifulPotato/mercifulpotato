If it conforms to Chinese government behaviour then these are extremely public and predominantly well compensated rural labour transfer programs occuring in other provinces that alleviates poverty for 10s of millions every year. If it&#x27;s anything like Chinese tech (it&#x27;s not) then they would be extremely well compensated and overworked relative to rest of society.

That should be the default assumption when treating these analysis, especially when they contradict each other i.e. Zenz estimates of millions detained is based off fanciful estimate of 1,200 camps... GIS analysis found only ~300, but the same analysis that essentially debunks Zenz will still blindly reaffirm his claims.<p>It&#x27;s manufactured consent. The implication is reality is worse than CCP purports but better than US funded analysis alleges, especially considering ongoing geopolitical tensions.
