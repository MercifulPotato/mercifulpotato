The problem is a lot less constrained if you have access to compute shaders (ie WebGPU), otherwise it looks a lot like RAVG (Nehab and Hoppe) and you have kinda nasty branching and memory access patterns in the fragment shader, plus still having to do coarse rasterization on CPU.<p>One of the operational challenges here is that the renderer would likely be a one-off, as the requirements are just so different than most other clients of a 2D rendering engine.<p>There&#x27;s been a bit of discussion on #gpu on xi.zulipchat.com. I consider this an interesting problem but can&#x27;t really justify spending time on Flash-specific features myself.')
