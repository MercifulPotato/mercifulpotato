Item(by='bestorworse', descendants=None, kids=[25349712], score=None, time=1607451628, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25348387, text='I see it as better way of developing a product. Or actually, a <i>foundational system</i>, if Fuchsia really ends up becoming something like that. You see, lots of things that today are fundamental were just &quot;developed organically&quot;, and that is OK because people never tought that it would end up being what it is.<p>Besides, a greater part of the cruft we have today is rooted in the development model companies adopt that is &quot;develop it, make it work, and ship so not to delay the schedule&#x2F;budget so much&quot;. And that is OK too given that companies just want to develop a <i>product</i> and don&#x27;t have lots of time, budget and resources... But, as things are in software engineering, that model doesn&#x27;t produce as good a piece of software as it would with more iterations and refactoring seeking the best software model and implementation. In the end, that results in greater issues issues than what was really needed and the backward compatibility hinders an actual solution. But Fuchsia being meant as a foundation, cannot be developed like that. Like a product that &quot;just works&quot;. It would end up being just another bad designed (and chances are, bad implemented too) system based on concepts of the beginnings of computer industry that doesn&#x27;t necessarily apply for today&#x27;s systems.<p>As I&#x27;ve loosely accompanied Fuchsia&#x27;s development, they&#x27;ve done a lot of early bring up work just so that other parts of the system could be developed. And that is expected because they developed arguably almost everything from scratch. You cant expect ending up with really great system design <i>and</i> implementation just from these first iterations. Then, with the experiences from that, they&#x27;ve done lots of refactorings that refined system&#x27;s abstractions, APIs and implementation. And, if they are serious about Fuchsia being a good foundational system, they have to solve these left over from the early development.')
