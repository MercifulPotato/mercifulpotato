ALH84001 is actually some pretty good evidence for fossilized Martian life.<p>What happened though was that they went public early with too little information, because they were worried about being scooped in the media. When they got asked questions that they didn’t have answers to, the result started to look like it was on shaky grounds. The opinion was formed that it was a bad result. After that it was pretty hard to get anyone to pay attention after that. Follow-on results pretty much confirmed the original result though.<p>(Astrobiology was my field ~10 years ago.)')
