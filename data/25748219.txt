I wasn&#x27;t aware of anything involving Parler&#x27;s lawyers.<p>Your first comment was responding to someone talking about AWS, Apple, and Google dropping Parler.  The discussion was around the right of lawyers to drop clients, clients being so toxic that no one is willing to represent them, legal counsel as a right, and the ramifications of a client being unable to secure counsel.<p>No one was talking about mass harassment but you.<p>&gt; I&#x27;ve had to ignore about 80% of your comments because they are just diversions.<p>You&#x27;re trying to argue something completely out of context.  That 80% of comments you&#x27;re ignoring are about the topic at hand.')
