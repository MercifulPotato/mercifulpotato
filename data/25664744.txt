Don&#x27;t questions their choices.  Don&#x27;t do it any other way.  Lock yourself into their good choices.<p>Their choices turn out not to be great for your use case?  Fuck off.<p>Compounded by the fact that Rails is currently in the same death spiral dotnet was before scrapping everything and releasing dotnet core - Rails is great in v1.  Rails is much less great in v6, where documentation is shoddy, splintered across versions, there are 5 ways to do anything, but god help you if you don&#x27;t know the most recent incantation.  Memorize all of our conventions, but hey - best practices have changed like 6 times in the last 10 years, so our conventions from yesteryear don&#x27;t apply, and no, we won&#x27;t update our documentation and stack overflow answers are bad&#x2F;outdated.<p>Basically - Coming in from all sorts of other languages and frameworks I&#x27;ve used in prod (Golang, Dotnet, Dotnet Core, Node, Ts-Node, Rails, PHP, etc) Rails is currently sitting in my shitlist.')
