But yes, in general it’s a nightmare especially with ping executables that don’t report timeouts at all.<p>This is a great example of one of the failings of the UNIX model. You can’t really parse the ping output across distributions easily, it’s built for humans to consume and until recently didn’t even report timeouts to stdout. Not to mention needing to invoke “ping6” for ipv6, which I need to add support for.<p>However it’s the best way to do this without needing to run gping and root.')
