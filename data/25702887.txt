The responses from Benjamin Black and Peter Voshall are correct.<p>We definitely were on DEC Tru64 at this time. Sun was running the big databases like ACB. I recall worries that obidos might not be able to build in a few months time so the engineer with the little corgi (Erik?) spiked out a linux build and then it was linux pizza boxes as quickly as we could build them.<p>We built CMF and other things to handle mass provisioning but it was chaotic for quite a while. I don&#x27;t recall anyone talking about what would later become AWS in those days.')
