In contrast to patents and the patent system (where inventors disclose the invention, so all of society benefits after the patent expires), the laws protecting trade secrets seems about the most undemocratic mechanism&#x2F;phenomenon I’ve come across.<p>I’m honestly struggling to come up with valid reasons to justify it.<p>Won’t we look back in 100 years and laugh at the insanity of what is essentially violently-enforced ‘privatized knowledge’, enabled by our punitive justice system (being able to put other humans in jail for ‘theft’ of trade secrets)?')
