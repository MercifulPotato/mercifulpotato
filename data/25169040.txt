The ability to transform serial compiled languages to run atop an async engine is great.<p>The examples, though, remind me more of Go routines and CSP rather than actors. They appear to be passing channels around to communicate which is very similar to but different than a mailbox open to any other process. Is that just a temporary approach? One of the best aspects of BEAM is OTP and supervision trees (linking processes) alongside flexible process naming. I&#x27;m not sure how channels would mesh with that. Granted this looks early stage and maybe you&#x27;re planning on building mailboxes or process links or similar.<p>Also, you might consider providing support for a binary message passing format like Message Pack or CBOR. Excited to see where Lunatic progresses!')
