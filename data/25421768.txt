I still think my cigar habit is not the healthiest. I only do about 2 to 4 a month. However i will agree that the &quot;tobacco studies&quot; are done on the chemical cocktail cigarettes. With the vast range of just shit they put it in, it&#x27;s not hard to believe they cause cancer. But a fermented leaf cigar that&#x27;s only bound with rice glue or whatever that other plant glue is, I think becomes similar to the difference of road safety between vehicles. Theres a chart I recently saw on transportation deaths per 1 billion passenger miles traveled. It was like .7 for planes, 1.5 for trains, 10 for cars and 200+ for motorcycles. To me, cigarettes are the motorcycles, cigars are the cars and the plane is being a nonsmoker, mostly because nonsmokers still get lung&#x2F;throat cancer. I haven&#x27;t seen a study on just cigar or pipe tobacco. Only on cigarettes, which again, I&#x27;m super against. Not defending Marlboro or the ilk. But I won&#x27;t be blind that there isn&#x27;t an increased risk in both me smoking cigars along with drinking alcohol. Im just mitigating my risk taking with both moderation and overall danger factor.<p>Damn it, this was a can of worms response...<p>Anyways, got a recommendation for someone that enjoys Alec Bradley Black Markets? Im looking to try something new out of left field soon.')
