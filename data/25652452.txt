That license is just for one location.<p>There&#x27;s also dedicated &quot;held back for sharing&quot; spectrum in the N77 5G band (3.8 to 4.2 GHz), which is more widely usable without detailed coordination (but you still need a low cost license)<p>With modern spectrum access systems (see CBRS for example), geolocation of the radio is used to determine via a coordination server what spectrum can be used in a given location. Whether that&#x27;s at risk of suppressing dissent or not is another discussion however - most radios in cellular networks will have some kind of backhaul and coordination management plane for interference avoidance and management - the threat model in cellular technology is a bit different still, and the communications are there to enable spectrum requests to be made in real-time. Spectrum coordination wouldn&#x27;t need to be done by government - there&#x27;s conceivable ways to do sensing and avoidance, but at the risk of tragedy of the commons scenarios.')
