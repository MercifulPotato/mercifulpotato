Reasonable people can disagree about these things.<p>EDIT: Sorry, a bit of a rambly post, too tired and emotional to rephrase.<p>I will say, though, that &quot;fundamental networking and caching issues&quot; sounds very... weasel-wordy, if you see what I mean? It&#x27;s not very concrete about what the actual problems you might experience would be. (Yes, latency and huge numbers of requests are issues, but is it really an issue until you get big enough?)<p>Almost all successful applications in existence until about 2018 (or so? Not sure exactly when GraphQL was invented) has done just about fine. If we&#x27;re talking about a brand new <i>type</i> of application which couldn&#x27;t have been done without it, then fine. If not... well, we&#x27;re not talking about technical limitations.<p>I truly do see the appeal of GraphQL for developers, and <i>especially</i> the fast decoupled iteration that it enables, at least theoretically. The thing is that when you need more data on the client, you still have to add that data on the server... <i>somewhere</i>. It&#x27;s great that the client can choose the overall &quot;shape&quot; of the data, but that doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of the data not actually being on the server.')
