(I&#x27;m eyeballing that &quot;40%&quot; characterization.)<p>In Italy, for example, 230 minutes of the day is spent on housework, shopping, care work, and &quot;volunteering&quot;. That&#x27;s more than the 204 minutes in India or 179 minutes in China and <i>far</i> more than the 149 minutes per day spent in Italy on paid work.<p>And at least part of those four categories is unpaid work.<p>I single out Italy, which is an outlier, because I recall reading things like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2014&#x2F;mar&#x2F;07&#x2F;italian-campaigners-housewives-paid-salary" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;world&#x2F;2014&#x2F;mar&#x2F;07&#x2F;italian-campai...</a> :<p>&gt; Italian campaigners call for housewives to be paid a salary ...<p>&gt; But a prominent pair of campaigners in Italy, a country with an estimated 5 million casalinghe (housewives), a moribund jobs market and a lingering patriarchal culture, this week threw their weight behind an eye-catching proposal they say would boost equality and fight domestic abuse: a salary for women working in the home. ...<p>&gt; &quot;I want to destroy this great prejudice that says: &#x27;I am the one who earns; you have nothing,&#x27;&quot; she said, adding that women who chose to work at home should be rewarded, not humiliated. &quot;They must not be considered B-list citizens,&quot; she said<p>This &quot;ourworldindata&quot; site continues with this prejudice by only considering &quot;paid work&quot; as &quot;work&quot;.<p>If unpaid work is included as work, then China&#x27;s 315 minutes of paid work + (56 + 123) of unpaid work = 494 minutes.<p>While the US&#x27;s 251 minutes of paid work + (96 + 122) of unpaid work = 469 minutes. That&#x27;s only 25 minutes less. (And most of that extra time in the US is spent on &quot;TV &amp; Radio&quot;.)')
