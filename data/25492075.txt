Instead of capitalizing on their existing userbase by making <i>better</i> machines that were also <i>compatible</i> with the currently popular model, they alienated their fans by making incompatible or barely-improved crap that nobody asked for: the ZX Spectrum 128, with just slightly more memory and a music chip but still using horrible graphics and tape storage, the QL, the Commodore 128...<p>The masters of both Sinclair and Commodore were tone deaf suit-zombies with no clue about the zeitgeist, no idea what gamers, the majority of their users, really wanted. Most of them were people who couldn&#x27;t afford to run multiple computers (only having 1 TV or computer desk to spare) or part with their existing software library for minimal benefits.<p>On the other hand you had consoles like the NES and SNES, which offered enough new features and came after a long enough time for people to not mind the incompatibility.')
