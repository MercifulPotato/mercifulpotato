I mean, the prices were elevated before it got to this. Seems like a situation of let&#x27;s ride the free customer acquisition and figure it out later.<p>They happily took the huge influx of new users that had no knowledge of this. And many got screwed. They couldn&#x27;t average down on their position. And a ton of buyers were removed. So the price got out of control. Many panicked because of it.<p>I&#x27;m not on RH but added more at 170 and it came with several partial fills of 1 and 2 stocks. That was RH users getting screwed as a ton of buyers were removed. Trading was not halted on the downward spiral.<p>They could have said - hey guess what - 750k RH users (whatever it is) that own GME cannot buy this stock, so consider this before you sell. Some kind of warning that passed the attorneys. How could they not see this coming?<p>Any way it went down - RH is done. I hope they &quot;pivot&quot; into a worse situation.')
