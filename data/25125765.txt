The problem of mapping a business domain to computing structures isn&#x27;t unique to OOP.<p>Yes, I agree in theory. What I meant to say is that many concepts don&#x27;t map to physical objects.<p>&gt; In this case, I&#x27;m slightly gobsmacked that no-one pointed out that an employee is not their job. The contract of employment is a separate domain concept.<p>This is what I mean by flamewars. Your solution sounds good, but there are other people on this same thread still arguing that it makes perfect sense for an employee to fire itself.')
