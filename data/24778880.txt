From signing the poll book to dropping ballot in the box. Avg 21 minutes, for both paper and electronic (no significant difference). For a moderately sized general election ballot (~40 issues and races).<p>Election administrators absolutely know these timings, how to properly do capacity planning. Whether they admit it or not.<p>--<p>In my jurisdiction, dropping off a ballot is trivial. It&#x27;s just a box. Drive or walk up. Open safety door. Drop the ballot.<p>I read that Texas requires proper identification to drop off ballots. And prohibits 3rd party help, eg wife cannot deliver husband&#x27;s ballot. (I can&#x27;t imagine any scenario where that extraneous step is merited.) So factor in the actual time &amp; motion data per jursidiction. Because as we know, every jurisdiction insists on doing their own thing, independent of all other considerations.')
