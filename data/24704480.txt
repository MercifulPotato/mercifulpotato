Item(by='rlander', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602035081, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24700508, text='Why I choose Erlang:<p>- simpler syntax: there’s no Erlang program that you can’t read after getting comfortable with the language. Seriously. Go read OTP source or Ryaks, everything is extremely clear and explicit. To me, easier to read also means less bugs.<p>- It’s so different from other languages that, IMO, it makes it easier to “think in Erlang”; the syntax fits so well the semantics that I find it easier to think in terms of processes,  patterns and the ocasional recursion when switching from other language (most Erlangers are polyglots IME).<p>*Edit: Reliable network services (Erlangs sweet spot) are much easier to write and maintain when written in a clear and explicit way. I love macros (consider myself a lisper actually) but I think they’re the wrong tool when writing bullet proof network servers (macros are basically everywhere in Elixir).')
