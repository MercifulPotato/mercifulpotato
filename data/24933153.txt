Many people are very unsatisfied with this site for tech&#x2F;developers.  Often one looks great but once started development it is bad.  I have not being developing about half of time as the parent thread author.  However, all what he said sounds true!!<p>I never used a site to find work, always through network or colleagues.  They tend to know my capabilities best. Head hunters are horrible people for tech.  Buzz word and framework doesn&#x27;t mean a thing. If you a good developer you can figure out how to do anything! It is how you thing and how you understand stuff and how to solve problems that counts.')
