Licensed taxis in Santa Clara county are hard to get reliably outside of the airport and train station. Otherwise, you call a number and someone says a car is coming, and 80% of the time a car does come; the other 20% of the time, you don&#x27;t get to the airport on time. Yes, it doesn&#x27;t take much to drive someone somewhere, but if hypothetically Waymo drives Uber and Lyft out of business and then drops out themselves, VCs will have learned that the unlicensed taxi business is a waste of money, and we&#x27;d be back to licensed taxis, which is a lot lower quality of service.')
