I still use my Sony Z3 Compact tablet.  It is thin, waterproof, supports a SIM and SD card.  I have never found a good replacement, though I&#x27;d like to.  I mostly use it for reading ebooks and Pocket and RSS feeds so it handles the tasks well, but no upgrades, eventually it will need a new battery and now I see root certs are built in guaranteed obsolescence (like on the iPod touch).  Unfortunately I can&#x27;t find any high quality Android tablets as manufacturers have relegated Android tablets to the price sensitive consumer demographic.  And iPad mini isn&#x27;t waterproof.<p>It also works well with older Bluetooth BLE devices that won&#x27;t connect with my newer Android phones.')
