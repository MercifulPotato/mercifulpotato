Item(by='gurjeet', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605380770, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25093842, text='Definition of clickbait [1] (emphasis mine): something (such as a headline) designed to make readers want to click on a hyperlink especially <i>when the link leads to content of dubious value</i> or interest.<p>The title of the article matches the content, so, no, it wasn&#x27;t a clickbait. Also, if the title was really a clickbait, someone would have surely called it out before my gripe about the title change. In fact, 2 others complained about the title change before I posted my top-level comment; those others&#x27; complaints and my responses are now buried under the &quot;More&quot; link at the end of this page.<p>I understand you, @baby, have good intentions, but I take offense to @bzb6&#x27;s remarks. I guess that&#x27;s what I get for responding to a recently created account (41 days ago) with no posts and all of whose comments are one-liners; mostly knee-jerk reactions, no insights, and not considering the nuances of the real-world implications.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.merriam-webster.com&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;clickbait" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.merriam-webster.com&#x2F;dictionary&#x2F;clickbait</a>')
