It used to rely on a home-grown build tool, but making our builds both fast and modern took the time of multiple full-time engineers. Webpack isn&#x27;t &quot;fast&quot; like Rust is fast, and it&#x27;s not old enough to be as well-documented or understandable as I&#x27;d wish, but:<p>1. it is flexible enough to fit all of our weird edge cases.<p>2. it has a really solid community of people working on it.<p>3. it made adopting new features like TypeScript extremely simple for us.<p>I don&#x27;t see us upgrading from 4 to 5 eagerly (at least until it&#x27;s been production-proven), but I&#x27;m excited about this release, and I love all the hard work that&#x27;s gone into it. Congrats to the team â€” it&#x27;s no small feat.<p>Edit: formatting')
