Honestly &quot;fizzbuzz&quot; is short hand for &quot;eliminate the set of people who apply for every coding job, but have no ability to code, or can only just take existing code and twist it about&quot;<p>(this last I used to think was laziness, but I think there is an ability to execute code in your head that is necessary - and if you can&#x27;t do that then making any changes to a code base is scary because you cannot reason about it.)<p>Do I use fizzbuzz anymore? No because it has been years since I have had to go &quot;out to market&quot; - but if I am interviewing you then I will have checked you pass this - reading your code, talking to co workers.
