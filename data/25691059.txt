Seriously, it&#x27;s that simple. Don&#x27;t spam us with links and tell us to &quot;look at the evidence&quot;. That&#x27;s what the courts are for.<p>If Trump is <i>so</i> certain that he&#x27;s right, he should say all he&#x27;s saying under oath. Surely he&#x27;s brave enough to do that right?<p>You can choose to believe in shadowy conspiracies of &quot;Democrat officials&quot; and &quot;left-leaning Republicans&quot;. That&#x27;s your right. But compared to that complex story, &quot;liar continues lying&quot; is far more likely.')
