I don&#x27;t like the JetBrains Mono as much in the interface but in the actual IDE it works nicely for me.<p>I really liked Consolas in the example but it&#x27;s not free so there&#x27;s that.<p>What I didn&#x27;t get is why the syntax highlighting option is so limited. Java didn&#x27;t work for me at all even though it&#x27;s in the dropdwon.<p>I also didn&#x27;t understand why the width of the code area so artificially limited.')
