Now I still like money, but each additional dollar is starting to show diminishing marginal utility. Though of course I&#x27;m still trying to grow my net worth, it&#x27;s no longer the main focus of my life, especially now that I&#x27;m &quot;retired&quot; from my main career at least. I split my time between gaming, running, reading, socializing and working on my trading bot (got rich the old fashioned way of saving my salary, the bot is for fun and to grow hopefully faster than SPX with better Sharpe ratio, so far so good).<p>I think while you don&#x27;t have &quot;FU money&quot; it&#x27;s important for money to be the main focus of your life. You don&#x27;t have freedom if you don&#x27;t have a lot of money and you can&#x27;t be 100% happy without freedom, at least in my experience, though I know opinions vary here.')
