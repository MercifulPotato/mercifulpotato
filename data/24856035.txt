We have had specialized roles for the entire history of society and it hasn&#x27;t caused anything to crumble.<p>I&#x27;m not a historian but I can imagine that a medieval specialist, such as for example blacksmith, could very much fix his own house (or maybe even build a new one), grow food, take care of animals, make wooden tools, make some simple herbal medicine etc. I&#x27;m guessing a lot of he was consuming was produced by himself and his family. Today, for engineers it&#x27;s the total opposite - we only consume things produced by others, and essentially by strangers whom we&#x27;ve never met.<p>Regarding fragility specifically, if a major crisis comes (say a war), the desk jockeys, esp. ones didn&#x27;t have the wisdom to accumulate resources, will fare much worse than someone who&#x27;s say running a homestead. If they did accumulate resources (provided they don&#x27;t become worthless by hiperinflation etc.), they will be able to buy the essentials and hope their stash lasts until the end of the crisis.')
