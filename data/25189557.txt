Some prejudices, we&#x27;re generally more sensitized that they&#x27;re unfair to individuals, and harmful, and mentioning them is taboo.  Other prejudices, we aren&#x27;t as aware of, and still voice openly, even though we could see that reinforces&#x2F;perpetuates prejudice that unfairly affects individuals.<p>Again, prejudice against people doing gov&#x27;t work isn&#x27;t the worst injustice in the world, but it&#x27;s unfair to individuals, and also would seem to discourage many people from going into gov&#x27;t work that affects society as a whole, and so this prejudice seems a problem to address.')
