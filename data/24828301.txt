Maybe it&#x27;s just the case that disruption is needed every decade or two to keep things fresh and interesting.<p>Anyone who has dipped a toe into modern frontend web development and hasn&#x27;t stayed for long enough to drink the kool-aid knows that it&#x27;s a shitshow. You need a toolchain a mile long just to get some basic stuff on the screen, a far cry from the easy learning curve (lol!) of Perl outputting HTML via cgi-bin in your home directory 20 years ago. Okay, sure, you have access to a lot of visually pretty things now, but ultimately a lot of that could have been implemented at the browser level by exposing primitives that were more useful right from the start, rather than downloading a few megs of Javascript to emulate a reasonable environment on top of an unreasonable one.<p>Remember the 1.44MB QNX magical floppy disk demo? Entire OS and a Javascript-capable web browser in less space than it takes to visit the average corporate homepage now. <i>Something is wrong here</i>. I don&#x27;t think there has to be a tradeoff where the programming languages become insanely difficult for average developers in order to use less space, either; it&#x27;s not like modern JS is particularly easy.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.red-lang.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.red-lang.org&#x2F;</a> is something in the right direction. The language itself looks a little confusing still, but I love the idea of a small binary that can run it and produce decent GUIs out the other end. We need to revisit the basic assumptions and produce something that can still be extremely performant on hardware that is 15 years old, imo, so that our modern machines become extremely powerful again.')
