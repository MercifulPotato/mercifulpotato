Your analogy maps precisely, in which case it&#x27;s no simpler than arguing about the original thing.<p>2. Your analogy is imperfect, in which case your conclusions are suspect.<p>Case #2 is most common, and the argument usually continues by proposing a different analogy. Now you&#x27;re arguing about the merits of your analogies, rather than about the topic itself.<p>Analogy can be a good pedagogical tool, highlighting some aspects of the problem, and giving you an intuitive way to connect to them. But eventually the analogy always breaks, and now you&#x27;ve got to un-learn the analogy before re-learning the reality.<p>Formal systems aren&#x27;t arguments, they&#x27;re assumptions. As long as the assumptions hold, the formal systems are useful. If there&#x27;s anything to argue about, that&#x27;s a limitation of their utility.')
