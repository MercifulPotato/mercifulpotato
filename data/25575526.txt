There&#x27;s even more violent media available. From news broadcasts to internet forum posts to books. Perhaps violent video games aren&#x27;t particularly worse at that than all of the other media that portray violence? The news tends to have stories that are more gruesome than the things that happen in video games. The violence in video games is usually toned down or limited.')
