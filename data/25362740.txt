The point is that it&#x27;s possible to use other push services on Android and has been done, just like it is possible to use Tor on Android. There is no reason that AOSP itself needs to implement Tor any more than Windows or AOSP needs to provide a push API. Both are possible to implement on top of the platform and have been implemented on top of the platform.<p>This is unlike iOS, which is the real broken platform.')
