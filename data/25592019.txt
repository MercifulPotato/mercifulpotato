I&#x27;d even venture far and say that If someone were to build a modern browser for plan 9, I&#x27;d want it built inside of inferno out of pieces connected and isolated via 9p&#x2F;namespaces and ran as an application (and bare metal on a tablet).  Dis is similar to WASM so you deliver web apps as actual applications. Done.<p>Too bad it&#x27;s stuck with hard coded 32 bit dependency. It also cant build on 64 bit systems unless they have 32bit compat (windows&#x2F;linux win here). There&#x27;s a fork maintained by some 9front users called Purgatorio. Charles Forsyth also still pokes at it and just added Risc-V support. It&#x27;s not dead, just resting. Patches welcome.')
