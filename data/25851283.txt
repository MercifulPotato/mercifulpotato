They sound good, but they feel like cheap plastic, they require an amp to drive them, they have a 1&#x2F;4&quot; jack and need an adapter etc.<p>Nothing here would make a consumer of high-end audio disregard the HD650. In fact, most of these consumers either own an amplifier, or have accepted the fact that amplifiers are needed for certain audio listening needs, so what would be the issue?<p>&gt; I think AirPods Max will end up replacing a lot of this premium market because they&#x27;re almost as good and they categorically win the other bits (wireless, easy sync with apple devices, nice build, etc.)<p>What I&#x27;m reading here is a disconnection between what &quot;high-end audio&quot; means to you, compared to what it actually means to the average audiophile.<p>That average audiophile may or may not buy into the AirPods Max, to fill the need for portable, good sounding headphones. Or they may go for Bose, or Bower and Wilkins, or Bang &amp; Olufsen. But these all belong to a different category in the audio world, compared to high-end HIFIMAN or Sennheiser.<p>In short, I can guarantee that the folks already rocking a McIntosh and a pair of expensive HIFIMAN, are not going to replace them for the AirPods Max. They are just not in the same league.')
