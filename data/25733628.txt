You&#x27;re doing that and then dismissing the entire issue because of it, which is intellectually dishonest, which you already know.<p>You <i>aren&#x27;t</i> giving the same treatment to the the other side here -- you&#x27;re not saying &quot;if keeping people safe means the police should be allowed to murder folks &#x2F; bludgeoning a police officer to death when storming the capitol&quot; so I find it difficult to believe you&#x27;re merely concerned about the use of violence.<p>You did, several comments up, state &quot;the assault on the capitol was an unprecedented attack on democracy,&quot; which it was, but that&#x27;s after posting multiple links where you&#x27;re posting links and evidence trying to discredit the nationwide BLM protests by painting them as violent, so again, your bias is evident.')
