Why can&#x27;t you build in the green belt?<p>There are some good reasons - the negative externalities of one-off housing in the middle of nowhere are huge (I say, writing from a one-off house in the middle of Ireland), but there are some bad reasons too, like homeowners using &quot;social and affordable&quot; to concern-troll their way in to ensuring nothing actually gets built.<p>And yeah, dev salaries in the UK are shockingly low compared to the US (and Ireland for that matter, so far as I can tell) but when the supply of housing is constrained higher incomes don&#x27;t help for long. Making $250k might enable you to buy a $2 million 4 bed 2 bath near decent schools in San Jose, but give it a while and you&#x27;ll need $350k, then $450k, etc. (or remote work will break the back of the NIMBYs with any luck).')
