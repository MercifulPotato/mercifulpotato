That’s what happens when you create gatekeepers and single points of failure.<p>“Just techie on techie.”<p>Oh bless your heart, child.<p>Once again, it was the <i>techies</i> who created this mess—and were perfectly happy with it too while <i>they</i> were the ones in charge. So until technies accept and acknowledge that they <i>are</i> the root of the whole problem, they’re not going to do a thing to usefully change it. ’Cos right now they’re one gang of children trying (futilely) to grab back a prized toy from another gang of children, to have all for themselves.<p>But as long as <i>someone</i> controls the read and write, the conditions that enable these vast walled gardens to take root and thrive will continue to exist. The only way to change that is by restructuring the platform at a fundamental level so that <i>everyone</i> controls their own read and write, and no-one else can just take that from them.<p>..<p>Personally I believe the first step should be reshaping Firefox into a full-blown WYSIWYG document editor, analogous to MS Word except that instead of reading and writing to a local filesystem it reads and writes them via HTTP[S] requests. And then go sort out the stagnant mess that is Apache et al so that they actually speak HTTP right, and provide that client with the “distributed filesystem” it needs to read and write to.<p>Read-write-publish-share. Simple foundational mechanics, and there’s no reason nor excuse why it shouldn’t all work correctly.<p>(Plus, Firefox desperately needs to differentiate itself from the Chrome&#x2F;WebKit hegemony if wants to justify why it should continue to exist. Well, there’s a reason—and opportunity—right there.)<p>If geeks can make that bit work correctly then they might have a chance at resetting the balance of powr. It’s not a complete solution: there’s still the problems of document search (currently owned by Google) and name ownership (for he who owns your name owns you, and right now all our names are owned by the quasi-libertarian shakedown artists of DNS registrars and squatters), and others. And then there’s the questions of how do you sell it (and Dog knows most geeks couldn’t sell ice cream to Arabs). But it is the first step in the right direction: putting the control into the hands of the Users. <i>All</i> of them, this time.<p>--<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;WorldWideWeb" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;WorldWideWeb</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digital-archaeology.org&#x2F;the-nexus-browser&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;digital-archaeology.org&#x2F;the-nexus-browser&#x2F;</a>')
