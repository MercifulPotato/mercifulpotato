That only seems like it would be nice in a world where leadership skills and confidence are rare, and thus it&#x27;s a &quot;seller&#x27;s market&quot; for people with those skills, where people might have to settle for just picking a leader <i>because</i> they are good at leadership, regardless of whether they are wise. (Which is, admittedly, the world we live in now.)<p>However, in a world&#x2F;cultural zeitgeist where leadership and confidence are <i>commonly-cultivated attributes</i> (like conscientiousness is in today&#x27;s world: something inculcated by parents, teachers, media, etc.), <i>most</i> people would have that attribute, making <i>most</i> people potential leaders â€” and thus there would be a &quot;buyer&#x27;s market&quot; for leaders. Leadership ability could be taken as pure table-stakes, and leaders would be <i>selected</i> first-and-foremost on their wisdom&#x2F;capability&#x2F;etc.<p>It is exactly the focus of the article, taken forward, that would make such a world come to pass.')
