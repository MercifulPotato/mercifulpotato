I have a Postgres DB on the same VPS (via a Docker image), with a 10-line shell script &amp; cron job for backups to Backblaze B2 (which costs ~nothing&#x2F;month for my tiny DB).<p>Additionally, my web app is a Kotlin API and a Nuxt.js SSR server, so I think I&#x27;d have to set it up as two separate &quot;apps&quot; on this platform. That means I&#x27;d be going from $5&#x2F;mo to $25&#x2F;mo.<p>On one hand, that&#x27;s not a ton in the grand scheme of things. On the other hand, the whole reason I use DigitalOcean and self manage my infrastructure is to _not_ have to pay that kind of money for my projects with no revenue.')
