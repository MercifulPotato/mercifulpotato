C++ doesn&#x27;t even have an official ABI, nevermind having a stable one. ABI changes can and do happen in many C++ implementations (and there is no compatibility across implementations - you can&#x27;t link a library compiled with clang to one compiled with MSVC). You can&#x27;t generally expect to link together libraries compiled with different major versions of the same toolchain, though this may be supported by some toolchains.<p>Instead, Rust has defined an ABI and has committed to never breaking that ABI. Editions support API-level changes, but the ABI won&#x27;t change.')
