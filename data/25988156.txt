I agree with you: individual citizens should have the right to talk about anything, there&#x27;s free speech after all.<p>What I mean is that if you are too focused on the (truly horrible) injustices perpetrated by other countries while you consistently turn a blind eye to the injustices perpetrated by your own, then you are not being very useful.  For example, in your case, the last three US administrations have been outrageously war-mongering zealots, starting wars all over the globe, participating in the violent overthrow of several governments for petty economic interests, and routinely engaging in extra-judicial killings abroad.  While you can talk about whatever you find interesting, your critiques of China are not really going anywhere, but you could be somewhat effective in opposing the violent policies of your own democratic country.  Call your representatives!  Make them know that you don&#x27;t approve of U.S. warmongering international politics!')
