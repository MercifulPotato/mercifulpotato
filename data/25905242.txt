The natural way, as in not swimming against the tide, is to bring civility to martial conflict. Military instruction on writing may be inspirational to people who short change some pursuits of knowledge. It may also be a giant trap, led to lure the naive and adolescents to the land of I Have No Mouth and Must Scream. Please do not turn everything into a special ops mission. The real face of conflict is ugly, human degradation and slow motion suicide that spreads across generations.<p>The article mentions Churchill, who would watch movies with naval officers about Nelson and Raleigh and be moved to tears. School kids today watch movies that would make him vomit or be forever horrified. That&#x27;s a much better emotion if you are going to led a martial life. RoboCop, or Saw would be better movies to show the officers of the Royal Navy. Something that really creates horrific anger because of sadistic cruelty.<p>Instead of Nelson, may I direct everyone to one Eugene Fluckey, who after winning the Medal of Honor, demanded a return to the Pacific. His officers mandated a psychiatric assessment, which he failed, due to his novel ideas of submarine mounted rocket launchers, bombardments, boarding parties, and shore raiders. Immediately he returned to the fight and went on to build under water launched nuclear missiles. That was close to 100 years ago. With the weaponization of space, on the scale of solar systems, galaxies, maybe even everything, imagine what we can do to each other. Awful.<p>Killing other people is never a good thing. If anything should be censored, it&#x27;s this, the pursuit of the martial, as in teaching your children how to use fatal combat techniques and intelligence on one another. They get it enough. We have enough of it in the world already.')
