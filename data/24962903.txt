I have a talk (honestly not a very good one: this was my first virtual talk and I wasn&#x27;t confident in the topic and I did too much preparation on the tech and not enough on the talk; but this is the best part of the talk) at a conference recently about working from home where I spent some time using interrupting of people as a more in-depth example of cultural crosstalk in action: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;W5PlZqdMR5w" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;W5PlZqdMR5w</a>. A core thing to appreciate--and there are studies on this from the field of linguistics--is that it takes so long to begin speaking with so many muscles and so much mental effort (in the same way it takes way more time than you would expect to just move your arm, and the studies that show you had to have decided to move your arm before you &quot;thought&quot; you had) that I assure you: no one who is interacting &quot;fluently&quot; in that discussion dynamic is waiting for pauses... they are <i>anticipating</i> (likely automatically, with no conscious processing or anxiety about it) the end of someone else&#x27;s thought and are just better at the prediction or better at aborting the process if they are wrong (or imply are OK with incorrectly predicted interruptions happening occasionally and don&#x27;t take it as an embarrassing faux pas).<p>(Not in the talk, as the talk wasn&#x27;t actually about any of this, despite how much time I dedicated to it... it was about working from home.) I do feel like there is a real problem here in that we have a systemic issue (in addition to some people who are just directly assholes who don&#x27;t want to hear women speak; I 100% appreciate that these people, unfortunately, exist) where we have taught women to be subservient and to not speak up for themselves in lots of contexts, even if the pervading culture of the men around them involves a very short short turn delay, and one aspect of this is &quot;they don&#x27;t interrupt people&quot;... men <i>do</i> interrupt people, as part of simply being taught that our new information is de facto valuable, and we thereby have an advantage over women. It isn&#x27;t because we are rude: it is because we have a different dynamic ingrained in us by our (joint) surrounding culture and it is absolutely unfair and biased against women. And so we need to be cognizant of this and do it less with women and even actively &quot;make space&quot; for women to speak. But, at the same time, we should be training women <i>that interruption is ok</i> and that not only will they do better if they interrupt but the entire team might benefit from their interruption, and that being good at the predictive modeling is a conversational skill everyone must have anyway and for which there is general value if you get better.')
