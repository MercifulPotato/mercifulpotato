But that&#x27;s mostly because I never took the time to take a driving license in the new country I moved in (and the public transport being so good). However, I really miss it, if I hadn&#x27;t been so lazy with my driver license this far I&#x27;d definitely buy a car, even if I used it once a month or less (driving to work makes no sense here). Sure, it&#x27;s expensive. But you can just wake up one weekend and decide to drive to a different city, see something you haven&#x27;t seen before. Also, if you need to buy something you&#x27;re missing, you can just take your car and go comfortable. No need to wait for a bus or a train in the cold or rain. In these five years I barely left the city, but if I had a car, I think I&#x27;d have gone to many places over weekends.')
