I&#x27;m very comfortable tossing away a bunch of code with great test coverage. You can always cherry-pick it back later and know that it works.<p>(I&#x27;m not 100% purist, but certainly I&#x27;d say 80-90+% and not 66%).<p>The important thing is you should be so fast at writing testable code that getting to 80% is a like going for a light jog. If it feels like a slog, you&#x27;ve identified weaknesses in your craftmanship that you should practice.')
