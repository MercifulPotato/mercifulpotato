(As a user, you would need to calculate the “environmental score” in the calculator[2] to decide what <i>your</i> score is given whatever configuration you&#x2F;your company uses.)<p>Additionally, if some software enables privilege escalation at the OS level by misusing APIs, this escalation is not a “scope change” unless the software tried to create a separate security authority for itself by having some form of sandbox or authentication, so a vulnerability of this kind in software that has no added security mechanisms at all will be scored <i>lower</i> than a vulnerability in software which has implemented some additional access control which was bypassed.<p>I’m not saying that the limits are nonsensical since without them you’d end up with a whole lot of Critical base scores, but in my limited experience the CVSS core score is pretty worthless when it comes to getting a sense of how bad a vulnerability actually is and I don’t know how security analysts cope with this system.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.first.org&#x2F;cvss&#x2F;v3.0&#x2F;user-guide" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.first.org&#x2F;cvss&#x2F;v3.0&#x2F;user-guide</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.first.org&#x2F;cvss&#x2F;v3.0&#x2F;examples" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.first.org&#x2F;cvss&#x2F;v3.0&#x2F;examples</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.first.org&#x2F;cvss&#x2F;calculator&#x2F;3.0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.first.org&#x2F;cvss&#x2F;calculator&#x2F;3.0</a>')
