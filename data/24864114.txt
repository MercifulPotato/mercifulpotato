In fact, I think if you asked almost anyone, they would say that&#x27;s a totally unreasonable belief.<p>You&#x27;ve clearly never been involved in any sort of union push if you think that employers are so above something like this. Even if they wouldn&#x27;t do something like this, there are often behind the scenes conversations about how to create the perception that they would - because that is equally as effective.<p>In that context, repeatedly pinging drivers asking if they support the legislation (with <i>yes</i> in bold&#x2F;highlighted) could definitely be a calculated move to create that environment.')
