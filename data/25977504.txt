He was a free market economist, and taught finance from that perspective.<p>Naturally, the rest of the academic staff were leftists. One day, they decided to invite him to a debate on the merits of free markets vs socialism. They figured they&#x27;d wipe the floor with him.<p>Well, they badly underestimated him. He was an experienced debater, and had an encyclopedic knowledge of history and economics. He trounced them pretty good.<p>But the important thing is the whole thing was very friendly and collegial, and they congratulated him on his performance. Several even thanked him for explaining things in ways they hadn&#x27;t heard of before. A couple told him they weren&#x27;t aware there was even a case for free markets.<p>A far cry from today.')
