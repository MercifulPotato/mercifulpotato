Once you get on their shitlist it can take months of fighting the red tape machine to get off of it again. So we bypassed that with passwordless login using email.<p>Unrelated, but we also discovered that one corporate had some kind of batshit crazy network where requests would be routed through different exit IP addresses in different regions for the same user. On top of that, 5 seconds later it would repeat a request. Not just GET requests either, but also POST requests. How they get by without horrible things happening is beyond me. This completely broke user sessions since any login attempt would be followed by a second login for the same user which invalidated the session token. Imagine trying to use your online bank with that network. If anyone has seen anything similar in the wild, I&#x27;d love to hear from you. We never figured out what software they have that does that. We changed how our sessions work to get around it, but it probably ranks as the most bizarre issue I&#x27;ve encountered in my 20 year career.')
