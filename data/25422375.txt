It&#x27;s so bad that there&#x27;s evolutionary pressure to learn to ignore advertisements.<p>Ads are like a form of social parasite - They&#x27;ve hijacked a human instinct to share things we like and turned it into a profit motivated, manipulative, abusive channel to suck money out of people.<p>Just like animals ridden with parasites are less fit - consumers who are most susceptible or surrounded by ads are less fit.  Their decisions are influenced by ads to no longer objectively consider whether a product is useful to them. Like a mouse infected with toxoplasma is drawn to the small of cat urine - even though it means getting eaten far more often.  Good for the parasite, bad for the mouse. Ads are good for the company, bad for the person.')
