For one, it’s easier to distinguish quality items because certain brands make it easy. For example if I see LL Bean branded boots on sale I know they’ll likely be of higher quality than no name Walmart ones.<p>I don’t care about it having specific labels on it. In fact I would like to not have those for the most part. But knowing that you are buying genuine Converse shoes might be nice vs knock offs.')
