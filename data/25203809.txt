Similar with memory. If you can assume your typical gamer has a 2TB (or now much larger) storage capacity, you can ship a 250GB game. But then it gets complicated when <i>everyone</i> does the same thing. If every program is half as efficient as it could be (in CPU usage or memory), then there has been no gain with the new system.')
