Eg. You have chosen &quot;last 2 weeks&quot;, it would comapre &quot;last 2 weeks&quot; with &quot;minus 4 weeks, minus 2 weeks&quot;.<p>Yes, I think that would work really well as it would be simple to understand.  You could also have the option to only show the differences or at least highlight the differences as that is what you are probably trying to see.')
