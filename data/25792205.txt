This let&#x27;s me run a persistent vim session that I can reconnect to, and vim has however many terminals I need open in it. Vim does my multiplexing, dtach just allows me to make vim persistent. Very glad to have re-discovered dtach, to enable this workflow.<p>Notably dtach is very lightweight. Unlike tmux, it is not a virtual terminal. Upon reconnect to my vim session, I issue a control-l to refresh the screen. Dtach hasn&#x27;t retained the screen state, isn&#x27;t translating between terminfos. The one thing that can go wrong here is connecting from different terminals- few programs have a way to update the TERM setting once the program has launched.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;austinjones&#x2F;tab-rs" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;austinjones&#x2F;tab-rs</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;crigler&#x2F;dtach" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;crigler&#x2F;dtach</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.archlinux.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Dtach" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wiki.archlinux.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;Dtach</a>')
