The mainstream media is anodyne in comparison...<p>The mainstream media is usually anodyne in comparison to conspiracy theories, because the latter can have extra drama injected into them and push more emotional buttons.<p>Take that first article I linked to above.  The &quot;clear Trump win&quot; scenario Whitney&#x27;s article dwells upon and gives a sinister cast also included a large <i>popular vote win</i> for Biden, which she completely failed to mention and which would have undermined her &quot;planned power grab&quot; narrative significantly if she had.  A constitutional crisis is much more understandable if the winner of the electoral college lost the popular vote badly, given it&#x27;s always been a broken system and it seems illegitimate to a lot of people for the winner of an election is not be the person who got the most votes.<p>But it&#x27;s way more dramatic if you can make it sound like the Democrats are planning on stealing the election regardless of what happens.<p>&gt; Separately the term &#x27;conspiracy theorist&#x27; is both anti free speech and extremely unhealthy in a democracy. One person&#x27;s investigative reporter is another persons &#x27;conspiracy theorist&#x27;...<p>Nope, sorry.  I&#x27;m not impinging on anyone&#x27;s free speech rights by using the term &quot;conspiracy theorist.&quot;  I&#x27;d argue it&#x27;s also rather healthy term to use in a democracy, since a democracy will fail to function effectively if such thinking becomes too dominant.')
