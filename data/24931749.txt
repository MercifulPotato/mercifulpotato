Space exploration has <i>already</i> created many significant benefits for humanity <i>on Earth</i>, by advancing hundreds of new technologies with terrestrial applications and launching satellite networks that support a safer, more peaceful world for humans, with improved agricultural efficiencies as well as advanced warning and a better understanding of extreme weather events and climate trends.<p>Also, spending on space continues to be and has been a very small expense, not only smaller than cosmetics, but entirely dwarfed by military spending and welfare, both of which are highly contested as to whether they provide net benefit at all to the people of Earth.<p>You&#x27;d have to be ideologically possessed or completely ignorant of reality to believe this anti-space bs.<p>&gt; American citizens need to decide what they prioritize. Is it space exploration or is it a decent standard of living at home? Is it the moon, Mars, or Earth?<p>No they don&#x27;t.<p>We can prioritize both, and frankly, life on Earth will be <i>better</i> the more we priotitize space exploration, not worse.')
