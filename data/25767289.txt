I work in France, and pre-pandemic everyone could work remotely, and we had full remote people as well. Lunches are sacred, and going to lunch with colleagues to a restaurant ( every day) for at least an hour is the norm, even if some people prefer to bring their own food and eat at the office.<p>I start and end work whenever i want ( i try to make the required 35 hours weekly but don&#x27;t keep rigorous track).<p>I get 35 days paid vacation, can take sabaticals of up to a year, renewable for one more year, and if i start a business i can take a year off work ( salary and position are kept) to see if it works. There&#x27;s paid maternal and paternal leave. I can&#x27;t be fired tomorrow unless for a big error on my part. If i get called outside of office hours, i get paid extra (double extra on Sundays or holidays). ( That&#x27;s labour law)<p>See why you can&#x27;t make huge blatant overgeneralisations?')
