The best way to get over that is to work with it to get a feel for the syntax, Once you get a handle on that it gets way easier.<p>Two books that helped me the most were:<p>Stylin&#x27; with CSS: A Designer&#x27;s Guide by Charles Wyke-Smith<p>This is kinda dated but does good on getting the basic structure down with a little bit on how CSS makes pages look better.<p>Handcrafted CSS by Dan Cederholm with Ethan Marcotte<p>This goes more into improving styles and how to get things working better and simpler CSS.<p>Both are showing their age but the approaches work for the programmer brain (more-so than books written for those who don&#x27;t know programming logic at all.)   Once you get these basics down, you will be able to understand what&#x27;s going on when you look over googled results of what things you want to do.  (and see how badly overloaded a lot of commercial sites are)<p>Still gonna take you months, but hopefully it won&#x27;t be as frustrating as when I started trying to figure it out.')
