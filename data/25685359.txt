The process is totally asymmetrical, rampantly abused, and there is no realistic recourse for victims. In practice people rarely sue afterward, due to further asymmetries. If not an automatic $1k+ fine for false claims, we badly need some ambulance chaser style law firms who solely seek out copyright victims and charge fees only as a fraction of damages awarded.')
