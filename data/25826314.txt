Item(by='beagle3', descendants=None, kids=[25826694, 25827713, 25826585, 25826608], score=None, time=1611002140, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25825961, text='No, that’s not the most likely explanation - it’s actually very unlikely.<p>Medallion is not unique, there are other firms with comparable win record (Virtu, a Czech one, an Israeli one and a couple of British ones at the very least) but only 5-10% of the size; of all these, only Virtu is public and verifiable, the others aren’t but you can find people who will confirm it off the record.<p>People were begging Simons to take money. He wouldn’t let them into medallion (why should he share?) but he did start a higher-risk, lower-reward business and let’s people into that.<p>As far as I can tell, the commonality among those always-winning firms is high frequency low latency algorithmic trading. These days it takes millions of dollars per month just to pay for the infrastructure you need to be able to be competitive - and then you also have to have some nontrivial edge, without which there isn’t all that much profit in having low latency.<p>What’s Virtu’s or RenTexh’s&#x2F;Medallion edge? I don’t know. In the past, they seemed to like people with speech&#x2F;hmm background. But that was before the DNN &#x2F; differential computing revolution. I have no idea where there edge is now (and actually whether hmm was their edge in the past - but it did seem to be quite common background among their recruits)<p>That said, they may or may not be tax frauds as well - I have no idea. But I don’t see any reason to suspect they are doing retroactive allocation of successful trades.')
