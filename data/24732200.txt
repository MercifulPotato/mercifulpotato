I have no intention to downplay the reported behaviour, just to give some perspective.<p>First, the military vs police comments sound a bit off to me. Technically, the most incriminated force, CRS, are part of the &quot;gendarmerie nationale&quot; which is a branch of French military. But the comparison stops here, for all purpose they are trained and behave like a police force, only one dedicated to handle riots. Which puts them more than other in a position to commit abuses, hence the focus on them.<p>In the recent years, there has been a tendency to equip them more and more like terminators with body armors and weapons like rubber bullets, tasers and the like. It is not well perceived and subject to continuous debate. But they have nowhere near the level or weaponization of US police force (almost typed &quot;military&quot; there, that is telling).<p>What Amnesty International reports here is known, it makes the headlines all the time in national newspapers, and a lot of people (me included) are not happy at all about it. There are ongoing inquiries and CRS and police in general do not have the same level of immunity as in the US, even though more scrutiny is always welcome.<p>Finally, keep in mind the level of violence in France is not comparable to the US. Every report you may see about it should be read relatively to what we are used to. From a different viewpoint, two policemen have been attacked and severely beaten two days ago. This is a national news, something exceptional, making again headlines on &quot;Le Monde&quot; (probably the major French newspaper) since then.<p>But sure, maybe caused by terrorism and black blocs, the level of violence in police response has increased. This is a major issue and a big topic, not something ignored. And it should not be.')
