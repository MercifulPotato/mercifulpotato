Apple could hire engineers to maintain this stuff, if they wanted to spend the money. It would not somehow make the rest of macOS worseâ€”no one is required to use old APIs.<p>I think it&#x27;s a mistake to assert that a company should always indefinitely support their software. There&#x27;s certainly an upside in maintaining backwards compatibility, but there&#x27;s also certainly a distinct other upside in breaking it (e.g. authentication services dropping support for HTTP and requiring HTTPS).<p>To restate that in a more generic way: given multiple existing constraints and you want to add on even more constraints, there&#x27;s no guarantee that you can always satisfy all constraints under all circumstances (e.g. if you have to support multiple API versions, you can&#x27;t necessarily always support every single one since sometimes the changes are fundamentally backwards incompatible).')
