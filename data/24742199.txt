Not the cost of creating it in the first place.<p>Also not priced in is the environmental cost of discarding the assembled product.<p>Edit: I might add that in the cost of digging up resources, in many cases the lives of the people doing the digging are not valued much more than the hours of the people doing the sorting of returned items. So that&#x27;s something to think about as well.')
