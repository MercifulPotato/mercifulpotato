Unbearable pain could be psychological pain from no longer being able to pursue a lifelong dream. I&#x27;m actually surprised I was downvoted for this opinion on here with only your response. Of course not everyone should end their life because there is a lot in life that one can do but I still wouldn&#x27;t hold it against someone that did.')
