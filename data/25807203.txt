But...<p>1) If I type that line myself, I want to know what `Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;` means.<p>2) For an audience of mixed levels of Rust expertise, the `Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;` idiom is on average <i>clearer</i>, because the more experienced Rustaceans will have seen it before while `Outcome` will be unfamiliar and in need of explanation.<p>I thought about publishing a crate with just that one line, but there&#x27;s already a slew of other similar solutions out there (anyhow, any-error, etc...).  There&#x27;s not that much to gain.<p>I just think it&#x27;s worth pointing out that it&#x27;s weird to require newbies to understand `Box` and `dyn` in order to handle errors.')
