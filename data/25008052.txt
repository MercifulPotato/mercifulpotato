From <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;software&#x2F;diffutils&#x2F;manual&#x2F;diffutils.html#diff3-Merging" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gnu.org&#x2F;software&#x2F;diffutils&#x2F;manual&#x2F;diffutils.html...</a><p>&gt; You can think of this as subtracting older from yours and adding the result to mine, or as merging into mine the changes that would turn older into yours.<p>The point stands: taking history in account is unconvincing, as it assumes intent where none is explicitly given. In the example, if the top branch had a single commit, AB =&gt; ABGAB, then there is no way to reliably infer that A &#x27;intended&#x27; [+ABG]AB, vs. AB[+GAB]. Even with the given history, maybe the author of the top branch really intended AB =&gt; AB[+GAB], but made an error, corrected in the 2nd commit. The problem is fundamentally ambiguous. We can argue which of the diff3 or anu&#x2F;pijul heuristics are better. In practice I suspect the difference is not that large.<p>For completeness, here&#x27;s a guess of what diff3 does, assuming merging top into bottom, following <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.jcoglan.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;05&#x2F;08&#x2F;merging-with-diff3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.jcoglan.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;05&#x2F;08&#x2F;merging-with-diff3</a>.<p><pre><code>    [bottom] =&gt; A [+X] B\n    [top] =&gt; AB [+GAB]\n\n    B    O    T\n\n    A    A    A\n\n    +X \n\n    B    B    B\n\n              +G\n              +A  \n              +B\n</code></pre>\nResulting in A[+X]B[+GAB] without conflicts.')
