It isn&#x27;t that conservatives have any reason to distrust the National Weather Service or the Center for Disease Control specifically, it is that they distrust all institutions.  I don&#x27;t think there is much the NWS or CDC can do to change that while still remaining objective and truthful.<p>Like you said, some people may already be gone for good.  My main concern is not necessarily bringing those people back.  It is preventing them from corrupting the perception of more people who are still open to discussion.  That brings us back to the original topic of social media censorship.  Sometimes it isn&#x27;t enough to constantly argue down these dangerous ideas.  We likely need to start banning people who are actively doing harm.')
