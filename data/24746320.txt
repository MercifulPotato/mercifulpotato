Acoustic propagation within a house can be surprisingly complicated.<p>Some years ago I noticed a very strange hum in one corner of my basement. Thanks to funky acoustics, I couldn&#x27;t identify the source for a while, but IIRC it ended up being a fan in another part of the house. I suspect most of the energy traveled through the house framing, and ended up resonating in the room I was in at the time.')
