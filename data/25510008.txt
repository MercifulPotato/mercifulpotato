A bill that&#x27;s so large that people literally don&#x27;t have the ability to read it before they vote on it? Policy negotiations are normal. This is not normal.<p>I mean, heck, why bring up separate bills in Congress at all? Let&#x27;s put off all legislation for the entire year and then we&#x27;ll pass everything as one bill when it comes time for the spending bill. We don&#x27;t even need to meet during the year, we&#x27;ll just do the entire process via backroom deals and give people a few hours to sign on before they vote yes or no on everything for the entire year. It&#x27;s not a broken legislative system, it&#x27;s just compromise! &#x2F;s<p>Yes bills are complicated, yes, compromise is necessary, but also there are obvious lines we can cross where there&#x27;s no reason for a bill to be so bloated and discordant, and this bill crosses those lines.')
