Item(by='autarch', descendants=None, kids=[25678657], score=None, time=1610058699, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25677120, text='You missed the &quot;for quarter time work&quot;. Earning $10k&#x2F;month working 10 hours a week is pretty close to getting $400k&#x2F;year for an FT job at Amazon (especially if FT ends up being more than 40 hours a week).<p>I say &quot;pretty close&quot; because if you&#x27;re working on a 1099 basis there are a bunch of extra costs (extra SSDI payments, health care premiums, etc.) that you have to cover.<p>But still, nothing about the article suggests that the pay rates are poor, and the upper end ($250&#x2F;hour) is quite good, especially when combined with the ability to work less than full time.')
