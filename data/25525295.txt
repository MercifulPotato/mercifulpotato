You have code that returns a Future, and creates more Futures along the way. None of this imposes any constraint on the runtime, except that you need some runtime to evaluate the future. But that runtime could be quite simple and execute in the current process&#x2F;thread (cf. the CurrentThread runtime), meaning you don&#x27;t need support for threads at all.<p>Contrast this with the thread model, where the runtime needs to create and destroy threads where the code asks for it. In other words, your program logic is mixed up with runtime considerations.<p>For a practical example, let&#x27;s say you want to use rust to extend some C code to create a network client that calls back into the C code. What if the C code is not thread-safe? With async, no problem, just use the CurrentThread runtime. This is my use case, anyway.')
