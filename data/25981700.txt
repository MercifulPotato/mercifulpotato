Item(by='techsupporter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612121289, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25977601, text='&gt; These differences have nothing to do with sharing your continent with Canada and Mexico. They have everything to do with culture and public policy.<p>Exactly.  I live in Washington State and even now, one major party in our Legislature is trying to get at least three bills through that would declare &quot;Emperor&quot; (language not used in the bill, but definitely on Twitter) Inslee&#x27;s emergency orders, including the mask mandate, void and tell everyone to do what they think best.  Which, fine, except for the whole community transmission and insisting on businesses be open--with those employees being told &quot;work or starve&quot;--things.<p>We&#x27;ve been hearing for many months that masks are required and must be worn and put them on and yet...everyone disclaims all responsibility for enforcing this.  I don&#x27;t blame retail employees from saying &quot;we do not want to be on the other end of a screaming patron in exchange for minimum wage,&quot; but when even the government tells us that they&#x27;re relying solely on people&#x27;s discretion and good sense, things fall flat.  I&#x27;m not saying arrest everyone who has their nose hanging atop a mask, that would be disproportionately unwise, but we absolutely can and should be having people in authority out day and night at shops, buses, parks, ferries, and so on reminding people that your nose goes under your mask.')
