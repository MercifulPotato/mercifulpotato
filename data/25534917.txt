I think you,’re saying you can’t trust TripleByte because they’re a company, because as you say “you can never trust what a company says”. In this case I actually know Ammon both personally and professionally. I met him when he was already a successful founder and I was a nobody years ago. I’ve had many more interactions with him since then, and my prior when I see something like this that could be a (pretty common) bug or malice is to strongly suspect… a bug.<p>And I dunno, and maybe this isn’t a popular opinion (thus why using a throwaway account) but I actually think “companies” are actually pretty cool. A “company” made the laptop I’m typing this on (which is way better than the one I had a few years ago, and cheaper). A company got reusable rockets to work, and made the first electric car that many people actually like. I don’t think any of this would be possible without, you know, companies. So I’m definitely, like you, going to take what they say with a grain of salt but I’m not going to blanket say “you can never trust” just because they’re a company.')
