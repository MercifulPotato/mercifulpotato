GM was early (earliest really) to the EV game, and has good EV tech. Excellent, even, it&#x27;s just... GM cars are fairly underwhelming in other ways. Still, the Volt is the best car I&#x27;ve ever owned.<p>They just don&#x27;t ship them in volume because it&#x27;s not yet profitable to do so. Whatever they produce of the Bolt, they sell. They just don&#x27;t produce that many. Still, not as bad as some other companies, like Toyota, etc. that have only produced EVs where required by compliance.<p>Unlike Tesla, they don&#x27;t have investors willing to take risky bets. They have to turn a profit and pay dividends. They&#x27;re a massive multinational corporation that ships many multiples of the volume that Tesla ships.<p>When batteries get cheap enough and the supply of them reliable enough, they will be entirely able to supply any demand that is out there.')
