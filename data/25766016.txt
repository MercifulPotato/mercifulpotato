I&#x27;d guess that its mostly dependent upon the team, manager, and project. But as my career progresses and I realize I dont want to be doing this shit well into my 50&#x27;s or hell..60&#x27;s I figure I can bite the bullet early at a FAANG and stack so much money by the time im 40 I can tell anyone and their mother to go fuck themselves. With the amount they&#x27;re paying the EV seems way better than trying at a few startups.')
