I expect there&#x27;s increasing diversity in terms of Stripe&#x27;s customer base and how they use the product, and trying to pick a single percentage price point that works across all of them is no longer feasible.<p>That said, I&#x27;m quite unhappy with Stripe&#x27;s pricing as an AU customer. We&#x27;re paying exorbitant rates to convert USD to AUD (think retail bank rates despite transacting multiple millions a year, ~3x what we&#x27;d pay Transferwise). There&#x27;s no option to settle in USD, and a lot of our expenses are in USD, so we then pay another currency conversion fee when we spend.<p>It&#x27;s problematic to the extent that we&#x27;re considering whether the ongoing costs and hassle of setting up a US entity, dealing with international tax, compliance, parent companies etc. would be worthwhile.')
