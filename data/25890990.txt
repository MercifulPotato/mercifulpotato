But, generally speaking, the offline mode is only used if there&#x27;s a network&#x2F;connectivity failure, and there&#x27;s generally no way for a fraudster to know in advance if that&#x27;s going to happen.<p>The acquirer (ie: the merchant&#x27;s bank) accepts liability in the case of fraudulent transactions.  There are limits on offline transaction values, and merchants that have high fraud risk may not allow it at all.')
