(US is #2)<p>Doesn’t China have the 12th largest proven oil reserves? (US is #10)<p>Do the tens of thousands arrested&#x2F;wounded&#x2F;dead in Hong Kong count as “crisis wracked”?<p>Doesn’t China ethnically divide itself between the Han vs everyone else, culturally erasing groups like the Tibetans or simply rounding up Uyghurs to fill concentration camps?')
