Also these libraries are easily uninstalled and isolated from other python apps you have. No need to use massively complex package managers like nix to handle isolation.<p>Fuzzing a library just isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;s done in python. The developer just installs it and manually tests it 5 or 6 times in a shell and it&#x27;s part of the ecosystem in 5 minutes.<p>If you accidentally leave unused libraries in your code and it gets pushed to prod it&#x27;s a non-issue.<p>I switched to c++ because I was ok with the verbosity and also the complexity and also dealing with memory. But literally every single corner of the c++ ecosystem is a pain in the ass to work with. It&#x27;s getting to the point where I&#x27;m just annoyed all the time. If you want high performance apps go with rust or golang. C++ is just not worth it.<p>For a C++ dev moving to python is like night and day. Imagine a programming environment where you only have to deal with the intention of what your app should do and not all the yak shaving that comes with it on the side. I know some and they tell me they would never go back to c++.')
