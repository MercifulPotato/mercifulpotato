You can still be a passionate, professional, productive developer and use an IDE.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jetbrains.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;webstorm&#x2F;structural-search-and-replace.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jetbrains.com&#x2F;help&#x2F;webstorm&#x2F;structural-search-an...</a>')
