Neither is weirder than the other. It&#x27;s tautologically the case that if you have good working conditions you relationship will be different. That said, if you still have to work for a living and not for your own capital, it&#x27;s still the case that much of your life blood goes into making someone else wealthier independently of whether or not you enjoy the work. Therefore, it&#x27;s still necessary to some extent to keep the power relation in mind, even though it can be less obvious in good working conditions and even if you do receive capital in addition to your salary.<p>For me HN is an invaluable resource since it has allowed me to take a peek into some realities that were hitherto unimaginable.<p>This sort of reality clash will only become more poignant in the future as the gap between highly skilled workers and the rest deepens to become a canyon. It&#x27;s already the case that you find my perspective weird, so imagine how weird it will be to future HN posters when the inequality has reached even higher levels and they can&#x27;t even conceive of someone having to apply for jobs to get one.')
