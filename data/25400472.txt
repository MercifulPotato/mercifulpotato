But when you use a keybinding with -x, your shell executes the command directly. So when you press return in fzf, indicated by the exit code being zero, we additionally do three things:<p>- echo a facsimile of the prompt followed by the edit command so that it looks like you just typed &quot;edit filename&quot;<p>- insert that facsimile into the history buffer so that you can redo the edit command with arrow-up<p>- actually start the editor<p>- and clear the commandline of anything you may have written beforehand, which would otherwise still be there and break the illusion.<p>The reasoning behind this dance is that if you just do an ordinary bind, you just get the edit_fuzzy call in your bash history, which is pretty useless. You want the actual generated edit call, not the edit_fuzzy call. So we use bind -x and &quot;pretend that you typed in the edit call manually&quot;. We could just make ctrl-E insert the edit command into the readline buffer, but then we&#x27;d have to press return twice.<p>${PS1@P} is &quot;PS1, expanded as if it were a prompt (P)&quot;.')
