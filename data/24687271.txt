I don&#x27;t like that idea, but what other choice do we have? Google clearly doesn&#x27;t listen to their customers (or rather, we aren&#x27;t their customers) and good luck even getting in touch with a bank&#x27;s dev team, let alone convince them to do something that, to their uneducated higher-ups at least, looks like a security downgrade.')
