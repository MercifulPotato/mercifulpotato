Suggesting other people try your blog built on this platform is giving people bad advice, and the comment you&#x27;re replying to is overly negative.<p>I think the thing that&#x27;s annoying is trying to sell <i>other people</i> on using such a tool. Anyone crazy enough to try it should jump right in, but don&#x27;t try to talk people into it as an actual good blog option.<p>I call this sort of project &quot;linux on a wristwatch.&quot; It&#x27;s <i>totally</i> cool and a fun hack, but there&#x27;s no real utility to it beyond an art piece.')
