This code is highly readable and reminds me a lot of the early times when we build HTML in PHP. You can also use it just like that. Render it server side and be done. Maybe load some additional js to act after all that on the rendered page.<p>Problem is, while this is the better user experience than having to download and run a react behemoth to gain basically nothing, no one seems to have come up with a good version to write this kind of heavily AJAX dependent webpage without it being a real hassle. So while react apps kind of suck from a user perspective, as a developer, my code has never looked cleaner and was never this easy to maintain because everything that happens and can happen is right there instead of been loading delayed from other files and then changing everything client side and needing additional endpoints for full html and fragments&#x2F;JSON on the server.<p>Now, sprinkling in CSS there an top of that or even one of these awful &quot;write css in js&quot; solutions would be were I also draw the line, though.')
