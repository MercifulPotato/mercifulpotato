Today they can be enoumously powerful, the next day they are suddenly under constant barrage from all sides. Like FB Google and Twitter were chanted as the beacon of free world&#x27;s inevitable domination in world in the grassroot&#x27;s revolutions in middle east (Arab&#x27;s spring); now they were blamed for almost every instances of domestic plitical failures.<p>A better approach might be subject these powers into the government system, and manage and use them as tools. Instead of pretending that a free-rein systems can regulate themselves, which ends up with a swamp of complications and complexity that no one is able to remotely influence the thing with a coherent vision and strategy.')
