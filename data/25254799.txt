I spent some time looking at how &quot;de-Googled&quot; GrapheneOS is.  If you define &quot;de-Googled&quot; as meaning the phone makes no connections to Google servers that you do not explicitly acknowledge&#x2F;permit, then GrapheneOS is still far from &quot;de-Googled&quot;.  Just to give one example, SUPL.  There are also plenty of unGoogled-Chromium patches GrapheneOS doesn&#x27;t apply.  I&#x27;m not saying GrapheneOS isn&#x27;t way better than the Android that ships on phones, but it&#x27;s misleading to pretend they care about de-Googling as a first tier priority.<p>GrapheneOS does do some privacy oriented work, but it&#x27;s far more focused on hardening.<p>I look forward to examining &#x2F;e&#x2F; and CalyxOS since their focus is more heavily on privacy.  For my use cases, I&#x27;m less worried about hardening than privacy.<p>Also, it&#x27;s a lot of work to keep Android both up-to-date and de-Googled.  I started patching GrapheneOS and realized I did not have the bandwidth to maintain the patchset.  And still had no good answer for SUPL.  Hopefully CalyxOS and &#x2F;e&#x2F; have maintainers with the bandwidth.')
