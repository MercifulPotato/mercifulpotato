Those books are fillable forms -- the medical titles have pages of generic questions like &quot;how often should I take &lt;some medication&gt;&quot; and &quot;can you take &lt;some medication&gt; with food&quot;, with large spaces for the reader to write an answer. The books aren&#x27;t specific to the medication at all, as evidenced by the fact that they&#x27;re full of irrelevant questions (like asking if an antiparasitic drug is addictive).<p>The business titles in the second SERP look similar -- they&#x27;re poorly formatted scoring systems or checklists.<p>So yeah. Those books look &quot;legitimate&quot; inasmuch as they are at least intended to be bought by real people believing that they are useful, rather than as a means of money laundering. The content of the books is heavily templated to the point of making the books not worth their selling price, but that&#x27;s a separate issue.')
