They&#x27;re very real.<p>However, consider this: If this short squeeze was as easy as WSB wants you to believe, why didn&#x27;t a well-capitalized hedge fund cash in on it already? It&#x27;s not like WSB planned this in secret. It was literally headline news on a top-10 website for weeks.<p>As you said, the hedge funds are certainly making a lot of money here. Early investors are making a lot of money. However, we don&#x27;t actually know how many of the short positions entered at $2 or $200 or even $400. Smart hedge funds will make a lot of money by taking short positions on this stock, selling their borrowed shares to Redditors looking to get rich, and profiting by exiting their short positions when this finally crashes. Those shorts will cause the &quot;short interest&quot; number to stay high, or even increase, as this situation goes on.')
