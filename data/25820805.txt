They take take take and never give anything back. It is not good for their presence in other countries. You have to give the host some reason to want to keep you around. \nBut these people at Facebook think they can go to a completely foreign market, setup shop, take over a huge chunk of the advertising industry, become an influential media platform overshadowing local media outlets, and they do that while employing barely any locals and avoiding taxes too boot. \nI name Facebook but this is probably true of other US tech giants too.\nPoint is, this is not a symbiotic relationship. It is no wonder the EU are not happy.')
