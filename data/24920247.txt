Rust is great but it&#x27;s not a mainstream language yet and working with late adopters will be difficult. There are fewer project and job opportunities in Rust. You may have to be comfortable with writing your own libraries and tooling.<p>If you&#x27;re more of a late-adopter type you probably value stability and maturity of the tools you rely on and perhaps put more emphasis on solving your domain problems rather than language tooling and tech problems.<p>The other factor to consider is what your goals are. If the incumbents in telecommunications have built a large ecosystem of libraries and tooling in C&#x2F;C++ you&#x27;re going to be working in a small niche writing things in Rust. Do you want to carve your own ecosystem in the space or would you rather spend time improving the status quo and moving ahead with the rest of the pack?<p>There are no wrong answers! It all depends on what you value more. They&#x27;re all fine languages and tools. If you lean towards Rust simply because you&#x27;re happier working in it then go for it. If you&#x27;re not being paid to work on these projects then happiness is definitely a strong indicator you should be using Rust.<p>Happy hacking!')
