Executing that is no worse than executing a random make command or `brew install`<p>&gt; downloading the script first and inspecting it is a good idea, but still not as good as building directly from the code<p>No, you need to inspect the code too if you&#x27;re that worried. I can write a makefile that just does this:\n    build:\n       curl <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;example.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;example.com</a> -o bad.txt &amp;&amp; cat bad.txt<p>Either you&#x27;re actually vetting what you run on your machine, or you&#x27;re not. curl | sh isn&#x27;t any worse than git clone &amp;&amp; make.<p>&gt; This is why we see people do things like publish a hash sum alongside binaries they offer, or use a digital signature. Then we can at least verify that a binary matches what the author says they released, or better yet ensure that the binary was produced by a trusted source.<p>So just publish the hash&#x2F;signature next to &quot;install instructions&quot; that contains the curl command, and let the user verify the hash themselves. Again, that has nothing to do with the install method.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;atHcYR8x" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pastebin.com&#x2F;atHcYR8x</a>')
