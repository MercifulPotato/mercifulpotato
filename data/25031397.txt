But of course, in 2020, that&#x27;s not at all the case; the Republicans made a campaign issue out of not voting absentee, and of attempting legally to reject absentee ballots under a number of conditions. As a result: mail-in ballots are sharply more Democratic than Republican this year.<p>Further, any analysis that compares returns <i>over time</i> and holds Florida up as the model state to match against needs to account for the fact that Florida was able to begin counting ballots early, because they passed state laws to do so†. PA and WI were legally prevented from counting ballots until election day. The returns over time are going to be much different in FL than in PA.<p>Here&#x27;s another data point: you&#x27;re about to see Biden&#x27;s lead in New York open up and drive his popular vote victory even higher, because NY, which is a shitshow, is only now getting started counting all the mail-in votes. Obviously, the Democratic Party didn&#x27;t launch a giant vote fraud operation in New York State, which they would have won even with a dead candidate.<p>† <i>Every state should be like Florida, in this regard.</i>')
