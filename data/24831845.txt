Item(by='PaulDavisThe1st', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603147413, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24830133, text='&gt; On Wednesday, October 14th, Twitter locked the accounts of a White House press secretary and the New York Post, one of America’s largest tabloid newspapers. The accounts shared a story the Post ran on leaked emails which seemingly implicate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son in corruption. When users tried to share the story publicly or privately, they found a message informing them that their tweets could not be sent. Chinese users of Twitter mused on the feeling of déjà vu, as links to corruption stories sometimes vanish on Chinese social media apps like WeChat as well. For a moment, the paths of the Chinese and American internets once more converged.<p>This is just preposterous.<p>On the one hand: a widely used but private corporation decided to block certain accounts and links on its service, because it doubted the truthfulness of what was being posted. The extent to which the decision by said corporation is in keeping with the interests of its governing state is unclear, and could be argued several different ways. Meanwhile, numerous other services and media talk about the same topic blocked by the corporation, both broadcast media and internet-based media (and those that span both).<p>On the other hand: a national government removes and blocks posts on certain topics. No services accessible via normal means within the jurisdiction of said government carry any material related to any of these topics. Access to information about them requires relatively specialized network access. No broadcast&#x2F;mass media ever carry items regarding these topics.<p>How can any sane person even suggest that there is any kind of equivalency between these two things? The <i>only</i> thing that connects these two stories are the scale of use of Twitter. If Joes Weekly Blog (jwb.wordpress.foo) or some similarly obscure network context chose to block anyone from the NY Post or links to it in the comment section of their blog, who would write an article about that?<p>So why does the <i>scale</i> of Twitter, rather than its fundamental nature, allow an otherwise apparently intelligent individual to equate Twitter&#x27;s behavior with that of the Chinese government?')
