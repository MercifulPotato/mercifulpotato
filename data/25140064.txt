In Poland he&#x27;s beyond Saint, you can&#x27;t speak ill of him. And yes, I&#x27;m aware of his contribution to the fall of communism and fall of communism in Poland in particular - his election as a Pole was specifically designed to achieve that goal after all, communist government really didn&#x27;t know what to do about it and it strengthened the Polish church to such an incredible force they became completely untouchable and yes, could be seen as the leading reason for the eventual fall of communism.<p>However.<p>Despite the early life reverence, I feel that as a grown adult I do now see him in a completely different light - as a man put into a certain role which he has played correctly, and ultimately he has protected an institution that sheltered abusers, corruption, wealth and which ultimately is a cancer spreading over Poland right now, destroying the society from within.<p>Also not everything is about US - look what&#x27;s happening in Poland with cardinal Dziwisz, the closest confidant of the pope - I always suspected he was a piece of shit after disobeying the direct testament of JP2 and making money off of it, but now it&#x27;s been confirmed he&#x27;s much much worse than just profiteering off a dead pope.')
