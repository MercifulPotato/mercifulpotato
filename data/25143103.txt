Every computer has tons of logs stored all over the place. Printing out ballots creates logs, processing ballots creates logs, receiving&#x2F;sending data creates logs, uploading&#x2F;downloading data creates logs. The servers managing all incoming&#x2F;outgoing vote data has logs, loading the votes into other software creates logs. The ISP transmitting the data has logs, etc, etc, etc.<p>Why not gather all this metadata, and see if it aligns with the actual vote data?')
