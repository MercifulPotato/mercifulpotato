Hopefully I&#x27;ll be able to cash out with enough to do my own biotech, so I&#x27;m just biding my time for now.  But what does concern me is that this is endemic in chemistry.  It&#x27;s not talked about much outside....  Which makes me wonder if other sciences are just as bad, &quot;we just don&#x27;t hear it&quot;.  The incentive structure and nearly nonexistent self-reporting accountabilily is just the same; and meanwhile everything operates under a general social deification of the sciences.')
