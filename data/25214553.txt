I can say &quot;there&#x27;s no god&quot; without evidence, it&#x27;s the guy who says the God of the Bible is real who has to explain what he means.<p>&gt; I find your claim...<p>Note the reply chain, I didn&#x27;t claim anything.<p>&gt; By this logic, if I say something like “there was no moon landing”, I could demand that you offer evidence to the contrary instead of offering any of my own.<p>The contrary would be that there was a moon landing, and indeed the person who claims it happened would be required to come up with the evidence. Luckily there&#x27;s a lot of it.')
