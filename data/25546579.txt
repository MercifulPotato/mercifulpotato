Several train operating companies issue these refunds automatically for tickets booked directly with them, and others will automatically notify the customer that they are entitled to claim.<p>I think some companies have taken the view that reducing the amount of administrative overhead for both themselves and passengers is a better long-term investment than trying to weasel out of otherwise reasonable claims. An airline with that kind of policy in place is certainly one which I would be more likely to make subsequent bookings with!')
