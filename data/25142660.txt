Item(by='johnfn', descendants=None, kids=[25142930, 25143267], score=None, time=1605734864, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25137202, text='I started reading this article really really wanting to agree, but ended up thinking that a large part of the problem here is that the parent is not making enough effort to understand her child.<p>The parent says &quot;my daughter was a creative genius, and then...&quot; as if to imply that she isn&#x27;t any more. But it sure sounds like she has creative pursuits to me:<p>* &quot;She wants Roblox. All the kids have it, and it seems harmless enough. She’s building her dream house&quot; This sounds like a creative pursuit to me.<p>* &quot;She wants to talk with her friends. I don’t see any harm in FaceTime.&quot; She&#x27;s talking with her friends.<p>* &quot;She says she wants to do a TikTok while we’re in the “aesthetic” woods&quot; She&#x27;s creating TikToks! How cool is that, and how creative! Again we see she&#x27;s not a passive consumer, she&#x27;s still a creator - it&#x27;s just that the medium has changed.<p>The real problem here is that the daughter used to pursue creative activities that the parent approved of (sewing, drawing). Now she does creative activities that the parent does not approve of or understand.<p>The parent should bridge the gap by trying to <i>understand</i> the things their daughter spends time on. Instead they lambast them from a distance! It&#x27;s such a shame to me that the article ends with a note about how the parent will try to convince themselves that creating tiktok videos is creative. What?!? Creating videos isn&#x27;t creative?? Of course it is! You should be encouraging and reveling in this sort of behavior!<p>I guess it particularly rankles because my parents did the exact same thing when I was young - they constantly tried to get me to stop using the computer. They never took the time to understand that I was using it creatively - I was coding games, writing books and poetry, learning python, modding warcraft 3. But of course they never saw the creativity in modding warcraft. &quot;Oh, he&#x27;s playing video games again...&quot;<p>P.S. and as I suggested, I do agree with the premise - phones definitely <i>can</i> destroy creativity, they definitely <i>are</i> addictive, they definitely <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> be given to kids... These are critical problems, well worth addressing and being worried about. But if I had to choose a single thing that was even more important, it would be fostering understanding relationships between parent and child.')
