Item(by='dylan604', descendants=None, kids=[25965401, 25965786], score=None, time=1611963979, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25963926, text='&gt; ACH settlement is getting faster.<p>I have seen a snail move through my garden at a faster pace. If it were 1992, and all we had were 9600kbps, then I could understand the burst all transactions after hours and then do the settle up over night. Suggesting that they are going to have 3 windows each day for settlement windows is a 1999 solution. That also sounds counter intuitive in that at each of those windows their systems will get slammed with orders to process. If they just let each one settle as they come in, then they would spread the load.<p>I&#x27;m really dumbfounded at how either I&#x27;m an idiot and just cannot understand the issue, or at how the rest of the world has been snowed over into believing it is terribly complex and takes decades to make incremental changes.')
