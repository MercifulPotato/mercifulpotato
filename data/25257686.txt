Item(by='vecinu', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606763900, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25256461, text='&gt; It sounds to me what you really want is for someone to alleviate your discomfort by shoveling off the riff-raff so that you can enjoy your bike ride, rather than having to address the systemic issues, which might impact your net worth.<p>I would take issue with this assumption as I had moved from a pretty socialist country to SF, where I paid much higher taxes and didn&#x27;t complain. Nay, I <i>celebrated</i> the taxes I paid because I saw where they went all around me. Fantastic infrastructure (SF roadways are littered with potholes and terrible quality), affordable housing and supported citizens.<p>We have a very tech heavy scene in the city I moved from where people earn 6 figures, with a much higher population and the situation on the ground was nowhere near what it was in SF.<p>I also take issue with your last statement because it implies I want &quot;the poors&quot; removed purely for my own enjoyment. I do not, I realize the suffering they go through and I want to help support them for their own sake and mine so that I don&#x27;t have to see them suffer daily.<p>I have posed this question to other SF residents but how does allowing people to pitch tents on the sidewalk and suffer visibly help them or people just passing through? People that are not vulnerable are suffering <i>because</i> they&#x27;re visibly seeing these people suffer. Who is winning here?')
