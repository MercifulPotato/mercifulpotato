By all means attempt a best effort at vaccinating at-risk populations first... But at the end of the day, even the at-risk-but-vaccinated folks are still at risk as long as herd immunity isn&#x27;t reached (the vaccines are 95% effective, not 100%). Lots of shots in arms, quickly, is more important than being extremely particular about whose arms the shots are in and in what order they are inserted. Israel will eliminate COVID as a serious concern by March; is it more &quot;equitable&quot; that Americans will likely continue dying through the summer, <i>but at least they&#x27;re dying in the right order?</i>')
