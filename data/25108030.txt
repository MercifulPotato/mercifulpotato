Open source GUI software that runs on Linux generally does not have good UI&#x2F;UX (for good ones I can only think of Blender), and big commercial softwares generally does not support Linux, being trapped between sucks..<p>But still, I&#x27;m looking for a decent distro that has minimal setup, very customizable, in active dev, and have decent graphics &#x2F; audio driver for game dev, for a possible future shift. I haven&#x27;t done much research yet but am currently looking at KISS and Arch, if you know more please let me know thanks!')
