But then you get drama about &quot;what is an asshole&quot;. Trust me, it&#x27;s not just a made up strawman argument. That happens regularly.<p>Breaking the Code of Conduct isn&#x27;t a one-and-done thing. You talk to that person, and tell them that what they said was over the line. Be that using a slur, being increasingly insulting to another community member, or something else.<p>I, as an administrator, basically tell them &quot;not cool&quot;. If their reaction is &quot;yeah, alright&quot; then nothing more comes of it. No citations. No three-strike rules. But if someone continually defies our reprimands we have the backing of saying &quot;you&#x27;ve repeatedly been told... &quot; and &quot;this is written in ...&quot; meaning nothing should come as a surprise.<p>It&#x27;s also a way for normal users to understand what might be rule-breaking behavior. I can&#x27;t observe everything happening in a community, as much as I like participating in them. Instead, I have to rely on other non-admin members reporting bad behavior. Making it clear to other users what kind of behavior they can report someone for is also super helpful - and for some people induces trust.')
