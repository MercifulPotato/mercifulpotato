You know the saying “perception is reality”? That’s not an irrational position and failing to acknowledge this is just leaving money on the table. To me the question is whether such unbridled hype is actually worth the cost. To me it seems to come with a lot of degradation in public trust, a commodity that’s perhaps the most important when trying to building a lasting, cohesive society.')
