How else should it work?<p>It&#x27;s a bigger problem in non Right to Work states, where you can be forced to join the union (and have dues taken from you).<p>In places where joining the union for their benefits is voluntary I don&#x27;t see the problem.<p>There are also places where you don&#x27;t have to join the union, but they still take some of the wages (at a lower rate than full members) for nebulous &quot;benefits&quot; the union offers. Those are especially contentious because not all the employee believe they get any benefits at all.<p>The US should shift to the European model where multiple unions are available at each employer, and they compete with each other for membership. I believe joining a union is required there, they don&#x27;t have any non-union jobs, but a European union is not the same as a US one.')
