Item(by='andrewjl', descendants=None, kids=[24687154], score=None, time=1601739341, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24670928, text='Saying the Ricardo&#x27;s theory is generally sound when taking into account intangibles is not gaping credulity. You seem to mistake that for unqualified support of what he wrote. You then deployed a quote by a scholar with an obvious axe to grind, confusing the discussion still further.<p>All to distract from a banal, unalloyed statement that trade <i>can</i> be positive-sum and hey maybe we should think about how to encourage more of that, with Ricardo providing excellent scaffolding to build upon.<p>To drill into the details further, Ricardo&#x27;s combined idea of trade, specialization, and economies of scale does not mean that some countries must specialize in high-tech &quot;good&quot; industries and others must stick to commoditized, negative-externality-filled &quot;bad&quot; industries. His work didn&#x27;t address that distinction at all, which is its limitation. Reading that into what he wrote is zero sum thinking. Countries can develop a basket of industries to specialize in, and if they plan carefully, can strategically do so to develop a stronger economy. It doesn&#x27;t require state planning and contrary to Marxian economics, doesn&#x27;t require state involvement period. If everyone were to do this, the whole global economy would be better off. That this doesn&#x27;t happen is due a complex confluence of social, political, and economic issues, not a capitalist conspiracy.<p>Intangible also doesn&#x27;t mean what you think it means, it&#x27;s things that are invisible and hard to quantify, which is exactly what the byproducts of a booming hi-tech (cloth, at that time) sector would be. It&#x27;s true that Ricardo&#x27;s framework did not take that into account and it&#x27;s true that negative byproducts of those decisions exist today. This is exactly what my own criticism of Ricardo&#x27;s ideas is, that they&#x27;re a good start but not sufficient for the contemporary world. All these facts do not excuse intellectual dishonesty in throwing out what he says wholesale.<p>P.s. And If one wanted replace Ricardo wholesale, one would have to propose a better scaffolding that accounts for economic phenomena we see in the real world. Marxism ain&#x27;t it.')
