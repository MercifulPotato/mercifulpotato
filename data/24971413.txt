There are many ways to do so. Some are algebraic, some are not. There is nothing wrong with modelling mutability using immutable structures: that is how you probably think about history, after all.<p>Either way, it is unclear what you&#x27;re actually trying to say. Haskell has methods for modelling change of state through pure objects, but you&#x27;re talking about that as though it were an inherently flawed or invalid approach, rather than one of many equally valid approaches to modelling state transformations.')
