They could actually buy less plastic products; Can write to politician, to companies, as employees talk to collegues and bosses, as a boss make the right decision.<p>Everyone of us can do so much.<p>And honestly, if this is the first time its scientific proven that there is microplastic already in a fetus, thats news worthy to me.<p>I will also not get into your strawman argument; Other toxins, air pollution etc. is bad but doesn&#x27;t make the microplastic situation any better or worse.<p>Based on what you write &#x27;its not that i dont&#x27; care&#x27; why do you take so much effort to take the issue down? Its not that the issue will suddenly have theonly priority of our society just because you also think its wrong.')
