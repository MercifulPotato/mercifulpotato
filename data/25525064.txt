I&#x27;ve been in my job 5 years and the one before that 8, I&#x27;ve had 4 interviews in the last 10 years. I kinda feel at a big advantage for not job hopping. It seems some people interview a dozen times a year just as normal.<p>Should I try to get 10 interviews just for practice before interviewing companies I really like?')
