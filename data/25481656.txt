It doesn&#x27;t mean we shouldn&#x27;t try to establish that access for people that would use it well though.<p>Also, there&#x27;s a difference between working to increase testing so that more people do get tested before a holiday and making that the center of your message. They need to be careful to not mislead or give the impression that they are misleading, but they could limit the messaging to a statement about working to expand testing.')
