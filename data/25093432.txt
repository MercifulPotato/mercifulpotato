It&#x27;s as a like to joke with my boss (who has a good sense of humor) when asked to do something faster than reasonable:<p>&quot;Well, if you&#x27;re willing to accept an incompetent result, there&#x27;s any number of things I could do very badly. If you&#x27;d like, you can fire 10 people &amp; I&#x27;d happily accept their 10 salaries if I&#x27;m allowed to be bad at their jobs.
