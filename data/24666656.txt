Item(by='anjc', descendants=None, kids=[24672815], score=None, time=1601670130, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24664474, text='Perhaps it&#x27;s a regional thing then, in my country 2x4&#x27;s aren&#x27;t exactly cheap if you&#x27;re buying enough to build an e.g. woodworking bench, and you need a planer even if they&#x27;re pre-planed.<p>I&#x27;m currently planning a studio desk right now, funny enough. I could buy one for maybe €500, but just the heavy duty shelf sliders I need will be €70 for a pair. A pre-bought one will also have a light aluminium frame, whereas mine is going to weigh a ton with steel tubing.<p>Like you say though, if I make one it will fit the space perfectly etc. All in all it&#x27;s worth it for me even if I personally don&#x27;t save money')
