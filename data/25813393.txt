You can buy new devices or buy adapters, but either way the computer is asking the user to <i>adapt to it.</i> I have a Razer laptop for playing games and they have some USB-C ports and some USB-A. One of the USB-C ports connects to the thunderbolt bus. On paper, the Razer has less connectivity bandwidth, but it&#x27;s my macbook that I always fuss over.<p>I see the attraction in making all your ports USB-C, but that&#x27;s just not where the computing world is yet. Give us 3 USB-C and 2 USB-A. Give us 2 of each and a specialized charging cable.<p>P.s. I would be more into the USB-C charger if I believed it was 100% safe to charge other devices with it, but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s true (even though I trust Apple - I&#x27;m not sure about the other devices)[1].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.androidauthority.com&#x2F;state-of-usb-c-870996&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.androidauthority.com&#x2F;state-of-usb-c-870996&#x2F;</a>')
