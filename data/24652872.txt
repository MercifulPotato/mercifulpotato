The middlemen are on the different system that has a higher price - a price higher by enough to account for their profit.<p>Sometimes the middlemen are worth paying. They might be better at searching all your alternatives and so they can find a route that you didn&#x27;t find at all in your search. They might know something that you didn&#x27;t think of (yes the non-stop is $100 cheaper, but wouldn&#x27;t you prefer two 8 hour flights and two hours to walk around an airport over 16 hours in your economy seat?) They might guarantee your cruise doesn&#x27;t leave without you if your flight is late. Only sometimes though.')
