Read: outdated propaganda from a bunch of exiles from 20-30 years ago stuck in &quot;immigrant time bubble&quot; where their impressions of the country is locked in a outdated reality. Which more or less summarizes this entire article and most ridiculous amateur CCP bad analysis regurgitated by western &quot;enthusiasts&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s like whenever people insinuate Tianamen 2.0 will repeat for xyz events like China is trapped in some pre reform time bubble in terms of culture and capabilities. Somehow a modern China with 14T economy is going to have deal with problems the same way as post war China with 200B economy. I&#x27;ve never seen so many seemingly intelligent people go full smooth brain on this subject matter including in this thread. It&#x27;s particularly hilarious to see people claim their very smart PhD Chinese colleagues being brainwashed, when theses colleagues have experience in both east and west - they&#x27;re not the ones with singular perspective and the information deficit. It&#x27;s not their brain washing, it&#x27;s yours. Chinese diaspora reciprocate stories of how brainwashed their western coworkers are.. Queue reactionary 50c accusations when 50c doesn&#x27;t operate in English inside or outside GFC.<p>China is ~50X wealthier since 89, a wealthier China with riot gear and information control doesn&#x27;t need to Tianamen dissidents haphazardly. A wealthier China with lethal injection doesn&#x27;t need to shoot people in back of head in open fields and bill family for bullet, nor execute as many when it&#x27;s economical to lock them away. Which is largely what happens outside of most egregious crimes &#x2F; drug smuggling charges. Not to mention much of China executes XYZ for bullshit reasons media reporting turns out to be China sentences person to &quot;death sentence with reprieve&quot; - a symbolic sentence that&#x27;s functionally life imprisonment. Things aren&#x27;t the best, but they are generally trending in the right direction.')
