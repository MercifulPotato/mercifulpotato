The user has to lock much more Bitcoin in a channel in order use Lightning for micro transactions, which defeats the purpose. The minimum fee to get a Bitcoin transaction confirmed in a reasonable amount of time is often over $20 USD at this point. That&#x27;s a very large deposit for a $20 fee to be worth the effort.<p>They could deposit a smaller amount of Bitcoin in a custodial wallet, but at that point you might as well use a credit card or Paypal. It defeats the underlying appeal of Bitcoin, which is controlling your own money.<p>More people would have, and more importantly use, Bitcoin if it was allowed to scale on-chain. Why that hasn&#x27;t happened yet is a different rabbit hole.')
