Anyone writing Java code that uses Gradle or Maven shouldn&#x27;t have much pain migrating. I&#x27;m acutally currently supporting both Gradle and Bazel on the same backend code base to give another team (who depends on my code) a chance to gracefully migrate.<p>The &quot;hardest&quot; thing to migrate has been C and Python code. For these the package for something is based on an absolute file path from the root of your repo. So `company&#x2F;foobar&#x2F;thing.py` is `from company.foobar import thing`.<p>I find this <i>very</i> useful personally because it&#x27;s now standardized through the codebase (no one just plops a setup.py somewhere and does whatever they want) but it makes the migration difficult because you need to change the paths.<p>There&#x27;s some work being done in rules_python and in cc_library&#x2F;cc_binary that lets you control this behavior and hack it to align with your current company standards though which is really nice to use for a gradual migration.')
