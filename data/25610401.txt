Item(by='jkcorrea', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609561940, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25610343, text='&gt; Yes, very likely I am &quot;not a good leader&quot;. I recognize this. I don&#x27;t want to be. I &quot;just&quot; want to have teams where you do stuff together, because it is fun, because it has a purpose, because it makes money, whatever. It works a lot better in situations where everyone has their own agenda and is not hired by &quot;my company&quot;.<p>Ironically, this is the way the leaders I most admire also talk. Maybe you&#x27;re putting to much emphasis and pressure on yourself, maybe your employees really did want to belong to &quot;your company&quot; and be on the same agenda as you but that was too stressful a burden to bare?<p>Either way, after 5 lead roles for yourself, taking a supporting cast role sounds like a good idea with little risk, if you hate it well at least you&#x27;ll know for sure')
