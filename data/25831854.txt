But it&#x27;s a whole other thing when it comes to more complex illnesses.<p>Having been for 18 months through different types of psychiatrists and clinics, I came out quite surprised in how &quot;trial and error&quot; this whole system is.<p>I&#x27;m writing this from Switzerland, where we have an (arguably) high quality health care system. But the amount of &quot;OK, that didn&#x27;t work, lets try this other drug&quot;. Or, now, 18 months later, &quot;Oh well, we did the list once through. But who tells me that the MD prescribing the first drug did a correct analysis? Lets start the list from top again.&quot; Or, for a friend of mine, his girlfriend found a working cure like that: &quot;Oh, this brochure describes your symptoms so clearly, and it&#x27;s completely different from what you&#x27;ve been treated for these last 20 years.

If you think the MDs are all useless: well, at some times I was glad they were there.<p>So, well, I think having a little less than random system might be helping. Let the MDs watch if it makes sense, enter the correct diagnosis, and catch the stupid errors data entry people can make. But i&#x27;d give it a try...')
