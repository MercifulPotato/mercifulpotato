But he didn&#x27;t.[0]\nNow you have a choice to make.<p>His probability of not revealing a car in the case that both doors you didn&#x27;t pick had goats behind them, is 100%.<p>His probability of not revealing a car in the case that one door you didn&#x27;t pick had a car behind it, is 50%.<p>We can reason then, that of the three possible scenarios for the two non picked doors {g,c}, {c,g}, {g,g}, that it is equally likely now that <i>since he didn&#x27;t randomly reveal a car</i>, {g,g} must be weighted twice as much as the other two.<p>Therefore, we must be as likely to have a goat behind the remaining door as we didn&#x27;t.<p>In conclusion, Monty only changes the problem if he selects with information.<p>[0] Notice that at this point, we have to <i>throw away from the decision tree</i> 1&#x2F;3 of the histories, and in <i>all</i> of them switching was beneficial. In what remains then, <i>switching is less beneficial than it was</i> before this trimming.')
