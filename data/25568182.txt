It feels like it has some rough edges - you have to decide between having pen support or having touch screen support, and suspend can be unreliable. These issues may be fixed now. Also, I encrypted my Windows partition, and now it requires the key each time to boot up, so I recommend against doing that.<p>Overall, I do agree that the hardware feels quite nice, and besides those issues I listed, the Linux experience is quite good. I was very happy to not be forced to use Windows.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;linux-surface&#x2F;linux-surface" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;linux-surface&#x2F;linux-surface</a>')
