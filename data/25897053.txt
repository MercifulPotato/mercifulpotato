Only in the extreme, I could sell on your GPLv3 software and use some proceeds to imply I am the trusted source for it which is pure rent seeking behavior.<p>I got a bit distracted by the second half of the article since it seemed to be flowing to the usual point that most people feel more comfortable marking up service costs as multiples of the actual hourly wage¹.<p>I think the feel good argument for consulting based models is that you are selling a real limited resource to the individual customer, but I think this mark up is actually more clearly rent. You are attempting to hold an expertise monopoly such that no one can sell a similar service and no customer can find adequate expertise on the market and just pay wages similar to whatever you pay the consulting employee. Why would your documentation be good in that model?<p>If they made a more unique point maybe someone could post a TLDR.<p>(¹ No?
