They are 10s of billions deep in a hole and make no profit (or revenue) and will not for multiple years. To ever pay back that investment they basically need to become Uber. And to get there, they need many more 10s of billions of capx. Uber is not even making a profit yet.<p>2. Waymo approach is the classic &#x27;solve the easiest problem first&#x27; mistake. They started and have driven most of their miles, in literally the easiest place to do AV in the world. They have created incredibly complex high resolution maps on one small and simple region in Arizona where the streets are wide, the weather is always nice, and the general upkeep of the infrastructure is done very well.<p>3. Reliance on hd mapping for localization is fragile approach, and it essentially requires you to continuously map the whole global road system to have a real generalized driving solution. When will they have cars that can just drive on roads they have never seen before, something that human drivers often do. Seems to me this is the wrong approach to take.<p>4. Waymo still needs highly specialized vehicles, even with lidar becoming cheaper, their whole stack is still a very high cost low volume stack. How they will compete against an Uber driver in a cheap mass produced car anytime soon is totally dubious to me.<p>Tesla clearly does not want Lidar. Elon Musk even said he wouldn&#x27;t use Lidar if it was free. What they are actually doing is using next generation radar and likely next generation sonar as well.
