The Biden Administration isn&#x27;t in charge of the China policy, that&#x27;s a US Government level comprehensive strategic shift that began well before Trump. The Pentagon overall is more powerful than the US Presidency, and all the agencies that matter are on board the China confrontation approach. There are strategic policies that persist regardless of administrations, for example that was the case when the US was dealing with the USSR, and it&#x27;s going to be the case when dealing with China going forward. It doesn&#x27;t matter who is elected President on this policy matter, the only thing that changes are the more subtle details (and some of the drama, as you noted).')
