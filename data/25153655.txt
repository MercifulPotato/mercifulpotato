Such tests had dispersed radioactive contamination worldwide, and examination of human bodies could reveal how readily it was taken up and hence how much damage it caused.&quot;<p>I guess that is indeed ONE way to answer the question... the 1950s era had so many absolutely crazy things happen, back when nuclear weapons were brand new and people didn&#x27;t realize what impacts they would have.')
