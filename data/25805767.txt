Don&#x27;t judge it based on Gradle. It is used for all kinds of things. Gradle sort of interacts with it in a highly toxic way and brings out all its bad parts. If you use it the opposite way - as a better version of Java with mostly structured code, plenty of explicit typing and avoiding the highly &quot;magic&quot; aspects that Gradle focuses on, then its a great language for application development. Certainly better for high level things than Java - but completely 100% compatible with the Java ecosystem.')
