I minify the code by hand, and typically prototype ideas and performance tests in normal non-minified code. Once the main idea and approach are settled, I minify the code by hand and keep an eye on the heatmap of the DEFLATE stream to match the 1024 bytes limit.<p>MONOSPACE took ~4months on an off to create, tallying ~60h of work. You know 2020 + trying to balance work &amp; family, and remain sane these days.<p>As I said on my site, the Audio and Visuals feed each other to make the background noise based on each dot, and the camera shake based on the Audio. That way I keep the Audio &amp; Visuals are perfectly in synch, for free ;)<p>For the X &amp; Y camera shake, I use the values 0 and 64 from the Audio buffer. The 64 is because this is the maximum number of characters rendered by the Text writer which happens in the loop updating the Audio buffer. Using something lower than the 64th value would make the last characters of the Text shake in a different way than the rest.<p>-- P01, author of MONOSPACE,')
