It was about labeling random, unrelated things as racist symbols&#x2F;acts, then pretending like that&#x27;s okay to do and to even defend. It&#x27;s absurd in every sense of the word. First off, you&#x27;re taking the actions and beliefs of a handful of people (stupid teens mostly in all of these trolled stunts) and applying their &quot;belief&quot; (lame jokes in reality) to an entire demographic. The actions of the few are applied to the many. What you are doing is pretty damn racist within itself. Add in that you want people to alter their normal, everyday actions on the notion of a random group sudden decides, &quot;Hey, this is mine now and everything associated with it is associated with me!&quot; You&#x27;re also claiming continuing to do said thing and even arguing that they never belonged to said hate group to begin with, makes you one of them. MLk had a thing about judging individuals on their own character, not on the superficial factors of others. That, and you&#x27;re the one who started the argument in the first place. Don&#x27;t claim someone is frivolously arguing when you&#x27;re the one that started it.')
