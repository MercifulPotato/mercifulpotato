Prediction is a skill, skills can be developed and different predictors will have varying levels of skillfulness.<p>The biggest contributor IIRC is Fermi-ization: the skill of decomposing big hard predictions into many smaller predictions.<p>For example: what are the components of the question? They might include:<p>- The likelihood of deaths due to combat action. That can in turn include predictions of the relative effects of ship armour, weapons effectiveness, preparedness for combat conditions and so on.<p>- The number of people involved. If a skirmish involves a hundred ships on each side, 2 deaths is a very low estimate. How many ships are in the area? How many could reach it by December 31st? How many would be likely to be sent?<p>- The causes of conflict. What are the triggering events, and how likely are they to occur?<p>I&#x27;m sure smarter and better-qualified folks than me can argue all the details, but that&#x27;s the <i>point</i>. You don&#x27;t accept the question as a coin-flip with no priors. You go prior-hunting.')
