Do a pip3 install tensorflow==1.15 just for an illustration of what I am talking about.<p>There are hundreds if not thousands of extensive code TF projects on GitHub that are now almost completely useless because the libraries they require are not readily available. Sure you can use them as a template to translate into TF 2 but as a keeper of an important open source library, tensorflow team has been far less than diligent at making sure projects containing their code do not break as tensorflow pushes out updates.')
