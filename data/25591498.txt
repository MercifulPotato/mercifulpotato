This many years on and people still say this?<p>Adobe killed Flash through their own engineering incompetence, not Apple through policy. Apple&#x27;s policy merely reflected the liability that the Flash plugin posed.<p>Adobe could not deliver a version of Flash on mobile that didn&#x27;t chew up CPU cycles. They tried on Android, it was rubbish, and Adobe themselves deprecated it in 2012. That&#x27;s only two years after Steve Jobs published Thoughts on Flash.<p>For Flash content to make any sense on mobile, with its lack of mouse pointer and persistent keyboard, developers could use Adobe AIR, a separate SDK from that used to make Flash web applets. One of the earliest apps ported from Flash to AIR, Machinarium, was a memory and battery hog â€” not even a new runtime could let Flash content from running unacceptably on iOS.<p>And all this in addition to Flash spinning up fans on desktops and laptops due to its inefficiency, let alone mobiles. Not to mention the security vulnerabilities in the Flash plugin and renowned instability that caused it to be <i>the</i> major source of browser crashes in Mac OS X.<p>Between Adobe deprecating their own mobile Flash plugin for running applets in Android browsers, the abysmal performance of Adobe AIR apps, I&#x27;m quite happy to say the one to kill Flash was Adobe, not Apple.<p>Can we put this one to rest at last?<p>&gt; Yet their influence is so great that they can kill platforms just by not supporting them<p>Well, aside from not supporting a platform from a vendor that can barely support it themselves, I&#x27;d say Apple is more responsible for the rise in adoption of HTML 5 features (WebKit invented &lt;canvas&gt;, iPhone and Android together accelerated websites to display video in HTML players rather than depend on Flash&#x2F;Silverlight, etc.) than the killing of something that was already dead.<p>Apple merely saw the writing on the wall. Perhaps they did contribute to making it happen quicker but it would always have happened.')
