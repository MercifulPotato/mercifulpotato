It sounds like there is more to do on setup morning here, since we had to show up at 5am (and didn&#x27;t have things really ready until 6:30 or so).  There are <i>so many seals</i> to check and record; lots and lots and lots of paperwork.<p>In Georgia, the ballots are printed from a terminal that the voter uses and then scanned, leaving both an electronic count and a paper trail (the ballot itself is ejected from the bottom of the scanner into a sealed ballot box).<p>However, our scanners jammed 40 minutes into the day; after a couple hours, a technician managed to come to our precinct and opened the ballot box and revealed that a lackluster design in the ballot box caused the ballots coming out of the scanner to sometimes curl up and jam.  Without any realistic solution, we just had to open the ballot box every time it jammed (supervised every time to ensure no monkey business) and push any stuck ballots out of the way of the scanner so that more could be scanned.  Amusingly we had good success regularly giving the machine a good shove to dislodge any stuck ballots.<p>We also had problems printing receipts---in our case, we only need to print 3 from each scanner, but we ran out of scanner receipt paper.  Since another precinct called us during the day looking for extra receipt paper... it wasn&#x27;t available.  But, we dodged a bullet, since there was <i>just</i> enough paper to print 2 of the 3 receipts.  (1 gets posted on the door of the polling place; 2 go to the county.  We wrote an apology on the receipt and only sent 1 to the county.  I verified on the Secretary of State website that the votes tabulated for our precinct matched what our receipts printed.  Cool to be able to double-check like that!)<p>I spent a while thinking about what a pollworker would need to do to illegally cast ballots.  It would be a tall order indeed and would require cooperation and secrecy from <i>everyone</i> there, since the only way to cast a ballot is to scan it, and everyone can see the scanners at all times.  I can&#x27;t see it realistically happening in any precinct.')
