Maturity is closely correlated to how long things have been around. Just because multiple database support was officially added on August 2019 it doesn&#x27;t make it mature after that date. It takes a long time to achieve maturity - people to adopt and improve on that functionality without breaking things. We have been using multiple databases for years as well, done our own way, which will now have to be re-done in the upgrade to Rails 6. It&#x27;s obviously not a plug-and-play replacement.<p>It&#x27;s never clear how long gems will be maintaned for, and when a new gem (like multiverse, which is the multi-database gem I suppose others are referring to) comes out, it doesn&#x27;t mean that businesses are going to jump on it right away. It needs to be around for some time so that support and its reputation start to build up a case to use it in production.<p>That&#x27;s why having it in core is important.')
