I also had a yoga and would go for that X1 next - the versatility is amazing (bed&#x2F;couch&#x2F;travel media use in the reverse V position is 10x better than tablet and laptop)<p>Battery life is about equal on this MBP - it&#x27;s just a terrible CPU for a mobile device. But more importantly I use battery about 1-2% of the time - ergonomics are just not good enough for it IMO.<p>X1 Yoga with an AMD CPU would be my ideal laptop but unfortunately it seems like AMD gets pushed to gamers and budget laptops still')
