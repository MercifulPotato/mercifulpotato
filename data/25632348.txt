Users of the web sites are not protected by Section 230 and can still be sued. This has happened frequently in the past when the RIAA would sue users of various media sharing tools.<p>No.  That&#x27;s not true.  Users are <i>also</i> protected when they <i>repost</i> third-party content by section 230.  cf. Barrett v. Rosenthal[0].<p><i>No one</i> is protected from being sued for <i>first party</i> content.  <i>Everyone</i> is protected from being sued for hosting&#x2F;reposting&#x2F;sharing third-party content.<p>However, if there are <i>other</i> (civil or criminal) legal issues (sharing copyrighted material for example), section 230 does not protect users, websites or other platforms.<p>As section 230 plainly states[2]:<p>&quot;(1) No effect on criminal law<p>Nothing in this section shall be construed to impair the enforcement of section 223 or 231 of this title, chapter 71 (relating to obscenity) or 110 (relating to sexual exploitation of children) of title 18, or any other Federal criminal statute.<p>(2) No effect on intellectual property law<p>Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit or expand any law pertaining to intellectual property.<p>(3) State law<p>Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent any State from enforcing any State law that is consistent with this section. No cause of action may be brought and no liability may be imposed under any State or local law that is inconsistent with this section.<p>(4) No effect on communications privacy law<p>Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the application of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 or any of the amendments made by such Act, or any similar State law.<p>(5) No effect on sex trafficking lawNothing in this section (other than subsection (c)(2)(A)) shall be construed to impair or limit—<p>(A) any claim in a civil action brought under section 1595 of title 18, if the conduct underlying the claim constitutes a violation of section 1591 of that title;<p>(B) any charge in a criminal prosecution brought under State law if the conduct underlying the charge would constitute a violation of section 1591 of title 18; or<p>(C) any charge in a criminal prosecution brought under State law if the conduct underlying the charge would constitute a violation of section 2421A of title 18, and promotion or facilitation of prostitution is illegal in the jurisdiction where the defendant’s promotion or facilitation of prostitution was targeted.&quot;<p>You are wrong about Section 230.
