I suppose compared to free and open source anything seems &quot;incredibly over-monetized&quot;, but Plex still seems to be one of the cheaper&#x2F;simpler business models in software, to me. They&#x27;ve got a generous free tier, a simple subscription service for some nice to haves on top of that, and offer a &quot;lifetime&quot; subscription option if you&#x27;d prefer to pay a bunch of months up front and not deal with it again. It seems simple and basic enough to me.<p>I know they are trying to do some sort of TV channel-like value add subscription as well (because everyone is in the Streaming Wars now), but they don&#x27;t push upsells into the app itself (or I never have a need to go to the sections that have that, I&#x27;m not sure), just random mentions in emails that I mostly ignore.')
