It uses Discrete Optimization with MiniZinc&#x27;s help. For now scheduling optimized for one specific usecase, but with Discrete Optimization - it&#x27;s easy to expand. If you&#x27;re interested in technical part check out introduction to MiniZinc for the scheduling problem <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;optduty.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020-08-29-schedule-optimization&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;optduty.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;2020-08-29-schedule-optimization&#x2F;</a><p>Working on project I focused on Privacy. 0 extra services used, no analytics, trackers, no external resources on pages, no welcome email, no emails without explicit agreement and normal delete button to delete the company account.<p>I&#x27;m not a frontend developer, so to make this part fun, I&#x27;ve used ClojureScript. Actually it was really nice and smooth experience.<p>I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback about idea, implementation, design (I know it&#x27;s ugly).<p>Thanks!')
