Murders<p>The books are usually &quot;slow burns&quot;, meaning they slowly build up to the big reveal at the end of the book. Agatha Christie is the master of making great payoffs though, so despite the initial slog, by the last page you are usually awash in dopamine&#x2F;adrenaline (okay maybe that&#x27;s a little exaggerated, but these books really do have good payoffs).')
