Made some quick notes browsing the site itself:<p>Favicon would be nice.<p>Lists: How do you ensure quality public lists? Curation? Upvotes? Rigid rules?<p>Statistics on plants: In addition to &quot;wants&quot;, and &quot;haves&quot;, would it also be possible to implement a &quot;satisfied&quot;&#x2F;&quot;dissatisfied&quot; stat for people who did&#x2F;didn&#x27;t have success with the plant in practice?<p>I think something like this would be particularly cool with users having the ability to update little case studies they performed with individual plants, lists and companions that would be linked to on their respective pages.<p>Companions: I love the idea of a list of &quot;proven combinations&quot;. I see in the description you&#x27;re claiming these combos work well. What I&#x27;d really like to see is an explanation for <i>why</i> each combination works well, if there is one, or at the very least a case study of someone else having used the combination effectively.<p>I guess mostly what I&#x27;m looking for, as someone new to permaculture, is a vote of confidence that the information you&#x27;re providing is well-informed. That can come in the form of just more in-lined text explanations, links to data&#x2F;research used as reasoning for your companions, or just inlined case studies from wiki contributers themselves.<p>I&#x27;ve got a buddy who is _far_ more into permaculture than I am. I&#x27;m gonna ask him to check it out later today. I&#x27;ll respond here with any of his comments.')
