If you want to do feature flags, you can basically build a service that stores key value pairs segemented however you please, throw it behind redis cache, and call it a day. This is faster and probably cheaper than buying a SaaS!<p>However, if you want a bunch of neat features, custom rollouts, and all that stuff, you&#x27;re simply not going to be able to get the same value (unless you have HUGE scale) building it, and should just buy it.<p>Most organizations aren&#x27;t comfortable saying &quot;this is all we&#x27;ll ever need&quot; and are worried about both building, buying, and then migrating, which can be significantly more expensive than either of those options in a vacuum.')
