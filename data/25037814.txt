(The article doesn&#x27;t say this explicitly, but implies it is.)<p>Rust is the future of game development because Rust is still an immature language. (This doesn&#x27;t actually sell the point, and I&#x27;m not sure why the author bothers talking about this.)<p>What&#x27;s weird, too, is that the article talks about how hard networking is, but _cart has specifically said in the past, &quot;Yup! High level and low level networking is definitely on our radar, but it also isn&#x27;t our immediate priority.&quot;<p>It may come as a surprise, but you basically have to bake networking into the engine. It&#x27;s not easy as an afterthought. Rust doesn&#x27;t help with this. In fact, multiplayer and all its challenges have nothing to do with Rust.<p>We had modern client-side prediction roughly 20 years ago, and people still don&#x27;t take multiplayer seriously.')
