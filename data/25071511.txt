It does the streaming big catalogue of music + upload your own and stream it too that I need. I love the ease of paying for a service and streaming any music I want but there&#x27;s a bunch of stuff I own from bandcamp or cds which aren&#x27;t on any streaming provider and I want them to be a part of my library too. Google Music did it well for me for a long time; Apple Music is doing it alright enough for me now. Apple Music in iTunes is absolute garbage on both mac and windows, but the android app works well.')
