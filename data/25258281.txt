I also find it interesting that you consider having a wide decoder not as a technical trick but as &quot;throwing hardware at the problem.&quot;<p>However you try and spin it, what it comes down to is this, Apple is somehow designing more performant processors than every other company in the world and we should acknowledge they are beating the &quot;traditional&quot; chip designing companies handily while being new at the game.<p>If it&#x27;s as easy as &quot;throwing hardware&quot; at the problem, then Intel and AMD and Samsung etc should have no problem beating Apple right?')
