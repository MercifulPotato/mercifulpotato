Multiple times over the years I&#x27;ve had to build free-lists in Java to avoid this specific problem.<p>Same for C++ if you use one of the built-in generic memory allocators. The fastest new&#x2F;delete are the ones that you don&#x27;t call.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth I tend to agree with the grand-parent thread. The lack of awareness of allocations, cache-invalidation via indirection are a significant contributor to why we see software clawing back hardware wins across the years on these platforms.')
