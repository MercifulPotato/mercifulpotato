A mercantilist in the 1700s could have made the same argument as you, and they would have been wrong.<p>This is why political philosophy is important. The United States was largely an experiment in political philosophy and it succeeded... temporarily.<p>Unfortunately, given that the modern world is largely run by either state-managed socialism or state-managed capitalism (neo-mercantilism), there will be no evidence to evaluate your hypothesis on Earth unless there is a mass depopulation (let&#x27;s hope not).<p>In my opinion, we will only have new political experimentation and innovation after we become a multi-planetary species. Political experimentation on Earth is too risky.<p>Until then, pay your taxes to appease the increasingly dystopian and insatiable &quot;leaders&quot;.')
