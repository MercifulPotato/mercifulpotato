Almost everyone benefits from universal coverage but the system has to incentivize patients to shop around for the optimal balance of price, quality, and convenience.  This can be accomplished with an annual deductible of a few thousand dollars perhaps capped at a % of income.  Without this incentive, costs skyrocket.  Price transparency is a pre-requisite without which consumers can&#x27;t easily shop around, so this law is a giant leap forward in the right direction.<p>That is the #1 most effective thing that Americans can do to reduce health care costs.  #2 would be to change the standard American diet and eat healthier to reduce rates of obesity and diabetes.  Almost every other proposed structural change or intervention we looked at was minimal by comparison.')
