Democrats seem more likely to respond to pollsters.<p>Of course pollsters already know this, so they weight the samples to reflect underlying demographics, but it gets tricky to do this accurately if your surveying response rate is 1% to 2%.<p>And of course... the forecast modelers know this. Which is what Gelman discusses in his post. Given that they now have 2016, and 2020 as examples of presidential polling errors, modelers need to shift their priors in a number of ways to account for what looks like a persistent undersampling of GOP voters.')
