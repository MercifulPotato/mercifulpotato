I know people who strongly dislike him and voted for him over Biden.  As a lower bound you can estimate around 8% of voters  will donate to each campaign which clearly marks them as supporters.  Perhaps as many as 40% of those 74 million votes come from strong supporters who might not donate but will advocate for him among friends and family etc.<p>However, mostly it’s based on party affiliation where people voting against him in a primary would vote for him in a general election.')
