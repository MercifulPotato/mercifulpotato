It kept the paragraph breaks and the bullets, though it did a second line of them in Wordpress&#x27;s &quot;list&quot; block, but that was easily fixed. It&#x27;s really annoying, as I like to keep it all in Pages since I&#x27;m working on a manuscript for a possible book, but if that&#x27;s what I have to do I guess that&#x27;s what I have to do. Sadly, I&#x27;ve not found any other way.')
