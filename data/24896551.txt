We try to kill starlings and yet they are still here, all we&#x27;ve done is waste time and resources murdering them. We try to kill japanese knotweed by pulling them out of the soil or by applying herbicide and the knotweed spreads further because it thrives in a disturbed environment. Asian longhorned beetle, gyspy moths, garlic mustard, etc. Whether plant or animal, it&#x27;s all the same. All wasted efforts because we&#x27;re collectively unable to think on the same timescale that nature does as it works to achieve equilibrium again after the disturbance.')
