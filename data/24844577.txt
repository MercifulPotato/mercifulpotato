The Google adwords &quot;strategist&quot; they have call me is always pushing the Smart Bidding endlessly.  So I try it on one campaign.  Smart bidding increased the click cost from about $20 to $100.  The one click converted but I get conversions on that campaign for about $60 so it was a disaster.  Turned off that smart bidding and went back to my own eCpc bidding.')
