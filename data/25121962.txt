I dislike Git for its complexity, guns helpfully cocked and pointing at your feet, obscure commands etc. but still feel it&#x27;s the best of the <i>available</i> tools.<p>I really wanted to like Mercurial. UI seems much nicer. But there&#x27;s no support from major tools. Cmdline tools are slow on startup - not Mercurial&#x27;s fault as such, but affects me as the user - in particular waiting for the cmdline prompt showing Mercurial branch etc. Learning materials are a bit confused - so many different types of branches, a lot of popular materials seem out-dated, etc. Everyone in the whole world knows survival Git, very few know anything else.<p>Long story short, if I were setting up a collaborative software project (be it commercial or FOSS), I would reluctantly but unwaveringly choose Git. Truth is, 95% of the time it doesn&#x27;t get in the way of getting work done, and the remaining 5% is not worth going against the grain on all the above points.')
