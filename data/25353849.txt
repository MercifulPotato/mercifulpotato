Kafka events for the same partition will always be processed in order. If you have a stream transformation that reads from a topic that lives in one cluster and writes to a topic that lives in another cluster, then (as long as you chose the right partition key) everything will work correctly. Even if you have a sequence of transformations that zig-zag between two different clusters, it will do the right thing. You can&#x27;t achieve that with traditional databases.')
