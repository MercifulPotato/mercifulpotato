It would be pointless. The best thing to do is just take a stand and say you&#x27;re doing this to protect yourself and that&#x27;s the end of the discussion. The evidence is overwhelming that covid is deadly and to be avoided whenever humanly possible. What good is an in-person Thanksgiving if you wipe out half the old folks in your family and know it wouldn&#x27;t have happened if you had skipped it this year. A lot of people won&#x27;t be seeing loved ones next year because they willy-nilly killed them this year because &quot;muh rights&quot; or because they let their emotions overrule their logic. I can&#x27;t believe people want blood on their hands like that.')
