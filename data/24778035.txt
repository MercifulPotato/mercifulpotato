I was reading through Google SRE stuff. Lots of good info. Lots of very, very bad ideas too. Lots of it is &quot;at scale, you can&#x27;t make everyone happy, so don&#x27;t try.&quot; You end up with SLOs and SLIs based on percentages of availability, errors, etc. If 99.99% of requests are good, don&#x27;t worry about the rest. However, at scale, 0.01 can be literally millions of real, breathing people with feeling and priorities and things to do. When you give away your product for free, these are good trade offs. When you sell your product, the same assumptions may not apply.<p>I cannot afford to ignore 0.01% of incoming requests because we charge per request. At a certain point, yes, money and pros and cons yadda yadda yadda. It just feels that, once again, people are saying, &quot;but Google does it!&quot; -- and that does not mean you should.')
