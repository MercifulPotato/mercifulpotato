Yes.<p>But there are a couple of reasons why I hire for for expertise in the ecosystem.  Granted I&#x27;m in .NET which is a very homogenous ecosystem, so framework&#x2F;library&#x2F;tool knowledge bifurcates into people who are experts on every tool&#x2F;library&#x2F;framework we use and people who&#x27;ve never used one.<p>1. For the first 6 months you&#x27;re paying a sr. engineers salary to get jr. engineer productivity.  Given that most devs switch after 2 years this is a huge productivity hit and it&#x27;s all front loaded.<p>2. While great devs are great, it&#x27;s a lot easier to figure out if someone is a framework&#x2F;language expert than if they are an intrinsically great dev in an interview.  i.e. (&quot;Do you know C# well?&quot; is easier to determine than &quot;Are you a good problem solver?&quot;)<p>3. Being an expert on an ecosystem pays dividends even after the first couple of years albeit smaller than the first 2.<p>4. It&#x27;s not that much harder to hire someone with expertise in your ecosystem than not.<p>5. Most devs are searching for jobs in the ecosystems they like working in.  But a lot of devs who can&#x27;t find a job get desperate and start applying to everything, which can bring down average quality of people who don&#x27;t have expertise.')
