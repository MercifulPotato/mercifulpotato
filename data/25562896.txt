They have enough people who can replace current workers. They won&#x27;t have a shortage in food production because the land exists and can be consolidated to fewer farmers. There is a surplus of hands still out there who can take up manufacturing. By the time China really faces mass declines like Japan, they will already have a significant portion of their economy transformed into a knowledge&#x2F;information economy.<p>In fact, a lowering population but increasing gdp will actually increase gdp per capita. The living people there will become richer per capita.<p>For developed countries with already low populations, the story is different. Fewer hands means lesser manufacturing which means lower gdp and thus, lesser power in the global stage.')
