The first time I bought it, I felt it was so bad that I thought about returning it. But after a while I got used to it, and now I love it and don&#x27;t like regular peanut butter (with sugar+salt) any more because it tastes overly sweet and fake.<p>However, it is pretty annoying how much work it takes to stir it to incorporate the separated oil. Particularly because it comes in a big 28 ounce jar.')
