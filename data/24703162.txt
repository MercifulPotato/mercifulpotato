Congress caps the number of green cards issued at 366,000 per year. Therefore, the number of new immigrants to the US each year is 366,000. The 140,000 number I initially used incorrectly was the number of employment based green cards as compared to family based. I&#x27;ve updated the math. [edit] It&#x27;s 1M once you factor in family of citizens.<p>Everyone else is a non-immigrant visitor, and not relevant to my numbers.<p>&gt; The U.S. foreign-born population reached a record 44.8 million in 2018.<p>The immigrant and descendent of immigrant population of the US is roughly 100%, because there are only 5 million native Americans in the US.<p>&gt; What amazes me is how much hate the US gets for being one of the most generous countries on Earth.<p>Canada brings in 25X per capita the number of refugees and 10X per capita the number of new lawful permanent resident.<p>You&#x27;re simply mistaken.')
