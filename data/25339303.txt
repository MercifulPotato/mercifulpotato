The idea was that you would give out a phone number, like you would give the number out but it would redirect to your real number without revealing it to the caller.<p>Once you are done with the throwaway number, you close the number and you no longer receive calls from people who had that number.<p>The big issue with my idea is that these telemarketers and other phone ner-do-wells aren&#x27;t sourcing numbers. They are blindly dialing numbers along with spoofing the incoming number so it appears local.<p>It isn&#x27;t possible to eliminate these calls by never giving out your actual phone number because your phone number is a string of 10 numbers that can be narrowed even further by knowing what area codes are in service, then narrowing even further I think on a closed set of the first three as well.<p>Ever notice how if you pick up a scam call, they don&#x27;t immediately pick up, it takes 5 - 10s? Yeah, that&#x27;s because the machine keeps dialing until it gets a signal that the call was picked up so it connects you to the caller.')
