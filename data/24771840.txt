I think that’s extraordinarily unlikely as even just the feedback from support calls is valuable information.  Remember, Facebook etc is making money by directly selling advertising and individual support calls can be quite profitable for them.<p>Sometimes a support call from a tiny new account that costs them 2$ can be worth a new 20,000$+&#x2F;month revenue stream.  Or that same account can walk away with a bad taste in their mouth.  Similarly, if their getting thousands of calls about something that’s often a fixable problem which they would otherwise never know about.<p>Which isn’t to say it’s profitable in the short or long term, just significantly less expensive than the sticker shock suggests.')
