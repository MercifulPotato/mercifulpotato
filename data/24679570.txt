The issue is there are not many males that major in education at the undergraduate college level and so there are not many male applicants to choose from.<p>This is a societal &#x2F; financial issue.<p>Societal because boys see education as a woman&#x27;s job, which is reinforced through their educational experience of having mostly female teachers.<p>Financial because as much as Americans like to think that they live in a progressive society, males are typically expected to be the primary income earner. Education simply does not pay well; particularly when you consider the education and credentials required. Education in the United States has added increased prerequisites to become a teacher in a public school. In all likelihood, your child&#x27;s teacher either already has or is working on their master&#x27;s in education to maintain their teaching credentials. If they have aspirations of being an administrator they are likely working on a doctorate. This to earn a maximum annual salary of less than $100,000 and only after decades of working for a school district.')
