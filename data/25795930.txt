Many people are worried about the following scenario:<p>- Software engineers unionize<p>- Some &quot;bad&quot; rules get implemented, perhaps passing vote by misleading slogans or over-represented groups etc. Maybe it was a narrow 51% vs 49% vote.<p>- Top talent leaves, over time that 51% in favor of the bad rules becomes a larger and larger majority<p>- Now your option is essentially tolerate it or leave if you don&#x27;t like what&#x27;s happening. So it&#x27;s the same as before, except now you owe union dues.<p>- &quot;Top talent&quot; starts new company that&#x27;s more focused on &quot;work&quot; and has fewer rules.<p>- Company grows...<p>- Software engineers unionize... repeat<p>When I say &quot;bad rules&quot; I&#x27;m thinking things that are the software equivalent to existing union rules like &quot;Only union members can plug in that HDMI cable&quot; etc etc.')
