My money is still on the wall on whether localized chemotherapy will be as&#x2F;more effectivr, but you&#x27;ve been as systematic as can be and it&#x27;s worth a shot to test in humans. Glad you used syngenic models instead of xenografts.<p>Ive been out of touch in this, could you clarify what is the current scientific consensus on the role of immune responses in chemotherapy efficacy vs. direct killing? How does your approach fit into that model?<p>Further,Could you comment on the immunogenicity of the tumor model you used to test the drug? It&#x27;s a cell line from the same strain but it&#x27;s still a line with probably a ton of mutations. Have to tried to establish tumors with more benign cells (or spontaneous tumor models ) to see if the efficacy can be matched in such scenarios as well?')
