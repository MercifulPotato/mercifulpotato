I won the top student award in digital marketing.<p>I found that I was spending most of my time carrying other students rather than actually learning something beyond what I could read in a book or already knew, at least at the conceptual level.<p>And believe me when I say I’m not smart in an academic sense.<p>Family issues came up and with a waning interest I dropped out while getting enough points for a Grad Cert.<p>Fast forward a decade later and I’ve filed a patent pending in AI and another one in video messaging.<p>The MBA was for the most part a waste of time, money and energy.<p>I really didn’t learn much, except to recognise getting an MBA is more to do with ones ability to persevere through an incredibly dry and uninteresting range of subjects for many years at a time.<p>Save your money, and spend it on something more useful. $40k gets you a lot of azure&#x2F;aws&#x2F;gcp credits plus lifetime accounts of Lynda.com training and pretty much any other online course aggregator you care to imagine.')
