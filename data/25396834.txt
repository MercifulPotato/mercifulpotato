A carpenter from 1920 wouldn&#x27;t need to change the way he used a hammer if he picked up the 2020 model, even if the 2020 model might enable new ways of actually using it (or improve old ways of using it).<p>So while there is evolution and development going on, we&#x27;re not replacing the hammer metaphor as it were.<p>The WIMP model has also seen evolution and refinement, but it&#x27;s still recognisable as the same model. I think the analogy holds.')
