While I stream music from Google Play (or Google Youtube Music, or whatever they&#x27;ve pivoted to), I still have all the mp3s - and for good reason, because Google Music consistently tried to switch many of my tracks for the &quot;censored&quot; versions, which I&#x27;d have to re-upload.<p>And Youtube Music isn&#x27;t much better, and it&#x27;s only a matter of time before their aggressive opinions on what&#x27;s good for their consumers diverges from mine.<p>I&#x27;m not willing to let a company dictate which music I can listen to based on licensing agreements with yet another company. I try to buy my music directly from the creator, and keep it safe and sound.<p>Funkwhale will never be as large as Spotify, and that&#x27;s fine. There <i>is</i> a niche for what they&#x27;re offering.')
