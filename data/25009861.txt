The Fedora-related discussion here of a new scp that uses sftp underneath, I&#x27;m guessing is less likely to make it to OpenBSD soon, for whatever such a rough guess is worth.<p>I made a separate comment suggesting a way to locally replace scp with sftp, as others have also done with rsync (Ctrl-F here for &quot;progress&quot;).')
