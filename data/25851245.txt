Also you can join multiple servers.<p>Also there are benefits of the bubbles in this context as while you may not be being exposed to all content, nasty groups can&#x27;t as easily spread content as they get blocked by most servers, so I think it does reduce radicalisation.<p>Also, within servers that don&#x27;t block each other, you can bring on federated content from any of them, and that can actually be horizon broadening too, but not in the frequently antagonistic way of Facebook or Twitter. At least in my personal experience.')
