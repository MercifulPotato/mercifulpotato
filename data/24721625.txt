But many Western swords could not either. Some could because they were heavier or pointier... but that would have made them poor against unarmoured or low armored targets. You couldn&#x27;t use it on horseback either, but the Japanese had longer versions for that.<p>That&#x27;s what different sword grips were for, though.
