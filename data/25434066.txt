As predicted.<p>It was entirely predicted that this was going to be the result of GDPR.  It should be obvious that some companies would simply block people from the EU, and those people could be worse off for being blocked.<p>&gt; The fact you&#x27;re tired of popups shows that GDPR is working<p>But the person does not want those popups.  They simply don&#x27;t care that much about data tracking.  And instead, they are more annoyed by the popups.  This is a negative consequence that you have to recognize.<p>&gt; Do you think it would be &quot;freedom&quot; to waive all of your waivable rights<p>Well here is a better solution.  The people who want the popups to show up, all the time, with the horrible UI, could have that.  But what if, for everyone else, we had a single click button that said &quot;ignore all this GDPR stuff, and go back to how it was before&quot;.<p>That way, people for prefer the frequent popups can have them, and the people who don&#x27;t want that, can just agree to all of it, at once, and not have to worry about it anymore, if we choose do so.<p>That would be a choice, right?  Thats freedom.')
