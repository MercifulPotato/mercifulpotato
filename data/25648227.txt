Way down south.<p>Um, no? For example, in Alaska during the summer (in the northern hemisphere) there&#x27;s a period of the year where they have sunlight 24 hours a day. In winter, they have 24 hours of darkness.<p>So no, it&#x27;s not a &quot;south&quot; thing (until you get to, for example, Antarctica). The closer to the equator, the less extreme the changes are.<p>EDIT: I see your addition in specifying the sunset time <i>right now</i>, whereas the rest of the thread seems to be aimed at the extremes, which will be closer to the summer and winter solstices. We just passed the winter solstice, so of course the sun will be going down quite early (in the northern hemisphere).')
