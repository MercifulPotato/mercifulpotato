I tried to explain why it was a problem, rather than just leaving them put out. Personally, I prefer this approach over the cold, unfeeling notification from a robot that noticed your repo was oversized. Human admins is a feature of sourcehut, and human failures of communication occasionally occur as a result.<p>Anyway, the facts are laid out, and I&#x27;m not particularly enthusiastic about rehashing this discussion again, 10 months later, in an unrelated post celebrating our anniversary.')
