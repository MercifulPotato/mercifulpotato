The 90&#x27;s had a &#x27;grim dark&#x27; thing going on in media in general at the time.<p>There was some pretty dark comics and cartoons at the time. Things like Spawn and a lot of other late night cartoons of the time. Music like Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Nails, Tool all had that weird dark vibe. Goth subculture was a pretty big thing in general.<p>Then there&#x27;s movies and stuff. Plenty of dark weird movies from the 90&#x27;s.<p>I think in general culture&#x27;s kind of moved past that to like you said more of a lighter tone to things.<p>That&#x27;s not to say &#x27;grim dark&#x27; won&#x27;t become a thing again though. Culture tends to come and go in cycles.')
