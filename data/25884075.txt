Under Obama, as I&#x27;m sure you know, the Espionage Act of 1917--one of the most pernicious laws we have on our books;\nit was enacted under Woodrow Wilson, and it was designed to criminalize dissent from U.S. participation in World War I--was invoked against whistleblowers and sources, like\nEdward Snowden and Chelsea Manning and a dozen others, more under Obama than every other prior president combined. It ended up being three times more prosecutions under\nthe Espionage Act for our sources as journalists than all previous presidents, including Nixon or Eisenhower or whoever you want to pick. And the press said almost\nnothing.&quot;</i><p>I&#x27;d like to know what exactly is so &quot;insane&quot; about pointing this out.<p>Glenn Greenwald has always been actually on the left, unlike the milk-toast &quot;leftism&quot; (or really &quot;centrism&quot; or rightism) of outlets like the NYT, CNN, MSNBC, etc..<p>This is what bothers people, and they can&#x27;t take people actually on the left pointing out what hypocrites and right-wingers many liberals are.<p>This is why Glenn Greenwald gets censored, but I&#x27;m pleased to see that he still has the balls to speak truth to power.')
