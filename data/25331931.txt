The sale of EFFORCE tokens is not directed at, and each purchaser of EFFORCE tokens will be required to represent, among other things, that they are not: (a) a citizen, resident (tax or otherwise) of, a person located or domiciled in, or any entity organized in or owned by certain persons in (i) the United States (including any U.S. Person pursuant to the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (as amended)),\n. . . In addition, each purchaser of EFFORCE tokens will be required to represent that such purchaser is outside of the United States at the time of agreeing to purchase the tokens, was outside of the United States at the time any offers to sell or any offers to buy the token were reviewed, and will be outside of the United States at any time that such purchaser performs its obligations under the Token Purchase Agreement.\nPurchaser Sophistication. \nEFFORCE tokens are speculative and involve a high degree of risk and uncertainty . . .<p>In other words, it&#x27;s apparent they are not wasting their time or money registering with the SEC. Expect the SEC to respond with something to the effect that &quot;regardless of all your terms and conditions if ANY US based person buys your Efforce token you are now subject to our rules and we will litigate&quot; . . . same result as if anyone offshore sells anything unsuspectingly&#x2F;unknowingly to a US citizen the US authorities immediately claim jurisdiction and ability to litigate&#x2F;arrest&#x2F;prosecute.<p>. . . and the private placement listed at 45%  - - these are the investors&#x2F;creators taking their very sizeable cut of the deal, not a particularly altruistic percentage.<p>Appears a bunch of Italians went seeking a world famous personality to be the frontman &quot;image&quot; for their token deal .  . . . and booked the Woz.     Wonder what his cut of the deal is ?')
