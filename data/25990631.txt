It helps a lot to have an excellent and curated todo list, action-oriented so that I can start working directly without too much time to think about other things.<p>Some other small things I do:<p>1. I use one account on my Mac for work and another one for personal&#x2F;leisure.<p>2. I mostly use the computer for work. I don&#x27;t play games on it, and I almost don&#x27;t use social media on the computer (for this and for other things like reading books or posts, I mostly use an iPad).<p>3. I use a Pomodoro app to start working. I just open it when I sit on the chair and add the first task I want to focus on. But after 1&#x2F;2 pomodoros, I drift off it and continue focusing.<p>4. It also helps me put on my headphones even if sometimes I don&#x27;t listen to the music. But I think this is a habit of focusing from when I was working years ago in an open-space or in coffee shops.<p>5. I use multiple keyboards some days: I have three external keyboards on my desk, and when I feel I am losing focus and I need to maintain it, I change the keyboard. It gives me a similar feeling like using a good pen to draw something or to write a good text on a piece of paper and just want to continue using it :)')
