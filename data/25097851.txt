Do officers not know what an introvert is? Do they not know some people react poorly to bring touched? He also had asthma, which might be good to know before you decide to chokehold someone. There&#x27;s tons of people in this world, who act differently to different stimulus, and mental healthcare in the US has historically been poor, so there are probably plenty of undiagnosed people walking around. Most people don&#x27;t announce they&#x27;re introverts during a police stop, this should have been a clue.<p>It seems a lot of police have trouble spotting the &quot;fakers&quot;. Literally they did a chokehold on him, how much training do you need to understand that causes harm? More excuses from you.<p>You seem to live in a land where just because it&#x27;s written on paper and police can legally kill people, that it makes it okay. Maybe policies need to change in light of so many of these tragedies, and the willy nilly use of Ketamine and chokeholds should actually be reconsidered. Hopefully this pilot program is a success, and we can avoid the amateur hour antics that lead to Elijah&#x27;s death.')
