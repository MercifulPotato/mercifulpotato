Somehow despite the intervening years I have found every environment I try to set up for my kids lacking compared to my early days with QuickBASIC. The combination of integrated help, a nice REPL and a simple interactive debugger is great to learn to reason about code. I’ve been quite impressed with GAMBAS, which is probably the best combination of simplicity and integration that I’ve found, not requiring constant googling or a separate tutorial, but it’s great to see something built around a language that could stick with them for years.')
