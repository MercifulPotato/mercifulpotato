There won&#x27;t be any less rigorous security checks because you&#x27;re flying a rocket.<p>Parallel procedures might sound fine in theory, but it&#x27;s <i>way</i> simpler to just have people onboard the ferry who are good to go and don&#x27;t need to be kept there, make a scene, etc. Security personell and access to information systems is much simpler to come by in the port, which incidentally already has customs facilities anyway.<p>&gt; And you don&#x27;t even have to start at some port far from a city.<p>Yes you do, that&#x27;s the whole idea of safe distances with rocket launches. We&#x27;re talking about a vehicle that basically can be as devastating as a small tactical nuke in terms of destructive potential. Especially during launch, you&#x27;d want that thing as far away from densely populated areas as possible: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gklVhRzkVqA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=300" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=gklVhRzkVqA&amp;feature=youtu.be...</a> that&#x27;s what happened last time a 30-engine rocket failed...<p>&gt; consider jet hydrofoils<p>That might be an option, but then again even Shotwell explicitly mentioned the boat ride to be longer than the 30 min rocket ride even at just 10 miles out, so I don&#x27;t think fast ferries are the most realistic option (mostly for safety reasons).')
