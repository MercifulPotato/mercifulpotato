But they rarely do that. Most take the spicy title (or out-of-context incorrect quote from Twitter) which reaffirms their opinion and run with it. They share, like and subscribe. And the article keeps being shared, liked and subscribed for months, even if it was disproven minutes after it was published. So instead of being a way to find the truth the article ends up being a way to validate missinformation.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the solution to this problem is. Just wanted to point out that &quot;letting them decide&quot; has a lot of problems.')
