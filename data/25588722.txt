Except that completing X-1 rides, earns you a pittance, far below a livable wage, and X rides earns you just above.<p>Also, X is also quite a large number. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible to complete it without working for 8+ hours during peak traffic time. So, in effect, drivers are not free to choose their working hours, if they intend to make enough money to live on.')
