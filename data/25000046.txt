It would have been great to be able to to chat so that I could learn more about how much this would cost, but as outlined above, they decided to end the conversation.<p>You&#x27;re right, currently the server is sitting in &quot;rescue mode&quot; and under OVH&#x27;s instructions, I&#x27;m not allowed to swap it back to the normal hard disk boot. That&#x27;s ok, I can still mount the disks manually via SSH and move everything out. So at least that&#x27;s some good news - the server hasn&#x27;t been seized.<p>The hosting bill has been paid up until December, so I&#x27;ll will be looking to get a partial refund hopefully.<p>Anyways, gotta roll with the punches I guess. Thanks for your comment.')
