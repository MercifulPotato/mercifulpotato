Item(by='gk1', descendants=None, kids=[25375257, 25375970], score=None, time=1607615475, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25374319, text='8% conversion rate is pretty good for a PH&#x2F;HN audience.<p>Three things I&#x27;m sure helped the signup rates, which others should copy:<p>- Low-friction registration using SSO.<p>- Glimpse of the product in the background.<p>- Let guests see and click on gated features. (Even if visitor clicks &quot;Or try it instead&quot; they still see &quot;+ New Draft&quot; button, which leads to the signup prompt again.)<p>I&#x27;ve tested these in other apps and found they significantly increase signups. The first because of low friction, the second because--I suspect--it shows the visitor what they&#x27;re about to experience in just a few more clicks, and the third because it shows the guest what&#x27;s possible and offers multiple chances to sign up.<p>Well done!')
