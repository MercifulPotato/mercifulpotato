For SoC components, the drivers might be provided by the vendor of the ARM SoC. But there still are drivers -- the OS still needs to talk to the SSD (via a driver), USB peripherals (via a class compliant driver and&#x2F;or custom drivers), and so on. We might not get to install a driver for the GPU, because it&#x27;s a custom design and the vendor of the machine (eg. Apple for M1) has already taken care of it.<p>But if we are to install any kind of third party peripheral (sound interfaces, printers, etc) with custom options (not just satisfied with generic class compliant driver) we&#x27;ll need to install a driver.')
