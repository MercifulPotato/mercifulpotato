But clearly she did do this: She sent a letter that made a bunch of (IMO) outrageous demands, outrageous because it essentially attacked other people at the company, and said that if her demands were not met, that she would leave. In this case, the ethical AI group is doing the same thing: demanding a manager not have a role with them, demanding (again IMO) unwarranted apologies from other people, and worse, demanding the rehiring of someone has shown that she has no respect for others in her workplace.<p>A bunch of overpaid toxic babies from my opinion. I don&#x27;t care who you are, going around demanding &quot;my way or the highway&quot; in a large company just makes you an asshole. If they don&#x27;t like what happened they should simply resign with integrity and move on.')
