For me there was an advantage in having a language where it wasn&#x27;t an option.\nYour (b) scenario is quite a strawman. I have seen plenty of good code using Generics, but sure, there is subset of code written using Generics that is not good, and I think it becomes easier to obfuscate code and make it hard to read if you have Generics, that might just by my bias, and I think I&#x27;m tainted from C++ and hopefully it will never become as bad as what you can encounter there.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to make out that Generics have no place in Computer Science. I was trying to make the case for it being nice that there was a language that didn&#x27;t have it, and was building on the grandparent saying that he didn&#x27;t miss it that often, which mirrors my experience with Go.')
