You only have to pay the TV Licence if you ever watch live TV, not if you merely have a televion set. I&#x27;ve never paid the fee because I don&#x27;t watch live TV, ever, and when you go on the TV licence page to fill out the form why you don&#x27;t need a licence, one of the options on the form is &quot;I only use my TV for games consoles, netflix, dvd players etc&quot;.<p>So it&#x27;s not some &quot;clever hack&quot; - the law specifically allows for not paying the licence fee if you own a TV set but don&#x27;t watch live TV.')
