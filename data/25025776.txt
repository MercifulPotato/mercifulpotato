But at least in my bubble, the marketshare of Premiere in shrinking fast, in favour of Resolve. I&#x27;m myself not super concerned about having less tool-specific tutorials as I&#x27;m on the level where specific tools matter less, and I&#x27;m more focusing on the overall pictures (similar to software development where once you have many languages under your belt, many of the more similar ones blend together).<p>Regarding plugins, last time I checked, Premiere still doesn&#x27;t support OpenFX (but might have changed). It&#x27;s just a matter of time before the ecosystem for OpenFX is way bigger than anything Adobe could ever dream up.')
