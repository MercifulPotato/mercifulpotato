Can I run this in a VM of Linux easily - and have all deps there, including OBS? (I dont know anything about OBS just yet - I just looked at it and DL&#x27;d it now...<p>Incidentally - I met the the producer of the podcast &quot;moneypot&quot; on the plane a few days ago and we talked a ton - I asked about how would one get into podcasting&#x2F;streaming if they havent yet - and she mentioned some great resources - I cant recall them off the top of my head - Ill have to ping her and get them again - but this is something I am going to look into learning during this pandowntime.<p>If you have resources to point at - that would be appreciated.<p>THanks for this though.')
