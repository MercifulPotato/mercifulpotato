Most records in such ADR databases are causally unrelated to the vaccine, and merely occur coincidentally; and the vast (&gt;99%) majority of the rest are occasional mild reactions.<p>&gt; <i>But yes, label people questioning the rushed out vaccine as &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot;.</i><p>I’m not. I’m labelling specifically those people as conspiracy theorists who make up bullshit that isn’t based on actual biology but rather on complete fiction. In other words, who spew baseless lies. I’m all for robustly criticising these vaccines. But it has to happen <i>scientifically</i>, and by <i>experts</i>.')
