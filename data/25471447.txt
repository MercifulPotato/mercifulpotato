Item(by='imiric', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608323017, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25466830, text='&gt; In GTA and Red Dead Redemption 2 it is far more fun to create havoc than to play any of the missions<p>While non-storyline gameplay is definitely more fun in Rockstar games, I think the mission and sidequest gameplay is way more fun than CP2077&#x27;s as well.<p>Consider this earlier mission in GTAV: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ikop7td88ks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=Ikop7td88ks</a><p>It involves a car chase, NPCs jumping in and out of moving vehicles, a boat mast swinging into traffic, shooting while driving, etc. This is all done smoothly, with no animation glitches or jankiness.<p>A mission after that involves a bicycle race, swimming and boarding a boat, followed by an intense jet ski race: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TcqvAgzr3To" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TcqvAgzr3To</a><p>So far in my admittedly short ~12h playtime of CP2077 on PC I haven&#x27;t seen anything equally as engaging, well designed or just plain fun. Most of the missions involve shooting galleries interspersed by cutscenes to showcase action set pieces, and there&#x27;s a lot of on-rails shooting from the passenger seat, which feels like gameplay from several generations ago, not from a next-gen title.<p>I don&#x27;t understand complaints that it shouldn&#x27;t be compared to GTA given that CDPR themselves describe it as an &quot;open-world action-adventure story&quot;, so comparing it to games that set the bar for open-world gameplay is only fair, and in my opinion it falls very, very short on those terms.<p>Just like it does on its RPG elements. Like others mentioned, it falls short when compared to even the original Deus Ex, let alone the more recent installments. This is probably why CDPR decided to avoid marketing it primarily as an RPG in 2019: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;oDldUQQ.png" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;oDldUQQ.png</a><p>All in all this was a massive disappointment for me, and I actively avoided trailers and marketing to avoid the hype. Even if all the bugs and performance issues are fixed hopefully a few months from now, the gameplay will still be mediocre at best. The only thing I&#x27;m partially still interested in is the story, though from what I&#x27;ve read that seems to be underwhelming as well.<p>This was the cherry on top of 2020. What a year.')
