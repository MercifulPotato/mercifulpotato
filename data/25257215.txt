Energy can be extracted without burning a fossil fuel such as coal, gas, or oil. Geothermal fields produce only about one-sixth of the carbon dioxide that a relatively clean natural-gas-fueled power plant produces, and very little if any, of the nitrous oxide or sulfur-bearing gases. Binary plants, which are closed cycle operations, release essentially no emissions.</i><p>&gt; <i>WHY IS GEOTHERMAL ENERGY A RENEWABLE RESOURCE?</i><p>&gt; <i>Answer: Because its source is the almost unlimited amount of heat generated by the Earth&#x27;s core. Even in geothermal areas dependent on a reservoir of hot water, the volume taken out can be reinjected, making it a sustainable energy source.</i>')
