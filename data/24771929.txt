Perhaps a 1 month journey through Arduino too.<p>But FPGAs are programmed in a C-ish language called Verilog (or VHDL) which sort of insulates you from the specifics to some degree.<p>Given my current interests, I&#x27;d probably try to translate a machine learning model into a Verilog program or something along those lines. But that&#x27;s a combination of two complex things.<p>Maybe a good first project would be &quot;make a really fast webserver&quot; by embedding a webserver + TCP&#x2F;IP stack into an FPGA. Or a really fast compressed columnar database engine.<p>Good luck! \nt')
