What we really see is light hitting our retina, or if you want to go one layer further, nerve impulses in our visual cortex. Everything else is model.<p>So if we accept that everything is model, then what you are really advocating is using verbose descriptions in terms of a fairly established model rather than succinct descriptions in a more speculative model. Phrasing it like this makes it clear that there is a balance to be struck between pros and cons. Maybe we are erring on the speculative side, but you will have to make that case.')
