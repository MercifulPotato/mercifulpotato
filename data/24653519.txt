USB-PD devices should not be incompatible to the point of damage but USB-IF has been unable to ensure this by keeping non-compliant products off the market.<p>USB-PD needs to be pulled under the IEC, NRTL (US) and CE (EU) regulatory systems and compliance overseen by entities with the legal authority to deter legitimate manufacturers&#x2F;importers from selling non-compliant products.<p>&quot;You can plug it in, but it might catch fire&quot; just isn&#x27;t good enough for a power delivery system that can provide 100W.')
