I stopped some time ago, but the idea of putting something &quot;real&quot; (but small) into real practice still bugs my mind.<p>I am no more interested in getting a job in finance as I am in getting a well payed job in general, and I still have 1.5 years of full time PhD thesis, so it is not a very short-time goal either.<p>Thanks for the insights, by the way.')
