How does it manifest today? Maybe they hear a msg rumor and go ‘yeah, figures’. A better example might be that mainland Chinese people genuinely think Hong Kong people think they are ‘better than mainlanders’, and low key believe in and support the crackdown and integration of Hong Kong (put them in their place). Wild stuff, amongst your own you have this informed hatred.<p>Similar to Karens in America, we don’t have outright segregation, we have a diluted form of it, which of course is a far cry from what it was.<p>The water is not totally filtered yet, need a few more pass throughs (few more generations).<p>As to why I think it’s way higher, it’s simply because the West has strong shallow racism. But the East actually knows the nuances of their region and <i>still</i> find ways to be prejudiced. That just simply takes more bigotry imho, where as in the West they only need pure ignorance.')
