If you understand SQL, you will probably understand why the example you give is a bad idea. If you don&#x27;t, you won&#x27;t. I&#x27;m speaking from the point of view of having written, at this point, thousands of lines of SQL at minimum, and having decided that it&#x27;s not how I primarily want to access data in the applications I write. The ORM queries I write are written with rough knowledge of the SQL they generate, and I try to be very careful with query builders to avoid the exact case you bring up.<p>I think LINQ in C# does a pretty good job of bridging this gap, actually. It could be better, but it discourages looping and encourages the declarative style that efficient SQL requires.')
