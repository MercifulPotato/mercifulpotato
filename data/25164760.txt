I’m just not sure that it’s one that’s familiar to me. I can’t honestly say I have my finger on the pulse of where people are using notebooks vs repls but the former seem really great for 1) step by step examples 2) scripts-in-progress where certain steps are more in flux than others.<p>Though, I think I get what you mean as I reflect on my own dev experience. As a mainly C# dev which has a very very limited repl experience (I would and should say no repl experience but someone will yell at me about csi.exe or dotnet-script) I have seen people using notebooks for want of a good repl, but I’m curious why anyone writing python would.')
