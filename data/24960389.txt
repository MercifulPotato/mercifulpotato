Total cost for basic materials for an entire car is less than $600, depending on type of paint, color and finish.<p>But earlier this year my truck tapped, quite literally TAPPED the back of an SUV when it rolled three feet forward from its parked position. The SUV owner and I had to look several times, and wipe off dirt and dust to see a 2 inch crack in the paint in the hatch.<p>Total repair bill? $1800 for that damn 2&quot; crack! It&#x27;s robbery and there&#x27;s no way it should cost that, but that was a &#x27;discount&#x27; rate. I could&#x27;ve painted his entire SUV three times for that price!<p>The autobody industry is out of control and insurance claims are often ridiculously inflated.')
