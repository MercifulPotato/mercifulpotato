Stateful &quot;functions&quot; is just so asinine I don&#x27;t even know where to begin. It&#x27;s like they wanted to ride the hype of functional programming, but didn&#x27;t understand referential transparency. And somehow that is supposed to be better than classes which, <i>by design</i>, are intended to hold state.<p>Which brings me to where I disagree with you that React team has their act together. If anything, the hooks API is tacit acknowledgement that they messed up on component lifecycles and their original component model and really don&#x27;t know what they are doing. If you go back even a year earlier, most people seem to have forgotten that they redid their entire set of lifecycle methods before scraping it all for hooks. They haven&#x27;t been able to get a stable API together because, architecturally-speaking, they don&#x27;t know what they are doing.<p>The only alternative explanation is that hooks is the React team trying to remain relevant through a misguided API &quot;refresh&quot;. Which is definitely not a good look for anyone wanting to take a framework seriously. Outside of Facebook, literally no one has the money to rewrite their app every year. Hooks aren&#x27;t even backwards compatible. It&#x27;s not even self-compatible with its current version! Since you can&#x27;t mix hooks and classes. Just insane.')
