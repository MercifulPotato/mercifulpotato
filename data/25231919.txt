It is also not an improvement for Software Engineering, imo. If you ask Software Engineers if they might prefer this process over the current process, I think, most would not.<p>I think you would be surprised, I am sure there are lots of people who wouldn&#x27;t be interested in such a methodogly. But you need to remember what the purposal is. Do you want to be interviewed and tested on your skills in an interview and then sign a job contract or would you rather do a possible 2 day tech test. You also need to remember the job market, if I have 5 companies in my job pipeline (I stop adding companies at 5) why would I want to do 5 1 day tech tests?<p>And 1-2 tech test is extremely common.')
