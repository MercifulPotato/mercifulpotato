And no, I&#x27;m not even talking about political viewpoints here - we see ideas based on fantasy, utter unreality, repeatedly winning substantial support and spreading amongst people.<p>Conversely whenever platforms do allow totally &#x27;free&#x27; speech, we see that they degenerate into hives of hate and moderate voices tend to leave entirely.<p>I don&#x27;t know what the answer is, but just having public forums made to allow everything, and screeching about free speech when they take a stand, is demonstrably not working.')
