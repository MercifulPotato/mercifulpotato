Banks rarely create open APIs, and even when they do they are fragile and subject to whims as the banks are optimizing for security first (plus: they need strong incentives to maintain APIs since it’s not even in their core business).<p>And since you can’t rely on an API, “there’s no other option” which compounds with the fact that coding up a web scraper for a specific bank takes <i>maybe</i> a dozen programmer-hours.
