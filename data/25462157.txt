Just if maybe needlessly complex.<p>I&#x27;ll describe what i&#x27;m doing, as the code is kind of old.<p>* I have a token model that stores a uuid and the relevant user and data, along with an expiration. This isn&#x27;t session data, just the valid token. You can also store this in redis or wherever.<p>* There is an endpoint that takes a username and password, and if valid, generates a token, and sets the token&#x27;s id as a httpOnly secure cookie. This can also returns basic user data for display, name profilephotourl, global permissions, etc. This has a noauth decorator from DRF<p>* there is a check token endpoint which just returns the above data. This also updates the expiration.<p>* i have auth module based on rest_framework.authentication.BaseAuthentication that checks the cookie, token validity, etc and generates a valid user.<p>That&#x27;s a high level overview.')
