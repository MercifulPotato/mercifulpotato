To increase raw bandwidth for 5k&#x2F;6k they combine multiple HBR2&#x2F;HBR3 links (over Thunderbolt or with multiple cables), which is the <i>opposite</i> of MST.<p>MST is supported specifically for early 4k displays that had scalers that couldn&#x27;t handle 4k60, but could handle half the resolution, so they sent two streams. But that wasn&#x27;t a bandwidth limitation; old MST 4k displays and modern SST 4k displays both used a single HBR2 link.')
