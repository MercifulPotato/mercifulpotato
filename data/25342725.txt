Personally, I believe it&#x27;s dangerous to conflate the two -- modern police departments are very, very different than the more community organized (or elected) folks who watched over small towns. Organized, uniformed, powerfully armed standing patrol police forces like we have today are a relatively new phenomena.<p>This isn&#x27;t a semantic disagreement, this is factually incorrect. ‚ÄùOrganized, uniformed, powerfully armed standing patrol police forces&quot; have absolutely existed in the US before the 1800s and date back to classical antiquity at least. Rome often employed it&#x27;s legions as police, and there was even a dedicated legion stationed specifically to police Rome [1]. It&#x27;s hard to get more &quot;Organized, uniformed, powerfully armed&quot; than deploying the military as a patrol force. And in the US professional police forces, not militia or community watch, have existed since the 1600s. And by the way, many police forces are still led by elected leaders - professional, organized police and community oversight are not mutually exclusive.<p>It might be fair to say that in the 1800s and early 1900s industrialization and technology had progressed to the point that police started to resemble modern police, and many US cities grew to the point that they started municipal police forces in this time frame. But the police of the 21st century with cameras, computers, dna testing, 911 systems and radios are arguably even more removed from the police of 1900 than the police of 1900 were to the police of 1800 or 1700.<p>1. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cohortes_urbanae" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Cohortes_urbanae</a>')
