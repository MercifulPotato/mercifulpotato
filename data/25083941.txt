This is a problem that definitely benefits from a gestalt approach. Otherwise there&#x27;s lots of ways pockets of life can cling on and maybe regain a foothold in a few thousand years when your back is turned. That&#x27;s why you need the Deadliest Catch crew for the crabs: Sure they have to search, but even the worst ship always came back with some. Load those guys up with crystal meth, adult diapers, and an IV nutrient drip and push them through a decade of non-stop crabbing until there aren&#x27;t enough left to sustain a reproductive cycle. Between that, nuclear fallout, and the chemical agents used for other life forms you can knock out these little delicious cockroaches of the sea.<p>On the availability of nukes, sure there&#x27;s more than enough around, but the problem is ownership. Unless you&#x27;ve subverted the government of Russia, the US, or China then even if you have enough nukes, you don&#x27;t have the infrastructure to launch them all at the same time &amp; avoid giving too much warning to people. They&#x27;ll bunker down and do all sorts of inconvenient things like try to restart civilization. Their chances are slim, especially with the super volcano route, but it could take a while to wait them out. And at that point you&#x27;ve lost the nuke option since all of the launch infrastructure has been destroyed. Then you&#x27;ve got to go the long way around and root them out shelter by shelter (or vault by vault, Fallout style) Messy. On the plus side, some of the people in those shelters will be preppers who tried to plan for this sort of thing, and they&#x27;ll get to die while living out their fantasy.')
