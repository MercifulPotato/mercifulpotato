Critical blocking issue right there.\n  - I did get one random crash (on Android), which meant a restart\n  - The intro story could be trimmed by about half :)\n  - Move the green &quot;Play&quot; button to the top of the menu.\n  - Maybe rename &quot;How to Play&quot; to &quot;Instructions&quot;, so only one menu item has the word &quot;Play in it&quot;\n  - The inventory system sucks!   Nothing worse than having 6 slots, 2 of which are filled with &quot;+1[2] mitts&quot;.  Please implement auto-management for inventory.\n  - Most enemy and item names are awesome.\n  - A few item names are confusing.  I don&#x27;t know what &quot;steelcaps are&quot;.  They look like boots.  Are they boots?\n  - Apparently I can equip mitts or boots, but not both?   Does that make sense?\n  - The icon has a laser sword.   Should I start with a laser sword?   Maybe a laser shiv?\n  - How many dungeon floors are there?   Please add that to the instructions.\n  - This might be crazy for a roguelike, but please consider difficulty levels.  It would be nice for a kid to be able to play through the game without frustration.</code></pre>')
