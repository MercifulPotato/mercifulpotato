The attempts made so far by the founder to push out the OP would color any future dilution, making it harder to justify that dilution in court, even if on the surface it appears legitimate.<p>If the shares are not sold to a third-party arms-length investor, OP would have to be given the opportunity to participate in the share issuance on a proportional basis.  If the founder and investor conspire to issue shares to themselves with the sole purpose of diluting OP, not only would that dilution possibly be reversed in court, but further sanctions could be imposed on the founder and investor as well.')
