Numerous papers are approved for publication submission without meeting this “requirement”: an internal analysis shows that just under half of the papers submitted to PubApprove are done so with a day or less notice to approvers.&quot;</i><p>That doesn&#x27;t show that 2 weeks notice isn&#x27;t required.  It just shows that some papers make it through the process very quickly.  Perhaps those that don&#x27;t have much controversy associated with them.  That doesn&#x27;t seem unusual to me, and doesn&#x27;t seem to prove anything.  It also seems curious that they didn&#x27;t talk about how long that other half did typically take.  Min&#x2F;max&#x2F;average would have been helpful.<p>Note that I have no idea if Dr Gebru was wronged here.  Just noting that the above passage seems inconclusive to me.')
