As it currently stands, very few people are able to produce the counter-propaganda because few have access to the actual propaganda.<p>This phenomena is how I&#x27;ve been mostly converted to racism (well, HBD), I could, with some difficulty, find the pro-racism view but finding an anti-racist view that actually addressed the HBD view was basically impossible (what little anti-racist stuff there was mostly attacking strawmen) because basically no one is exposed to the HBD argument (thanks to censorship including social censorship mostly), so no one produces counterarguments!<p>Also, there&#x27;s a small chance that I&#x27;ve been completely mislead about what the supposed &quot;Islamic terrorists&quot; believe and actually their ideology is awesome and I should convert to wahabiism. I&#x27;d like the opportunity to make that decision myself.')
