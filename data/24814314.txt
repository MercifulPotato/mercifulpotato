Maybe to cover up that they where illegally obtained or whatever. These stories are the default other than a simple &quot;anonymous source&quot;.\nAnyway the media and the people do not need to care how the data was obtained. We are not using them as evidence in court or anything the like. It only matter if its true and in no way can censorship help figuring that out.\nAlso the evidence that the data is legit is overwhelming.')
