You&#x27;ve at least got to weigh up how you might incriminate yourself, before saying anything.<p>In Cheat, a liar knows you won&#x27;t have access to any other outside information than what they can also see. (Unless you have two aces, in which case they are already incriminated and story telling will do no further harm.) That means their lengthy story-telling can, with sufficient experience of the game, remain safely consistent with the information you have.')
