It used to perform badly a couple of years ago, but with the new FastHTTPLocust class its performance is quite OK and it&#x27;s the only tool that allows you to write test code in regular Python (there is another tool - the Grinder - that also lets you write in Python, but it is Java-Jython which means no pypi libraries). If you&#x27;re into Python you should definitely try out Locust.')
