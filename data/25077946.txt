We&#x27;re looking at what the Constitution says because it is still the supreme law of the land. People who think some provision of that supreme law of the land should be changed can propose amendments; the US Constitution has already been amended 27 times. But you&#x27;re not supposed to just pretend that the law doesn&#x27;t apply because you don&#x27;t like what it says.<p><i>&gt; All that was a long time ago and things have evolved.</i><p>And the US Constitution has been amended where necessary to take that into account. We amended the Constitution to abolish slavery, to give women the right to vote, to have Senators elected by the people of their states instead of the legislatures, to eliminate poll taxes, to limit how many terms a President can serve. And we can continue to amend the Constitution where necessary to fix other issues. That is how people who want to take Justice Ginsburg&#x27;s advice and take advantage of advances other countries have made should do that.')
