It&#x27;s just that FOSS is terrible at paying experts to do the work necessary to design a service usable by non-technical folks.<p>In other words, I think people look at the problem you&#x27;ve described and assume that it must be open research because no unpaid dev has posted a hobby project to Github to solve it. But that wouldn&#x27;t be an accurate conclusion-- in fact everyone has used Google&#x27;s annoying hairball of sophisticated, hidden techniques which solves pretty much this problem (and probably other problems as well).<p>You wouldn&#x27;t need anything as sophisticated as that. But you <i>do</i> need to pay experts the going rate to design, implement, test, and tweak such a service.<p>If any FOSS orgs had the foresight and funding to do this, I believe it would reveal that all commercial social media networks including Reddit haven&#x27;t &quot;solved&quot; this problem simply because it isn&#x27;t in their financial interest to do so.')
