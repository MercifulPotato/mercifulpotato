If you don&#x27;t want people to blame you for a coup, maybe don&#x27;t make your first public statement about it be a douchebag admission of guilt.<p>&gt;And to you as well, after all, lower lithium prices mean lower prices for any battery-operated electronics. Maybe you&#x27;re behind this coup as well?<p>I would stand to gain a few dollars, Musk would gain billions. As I think the US helped with this coup, I would be behind it as well, but not to the same degree.<p>&gt;I think you can state it more strongly than that. It&#x27;s a conspiracy theory in the mold of infowars.<p>Both the foreign interests ties and the US ties have some evidence, you just can&#x27;t conclusively show Musk&#x27;s involvement. Given the events of the past century, suspecting US involvement in a South American coup is hardly crazy.')
