Item(by='dheera', descendants=None, kids=[25814809, 25814461], score=None, time=1610909442, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25813337, text='Also, I&#x27;m a big fan of U2F keys including Yubikeys.<p>I don&#x27;t use SMS, deprecated it 10 years ago in favor of e-mail, and would never use SMS for 2FA. I still have a virtual SMS number that forwards to my e-mail for the idiot sites that still insist on it.<p>For most people, SMS is hackable, tied to a single battery-powered device, easy to steal (after which for most people in the default phone configuration the SMS verification codes will happily pop-up on the lock screen without unlocking the phone), and hugely inconvenient if you are in front of a desktop computer all day and have to go find your phone (at home for example I pretty much never have my phone next to me). SMS also famously locks people out of their accounts when they go to another country and have to use a different SIM card. Also, if you have a giant desktop in front of you, it&#x27;s ridiculous to not use that as your 2FA device. You should NEVER have to pick up a 6&quot; handheld device for 2FA when you have a massive immobile, hard-to-steal device in front of you that in my case is also physically locked down to furniture.<p>Yubikeys and other U2F keys do exactly this.<p>The article is wrong about one thing:<p>&quot;But if you’ve stolen my laptop and the YubiKey is plugged in, then you’ve got the keys to my kingdom.&quot;<p>No. My preferred way to use Yubikeys is to buy one for each immobile device (home&#x2F;office desktops) that stays plugged in, and ONE mobile key that lives in my wallet. Register all keys with critical services. If any device gets stolen (highly unlikely for the immobile devices, the mobile device is the only one I need to worry about really), go home, log in with another key and remotely disable it.<p>My main gripe is websites that don&#x27;t allow multiple Yubikeys. AWS is at the top of my hall of shame.')
