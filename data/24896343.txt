I would much prefer a setup like that over our current rule that all cypress tests must pass before merging.<p>A better rule might be that at least one unit or e2e test was added or updated to reflect the change in the code, and that that particular test succeeds. But run all the others on master.<p>One advantage (or occasional disadvantage) of Cypress test before merging, is that there is someone clearly responsible for fixing it if a test fails. Problem is, sometimes the failing test has nothing to do with anything the creator of the pull request did. It&#x27;s still a mystery how that&#x27;s possible, but it happens. Hence my feeling that Cypress tests aren&#x27;t very reliable. At least some of ours aren&#x27;t.')
