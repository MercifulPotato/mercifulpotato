Everything I needed was within a 3 minute walk. The dorm was full of my peers. There was always something fun going on.<p>You had a room just big enough for a bed, a desk, and a sink. Everything else was common.<p>If I was a developer I&#x27;d build a &quot;dorm for adults&quot; right next to places like Amazon, but at least around here zoning won&#x27;t permit it.<p>It&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re single and don&#x27;t have many possessions. Inexpensive, too.')
