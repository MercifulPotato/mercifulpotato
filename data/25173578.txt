To bring revenue<p>2. To create incentive<p>3. Social justice (or illusion of it)<p>Revenue from a specific tax is almost never used for a specific purpose. All revenue goes into a large bin from which the government takes to finance everything.<p>Revenue from fuel&#x2F;road tax is not used to finance building roads. Infrastructure is financed from budget or by private companies who then can impose tolls on road users.<p>Fuel tax (besides obvious goal of creating revenue) is there to create incentive to drive less and to drive more efficiently (using less fuel). This is not to preserve roads but rather to preserve capacity and environment.<p>I can only assume that tax on electric vehicles is as a response to increasing use of EVs. Initially, EVs were exempted from taxes to create incentive to use them more. Now that it is pretty clear EVs took off and will be widespread no matter what, some countries start to remove those exemptions to ensure continuing revenue stream.')
