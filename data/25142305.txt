Make non-destructive edits and export.  My workflow is the same though JPG requires a less pixel pipeline during post processing.<p>To put it another way the only difference is that my “archived negative” is a JPG rather than a RAW. But in 300 years I would only bet, and not very much, on physical prints. I’d give JPG a reasonable chance thirty years from now. Proprietary RAW files will probably be readily accessible in fifteen years for the most part.<p>Most of what JPG does is free me from a “raw+jpg just in case.” I don’t think defensively like that anymore...I don’t burden myself with a lot of “a serious photographer would.” What I am making is a picture. There are tradeoffs and the actual pictures I make (not the ones I might possibly make) are how I think about cost and benefit.<p>Disk space is cheap and so I use it write only. The time I spend on file management is expensive, so again write only. RAW + JPG requires much more file management than either alone. Should the JPG and RAW receive the same number of stars? The same tags? Always? I don’t want to spend time thinking about that.<p>For me, RAW represents  an obligation to future work. The picture is never done when it is made. Not ready upon  download.<p>JPG frees up energy for making more pictures. YMMV.')
