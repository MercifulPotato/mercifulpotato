Item(by='jcrawfordor', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611448727, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25886743, text='The FAA has issued a recommendation that pilots who are experiencing a safety problem that they believe to be related to military electronic warfare exercises should use the term &quot;Stop Buzzer.&quot; This term, borrowed from military range safety practices, is intended to make it clear among controllers that they should use a procedure specified with the NOTAM to request immediate termination of the exercise or testing. I am not especially clear on the criteria for use of this procedure, I&#x27;m not sure if a controller would comply without a declared emergency. I&#x27;m also not sure how quick the response will be in all cases - White Sands controllers are in close contact with Albuquerque Center but you&#x27;ll probably see a slower response if you&#x27;re talking to someone else or 121.5.<p>This recommendation came out because there are multiple cases where pilots have declared emergencies related to GPS jamming but controllers have not requested termination of the jamming because of miscommunication or not realizing that the emergency was related.<p>This is all pretty new and it has not really been communicated very well, I only know about it because of something I saw in _AOPA Pilot_. It has been reported that some aircraft, I forget which but I believe a light jet, react particularly badly to loss of GPS and it can get as bad as loss of attitude information, potentially as a result of a bug.')
