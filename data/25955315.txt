That the market is a casino? Taibbi would probably agree with you! I&#x27;ve made money on these bets, so have some of my friends (more money than me, they had more balls than I did and made more risky trades). The general consensus is that these &quot;zombie companies&quot; are worthless, hence the short positions.
