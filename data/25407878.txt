These messages are meaningless because they&#x27;re robbed of any context or compassion. I won&#x27;t feel wonderful and loved because a random string generator on a GitHub readme page tells me so.<p>If you tell me &quot;I like your shoes&quot;, it will brighten my week. If I see you walking from person to person, telling every single one of them that you like their shoes, it won&#x27;t feel like much of a compliment. It&#x27;s not nice nor thoughtful. It&#x27;s just noise.<p>You have the right spirit for trying to make the world a little brighter, but I don&#x27;t think mass-producing generic compliments is the way to go.')
