It will just increase the churn. Witnessing all the cries of &quot;16GB of RAM isn&#x27;t enough!&quot; makes it quite apparent that  software behaves like a gas rather than a liquid, and will expand to consume whatever hardware is available to developers.<p>I think that for consumer products, which these are targeting, software responsiveness, usability, and battery lifetime are by far the most important metrics.<p>These chips help with battery, and can hell with software responsiveness if there&#x27;s is developer focus on it.<p>But what will probably happen is that development teams will buy the fastest computers they can, and then develop software that is mostly, somewhat adequately performing on this beefy hardware, then ship it to customers that are on weaker hardware.<p>This effect is especially pronounced for web software, where it&#x27;s easier to make unresponsive interactions due to so many layers of software, especially with developer network connections usually being 10x-100x less latency than users.')
