Concretely, what are we allowed to say and not say (the Reddit forum question at stake here), how much are we allowed to have and not have as demonstrable assets to qualify for a trade (Accredited Investor and Qualified Purchaser already exist in the private equity world), etc.<p>If you take a step back and put a magnifying glass on the principle, protect vulnerable people, you have to ask, what about:  smoking, drugs, unhealthy foods in an obesity epidemic, extreme sports, combat sports, driving under the age of 18, and many other questions.  What about poor people buying lottery tickets?  If I go to a local bodega, I&#x27;ll stand in line behind people buying lottery tickets, and you can see they are not upper income people.<p>The world is dangerous and we&#x27;re all vulnerable, and yes, some more than others.  Various societies have to decide on the scale of 0 to 100, how much we allow individual to hurt themselves.  The answer will be different in China, Sweden, the United States, and so forth, owing to the values of the societies.<p>How about protecting vulnerable investors by regulating entities like short selling hedge funds?')
