If you want to be taken seriously, either you manage to uncover the con or you use the con against themselves. Otherwise you are just a lame sad loser.<p>Anyway, I am sure you won&#x27;t do any of that. It&#x27;s much easier to just sit on your chair and fool yourself into thinking that you are the only one that knows all the answers and everyone that is trying to work on improving the state of crypto is a fool. What is off-putting about all of your comments is that you dismiss the work or research of anyone as a waste of time (and energy and natural resources) but you fail to provide any kind of compelling evidence that can reject whatever hypothesis people are trying to validate.')
