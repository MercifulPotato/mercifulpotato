There isn&#x27;t really any other reason, as you wrote the Win32 API is backwards compatible as are the X11 libraries and a few other toolkits - perhaps the most stable is Motif, which goes back to the early 90s.<p>Of course they do not have to care about backwards compatibility since GTK is just a library that happens to be popular enough to be widely available but not really part of any platform. The OS itself (Linux) is binary compatible going back decades.<p>It is a bit frustrating though, but really if you want a stable GUI API either write against pure xlib or use something like Motif which even though it barely gets any updates probably wont go away any time soon as it is used in several long standing scientific and enterprise applications (ie. the unsexy stuff you rarely hear about but still work behind the scenes).<p>It might be interesting to see what it&#x27;d take to make Motif a bit more themeable though.')
