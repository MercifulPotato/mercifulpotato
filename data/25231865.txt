In particular, if I&#x27;m using something like minikube to do end to end testing (I develop tooling on top of Kubernetes), remote development is far superior because I can offload a bunch of the heavy lifting away from my development machine. It&#x27;s pretty easy to peg one&#x27;s CPUs using Docker &amp; K8, resulting in CPU throttling and just a slower experience locally.<p>If I were in IT, I&#x27;d not be buying M1 laptops right now for the company. However, for a personal development workhorse, I&#x27;d jump on it. I wouldn&#x27;t miss local docker.')
