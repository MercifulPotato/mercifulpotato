Cloud allows rapid iteration, but doing a bit of self-hosting&#x2F;colocation is such an insane cost savings that I think a lot of folks are really missing out on.  I know at least 1 startup I worked at that would&#x27;ve had a more comfortable runway had they not went wholesale into AWS instead of playing it smart with hybrid.  Paying a small team of folks even an astronomical salary to keep a small number of servers up 24&#x2F;7 and use cloud where it makes sense (S3, elastic CI&#x2F;CD with EC2) should still be saving some companies 6+ figures a month.')
