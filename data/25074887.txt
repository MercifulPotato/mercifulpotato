Multitools are pretty bad as actual tools, we just use them because carrying around an entire toolbox is nuts. It&#x27;s not the versatility that makes them good, it&#x27;s the form factor.<p>If I had to compare tech to real life tools, then IDEs would be food processors: heavy, extremely good at what they do, make some things possible and other things trivial, best at scale. And vim would be, I dunno, a really nice chef&#x27;s knife? But you can&#x27;t serrate a chef&#x27;s knife. Whatever, analogies are dumb.<p>(Emacs of course would be a smart fridge running emacs as an OS.)')
