Anti-competitive behavior is the problem, a monopoly is a specific very problematic example of anti-competitive behavior, but it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s anti-competitive that makes it a problem.<p>Apple may not be a monopoly.  They&#x27;ve definitely set up the ecosystem to be anti-competitive.  Whether that&#x27;s harmful to consumers (which is what matters) is debatable.  I tend to think it&#x27;s harmful, but they&#x27;ve done such a complete job of locking it down that it&#x27;s hard to even compare without having to change a <i>lot</i> or things, since they control and exclude others from the hardware all the way up to sales transactions for services, and everything in between.<p>That said, the fact that Apple was able to quickly cut their fees from 30% to 15% for some developers just because of growing public sentiment seems to indicate that competition is not working well to normalize these app store fees, and that likely means developers and by extension users are paying more because of that.')
