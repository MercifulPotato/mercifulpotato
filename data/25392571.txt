Every so often, a version of Windows seems to come along that gives you a genuine improvement over what came before - in my view Windows 98 SE, Windows XP and Windows 7 for example, which may represent the nostalgia valleys. Other intermediate versions seem to at best introduce new problems to replace the old ones.<p>Of course, it would be great to have the Risc OS experience while doing modern computing tasks, so I&#x27;m pleased to hear that the lessons it brought to the world have not been forgotten.')
