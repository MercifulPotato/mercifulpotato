My static method would be explicitly coded to return a particular implementation, and there would be a separate static method for each kind of service you need. (Eg: one per interface if you&#x27;re using interfaces for the return types.)<p>No registration or configuration is needed, because the types are hard coded. If you need mocking support, a single IsTest config setting could be used in a conditional statement to determine which implementation to return.<p>That&#x27;s very little additional coding if you use a ternary statement, and it lets you opt-in to the mocking mechanism if&#x2F;when&#x2F;where you need it, instead of permiating your entire architecture with it.')
