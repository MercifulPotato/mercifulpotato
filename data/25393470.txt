Item(by='falcrist', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607731310, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25391985, text='Freedom of speech in the broadest sense (as in &quot;the freedom of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, censorship, or sanction.&quot;) isn&#x27;t binary, and cannot be absolute. There are some forms of expression that we almost universally agree shouldn&#x27;t be allowed. Incitement to violence, &quot;shouting fire in a crowded theater&quot;, depictions of sex with minors, etc are all unprotected from restriction.<p>In that sense it&#x27;s like the concept of freedom in general. It&#x27;s slippery, difficult to define, and has fuzzy boundaries. We&#x27;re not always going to agree on the extent of each freedom. Where does your freedom end and mine begin?<p>In this particular case, how big does a company need to be before we start forcing it to host content that it doesn&#x27;t want to host? When is it ok to force someone to provide a universal platform... to tie their hands so they can&#x27;t moderate as they see fit?<p>Do I have a right to stand on your stage and shout whatever I want at your audience?')
