If someone sends you a group text, you won&#x27;t see it. (The only distro that seems to have partial support for it is Ubuntu Touch, and there it seems incomplete; sometimes I would receive group messages and sometimes not. I missed a few important ones this way.)<p>This is probably only relevant to those in the US as I understand MMS is not as prevalent elsewhere.')
