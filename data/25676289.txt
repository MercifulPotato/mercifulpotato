I don&#x27;t want an integrated development environment - I want a modular one. And as one of those modules, I would love a simple, lightweight code editor. UTF-8 only, auto-indent, a file list column, a good find-in-page feature, and file type dependent syntax highlighting and multi-line comment key. That&#x27;s all I need. It seems I am always stuck between bloated IDEs (or bloated text editors like VSCode and Atom) or painfully low-featured ones like notepad or nano.')
