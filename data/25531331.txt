Its&#x27; beautiful, and has a nice mix of carrying forward old storylines and settings and mixing in new things. It also made a lot of characters more authentic to me than the original one - e.g. the turks felt more like real bad guys. Aerith character is great too.<p>What I&#x27;m not too sure about is whether it was the right decision to stretch the Midgar part of the story that much (I&#x27;m already at 45 hours in chapter 17). The original FF7 had a lot more places to offer, and climbing up a buildling or moving through sewers or tunnels for 2 hours isn&#x27;t that exciting compared to that.')
