In these cases, a you will most likely already be provided with, or at least recommended an Ingress Controller.<p>Setting up K8s clusters from scratch on bare metal (or even worse, VMs) is generally not something you should be doing, unless you really know what you&#x27;re doing and have a good reason to. Think: going &#x27;Linux from Scratch&#x27; instead of installing Ubuntu. K3s is not an alternative to K8s, it really just is a distribution for bare metal deployments. So is Rancher, OpenShift, etc.')
