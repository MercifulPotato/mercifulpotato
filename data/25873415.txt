They had tech talks showing the full system architecture on YouTube that didn’t get more than 10k or so views. A quick search indicates that a lot of those are gone now (maybe just outdated) and the channel is more marketing heavy now, but just as low trafficed.<p>They also open source a lot of their core technologies. The main database they used was “AtlasDB”, a relational layer on top of Cassandra. It’s open sourced and actively developed, and again, nobody seems to care, with it at a measly 700ish stars - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;palantir&#x2F;atlasdb" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;palantir&#x2F;atlasdb</a><p>People just like a good boogie man story, and after 2 decades of being labeled as such eventually you just stop trying to fight it I guess.')
