This sounds like an interesting book.<p>The phrasing used on the web site is &quot;Post-accident attribution to a ‘root cause’ is fundamentally wrong.&quot; At first glance, it sounds like the author means there is no cause that can be found so you shouldn&#x27;t try to determine the cause. First they clarify by saying there are many causes not just one. However, this phrasing made me scratch my head:<p>&gt; The evaluations based on such reasoning as ‘root cause’ do not reflect a technical understanding of the nature of failure but rather the social, cultural need to blame specific, localized forces or events for outcomes.<p>I don&#x27;t know what other organizations are like, but where I work, when we do a &quot;root cause analysis,&quot; we aren&#x27;t literally looking for a single cause, despite the name. The &quot;root cause&quot; is almost always that pieces a, b, and c came together in an unexpected way. I can definitely think of places where I worked where they were mostly out to place blame, though, and I guess that&#x27;s what they were trying to caution against.')
