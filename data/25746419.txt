I think articles like this are about the story as much as if not more than their informational aspect. They are kind of like cool stories you tell your friends. You can see it the conversational sentences in this article.<p>Especially if it&#x27;s an article and not a video when I could easily skim to the end to read the conclusion if I don&#x27;t want to read the story. I feel disrespectful towards the author if I want the conclusion up front.')
