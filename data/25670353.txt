That said, I don&#x27;t think that being apparently &quot;nice&quot; to protestors is necessarily a convincing proof that you are somehoe &quot;letting it happen&quot;. If you are outnumbered and the situation isn&#x27;t directly threatening, then it may be better to keep the situation from becoming threatening while you call for reinforcemens. Then the problem was that they were outnumbered to begin with, which could shift blame upwards. It&#x27;s going to be obvious from investigating communications, whether reinforcements were called in, how quickly they were sent.')
