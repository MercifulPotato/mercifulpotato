Your approach makes several assumptions and gives a lower bound IFF those assumptions hold.<p>The upper bound is useful for the general case: no attacker will be worse.<p>You&#x27;re trying to account for more sophisticated attackers, which is great! It is however not clear (without further motivation) whether your attacker model is realistic. That is: will their be an attacker who knows this much about your password generation approach, but does not know more?<p>If no realistic attacker would know this much, your approach gives an overapproximation (real bound is higher). If, otoh, there is an attacker who knows more (eg, seed of the PRNG, or first characters, etc.), it&#x27;ll be an underapproximation  (real bound will be lower).<p>So, the difference is that the result of the first approach can directly be interpreted, while the result of your approach needs context.')
