Refreshing with new hardware capabilities, and it seems they thought it through with the addition of a universal (yeah ...) hex format to support both v1 and v2 platforms from a single file.<p>The new nRF52833 MCU [1] seems pretty capable and certainly inline with what is being used in industry for suitable applications (it&#x27;s an Cortex-M4 64 MHz, 128 KB RAM, 512 KB flash, Bluetooth) but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have <i>hardware</i> support for any ML-specific stuff that I could see.<p>Oh, and there has been a keming accident on one of the images that is a bit unfortunate, the word &quot;MakeCode&quot; looks a great deal like &quot;MaleCode&quot; which is perhaps not optimal in their context [2].<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nordicsemi.com&#x2F;Products&#x2F;Low-power-short-range-wireless&#x2F;nRF52833" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nordicsemi.com&#x2F;Products&#x2F;Low-power-short-range-wi...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.microbit.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;latest-revision&#x2F;assets&#x2F;blog&#x2F;software-overview-v2.svg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tech.microbit.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;latest-revision&#x2F;assets&#x2F;blog&#x2F;s...</a>')
