For GCC and clang, you should use [] (empty square brackets) to denote a variable length array at the end of a struct. For msvc, [1] is used all over win32 and is explicitly supported for that purpose.<p>Edit: it&#x27;s UB because you&#x27;re accessing past the end of an array with size given at compile time.')
