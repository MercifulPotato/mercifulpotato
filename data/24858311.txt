If you come back to the country with both your old phone and new phone you&#x27;ll have problems. But if you leave <i>without</i> a phone or laptop, and come back with both, without packaging, with apps and files loaded and everything, and claim you&#x27;d brought them in Brazil originally, you&#x27;re fine. So that&#x27;s what people do.<p>If you have a legitimate need to bring multiple devices to and fro, at one point there was a form you&#x27;d fill out at the airport when leaving where you&#x27;d put down serial numbers and they&#x27;d verify on return.<p>With something like a PS4 it might be a <i>little</i> riskier, but you could probably spin some kind of story they&#x27;d accept, as long as it appears similarly used and not in packaging. (&quot;I was visiting family and my nephew wanted to play PS4 so I brought mine for the week!&quot;)')
