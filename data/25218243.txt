Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.&quot;<p>What most people do is ALSO pass up optimizing that critical 3%, so software gets slower and slower. What he (probably) really meant is: &quot;don&#x27;t micro-optimize what a compiler can do better, optimize your algorithms and data-structures&quot;<p>Some common excuses for bad code:<p>- Shuffling data around needlessly? Not a problem. It&#x27;s fast enough.<p>- The algorithm is bad. Not a problem. It&#x27;s fast enough.<p>- This is obviously bad. Not a problem. It already takes minutes, so a few more won&#x27;t matter.<p>- The code is slow. Not a problem. It&#x27;s only used internally.')
