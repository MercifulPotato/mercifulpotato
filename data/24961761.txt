This RNA may encode a protein, or can have a function in and of itself, such as tRNA, mRNA, or rRNA. Promoters are located near the transcription start sites of genes, upstream on the DNA (towards the 5&#x27; region of the sense strand).&quot;<p>In programming terminology, the promoter region listens for events, and is followed by a handler body. So protein concentrations can be used for state.<p>Regarding the calcium gradients you mentioned, I wonder... I think they are more about inter-cellular communication. Cells can use calcium to make electricity. Calcium is also used by neurons to send electric pulses.<p>I actually find it fascinating that neurons are not unique in using electricity to communicate - that an analog exists in the plant world.')
