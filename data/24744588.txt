Why is nested data better than flat data? If you think about it, there&#x27;s really nothing wrong with either.<p>The only reason you would want to structure your data like that is if you want to think about the Box as a whole from a more abstract level.<p>But there&#x27;s nothing wrong with writing an entire app that focuses on the measurement of the left bottom side of a box. If that&#x27;s the requirement, than there&#x27;s no need to define the measurement as part of a higher order type &quot;Box&quot; if you&#x27;re not doing anything with the other measurements.')
