If the physical sensor were moved, the most straightforward data schema would call for the coordinates for the Sensor table to be updated, but then the historic data would have the wrong coordinates if you did a join.<p>The ideal solution is to design a bitemporal schema so that rows are only ever inserted, not updated, but failing that, regular automatic database snapshots are a good start.')
