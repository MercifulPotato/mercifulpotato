It seems to me that the topic was politicized early in the US. I&#x27;ve followed Fauci&#x27;s meandering diplomacy from time to time, as well as disagreements between federal and local responses. Maybe some trade-offs were made.<p>There is one complaint I had about experts in Europe, too, and that is that they resorted to a &quot;king&#x27;s lie&quot; about masks at the beginning of the pandemic. Certainly none of them said you shouldn&#x27;t wear a mask, but they downplayed their importance when there weren&#x27;t enough of them yet for the medical staff. IMHO, they shouldn&#x27;t have done that. Instead, governments should have regulated mask trade and distribution from the start like in some Asian countries.')
