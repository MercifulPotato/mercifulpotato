That&#x27;s the biggest benefit, and another reason I&#x27;m buying it (on top of great performance for my NLE apps). I want the Mac to be it&#x27;s own platform, and be under Apple&#x27;s control and vision. If it&#x27;s also made foul-proof and air-tight, so much the better.<p>I don&#x27;t want another lowest common denominator OS converging on the same point.<p>If I didn&#x27;t want platform control I&#x27;d buy some OEM device...<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean I approve of any and every restriction. But I&#x27;m ok with a &quot;walled garden&quot; -- better than an open garden full of junkies and garbage. Some of the best Japanese gardens and so on I&#x27;ve seen had walls around them...<p>Of course an open garden that&#x27;s beautifully maintained, respected by those in it, etc, would be even better, but that&#x27;s hardly the case in real life, so that&#x27;s where curation and walls come in.<p>To me this brings me to the Amiga and Atari and Acorn and other alternative platforms of my youth. I don&#x27;t want everything to be amd64 and Windows or the nth Linux distro.<p>In any case, Apple doesn&#x27;t force anyone&#x27;s hand, if anything they make it more difficult to buy their stuff (more expensive, targeting the expensive end of the market, only 10% market share at best, different OS and now different CPU than the rest of the market, etc).')
