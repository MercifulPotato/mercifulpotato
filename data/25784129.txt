It is not easy to find another blacksmith. Without the right blacksmith, there can be no magic.\n</code></pre>\nWhat? That runs counter to my experience at every company where I&#x27;ve either seen data engineers or worked as one. My observations of how management treats the two groups is this:<p>Data engineers (&quot;blacksmiths&quot;): Blacksmiths are paid less. People think of them as less highly educated. Their work is less creative. When they are successful, their work is mostly invisible. They are interchangeable. People think of what blacksmiths do as more like scripting than writing code. Blacksmiths mostly work on configuring systems they didn&#x27;t build. Blacksmiths do more troubleshooting than building. Their roles are focused on support.<p>Data scientists (&quot;magicians&quot;): Magicians are paid more. Much more. People think of them as more highly educated. By definition, what they do is magic. They work on prominent projects. Their successes are highly visible. They build large systems that only they can comprehend. They use support staff to clear away mundane obstacles so they can focus on unique, highly creative aspects of work.<p>Saying that we need more data engineers than data scientists is like saying that we need more janitors than CEOs. That&#x27;s true, but it&#x27;s true because <i>we made it true</i> by structuring projects around one prominent, well-paid person supported by a staff of invisible drudges.<p>This smacks of the positive self-talk that QA and software testers used to give each other: &quot;We are indispensable! We take pride in our craft! Nothing can ship without our signoff!&quot; And then lots of companies reduced their QA or eliminated it wholesale by focusing on continuous delivery and changing consumer expectations of what &quot;broken&quot; or &quot;acceptable&quot; means. The same fate awaits data engineers.')
