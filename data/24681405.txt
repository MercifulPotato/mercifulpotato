They&#x27;re not disposable commodities that need annual refreshes. I&#x27;m not buying any more Sonos equipment. I was done five years ago.<p>Sonos is trying to deprecate their older models and introduce planned obsolescence. They had a program to brick your old equipment in exchange for rebates on newer models. That was totally wasteful and wanton, and the Internet called them out on it.<p>They have so many competitors now, including the tech giants which control streaming. Google is in a feud with them and could cut off access.<p>Sonos is in a very precarious spot.')
