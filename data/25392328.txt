And those studies do find differences in efficacy (just because the old vaccine was 96% effective doesn&#x27;t mean the new one can&#x27;t do better) as well as in occurrence rate of side effects.<p>There have even been studies where the vaccine that you get in the control arm of the study is the vaccine against Meningitis and then after a year or two they do give you what ever vaccine you had not received yet. (Sorry, forgot against which disease the vaccine under test was protecting.)<p>And of course there is double blind studies where you get three injections, one of which is saline, two are active. They are given a few weeks apart, you don&#x27;t know the order and they check antibody level in the blood every week.')
