This feature is used exclusively by our own developers and almost exclusively on our own properties. It&#x27;s used on a whopping 0.8% pageviews (once again, almost exclusively on our properties). So now we will not remove it&quot;.<p>&gt; But sure, try to weaponize anything related to web components at every opportunity.<p>No. That was a very recent example, and that example had a number of pageviews in it, so it serves as an interesting comparison of approaches.<p>0.8% pageviews by Google&#x27;s own devs for a standard Google rammed through despite objections? Oh, it&#x27;s good, ain&#x27;t gonna remove it. 1-2% pageviews by people outside Google for a standard Google had no say in? Oh, not gonna do anything about it.<p>And if you paid a grain of attention, I also have this to say about Google&#x27;s hypocrisy (with links to Mozilla&#x27;s stance on standards and to Chromes feature list page):<p>--- quote ---<p>when other browsers consider standards harmful, Chrome just ships them<p>--- end quote ---<p>Which is a fact of life regardless of my feelings towards particular standards.<p>I can add another link, of course: Web API counts across browsers [1] It&#x27;s so nice to see Chrome  shipping in total over 1000 more APIs than competition, of them many considered harmful, and including over 600 browser-specific APIs. Because it&#x27;s all for the greater good.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web-confluence.appspot.com&#x2F;#!&#x2F;confluence" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;web-confluence.appspot.com&#x2F;#!&#x2F;confluence</a>')
