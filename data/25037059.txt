In order to get anything done, you need allies.<p>Most people simply don&#x27;t care about the things that matter to you. It&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re opposed, but that they are apathetic, and it&#x27;s certainly not their top priority. Even if they roughly agree, they almost certainly prefer some other version of it.<p>A party is a way of trying to reach a majority by putting a selection of issues together that you can all at least agree to, if not favor. You hammer out one acceptable version of legislation: not anybody&#x27;s favorite, but one nearly everybody in the group can at least tolerate. The less they like it, the more they will need some encouragement to vote for it -- which includes your promise to vote on their favorite thing.<p>Every proposal to change the system seems to be predicated on the idea that if only your idea could be presented in isolation, people would leap at the opportunity to pass it. That&#x27;s simply not the case. Most people simply do not care, and any effort to make them care is going to be some variant on a political party.<p>Democracy is, at core, about getting large groups of people to compromise. No variant of democracy absolves you of the need to negotiate with people who at best don&#x27;t care about you. There are many, many different ways to govern ourselves, but none of them will give you that sense of purity you seek, where you get to vote on your favorite issue and then ignore everybody else&#x27;s.<p>It&#x27;s fundamentally messy and will always, in the language familiar to HN readers, be full of &quot;smells&quot;. Systems predicated on eliminating the smells, rather than living with them, are always going to be toys.')
