Maybe it&#x27;s due to the high Christian population.<p>I think many European countries that are very sexually open such as Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark are doing just fine. I also think that OnlyFans is an important service that gives sex workers the power to work for themselves in their own homes as opposed to having to make a living through less safe options. Customers get more personalized content and sex workers get a higher percentage of their payments while avoiding potentially physically or emotionally abusive situations - seems like a win-win to me.')
