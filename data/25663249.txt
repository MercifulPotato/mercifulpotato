Walter Cronkite is 50s to 70s, the postwar figurehead when there were like 3 TV channels. That&#x27;s where the notion of a shared reality comes from. And I guess this was still pretty strong into the 90s, everyone watched gulf war I on CNN right?<p>Whereas Walter Duranty was a big deal in the 20s &amp; 30s, in much more fragmented &amp; volatile times. Although how much their fragmentation resembles ours I don&#x27;t know.
