Competition is good, and Windows vs Linux is competition. We don´t want to remove variety even if the Free software is the one that &quot;wins&quot;<p>This reminds me of DirectX  vs OpenGL in the late 1990s and  through the 2000s. DirectX under Microsoft rule did not have to answer to any committee, thus the progress and groundbreaking technology that it enabled was really good. Meanwhile, The OpenGL consortium had to argue to get just one feature into the standard. It was very slow.<p>Another example was .NET vs Java. Even though Java was &quot;driven&quot; by Sun (and then Oracle) a lot of the new features were done via consortium and thus its development was slow. .NET instead got LINQ and other really nice improvements during that time. Now, I haven&#x27;t programmed in .NET since around 2005 (I don´t do Windows), but I appreciate that they are pushing software technology.')
