There will still be a race to update your entry in the auction as close as possible to when it runs, because equity markets do not operate in a vacuum.  Correlated futures markets don&#x27;t operate this way (and the regulatory lift to make them do so is separate, and just as hard as doing this for equities), so there is still a race to incorporate the most up to date information ahead of a periodic auction.<p>2. This _will_ widen the bid-ask spread and reduce liquidity, for the following reasons.  There are right now 16 distinct exchanges, excluding dark pools.  As a market maker, I want to show my quote to buy&#x2F;sell to as many participants as possible, and so I quote across a decent subset of these exchanges at any given time.  I _don&#x27;t_ want to get simultaneously filled on all these orders, and am relying on the fact that most of the time if I get filled once, I can cancel from all the other exchanges and then re-evaluate what I think the fair value of the stock is, and put out new orders reflecting that view.  The more confidence I have that I can do this, the tighter a spread I can offer, and on the flip side the more risk of overfill there is, the wider I need to quote to account for that risk.  In a simultaneous periodic batch auction world anyone can take all available liquidity market-wide trivially, so I have to either reduce liquidity across the market to a lower level to cap my risk, or substantially widen my quote to make that risk economically viable.  Both are ultimately bad for counterparties.<p>3. This would likely serve to entrench existing wholesalers unless they were forced to stop crossing orders internally, or otherwise play by a stricter set of rules (and good luck with that).  The vast, vast majority of retail activity never sees a public marketplace, but is executed by a wholesaler - so if you&#x27;re leaving them out of this picture you&#x27;re not really changing much.<p>My personal $0.02 on this is that the latency race is just a turf war between liquidity providers, but has no real impact outside of that arena.  There are other areas of needed reform: market fragmentation to the degree it exists today is a net negative IMO.  Similarly the market-wide best execution requirement is just extra complexity and creates opportunities for regulatory arbitrage.  The proliferation of exotic order types and &quot;differentiating&quot; exchange behavior adds complexity and creates opportunities to game the system.  Exchanges charge exorbitant fees for access that create barriers to entry for smaller participants.  To name a few.')
