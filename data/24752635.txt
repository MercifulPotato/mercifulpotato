I only use SRS for (independent and disconnected) atomic-type knowledge that I need to drill. My rep loads are generally not onerous, so it&#x27;s not a problem that necessarily affects me too much.<p>Agree. Also agree that actually using something is more important than how good it is. I just strongly object to:<p>&gt;outdated algorithm corresponding to worse or better results to me is neither here nor there. There&#x27;s evidence that the repetition interval itself is not the critical factor in retention.<p>claiming that algorithm does not matter, especially from people without experience actually using both.<p>&gt;(Example: I learn through cognitive dissonance so I use it primarily to deprogram certain associations in my head. For instance, the word &quot;oficina&quot; looks like &quot;office&quot; to my English brain, but the word actually means &quot;mechanic&#x27;s workshop&quot; in Portuguese. Or &quot;pretender&quot;, which looks like pretend in English, actually means &quot;intend&quot;. SRS helps me drill the Portuguese meaning into my skull. I use SRS to memorize bits of knowledge that don&#x27;t fit anywhere and that are hard to create a context for.)<p>you look to be describing exactly interference: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supermemo.guru&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Interference" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;supermemo.guru&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Interference</a>\nyou might find 20 rules article useful for it: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supermemo.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;archives1990-2015&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20rules" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.supermemo.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;archives1990-2015&#x2F;articles&#x2F;20ru...</a><p>&gt;I have looked into SuperMemo in the past because I was attracted to the prospect of a general pro-level memorization tool. I use complex pro tools all the time and was not fazed by the learning curve, but I felt the UI was, let&#x27;s say, overfitted to the creator&#x27;s personal preferences.\nIt was a purely emotional decision but I knew I wouldn&#x27;t use it regularly, and the best SRS tool is one that one would use over one that one would not.<p>That is understandable. I will say: I personally like the interface. To anyone reading this, I might seem insane but for a high-level user it just clicks and works (with few quirks here and there). Likely because I lack imagination I can&#x27;t imagine how I&#x27;d make it look nicer while still maximizing usability.<p>It is of course terrible to share with newcomers. But I&#x27;ve taught many people SuperMemo, I think the main issue with the UI for most people is just that you don&#x27;t understand it. Once you get over that I think it&#x27;s not so bad.')
