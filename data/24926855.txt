I order a can of paint from Lowes. They send me the wrong color. I reach out to their customer support. I ask them to send me the correct color of paint. They inform me that they don&#x27;t have power to do anything as they aren&#x27;t the correct team. I ask who the correct team is. They give me a phone number to call for a customer support line that closed three hours ago. I call the next day, and they tell me that they too are powerless to do anything and that I need to return the can of paint I ordered online to the brick and mortar store.<p>At this point, I don&#x27;t give a shit about the $16 of paint, I&#x27;m not spending two hours of my day to return this can of paint at the lowes store on the other side of town. It&#x27;s about the principle. A sane company would have replied with the first (and only) customer support team with something like &quot;I&#x27;m so sorry! We are shipping you the correct color right now.&quot; That sane response used to be the norm 10 years ago, because a $16 loss on one can of paint is far less than losing a customer for life who will now make it their life&#x27;s mission to deter friends and family from patronizing your business.')
