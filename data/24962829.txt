Very sincerely, there’s a lot of commentary here that is one small step removed from The Red Pill or MRA toxicity, and unfortunately the site guidelines allow it to be treated as if it’s innocuous and fair &#x2F; civil discourse.<p>Is it possible that valuable contributions to a discussion could be &quot;one small step removed from&quot; negative, toxic, or detrimental ideas? For example, someone could say &quot;inequality is increasing and its reaching a critical point where we may have to do something about the staggering amount of wealth held by the 1%&quot; or &quot;gun rights were enshrined in the US constitution so that a tyrannical government could be changed by force&quot; which could both be interpreted as a small step from extralegal measures to rectify the situation according to the speaker&#x27;s values, but may also be interpreted as a justification for legal measures (in the former case) or a recitation of historical fact (in the latter case).<p>I mention this because part of the problem I have observed in social media discussion of controversial issues is that on the one hand, people use certain tropes&#x2F;memes as signals to invoke a particular perspective and people have responded to this by inferring their interpretation of this reference and jumping to condemning the perspective they believe has been referenced. This makes the discourse seem bizarre to outsiders who lack the requisite background knowledge to make those same inferences and polarizes people by suggesting that some signals are always used to refer to certain perspectives and not others.')
