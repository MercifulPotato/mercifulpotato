Back then, us silly gamedevs would argue with ILM that they needed to transition from CPU to GPU based rendering.  They always pushed back that their bottleneck was I&#x2F;O for the massive texture sets their scenes through around.  At the time RenderMan was still mostly rasterization based.  Transitioning that multi-decade code and hardware tradition over to GPU would be a huge project that I think they just wanted to put off as long as possible.<p>But, very soon after I left Lucas, ILM started pushing ray tracing a lot harder.  Getting good quality results per ray is very difficult.  Much easier to throw hardware at the problem and just cast a whole lot more rays.  So, they moved over to being heavily GPU-based around that time.  I do not know the specifics.')
