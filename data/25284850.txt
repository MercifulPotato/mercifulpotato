If you don&#x27;t like your opinions being hidden, you just have to go build your own community of millions of people. Simple. And of course, nobody should be concerned that the communication channels for ~all forms of public debate are privately owned.<p>Look: I don&#x27;t mind being downvoted. I don&#x27;t care about karma points. But the HN system is one where downvoted comments are <i>hidden</i>, which is itself a form of censorship. Marginal opinions are routinely buried -- and I&#x27;m not even talking about my own. I upvote unfairly grayed-out comments that I disagree with, all the time.<p>It is deeply ironic, for example, that my parent comment about censorship is now hidden at the bottom of the page, in light gray, because <i>one person</i> downvoted it.')
