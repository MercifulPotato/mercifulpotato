Item(by='Aachen', descendants=None, kids=[25684095], score=None, time=1610102650, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25681088, text='I really think that the vast majority of people, say 90%, really don&#x27;t think &#x27;this is still &quot;in dispute&quot;&#x27;. Of those, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if a decent share disagrees on the severity of the problem, and probably 95% of those 90% have very little idea about the time-sensitivity of the issue in the first place. However, virtually nobody I speak to thinks it&#x27;s a non-issue, and if you look at polls about whether the government should do more against it, you usually see a large majority (and that&#x27;s only a subset of those that acknowledge that there is an issue at all).<p>Perhaps murica is, as usual, an outlier among generally educated countries, but let&#x27;s not pretend like there is too much dispute to get things done on this topic, or that denying it is anything more than a conspiracy theory with a vocal troll&#x2F;joke aspect to it as well as a couple of real conspiracy theorists.<p>The biggest problem is that people don&#x27;t believe they can do anything. A family member of mine wants to put a solar park in a nearby field. &quot;Great!&quot; I said, &quot;I&#x27;ll chip in!&quot; Realizing I wasn&#x27;t doing it for monetary gain (I don&#x27;t live nearby enough to really profit from it), they then told me to not be &quot;more catholic than the pope&quot; (not sure if that translates well) and wouldn&#x27;t accept the money I wanted to put towards this directly effective good cause. They (singular) are not doing it for the climate, they don&#x27;t believe it will make a difference. They think it&#x27;s a good investment for their own riches. But they don&#x27;t think climate is a non-issue, just that they can&#x27;t do anything about it, nor believe that there would be a sufficient majority to collectively (i.e. have the government) do something about it.<p>I mean, they&#x27;re right about this being absolute peanuts, but the presence of solar fields and wind turbines also sends a message to those who learn of it: we can do this, we are doing things, it is economical, let&#x27;s go for it.')
