All the while they will rope off large sections or shut down escalators for months while there is ZERO work being done.<p>There was a Subway station called Runnymede that took about 5-7 years and when completely you couldn&#x27;t tell they did anything. I am sure it cost 10&#x27;s of millions of dollars and could have been completely started and finished by a private contractor in a couple months.<p>The city has never been manage properly because there are no consequences to the ineptness of the Politicians and bureaucracy that run it. You could complain (a lawyer friend did) and they basically either ignore or make up some story how difficult it is to lay 200 sq&#x2F;ft of tile and clean an escalator...These things take years of hard work and planning....<p>Surprised the city doesn&#x27;t come crashing down under it&#x27;s own weight of dysfunction but they seem to prop it up by the endless tax or fee increases.')
