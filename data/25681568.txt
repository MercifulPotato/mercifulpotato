And they are running more often (they weren&#x27;t running 24&#x2F;7.<p>I work in imaging, visited 100s of hospitals in Canada and mainly USA.<p>Would be uncommon to see a unreported list in USA with exams 24 hours or older.<p>In Canada it was common to see months.\nThese are scans performed but not interpreted by a radiologist .<p>So for urgent cases(like dieing in the hospital), there is hardly any wait and read right away.<p>But if it&#x27;s somewhat none urgent (friend waiting 1 year for a MRI for nerve&#x2F;back pain), you might have to wait awhile for the scan and then the report.<p>If you in a population dense area, you might be waiting awhile, but may get quicker service in smaller nearby towns(I had a 3 month wait for. Knee scan, went for a 2 hours drive for a scan a week later)<p>Our public healthcare has caps on how much a radiologist can read&#x2F;get paid, so there is no incentive in Canada for radiologists go full force.<p>In USA they are paid per exams, and depending on case types could be reading 100s per day.')
