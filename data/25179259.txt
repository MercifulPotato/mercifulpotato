The point of a signature is to make it obvious to both parties that they are making a binding agreement and to bring all the terms of the agreement together in one contract.<p>A signature also makes it so that someone must commit a felony to misrepresent what you agreed to by forging your signature, no matter how easy it might be to forge. It also creates evidence of their crime.<p>The article’s complaint seems to be that it might be easy to forge a signature, electronically or physically. Forged signatures are almost never an issue in contract disputes, and when they are, it’s almost always petty small time crime like check fraud.<p>Solving something that is not actually a problem, using an extremely complicated tool like cryptographic signatures, which require a huge amount of tooling around the storage of private keys and the identification public keys, is backwards.')
