You’re paid just for being an employee, not for hours worked.</i><p>This used to be true, but has changed in a lot of states and cities in the last decade or so.  Many people still think that salaried=work as long as the boss says.<p>In those places, being salaried doesn&#x27;t mean you have to work unlimited hours with no compensation.  This only applies to managers.  If you don&#x27;t directly manage people, you are legally entitled to overtime.  Pre-pandemic, some states were cracking down on this.<p>It&#x27;s worth checking your state and city&#x27;s labor laws every couple of years because things change all the time.')
