Humans are social animals, and we have evolved a set of rules to guide human communities by. We call this morality (there&#x27;s an interesting discussion about biblical&#x2F;religious morality vs atheist morality, but it&#x27;s interesting because of how similar those moralities are).<p>If your goals never align with those of your community&#x2F;organisation, and you don&#x27;t need the community&#x2F;organisation to help you succeed in them, then ignoring morality will help you succeed in your goals.<p>But if your goals are aligned with your community&#x2F;organisation, then morality is actually a great guide as to &quot;behaviour that has been proven to work well&quot;. This, I think, is what the article was talking about.<p>As a manager, my experience is that dark traits are always a negative for the organisation. The goals of the individual and the organisation soon diverge, and the goals of the individual take precedence for them. Managing them so their needs stay in line with the plan is an extra burden, and you never know when they&#x27;re off planning something evil.')
