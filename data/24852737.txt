Item(by='1vuio0pswjnm7', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603317828, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24849147, text='&quot;I think Google is the best search engine.&quot;<p>The OP is arguing that this case is about default settings, similar to the Microsoft case.<p>In practice, someone else is deciding what is the &quot;best&quot; search engine for the vast majority of users, as these users never change default settings.<p>It is arguable Google is paying millions of dollars to remove choice, and the question of what is the &quot;best&quot; search engine. If there were no &quot;search from the address bar&quot; or other &quot;built-in search&quot; with Google set as the default, what would happen.  Would users choose Google.  We cannot know because Google&#x27;s distribution agreements have foreclosed the issue.   Even if we all agree users would choose Google anyway, because it is unquestionably &quot;the best&quot;, this does not explain why Google, with its monopoly on search, pays millions to become the default.<p>Because the use of a search engine has been made a matter of &quot;settings&quot;, e.g., address bar as search box, and not a conscious choice, e.g., typing the address of a search engine, Google&#x27;s distribution agreements have removed user choice.  The choice of search engine has already been made for them.<p>It is like crapware that comes pre-installed on computers.  One can argue users make a &quot;choice&quot; whether to use these programs or not, but the choice of whether to install them in the first instance has been removed, in exchange for payments.  Sometimes the distributors make it difficult or near impossible to remove these programs, assuming a user even knows how to remove programs.<p>Thanks to Google&#x27;s negotiations with distributors, in order to &quot;not use Google search&quot;, users have to change &quot;settings&quot;.  Generally, relatively few people ever modify settings. Hence there is a certain permanence to &quot;settings&quot;.  Companies pay millions to become the &quot;default&quot;.  There is nothing inherently &quot;illegal&quot; in making such agreements.  However when the company paying millions to become the default <i>already has a monopoly</i>, then we have to question what is the true purpose of these distribution agreements.')
