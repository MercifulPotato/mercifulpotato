I just got one to the charger.<p>I will say though, half the ones I tried connecting to didn&#x27;t connect, and the other half seemed stuck or upside-down, or broken. This is not promising for if I am going to use this for telepresence... I might have to call someone to right me or fix me.<p>Also, your app doesn&#x27;t seem to provide any sort of exclusive control... I am pretty sure I was fighting another driver for control?<p>EDIT: Additional piece of feedback, I see the charger is not included or sold. While the site says it&#x27;s just a Qi charger... having a Qi charger in an orientation that&#x27;s well-suited to easily docking a relatively questionable driving device... absolutely worth selling.<p>I&#x27;d be hesitant to buy a product like this without that charging solution, I&#x27;d strongly consider one with it. Sell the charging station, even if it&#x27;s a separately sold item that&#x27;s basically a retail Qi charger and a 3D-printed holder for it.')
