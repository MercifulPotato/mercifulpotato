You pay them where your main residence is.<p>So on the other side of the spectrum you have Austria which has high income tax (because socialism and income equality) but basically no inheritance taxes, and taxes on assets are levied on their original purchase price so you end up having countless residents who earn small incomes but are sitting on millions of euros of wealth due to exploding real estate values but only pay 5 Euros tax per year as that&#x27;s levied against the purchase price from 60 years ago when their grandparents bought it for pennies.<p>So you end up with huge wealth inequality where even people with good incomes pay high taxes and are priced out of the real estate market if they don&#x27;t come from families of means.')
