Of course, AI is in every aspect of advertising and content recommendations to &quot;help&quot; you make more targeted choices. I speak as a former insider who spent many year building advanced systems for increasing conversions.<p>What&#x27;s worth talking about in 2020 though is:<p>- What is the differential power that companies with advanced AI hold over other smaller players like mom and pop stores or smaller retailers? Is AI sophistication the new &quot;income inequality&quot; since smaller companies that can&#x27;t wield that power get out-competed by larger players, leading to extreme concentration in the hands of few as time goes on?<p>- Compared to 2000-2010, what is the net increase in 2010-2020 for consumerism for someone making the same salary given online + AI influencing buying behavior? How does that fare for 2020-2030 and is that a sustainable path for the planet?<p>- How is AI influencing our buying habits and consumerism in general? Are we buying new type of things we&#x27;d never have considered before? Does it change who we are as people?<p>- Why are we not using AI to weed out bad reviews just like we do for email spam? Is the lack of AI in the right places equally harmful in making us buy more? Does Amazon really not have the resources to score reviews given how obviously fake top reviews tend to be for almost every non-brand item you look up on amazon?')
