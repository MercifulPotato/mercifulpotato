That’s exceptional in my opinion.  I could write a script that would register 10k of those in several minutes.  But the more likely scenario is that I can’t be the only one that has realized this...nobody knows how many people are doing this once or a few times.<p>That is the whole point of this conversation - the <i>possibility</i> of incredibly easy, undetectable fraud renders all votes meaningless because we simply don’t know how much occurred and there is no way to find out because the rules are so loose.  Until they are changed, it completely negates any point in voting.')
