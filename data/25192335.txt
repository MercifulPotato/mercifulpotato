They don&#x27;t say &quot;Ignorance is bliss&quot; for nothing.<p>If you don’t say anything to the person who can increase your compensation, you might start caring less about your work, which could be noticed. Worse, you might start having feelings of resentment towards the company, manager or even your colleagues, depending how much you like them.<p>If you ask for a raise without mentioning your colleagues, and don&#x27;t get it, you won&#x27;t be too happy knowing what you know. Or to be more specific, believing what you believe, that you deserve the same compensation as your co-workers.<p>If you ask for a raise, don’t get it and then bring up your co-workers, I assume this would prompt your manager to give you reasons why your situation is different. But it&#x27;s possible you might think these reasons are BS.<p>These are, of course, hypothetical scenarios, but it&#x27;s not bad to consider them.')
