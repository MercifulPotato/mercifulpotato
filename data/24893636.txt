So they banned councils from building houses in the 80s. House builds plummeted from 300k per year to 30k per year. Plus they forced the council to get rid of their affordable housing by letting people buy their council house from the council.<p>So now, when poor people who are guaranteed a house need one, the council have to buy a slot from the free market (and obviously need to go for cheap).<p>Now the UK has a housing crisis.<p>Yay, free market.<p>Basically, the opposite of what you think. The council didn&#x27;t &#x27;choose&#x27; to put people there, they were forced to by the market and disasterous neo-liberal policies.')
