And the change is happening fast, fast enough to not leave much room for adaptation, you will get extinction of key pieces needed for our survival instead of adaptation. And something that is slower to adapt is a civilization tied to the ground by buildings and agricultural fields.<p>20,000 years ago the Earth was 6 celcius colder. From 20,000-10,000 years ago the Earth warmed 6 celcius. Humans benefitted greatly from this warming and we didn&#x27;t yet have technology which enables us to survive extinction.<p>I believe asserting that climate change of an average increase of 1.8celcius as extinction level is quite inaccurate.<p>&gt;And even if you can call &quot;record&quot; what can be indirectly deduced from ice cores, the records they are talking are methodically measuring and registering them live. Those records are the broken ones.<p>We could discuss why you believe that science to be inaccurate. Could you tell me more please?<p>&gt;With the lockdown, less circulation and flying, it may have helped to add less carbon to the atmosphere than we the previous year. But adding less doesn&#x27;t mean that will be a reduction of what is already is in excess, the carbon added to the atmosphere could stay there from decades to centuries, and we keep adding new carbon to that furnace (fossil fuels, and positive feedback releasing frozen carbon around the poles). Even with full zero emission the carbon that is already there will keep increasing global temperature averages.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I necessarily follow. The paris&#x2F;kyoto accords are focusing on reducing emissions but your assertion is that we are passed the limit and that it continues due to a positive feedback loop. Then the proposals by the paris and kyoto accords are wrong. That would make me want to re-evaluate the entire topic.<p>Did you know that after 9&#x2F;11 terrorist attacks and air traffic being grounded for 3 days dropped global temperatures by 1.1 celcius? Certainly something the airlines don&#x27;t want the public to know; the amount of planes with giant engines spewing ridiculous amounts of diesel&#x2F;jet fuel in the upper atmosphere has a huge effect on temperature.<p>Obviously we didnt end airtravel but we have dramatically reduced the amount of planes in the air. People are staying home in lockdown. We absolutely should be seeing reductions in temperature. Since we aren&#x27;t, it makes me question the original premise.')
