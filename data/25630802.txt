Wikileaks has exposed a number of US war crimes that went completely unpunished, while a person who was working on behalf of Wikileaks is being prosecuted on grounds that are fairly constructed and far-fetched even by US standards. Morally speaking, even if some of Assange&#x27;s actions were immoral they might be considered excusable because the perils were outweighed by the benefits of these actions. It&#x27;s not uncommon to reason that way. The same kind of reasoning is used to justify the means by the ends, e.g. purporters of the US drone strike program argue that the many civilian bystanders that are killed by those strikes are justifiable by the end, which is the extrajudicial killing of the alleged terrorist targets.<p>It&#x27;s called a balance of consideration argument, sometimes also &quot;conductive argument&quot;.<p>Obviously, the legal question is different from this, IANAL and I don&#x27;t even know if lawyers use conductive arguments in this way. The judge in this extradition case certainly didn&#x27;t, but that&#x27;s not surprising since her job wasn&#x27;t to judge Assange&#x27;s actions.')
