Police department budgets have absolutely ballooned in many places, but crime hasn&#x27;t really dropped a commensurate amount. (In Seattle, police budget has increased over 33% in the past decade, while crime rates haven&#x27;t moved.)<p>Reductions in policing are paired with increases in spending on community and social programs that address the root causes of crime rather than just punishing those who turn to it from necessity.<p>With the two combined, it&#x27;s plausible that reducing police funding could actually reduce crime rates if the money was well invested elsewhere.')
