This is the wrong interpretation - restrictive measures do not increase your <i>absolute</i> risk at home. They were talking about the relative risk between two scenarios - which allows for misunderstandings. The last sentence which was omitted in your quote was:<p>&quot;These lines of evidence support that SARS-CoV-2 transmission is facilitated by close proximity, confined environment, and high frequency of contacts.&quot;<p>What the paper ought to have said was, when more restrictive measures are in place, it is important to focus and step up measures for the people you interact with most - because those people in this new and different scenario now become the most likely people for which you will catch an infection.<p>The people you interact with have not suddenly become more risky in an absolute sense, but they become a more important risk factor when situations change.<p>Trying to draw conclusions between the relative risks between two different scenarios is not the same as absolute risk. This is the trap!')
