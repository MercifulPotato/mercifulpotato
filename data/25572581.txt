The largest group who do not require licensure are those who fit into the &quot;industrial exemption&quot;, engineers employed by a company to work on products manufactured and sold by said company.  This particularly affects electrical and mechanical engineers.<p>I was an electrical engineer for four years to start my career, and I never even took the FE exam.  It likely would have limited my career progression at some point, but it never would stop me from working as an engineer.<p>[1] In the US.  Since this article is from <i>The Atlantic</i> and is about &quot;Life in the Simpsons&quot;, I am going to assume the US for the context of everything I say.')
