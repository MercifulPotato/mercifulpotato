Current mandatory lockdowns in Europe affect mostly the private area. There are nightly curfews and you sometimes can&#x27;t go alone into the forrest, but you have to go to the office if your boss says so.<p>Rather, the idea is to 1) stop unneccessary contact in the workplace, and 2) do so in a solidaric fashion, protecting those who still have to go to work or those who are affected most by the loss of income.<p>For example, there is currently an outbreak at Airbus in Germany. I can&#x27;t understand why people still have to work there ATM.<p>I&#x27;d gladly sacrifice some industrial production and growth - meaning I&#x27;ll have to wait a few months longer for the new TV or Car I wanted to buy - if we can the the pandemic under better control and resume somewhat normal life earlier.')
