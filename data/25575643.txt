Can&#x27;t we achieve more in terms of performance and flexibility if we skip triangles pipeline  and do all rasterization and pixel color calculation in computed shaders? For example you don&#x27;t need to carefully choose tesselation level (or spend memory for many different zoom level lods and then trying to avoid lods switching artifacts) for models and fases with many smooth curves if you can do resolution independent rasterization straight from sdf&#x2F;nurbs&#x2F;b-splines in realtime. And it seems like having much less overhead due to 2*2 pixel overdrawing of many triangles just for visual curve effect.')
