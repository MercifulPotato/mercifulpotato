The interaction between people is far too difficult to model as a consumer, so it&#x27;s better to consider the business model, or, more weakly, how a decision affects social capital, thereby affecting this model. This helps create &quot;trustless&quot; scenarios, in which the &quot;morals v profit&quot; quandary is meaningless because both align to some degree.<p>For example, take Apple and Google. Google profits heavily from adverts, so it is not only sensible but natural that Apple, as a strong rival in the OS field who have no business incentive to do so, should lean heavily into this, exploiting and actualising this gap in business-model-incentive. Likewise, Apple profits heavily from phone hardware: it is sensible and natural that Google, who somewhat rival Apple in this field, should desire somewhat to try and present their phones as being less overpriced.<p>This is far harder glean information from, of course, and PR can be as genuine as it can be deceiving. But it&#x27;s a useful tool in a savvy consumer&#x27;s arsenal, methinks, especially for large decisions or with companies whose practises and profits are well-known (as opposed to, say, a brand of toothpaste).')
