I&#x27;m just not following how suddenly with the M1 all Qualcomm needs to do is make a chip of the same size and it will be just as performant. The disparity in performance isn&#x27;t new with the M1, Qualcomm ARM CPUs have been slower than Apple ARM CPUs for nearly a decade now. What was amazing about the M1 is that it beats even the best power hungry x86 chips in many single thread tasks as well, not that it suddenly jumped ahead Qualcomm (Apple was already ahead of Qualcomm). Also the business case isn&#x27;t new, Qualcomm has been trying to display x86 laptop chips for years and has fallen short on performance every attempt. The M1 does not present a new challenge or new opportunity in this space, just better execution.')
