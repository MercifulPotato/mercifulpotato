Turns out it&#x27;s lucrative to scream &quot;they took yer jobs&quot; on cable news all day long, but not so lucrative to accidentally energize a bunch of racists into taking action on it. And you can bet that if &quot;ordinary people&quot; hadn&#x27;t been completely on board, they&#x27;d have burned down the statehouse before letting &quot;Boss Hogg&quot; restrict what the &quot;Duke Boys&quot; can do on their own farms. (Granted, Dukes of Hazzard was Georgia, but you get the drift.)<p>Also-- &quot;circulation of elites&quot; seems more fitting to describe what happens when you see someone like David Frum start appearing regularly on MSNBC instead of Fox News.')
