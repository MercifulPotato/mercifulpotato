Remote fetches should never use any information from the remote site as a top-level context.<p>That is, if I navigate to foo.com which serves an image from bar.com, bar.com can set cookies, etc., and on future visits to foo.com the foo.com-&gt;bar.com context should be used.  But if I go to hat.com and it serves an image from bar.com, none of the foo.com-&gt;bar.com context should be used, only the hat.com-&gt;bar.com context.<p>Disabling third party cookies gets you maybe 60% of this, but we need to keep going, disabling all caches, etc., except as tied to the context of interest. It&#x27;s probably also time to get rid of the idea of &quot;visited&quot; for a link and similar features that use global information rather than information scoped to the currently visited site. And, of course, eternal vigilance against browser fingerprinting attacks.<p>Since this would cripple a fair share of targeted advertising, we might not see this appearing in Chrome (although they do offer third-party-cookie-blocking, so there&#x27;s that), but we should definitely see it in Firefox.')
