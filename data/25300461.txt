It relates the wars described in LOTR from the point of view of Sauron&#x27;s soldiers (they are regular humans, the &quot;orc&quot; descriptions are a ridiculous libel).  Unfortunately, the rest of the book describes the continuation after the wars and it is much less engaging, since you cannot draw parallels with the original story.')
