This is all happening today.<p>The only projects that will be more seriously affected by this decision are WINE and similar - projects that are copying the API but not the implementation. Even here, it is very likely that WINE could win on Fair Use, since their copying is obviously done for interoperability.<p>Also, APIs are obviously creative human works, and their purpose is first and foremost usability for the end-user.')
