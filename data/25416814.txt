Banned? Lost all my data? OMG.<p>Then I got error &quot;502 That&#x27;s all we know&quot; after entering my passwords.<p>Finally I realized it couldn&#x27;t be just me, so I opened HN and confirmed my suspicions.<p>It&#x27;s all up and running now but I was really scared.<p>I&#x27;m really curious what happened because it surely looks like Google has a single point of failure in their authentication mechanism which is just horribly wrong. The company has over two billion users - a situation&#x2F;configuration like this just shouldn&#x27;t be even theoretically possible.')
