Two things that strike me are that someone can build an &quot;iPhone X replica&quot; out of a bunch of commodity parts. I have a couple of older computer re-creations, a PDP-8, a PDP-11, and an IMSAI 8080, that were built as replicas using mostly off the shelf parts. So when someone 40 years from now is building an iPhone X replica for nostalgic people like me, it will be something like this perhaps.<p>That said, as a nerd I am pretty dense when it comes to fashion and have never understood the &quot;signalling&quot; that goes on. Even when kids at school wore counterfeit iZod polo shirts to signal elite status? I could never figure that out. But I recognized that it was really important to some people that they be perceived as fashionable, and without the means to pay the prices resorted to fakes.')
