This helped me to build on the next features, Readable UUID now has an Inverse which returns UUID given an Readable UUID. Additionally, now you generate a small 32 bit human id like “11 green birds happily buzzed” and later on, you can verify this short readable against original UUID. Plus some of you asked about entropy reduction in Readable UUID, I have added a section in the README called “How it works?” and proved how it&#x27;s 128 bit and no entropy is lost.<p>Thanks,\nDebdut')
