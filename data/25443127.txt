Item(by='armoredkitten', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608130166, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25440540, text='I&#x27;ve been using i3 for about six months or so now, and the biggest thing I&#x27;ve realized is that Alt+Tab as a way to switch between windows is such a frustrating approach to window management. Once you have more than two windows I need to switch between, I am constantly losing track of which one is next in the queue.<p>i3 (and other tiling managers) let you more easily navigate between windows by using their <i>location</i>. I can switch to the window to the left, or to the right, or use i3&#x27;s tabbed interface to navigate windows similar to a browser, or switch between workspaces. But the point is, the windows are always in the same order, in the same location (unless I move them), so I find it so much easier to quickly switch between them.')
