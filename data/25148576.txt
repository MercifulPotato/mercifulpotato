Have a small hardware watchdog which, when not being tickled, will power off the whole system for 5 seconds and power everything back on.<p>Write code to periodically tickle the hardware watchdog when everything is 100% healthy, or when 3 reboots have happened in short succession (you&#x27;d prefer the system up with 90% of the hardware working than bootlooping).')
