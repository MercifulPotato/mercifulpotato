The moon engine needs to operate in a vacuum. And its landing craft can robotically land itself, after hovering, looking for a suitable landing site, and then softly sticking the landing.<p>The question is if it’s harder to land on earth, where you must deal with the atmosphere, versus on the moon, where there is no atmosphere.<p>My guess is that they’ll stick the landing.  Or at least, get really close to success on the first shot.')
