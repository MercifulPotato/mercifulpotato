The algorithms seem to be designed to feed into division and biases. It&#x27;s absolutely no business what conversations others are having and yet this precise metric is being leveraged to abuse people into generating income. You and I can ignore social media but it seems to have caught an alarming majority in its wake. Add in misinformation and encouraging division and it&#x27;s a troubling state of affairs, especially when it is proving to be so very profitable.<p>I definitely agree that a morality police can only make things worse, but a fact police may help :-)')
