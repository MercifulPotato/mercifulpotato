If you start at 6 figures, a single breach can land a company well into the billions, and insurance premiums would be way too high for corporations to stay in business. I know there are a lot of &quot;well good, fuck the corporations&quot; sentiments out there, but these are corporations which can be economically viable <i>and securely protect consumer data</i> if they are given some time to improve their security. We absolutely should walk the price up over time, but let&#x27;s give people some time to develop and implement a security competency within their organization (not to mention growing a security <i>auditing</i> competency sufficient to handle the scale of <i>all businesses</i>) before imposing ruinous insurance premiums.')
