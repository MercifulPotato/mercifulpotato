If it has to fetch the CRL from the CRLdp or do OCSP with the OSCP AIA, like CAPI does, then it definitely has to have an error for when certificate revocation status is not available.<p>Honestly, even if I provide the cert &amp; CRL, it should probably be able to throw an error if either one has invalid ASN.1 encoding or such.')
