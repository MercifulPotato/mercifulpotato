I&#x27;ve worked in China and been in the country multiple times over the last few years.<p>I&#x27;m Chinese. I still have family there.<p>&gt; In Mao&#x27;s times you had to carry the little red book in your pocket, were put into a factory or lined up against the wall.<p>This is funny because Xi is emulating Mao. Instead of a red book, Xi has a yellow book.<p>&gt;  Today foreigners can go to the country, start a business and you can work where you want. Over the last five years in particular the situation for businesses has gotten better because the courts actually have started to function and address stuff like IP claims. Still slow for foreign business in particular, but if you think modern China, one of the world&#x27;s most integrated economies, is comparable to the Mao era I truly don&#x27;t know what to tell you.<p>If you know enough about history, the credit for opening up China to the West goes to Deng Xiaoping and not Xi. Also you&#x27;re talking past tense. In the present, foreigners are being squeezed out.<p>&gt; China is also, ironically enough, probably one of the most fiscally decentralized economies on the planet. If you look at the degree of economic autonomy regions have, you won&#x27;t find it really anywhere else.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re reading, but a good percentage of companies are either state sponsored or state owned. Still, you weren&#x27;t completely off. Continued decentralization of the economy was the trend before Xi, but Xi is reversing it now. I&#x27;m speaking of the near future and not the past.<p>What you&#x27;ve written was largely true a few years ago but not so much now or the near future.')
