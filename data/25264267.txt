I setup debian-administration.org at least partly to document things I&#x27;d learned, tried, or discovered.<p>It was a useful resource for a few years, but it never really took off and I had the pain of dealing with spam and user-support.  So now the site is read-only archive-only, and offline.<p>But it was a good experience.  Forcing myself to document things &quot;nicely&quot; really helped make sure I learned things and didn&#x27;t need to refer back to my own notes in the future.')
