Yes, you can install the latest Windows on a 1.6GHz dual core PC from 2006, but it&#x27;s not going to make a great PC. On the other hand, it makes a fine host for a NAS device or some other home server, or a router&#x2F;firewall, or a media PC to hook up to the TV etc.<p>An iPad or iPhone would do much of the same, and in some ways better or for different uses. It uses less power. It could be used as an in-wall display. It could be a WiFi repeater, or an access point given a USB ethernet adapter. People are creative, if you give them the chance. And none of those things really care if the battery is flat.')
