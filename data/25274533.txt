Offline rendering (ray&#x2F;path-tracing) or real-time rendering were the main topics of all my projects over the past 6 years. Optimizing existing code and writing new low-level code is what I find most rewarding. Would like to work with Rust.\nRecently, I have also been enjoying working with big data streams for ETL pipelines (Flink, Kafka).<p>Thanks!')
