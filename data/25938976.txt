Other cars can usually do this too.<p>The car will pre-heat the battery for optimal charging temperature before arriving at the charging location. Not all EVs do this, they should. Cold-gating during charging is a big deal when traveling long distances in below freezing temperatures.<p>A Tesla can also check if there are free spots in the charger. No other car does this as far as I know.')
