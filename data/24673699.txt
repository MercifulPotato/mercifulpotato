What I tell folks I mentor is that a job isn&#x27;t serious if there&#x27;s no stocks or bonus in the compensation package.<p>For that specific example, it&#x27;s because there was no risk on your end for developing the product. To capture it&#x27;s value the IP would have needed to be developed outside the company and licensed to it. But that&#x27;s way more risky.<p>&gt; So why should I have ever gone above and beyond in the first place? Meanwhile my manager repeatedly complained to me that I only worked 9-5.<p>You shouldn&#x27;t have, at least, not there. Clearly they had no clue how innovation happens and how to create an environment where the type of people who innovate ends up.')
