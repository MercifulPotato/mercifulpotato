But look at Louis Rossman&#x27;s Youtube channel, he rants about the common defects in the bad Apple products better than I could.<p>&gt; <i>Also, the comment about people refusing to think is a bit obtuse, don&#x27;t you think? Assuming that people who buy Apple products don&#x27;t think is a ridiculous claim</i><p>It was the nice variant of what I was trying to say ;) The mechanisms of Apple fanboyism work like a religion or a cult, and that&#x27;s not a novel thought by me. In that context it&#x27;s not absurd, it really is what happens: People buy these products often enough without an ounce of thought, it&#x27;s religious conviction and our primate brain wanting to signal status. Not always of course, but often enough. And that does produce the negative reaction in others -&gt; parent was asking.')
