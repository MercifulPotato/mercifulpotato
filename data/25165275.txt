Or the reality just being that it didn&#x27;t have product market fit with employers.<p>Specifically:<p>- 48 hour response time (not enforced)<p>- bidding transparently on candidates (90% of the companies revealed a low ball offer in person after the fact, a mystery that is no different than not using Hired)<p>They should have just stuck with Dom Periognon redistribution.<p>It is probably a sustainable business and brand just as a tech recruiter and shedding all of its dead weight - like the massive valuation and creditors.')
