You measure kinetic energy of the projectile.<p>Formula:\n(mass * (velocity * velocity)) &#x2F; 2<p>Weighting is simple, but for measuring velocity you need a chronometer.<p>The great composite crossbow I linked above had 1257lb draw weight, and it managed 420 Joule energy with a 320gram projectile.<p>By comparison, Tod Workshop&#x27;s 1000lb windlass crossbow shot achieved 110 Joules <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;kHnZo6ELEV0?t=591" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;kHnZo6ELEV0?t=591</a><p>This is to give you an idea that crossbows of similar draw weight can vary wildly with their projectile energy. Note the composite crossbow used wood &#x2F; great horn and it had much longer bow arms.<p>The 160lb draw weight longbow in the Tod Cutler &#x2F; Joe Gibbs mythbusting video managed 123 Joules (10m from target) and 109 Joules (25m from target). Arrow weight was 80gram.<p>And the staff sling I linked above managed 107 Joules with a 3000grain (194gram) stone.')
