It seems unethical for an individual lawyer to bring spurious lawsuits as a matter of practice.<p>If my elderly grandfather goes to a doctor and says “here’s $100k please chop of my leg because I want to” the doctor won’t do that. If they did they may lose their license.<p>Seems like similar issues would exist for a company saying “here’s $1M please file  lawsuits to block a company’s funding rounds.”<p>While it’s legally allowed, it seems like professional ethics should prevent it.<p>Of course it’s really hard to show what’s spurious.')
