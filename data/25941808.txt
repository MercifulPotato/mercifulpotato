Item(by='jug', descendants=None, kids=[25941924], score=None, time=1611842451, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25940725, text='&gt; Finance is highly regulated and arbitrarily so.<p>But how can you regulate that people get together and buy stock? They need... 1) Internet bulletin board. That&#x27;s it. The barrier of entry is just so damn low, and that&#x27;s in part also why this has happened. In hindsight I&#x27;m surprised it hasn&#x27;t happened before but I suppose Covid-19 brought this on.<p>I think it would be easier to regulate something that at least takes a certain amount of investment in terms of insight or knowledge, but here you can just take any random heavily shorted company and like... get people on a popular board to buy stocks over a day.<p>This time, sure, it was Reddit and the subreddit may be suspended. Next time it&#x27;ll be a Discord or Telegram board or something. It&#x27;s just... so easy')
