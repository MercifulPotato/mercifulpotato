Item(by='yowlingcat', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605534040, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25109357, text='&gt; Personally, it reminded me of how people say &quot;it&#x27;s not a sprint, it&#x27;s a marathon&quot;. Yeah, but Haile Gebreselassie runs the marathon at an average of 20 km&#x2F;h. Some people really do operate at a heck of a limit.<p>I wonder if that might be missing the broader point of the saying. Yes, it&#x27;s true that some people do operate &quot;at a heck of a limit&quot; but it&#x27;s much more true to say that human beings, compared to other animals, have distinct advantages and disadvantages. Bear in mind that few other species can actually &#x2F;generally&#x2F; run marathons -- we evolved the ability to sweat and engage in endurance ran &#x2F;in the pursuit&#x2F; of persistence hunting.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s just a personal thing these days, but I&#x27;m even more curious about min-floors than max-ceilings. Not just because of patterns like this, but because the thought leadership trope of &quot;let&#x27;s look at a leader in the field and figure out what we can learn from them&quot; is not very useful. Figuring out why it&#x27;s so easy for me to get into decent aerobic shape pretty quickly as a human being (for millions of years, it was useful for hunting) is a lot more enlightening.<p>So to get back to your point, JC is probably even more of a &quot;marathon runner&quot; than he looks like. I&#x27;ve seen that with all great engineers (and founders) -- they have the patience and opportunism to pull solutions out of a different problem space from scratch for a six to seven year stretch of time.<p>It&#x27;s not about working hard. It&#x27;s not about working fast. It&#x27;s about merely surviving -- and getting creative with how you go about doing that. And it is almost always about efficiency.')
