Xorg has this one problem, Wayland has countless problems.<p>Xorg is stable and proven for decades; Wayland has been incomplete and buggy for decades.<p>I don&#x27;t run Wayland, PulseAudio, DBUS, or SystemDumpsterFire on my system, and don&#x27;t miss any of them.<p>I don&#x27;t run strange binary code on my system either, so keyloggers aren&#x27;t really a concern.<p>I find it ironic that people who routinely shovel foreign binary code onto their system (even automatically downloading and installing it, no less) from untrusted and untrustworthy third parties, are so all-fired concerned about these trifling imagined Xorg security problems.')
