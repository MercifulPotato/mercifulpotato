The nanometer names are only kinda comparable within a single company, but they are <i>not</i> comparable beyond that.<p>It&#x27;s like saying that Chrome is 6x further ahead than Safari because Chrome is on 87 and Safari is only on 14. Same thing with fabs here, it&#x27;s just a version number that counts down and has been for a long while.<p>In this case specifically, Intel&#x27;s 10nm is more or less the same density as TSMC&#x27;s 7nm. TSMC&#x27;s 5nm is then a significant 1.8x the density of their 7nm process, so right now Intel&#x27;s fabs are ~identical to what AMD is using (7nm), but Apple&#x27;s use of TSMC&#x27;s 5nm then puts them a generation ahead. TSMC is leading, but by a single generation not by 3-5x or whatever. Or to put it in year terms TSMC is about 2 years ahead of Intel right now, Intel just now getting &quot;volume&quot; 10nm up &amp; running while TSMC was at a comparable node in volume 2 years ago.<p>As far as &quot;performance&quot; goes, though, so far TSMC, even their 5nm process, cannot quite match Intel. Remember that as far as the fab goes, performance is just what clock speeds can be hit, and Intel&#x27;s clocks are the highest - they have the fastest transistors. 14nm+++++ is a meme&#x2F;joke, but the actual transistor speed of it is still downright impressive. How fast a CPU actually runs depends on the architecture, though, which is influenced by density but in terms of pure single-core performance that&#x27;s really almost entirely just architecture.')
