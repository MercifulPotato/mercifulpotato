Django is here to help me model my database, handle few permissions and bring few API up online, I see no problem with having a PWA in front of it. Are you trying to get all of your website server rendered ? In which case you could do that without having to worry about integrating it with Django... TBH after 5 years of react and 8 of Django, i&#x27;m just not mixxing them up except for the front-end calling a query on the back-end (which both can be served at the same domain using nginx) ;')
