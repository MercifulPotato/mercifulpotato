Again, another program I hope to bring to the web someday (similar to how I ported StoryHarp from Delphi to the web a couple of years ago):\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pdfernhout&#x2F;PlantStudio" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;pdfernhout&#x2F;PlantStudio</a><p>That idea of breeding plants in simulation (and then later music) came in part from &quot;The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design&quot; (a 1986 book by Richard Dawkins).<p>I can also credit a computer music course I took at Princeton circa 1984 from Paul Lansky with helping inspire the idea of generating interesting sounds and soundscapes. Although before that was playing around with sound on the Commodore PET including via a four voice sound card (an amazing thing back then in the late 1970s) and then on the VIC-20 and C64. Having an electronic organ in the house growing up was also another influence (including as keys would get stuck on) -- as was a tape recorder. Hard to remember how difficult any sort of electronic music and sound was to do in the late 1970s and early 1980s... Now it seems almost trivial given smartphones and laptops...<p>I can also credit a graduate course a SUNY Stony Brook called &quot;Understanding Math through Art and Music&quot; which I audited. I made a final project on a Mac that randomly generated eight musical notes. It was not much of a project (and not even a full octave span) -- but it made me realize that there is art in how we choose to take randomness and convert it into something tangible or audible.<p>One key early idea early on was also learning from a Commodore PET newsletter how to make a stream of pseudo-random numbers from a simple algorithm -- which I eventually used to generate terrain for a VIC-20 game called Intruder Scramble (inspired by the Scramble Arcade game). That video game helped pay for part of Princeton. And that idea of a repeatable stream of pseudo-random numbers to define a derived repeatable structure you can explore then made its way into PlantStudio and EvoJazz&#x2F;MusicalPhrases. Minecraft uses a similar idea for producing repeatable terrain from a seed value.')
