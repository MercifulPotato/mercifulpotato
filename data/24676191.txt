I would much rather have a good filter than mechanically removes infectious particles, wildfire smoke, and particulates in general.<p>For a residential recirculating system, the relevant parameter is flow rate times fraction of particles removed in one pass.  An AC or heater generally has a high flow rate and needs a filter to keep the heat exchanger and fan clean regardless. The added material and energy cost of a good filter is low.<p>On the other hand, if you are moving air from one space to another and don’t want to contaminate the space you’re moving air to, the absolute filter &#x2F; sterilizer efficiency may matter. Things like HEPA may be useful here.<p>I would be surprised if a UV lamp is cost effective for new installation. For retrofit in a system that can’t handle a better filter, maybe.')
