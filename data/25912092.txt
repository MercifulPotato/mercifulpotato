It’s expensive so not designed to sell a lot of them but everything I’ve read says it’s a extremely good bike with every one riding it saying if they had the spare cash and wouldn’t miss the money, they would buy one without hesitation.<p>An observation with every review I see on an electric motorcycles is every one says they thought they would miss the sound but instead the motor whine and the quietness adds to the experience. The motor whine and the torque&#x2F;instant acceleration is supposed to be addictive, sounds like something out of Star Wars accelerating.<p>I like the sound of various engines, old thumpers, v-twins, v4’s, inline fours, straight through systems etc but don’t think I’d miss them, electric is another evolution of them.<p>A lot of complaints and policing a round motorcycles is the noise. Most people put after market exhausts on for the performance but that’s no longer required with electric.<p>I think the power characteristics, the low centre of gravity means once range issue is better with bikes they will be a more pure experience.<p>The lower noise will make longer journeys less fatiguing, it means national parks&#x2F;country roads won’t be trying to ban bikes because of sound, same for dirt bikes etc etc.<p>I’ll probably miss ICE bikes and they will become classics but electric will also be an evolution of the motorcycle.<p>For me riding is about how the bike handles, the performance, where it lets me go. You are much more involved riding a bike than a car and you also take in the environment much more. How a motorcycle looks is important to me but I’m far less concerned about the image which is Harley’s marketing or all the custom cafe racers you see coming back these days.')
