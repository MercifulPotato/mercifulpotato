Lemme make it clear for you, so there is no misunderstanding. I do not nor have said anywhere that I have disdain for people with disabilities.<p>Furthermore, coloring is an end-user business, not yours as programmer. Lemme explain this as well, since I am somehow under the assumption you are missing a full point of how modern operating systems works.<p>All modern operating systems have a window manager that is in charge of setting, among a lot other stuff, also the colors. They get those colors from the end-user current selected theme. If the end-user wants in his theme a memo to be red and a combobox to be black, then all the programs running on that end-user better have memos red and comboboxes black. Any one of those programs that do not let the operating system set their font, font color and background color of various components are breaking the end-user trust. And here is the amazing kicker! You, as a programmer, have to do absolutely nothing about it. All modern IDE&#x27;s&#x2F;compilers will do this by default.<p>Now, if you mess around and change that because you, as programmer, &quot;know better&quot; then you&#x27;re a poor programmer. One way to redeem yourself is to let your users set the colors in your program under a Settings page.<p>Final thought. In regards to user with disabilities, they have different disabilities and different coloring needs. So this &quot;cool kid&quot; who thought dark mode is not burning their eyes, is the one disregarding them, not me.')
