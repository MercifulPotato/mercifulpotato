It&#x27;s a form of thinking out loud, and intensely personalâ€”a way of finding out how one understands oneself and the world by writing about it. This is actually the origin of the term &#x27;essay&#x27;, which means &#x27;attempt&#x27; and is intrinsically informal. Citations would be out of place.')
