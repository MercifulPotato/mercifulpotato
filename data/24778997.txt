They do know their place: it&#x27;s making money. The problem is that in our corporate market-based economy any culture producer that does not relentlessly focus on profit and scale will be outcompeted and destroyed by one that does.<p>Corporations are incentivized to hand the reins to the money people because the larger market structure means they will die if they don&#x27;t.
