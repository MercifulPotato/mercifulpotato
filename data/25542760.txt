Item(by='nicbou', descendants=None, kids=[25543503], score=None, time=1608982000, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25542317, text='&gt; The idea behind outsourcing is that you can spend additional hours doing paid work<p>There&#x27;s a whole section of the article that argues that this is not possible. You can&#x27;t scale your income up and down on a whim.<p>&gt; Of course, it also assumes that people can choose exactly how many hours they work at their regular hourly rate, which isn&#x27;t usually the case, but that&#x27;s a separate quibble.<p>It doesn&#x27;t. There&#x27;s a whole section just about it. Have you read the whole post?<p>&gt; You can&#x27;t look at your fixed expenses in terms of a fixed amount of each hour&#x27;s wage if you&#x27;re increasing the number of hours worked.<p>There isn&#x27;t a linear relationship between your gross income and your disposable income, but that doesn&#x27;t invalidate the calculation.<p>You could say the same about health insurance and income tax. The former is capped (in Germany) to a certain amount, so it becomes a fixed expense past 56250â‚¬ per year. The latter is a progressive tax, so it doesn&#x27;t grow linearly with your income.')
