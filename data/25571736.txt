OSM is great when it comes to the actual road geometry (esp. bike and pedestrian roads), although it often gets the speed limits wrong. For pedestrian travel analysis I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the best dateset available, since it includes all those &#x27;unofficial&#x27; paths that everybody uses, but are often left off official maps. It is however pretty terrible when it comes to buildings and addresses. You don&#x27;t have to get many km out from major cities before a lot of buildings are missing, and the numbering of buildings is often either missing or wrong.')
