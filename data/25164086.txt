Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605901414, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25160303, text='&gt; I don&#x27;t see ligatures solving any important problem.<p>I see ligatures as solving, imperfectly, the problem of &quot;my language has clumsy operators because it wasn&#x27;t designed with support for unicode operators&quot; lining up with the preference of &quot;I prefer less-clumsy operators&quot;.<p>If you don&#x27;t have the first problem then, even if your language <i>also</i> supports ASCII multicharacter operators, its just an autoformatter issue.<p>Aside from the ambiguity with similarly-appearing genuine single characters, programming ligatures tend to not really solve the problem they set out to in monospaced fonts, where you end up with a single symbol which invariably preserves the width of the ASCII multicharacter symbol, which either introduces extra empty space or extra visual weight or, often, both.<p>&gt; My personal opinion is - and I&#x27;m fine taking negative karma for this - that ligatures mostly appeal to the front-end developers among us.<p>I&#x27;ve seen more praise for them from corners of the Haskell&#x2F;Idris community than from the much larger front-end community. I don&#x27;t think there is any real correlation between working in front-end and preferring fonts with ligatures.')
