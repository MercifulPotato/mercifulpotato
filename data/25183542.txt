Item(by='pm90', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606105150, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25182201, text='&gt; But also by stacking the offers, I believe I&#x27;m getting more value here than they do.<p>Your data is valuable not just for the immediate value that its used for (e.g. grocery stores predicting how much they need to restock of product X aggregating over consumer choices of all users). Its also useful as a data point in larger statistical analysis of an &quot;audience&quot; (i.e. a group of people with certain attributes) to marketing organizations. Every datum that they get makes their models somewhat more accurate.<p>Most of these analysis are still pretty primitive today (AFAIK, maybe someone from the NSA or G00G can say otherwise). But these tools are getting better every year, and so is the value of your data.')
