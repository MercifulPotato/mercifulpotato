Minimum wage working 40 hours a week would net you ~$15k. How do you expect to raise a family of four on less that $300 a week?<p>What do you think will happen if the wealth gap grows further and more and more people become angry and unhappy? Riots and revolution are only a matter of time if the gap keeps growing. Having billions of dollars in an offshore bank will  mean nothing if we continue on the same path. Even if you have no empathy for the 99%, at least look at it for self preservation. Our country is still extremely young and recorded history doesn&#x27;t stretch back very far; chaos and revolution are normal and it would not be hard to pass the point of no return.<p>There is a reason most tech aristocracy believe that minimum basic income is a good idea.')
