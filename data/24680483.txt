The only way I&#x27;m aware of to get into prison is via an arrest by police.<p>Nope, you can go to prison without being arrested first if you showed up to court voluntarily.<p>&gt; So, every arrest a police officer makes, they need to consider, &quot;knowing what I do about prison, is it ethical to arrest this person?&quot;<p>Nope, most arrests don’t result in prison time and unless the crime is particularly bad, the cop can’t even know if prison time is a realistic outcome. It sounds like your beef is with state prosecutors (e.g. Kamala Harris) and you just don’t understand the system well enough to know the actors involved.<p>&gt; Police militarization is supported at the federal level through grants of military equipment, and nationwide through the use of trainings that teach officers they are &quot;warriors&quot; or &quot;sheep dogs&quot;.<p>This is not “nationwide” in the sense that it’s up to each department if they want to participate. A city can absolutely refuse to participate in this programs and most rural places don’t (perhaps because they are ineligible, but either way not nationwide).<p>&gt; They might all have different funding and standards, but there are systemic nationwide problems.<p>You have yet to identify these problems though. What issues do you think the officers in Cody, WY have?')
