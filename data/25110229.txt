A company like Onnit provides quality equipment at an affordable price so it is one of the go to place for people getting into functional fitness. In that respect it is a &quot;contributing member&quot; of the fitness community and I don&#x27;t mind getting targeted adds from them.<p>On the other hand, I also get a lot of ads for gimmicks or dumbed down versions of legitimate fitness equipment. I view those companies as parasites on the fitness community and resent getting targeted adds from them.')
