I believe it&#x27;s more accurate to assume the original author is malicious. In that case:<p>curl https | bash - you are compromised<p>language specific - the malicious author&#x27;s content isn&#x27;t checked before it is being pushed. They have a window of opportunity before being discovered by the community and be banned, but the hashes don&#x27;t protect: the verification must be done manually<p>third-party repos - I&#x27;ll only take the example of AUR because it&#x27;s the one I know best: if the malicious author is also the packager, the situation is the same as the previous one. But, as is often the case, if the malicious author is not the packager, the latter has to be convinced to serve bad content and acts as a simple gateway')
