She is also gaslighting you into thinking you are the problem.  You&#x27;re not.  And she is using your child to blackmail you emotionally.<p>&gt; things she has anxiety about doing -- driving the car to new places, walking the dog when it is dark outside<p>This isn&#x27;t anxiety, it&#x27;s laziness.  But if you&#x27;re merely reluctant about the exact same things, she calls it &quot;a form of emotional abuse.&quot;  Brilliant.<p>Unfortunately, the way the law is currently applied, there is nothing you can do without violating it.')
