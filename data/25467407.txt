I don&#x27;t know why people do that to themselves working under these conditions.<p>I work for a non-software company and don&#x27;t have to deal with tests, I solve problems with software. I can use the tech I like. I am measured only by results. If I have problems that negatively affect my performance, I get opportunities to get my energy back, be that another project or some free time. There are these companies out there. Maybe not as prestigious, but there are advantages if you like going to work.<p>Don&#x27;t ever work for people with an inferiority complex, they will constantly try to throw themselves against you and you should know your own worth. There are enough jobs for softies out there that you can leave that behind.')
