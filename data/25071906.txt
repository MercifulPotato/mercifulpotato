Many developers observed significant improvements after the v9 release. Here&#x27;s just one [example](<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22260864" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=22260864</a>).<p>&gt;Every ngconf there&#x27;s talk of the magical 2kb hello-world<p>Currently, it&#x27;s absolutely doable to get very small bundle size (&lt;7-8KB) for a hello-world application. This, however, relies on private APIs. We haven&#x27;t made them public yet, because not many folks are building hello world apps, but in the future we&#x27;ll be exploring how to reduce the footprints of the framework even further for smaller apps.<p>&gt;We&#x27;re currently at 2mb main&#x2F;vendor after spending A LOT of time optimising and making everything lazy<p>It is shocking for me that you&#x27;re spending that much effort on optimizing your app, but you can&#x27;t get your bundle below 2MB. I&#x27;m spending large chunk of my time looking into apps and thinking how to make them smaller &amp; faster. I&#x27;ll be more than happy to connect and brainstorm the same for your case. Please reach out to me on my hackernews username @google.com<p>&gt;Every year I install the VSC Language Service plugin and have to disable it the same day due to it continuously crashing and killing the editor so it seems we&#x27;ll never get to benefit from that.<p>Sorry to hear you had such an experience with the language service. If it keeps crashing, definitely report the problem here <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;angular&#x2F;angular&#x2F;issues" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;angular&#x2F;angular&#x2F;issues</a>. We&#x27;ll be very thankful if you share reproduction steps.<p>&gt;Then I see a continuous stream of core developers leaving the Angular project due to toxic behaviour from Igor and it feels hopeless and depressing.<p>Folks leave and and others join. I can&#x27;t comment on my co-workers experiences, but after 2 years working on Angular I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the behavior you&#x27;re referring to.<p>&gt;The one saving grace is that the entire ecosystem is written in TypeScript and it&#x27;s nice seeing everything typed to perfection.<p>Oh, I wish everything was that perfectly typed :). This is something the team and the community is constantly working on, but we still have a long way to go until we reach perfection.')
