And made it impossible for you to install unapproved apps that did not give them a cut.<p>Would you really believe that such behavior would not break anti-trust law?  Because the courts already ruled against microsoft in a much less extreme situation.<p>And furthermore, are you really OK with that behavior, if microsoft forced every single windows PC in the world, to disallow unapproved apps?<p>&gt;  The argument that 30% is unfair goes nowhere in court -- so what should it be?<p>The lawsuit has nothing to do with the 30% cut.  Instead it has to do with Google and Apple engaging in anti-competitive behavior, and using their significant market power to prevent competition.<p>They should not be forced to change their price.  Instead, they should be force to stop their anti-competitive behavior, and allow other apps to be installed, in an easier way (in Apple&#x27;s case), where as Google should be stopped from forcing OEM providers to not preload the epic app store.<p>&gt; why they should be free to set their own prices<p>It has nothing to do with price setting.  That is nowhere in the lawsuit.  Instead, Epic is trying to stop anti-competitive behavior.')
