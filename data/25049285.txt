Unless you have the cycles left to act on more information, more information is unimportant. You can only spend so much money and time supporting political causes, and the once those blocks are filled up you really only need to check in every so often to decide if you want to reassess your priorities. The real goal is to figure out what questions you need answers to to decide how to act, get answers to those questions as often as you need them, and try not to learn more than that unless you’re curious enough about something new to deep dive on it.<p>While that lacks nuance (there’s value in curiosity and being a slightly more informed citizen), it does summarize my view. Just have to strike a balance where you don’t also look so shallowly into things that you take what people are saying as true without further research.')
