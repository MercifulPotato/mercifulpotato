Try searching for Ozonetel on Google. There will be six competitor ads and then our website will show up :)<p>Fact checking you: On Google, I see at most a single ad (on most refreshes for Ozonetel, on one occasion for something called dialpad, on some cases, no ad is shown) and then your website, whatever it may be. It would seem that you are trying to piggyback on this article&#x27;s discussion to increase awareness of your brand, which is not cool.')
