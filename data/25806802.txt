And its not surprising because, if everybody contemplating using Gradle was first told &quot;You should only do this if most of your team is willing to learn Groovy to good proficiency&quot; - hardly anybody would do that.<p>Now groovy is a great language IMHO but I think the way this goes down results in people hating it because they get handed a build as if they should understand it easily and then experience hours and hours of frustration as it exhibits unexpected behavior as they learn all the surprising things about Groovy (and not just Groovy but the Groovy+Gradle DSL dialect that is much weirder than plain Groovy).')
