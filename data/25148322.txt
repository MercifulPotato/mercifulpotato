Good to know that Russia is there to annex countries that are about to fall for this nefarious american trap.<p>Some would say Denmark is already in this unthinkable situation  so the poor people of Denmark can only hope that one day, some green patriotic Russians will land on danish soil to save them.<p>&gt;&gt; USA who pumped copious amounts of money in getting a &quot;favorable&quot; group of very questionable &quot;politicians&quot;<p>Let&#x27;s not talk about questionable &quot;politicians&quot; supported by Putin. They are all either dictators or wanna be soviet&#x2F;communist, oligarchs or the worst shady thing you could possible imagine.<p>Until Russia realises that nobody wants (except Russia) the Soviet era back these small countries have no choice but support U.S&#x27;s interests. The way Russia is doing business &amp; diplomacy is just ugly(albeit efficient at times).')
