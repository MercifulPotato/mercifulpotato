You can make that claim without being a utilitarian, but I don&#x27;t think one can be a utilitarian without making that claim. (unless one gets into &quot;no true utility&quot; :-)<p>Bernard was discontent, but he was content when he could exploit the Savage, and he&#x27;ll be very content on the island (and his discontentment was merely that, he was never suicidal). Mond would also rather be on an island (a place that sounds reminiscent of Dante&#x27;s first circle) with all the cool people, if it weren&#x27;t for his (programmed?) sense of duty. I don&#x27;t get the sense that discontent too-individualistic people remain discontent once they are allowed to go to the islands.<p>(In Huxley&#x27;s england, I believe people who either wished or were forced to avoid the bottles of their copy-book upbringing became &quot;remittance men&quot; and women, some of whom wound up on literal islands.)')
