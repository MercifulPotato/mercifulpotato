Item(by='ganoushoreilly', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611021903, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25828983, text='I apologize that it appears I targeted you, you&#x27;re correct you didn&#x27;t state that and i&#x27;m not intentionally addressing you as an individual. My response is by and large to the media and the large population of people espousing that view (including in this thread). In response I&#x27;m addressing the same, not you directly so I don&#x27;t mean to direct ill will or harm, i&#x27;m simply trying to project a perspective that is frustrating and often times ignored or belittled.<p>I watched my friends businesses burn last summer, as well as many other businesses near my home. The common response was &quot;\n&quot;we&#x27;re doing this because we have this right, we&#x27;re frustrated at the system that did X or Y&quot;. None of my friends caused any real or perceived in-equality towards anyone, none of them are racist, all of them as well as I, support the right for individuals to love and marry whomever they want. They were by and large allies, yet someone arbitrarily determined that because their business was there, Insurance would cover and they could loot and burn it. They decided that when they responded in public days later, that they were white males and even if they weren&#x27;t bad, it was retribution for whatever grievance someone held. Anyone that doesn&#x27;t believe that those actions, that persisted for months, weren&#x27;t abhorent and just as destructive to democracy and our country, then you&#x27;re not being honest with yourselves.<p>The point is, the media is choosing to doom and gloom this situation when I would argue half of America has had this same perspective for a year. I&#x27;m not arguing the merits of either sides grievances, though I think both have many valid points.')
