The sliding compound mitre saw was the life changing tool for me.  It was what was holding me back all these years from doing my own projects.  I was always outsourcing this type of work for simply the cutting of lumber and thought I could do better than what I paid for. My railings turned out really well and mercifully passed the wife approval test.')
