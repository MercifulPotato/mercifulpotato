Item(by='cheph', descendants=None, kids=[25915139], score=None, time=1611658681, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25913868, text='&gt; CURIEs and the depending standards alone are well over 100 pages.<p>The curie standard is 10 pages long, and those &quot;dependent standards&quot; includes things like RFC 3986 (Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax) and RFC 3987 (Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRI)) - which are well established technologies that most people should be familiar with. And you really don&#x27;t need to read all of the referenced standards to be able to understand and use CURIE quite proficiently.<p>&gt; RDF has like 100<p>Normative specifications of RDF is contained in two documents:<p>- RDF 1.1 Concepts and Abstract Syntax ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;rdf11-concepts&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;rdf11-concepts&#x2F;</a> ) = 20 pages<p>- RDF 1.1 Semantics ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;rdf11-mt&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;rdf11-mt&#x2F;</a> ) = 29 pages<p>These page counts includes TOC, reference sections, appendices and large swathes of non-normative content also.<p>And really the RDF 1.1 primer (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;rdf11-primer&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.w3.org&#x2F;TR&#x2F;rdf11-primer&#x2F;</a>) should be quite sufficient for most people who want to use it, and that is only 14 pages.<p>RDF and CURIE is simple as dirt really, maybe too simple, but I think I can explain it quite well to someone with some basic background in IT in about 30 minutes.<p>And while the other aspects (e.g. SPARQL, OWL) are not that simple, there is inherent complexity they are trying to address that you cannot just ignore. And not everybody needs to know OWL, and SPARQL is really not that complicated either and again most people can become quite proficient with this rather quickly if they understand the basics.<p>&gt; What we need is a simpler ecosystem, where people can stake their claim on their niche, where they have the ability and power to experiment and explore.<p>What are the alternatives? Proliferation of JSON schemas which is yet to be ratified as a standard and does not address most of the same problems as Semantic Web Technology? I think there are some validity to your concerns, but semantic web technologies are being used widely in production, maybe not all of them, but to suggest it is not usable is not true.<p>I have used RDF in Java (rdf4j and jena), Python (rdflib) and JS (rdflib.js) without serious problems.')
