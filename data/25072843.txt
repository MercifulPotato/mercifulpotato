If Microsoft had transitioned .NET to be cross-platform much sooner or from the beginning, then they would have been better off. I was recently surprised to learn that Mono basically existed from the beginning of .NET, as I had no idea it was so old, so it&#x27;s clear that people wanted something like .NET Core from the beginning.<p>It&#x27;s confusing to me that Microsoft embarked on their Iron &lt;x&gt; project, or whatever it was called, to stress test the CLR, got F# out of the project, and then decided to sit on it. They have incorporated F# features into C#, but it is confusing to me that they saw the rising popularity of Python and decided to let it happen unchecked because C# will never be F# or a language that appeals to Python programmers.')
