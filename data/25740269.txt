You can also build more than just communications on ISP infrastructure.<p>As examples, you watch Netflix on the infrastructure of an ISP but Netflix is not communications and you may bank on your bank&#x27;s website on an ISP and that is not communications those are movie watching and banking respectfully.<p>I could continue to provide examples, but my point being is an ISP is not in itself sufficient for communications to be established and that you can establish more than communications on an ISP and that is why I don&#x27;t agree.')
