I mean, who gives away used clothes that are still in good conditions?</i><p>Well, if you have a &quot;lack of wealth thing&quot;, then you should immediately be able to grasp some advantages of this:<p>(1) second hand clothes are cheaper to buy (or free in some cases).<p>(2) second hand clothes means you make some money selling your old clothes, instead of throwing them away.<p>If what&#x27;s alien to you is how would anyone &quot;throw clothes away&quot;, that still seems like a strange question.<p>Unless we&#x27;re talking about some developing country, tons of people in the West and elsewhere get new clothes and stop wearing old ones, which can then give away. Women sterotypically (and statistically) more so, following seasonal fashion, but also tons of men.<p>You don&#x27;t need to have &quot;wealth&quot; to do so. Even people living with average wages do stop wearing old clothes all the time.<p>And of course some do so by necessitity too, because their kids outgrow their clothes sizes, or because they themselves got fatter&#x2F;skinner and their old clothes wont do them anymore.<p>&gt;<i>At no point have I ever said &quot;I no longer want to wear this, I&#x27;ll sell it for a buck and buy something new&quot;.</i><p>Well, did you ever consider that you&#x27;re in the minority here? I&#x27;ve myself never considered to do some things millions of people do, but I do know that most others do them....')
