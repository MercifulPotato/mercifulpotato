It&#x27;s so bad that people (incl. me) tend to prefer to copy-paste libraries source code instead of setting up a dependency.<p>A Python, Ruby, Node or Java project would never have to head toward such a poor solution instead of using their respective package managers. But in C++ we do because the alternative (e.g. Conan) is such a nightmare to use.')
