Admittedly, those languages are usually higher level than C&#x2F;C++ (but both Java and Python would probably find it common to handle a 3xx or a 404 or a missing row with an exception)<p>At a high level, I think the important thing is that funct() -&gt; Result&lt;T&gt; and func() -&gt; T that may throw&#x2F;raise an exception are basically equivalent. Result may require slightly more explicitness at (at least) one call site, but ultimately both allow you to return a T, or report some non-T result, in a structured way. The only difference is that exceptions force you to handle the result explicitly (although that may just mean a single call to value! or VALUE_OR_DIE, or whatever the &quot;get the T or segfault&#x2F;panic&quot; method is). In this way, I really do think checked exceptions are highly analogous to Result types.<p>Implementations may have different performance tradeoffs, but those aren&#x27;t implicit in the choice of exception vs. result.')
