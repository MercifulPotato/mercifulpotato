Item(by='slightwinder', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606306372, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25205833, text='&gt; Does earth rules apply to life from other planets?<p>Any law applys to their territory, independant on whether the culprit is a citizen of that country or a foreigner. Whether they can execute the law is of course a different story. But from where someone comes from doesnt matter in the first place.<p>Though, you could argue whether laws are limited to humans or whether they apply to every species. AFter all we don&#x27;t apply the same laws to animals and humans, there are usually differnt sets for each.<p>&gt; The only reason that laws work is because of the threat of what happens if you donâ€™t obey. If we are not in a position to threaten the extra terrestrials then we are also not in a position to dictate rules for them to follow.<p>This is a classical problem of international laws. Country A can&#x27;t execute laws to citizien of country B, because country B is stinky, or citizien already has left country A. Usually there are contracts for this, so in certain cases country B will give their citizien to Country A if the case is heavy enough to justify such an act. But of course they can also just ignore it.')
