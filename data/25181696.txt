He clearly doesn&#x27;t know much,  as displayed with his wild accusations of cheating by the Deep Blue team.  He knows a lot of about top-level chess but almost nothing about AI.  When he lost vs Deep Blue, the AI was not stronger than top chess players at the time. Instead, Kasparov had some wrong ideas about what the computer could and could not &quot;see&quot;.  If he understood computer chess better, he could have easily won, IMHO.  He played into the machine strengths and was clearly flustered when it didn&#x27;t behave as he expected.')
