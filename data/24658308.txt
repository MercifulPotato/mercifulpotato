Allow the wild-wild-west only on .com (or segregate however you decide). There need to be domains with no ads, no tracking, no spamming, no &#x27;social&#x27; behemoths, no companies, no for-profit org&#x27;s, no begging bowls. (I&#x27;m sure you can think of more nos.) Person-to-community only; supplications need to be granted community-by-community.<p>The penalty for attempted transgressions will need to have <i>serious</i> teeth. Else we&#x27;re screwed.')
