Usually once they start running they have to call for fuel immediately and be regularly refueled until power is restored. They don&#x27;t have a week of fuel or anything like that.<p>I don&#x27;t see why natural gas is such a bad backup for utility electric. It doesn&#x27;t share fate with the electric grid and it&#x27;s buried. Seems pretty good.')
