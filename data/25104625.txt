Their situation is mostly of their own doing. And of course it&#x27;s exacerbated by the discrimination, but they don&#x27;t have to live in mountains of trash. Also they don&#x27;t let the police in their communities, neither the taxmen. It&#x27;s a de-facto state within the state. The state has &quot;left&quot; them the way they prefer. And I am a firm believer that this is the right stance. The only other possible approach would be something like a police state, forced labor and education etc. Free healthcare and social benefits they get even now. They literally do no work and get no jobs because they have enough money to continue their happy existence. I am not being sarcastic here by saying &quot;happy&quot; as it&#x27;s very much visible in the article. This is the ultimate failure of the well-fare state and it&#x27;s only going to get worse if the well-fare continues. It&#x27;s very funny how progressives chant slogans from far away, but no one dares go propose the same ideas in-person (to the Roma).<p>I am also a member of a minority in Bulgaria (Turkish), but our people are nothing like the Roma - we don&#x27;t live in ghettos. And although there is a lot of &quot;historically based&quot; hatred towards us here, I can say from experience that the (ethnic) Bulgarians are not that racist (or at least not unreasonably so). Westerners are too soft and entitled to their progressive beliefs which are going to screw them big time.')
