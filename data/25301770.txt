This isn&#x27;t even about GDPR, it&#x27;s about a completely different piece of legislation, the E-Privacy Directive. This is completely agnostic on personal data and so the post is largely flawed.<p>Even if you&#x27;re not dealing with any personal data, if you&#x27;re placing a cookie (or doing anything analogous device fingerprinting etc) you are in scope of the Directive and need consent, irrespective of GDPR.<p>The new E-Privacy Regulation is looking to implement an exception to consent for analytics but that would have providers like Google Analytics out of scope. Anyway, it&#x27;s stuck in the mud at present...')
