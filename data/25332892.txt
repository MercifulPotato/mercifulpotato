Item(by='js8', descendants=None, kids=[25333625], score=None, time=1607354214, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25332321, text='There are more libraries for different things, but in the 90s, there was a quite a bit of commercial RAD application builders, and that went out of favor.<p>So while it is nontrivial to build a web, or any modern (network-connected) application today with 90s tools, I am not entirely convinced that building an application today is easier than it was in the 90s. If anything, I suspect we build more from scratch, or leveraging existing open-source, rather than use prefabricated and commercial RAD tools (which are, and always were, pretty expensive).<p>Edit: I guess what I want to say, if you compare writing actual &quot;business logic&quot;, it is still about as difficult as it was in the 90s. We can do fancier things by leveraging libraries (sometimes included in the programming languages), but that&#x27;s it. In fact I even suspect that people in the 90s were more productive in writing actual business logic, because there was less distractions from the fancy technology (such as web). And I have seen 30-40 year old applications that nobody wants to rewrite, because their complexity is so high that it would take a long time, and it&#x27;s not clear to me it would take shorter time to develop them today than it used to.')
