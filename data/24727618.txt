The reason you couldn&#x27;t copy the harry potter chapter titles exactly is because they contain specific titles, e.g. &quot;the boy who lived&quot;, but &quot;&lt;my own catchphrase for main character&gt;&quot; as the first chapter title is again very, very common.<p>Also, the argument is about reuse&#x2F;interoperability. Recipes are something you use and the naming is functional and it is important that it is similar enough. I am not aware of harry potter chapters being used like that, but if authors start talking about &quot;The sorting hat&quot; chapter as a term of the art , then yes you should be able to use that term. Similarly to how you can introduce a weapon in your novel without paying royalties to Chekhov.')
