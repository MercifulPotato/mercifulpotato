It just can&#x27;t happen yet because blockchains don&#x27;t scale enough.<p>A while back I read Matt Taibbi&#x27;s book <i>The Divide</i>. Chapter 8 was about collection on delinquent credit card debt, and it was horrifying. According to Taibbi, &quot;the bulk of the credit card collection business is conducted without any supporting documentation showing up or being seen by human eyes at any part of the process....in the overwhelmed modern court system, simply attesting to having the right documentation works just as well as really having it.&quot;<p>According to one judge, &quot;On a regular basis this court encounters defendants being sued on the same debt by more than one creditor alleging it is the assignee of the original credit card obligation.&quot; It&#x27;s also common for lenders to claim delinquency despite the loan actually being paid.<p>In theory, defendants can challenge all this but even if they could afford lawyers, they often don&#x27;t even know they&#x27;re getting sued. When they don&#x27;t show up there&#x27;s a default judgement against them and their wages get garnished.<p>If we had a really scalable blockchain to run all this, including the loan payments and loan sales, then courts could automatically check this stuff. We have the tech now to maintain sufficient privacy for borrowers.<p>Of course we wouldn&#x27;t need a blockchain if courts were doing their job, but a pure software solution is likely cheaper than spending a lot more tax money to examine paper documents.')
