And I like Signal because of its built-in security, although the lack of an API, easy integration into other clients, automation and ease of use from multiple devices prevent me from using it more. But I guess that this is a trade-off to be accepted for having strong encryption and messages stored only on the device.<p>Let&#x27;s keep in mind however that these are advanced use cases, and that for 99% of the users these are just apps supposed to deliver text and media from A to B. In 2021 it&#x27;s not hard to build an app like these, even with E2E encryption and 2FA. Social lock-in obviously plays a role, but I&#x27;m really appalled by the scarcity of alternatives that enables companies like Facebook to bully us into reading our private messages for advertising purpose and easily get away with it.')
