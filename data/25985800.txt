Many of these strategies are easily scalable to turn a small edge into a big one, using leverage. Oftentimes these strategies have an asymmetric risk profile, with low probability of losing a lot of money (sometimes with unlimited downside potential), for example:<p>- writing out of the money options for the premiums<p>- shorting stocks with leverage<p>- &#x27;08s frenzy of selling credit default swaps<p>- forex trading with spreads so low that they take 100x+ leverage<p>Usually, when these strategies work, it&#x27;s easy money and they get addicted to the easy returns. They scale the strategies up to a level of risk they can&#x27;t handle. Like having 140% short interest relative to GME&#x27;s float. When these strategies blow up in their faces, it wipes them out completely, to the level of requiring bailouts.<p>Main street (retail investors, taxpayers) have had enough of this, and a lot of anger is directed at institutional investors for always getting the easy money and the bailouts at their expense. They want to see the game applied fairly, such that when the bets go sour, they go bankrupt and don&#x27;t get bailed out like in 2008. In the 2015 CHF forex crisis, many brokers went bankrupt overnight. That&#x27;s what should happen to Melvin, and to anyone who takes the stupid risky bets that don&#x27;t work out.')
