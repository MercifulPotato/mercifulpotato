Read almost every amendment - many have to do with rights we have places <i>outside</i> our own personal property.  The entire point of this discussion is about what we are allowed to do in places nobody &quot;owns&quot; - i.e. places the govt owns - because the govt&#x27;s purpose is to serve the people after all.  Your argument is hopelessly broken here.  What if the government told you you didn&#x27;t have the right to leave your property - even to get food for yourself.  Too bad for you - you are only free to get food on your own property.  You probably wouldn&#x27;t like that I suspect.')
