The core logic of a program can (optionally) interact with humans and&#x2F;or other systems. With neither, one is left with a “run to completion” program that typically transforms its OS supplied inputs into outputs.<p>A “user interface” is associated with human interaction, whereas an API is associated with interaction with other systems. That human interaction is in terms of the <i>user</i> of the program, not the producer.<p>That programmers are human, might mean that they need to program against an API, but surely that doesn’t mean that the term “user interface” should be extended to it?')
