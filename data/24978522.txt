I&#x27;m in an ok place right now and focusing on research and side projects. I&#x27;m not actively looking for work but if there&#x27;s something at the intersection of my interests I&#x27;d love to talk. Not sure myself what that would look like, perhaps something around MLOps, infra&#x2F;automation, Reinforcement Learning, Algorithmic trading, etc.')
