This is not a detail. This is the core market of the car and it has been perfectly designed to address it.<p>This is a clean, compact, two seaters with a size and performance profile perfectly suited for a city looking like Paris. It&#x27;s probably going to make a killing as a ride sharing solution.<p>It&#x27;s a very interesting new value proposition (small, slow, clean, quite cheap) and it does so using an extremely aggressive engineering proposition (only 250 parts, perfectly symmetrical, similar front and back).<p>This car is a design master \nclass. The fact that you fail to see that is on you. Meanwhile it is selling very well.')
