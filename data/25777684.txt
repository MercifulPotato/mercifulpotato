He is presenting his opponent&#x27;s viewpoint, with humorous exaggeration.<p>You&#x27;re right, page 3 winds that back as you say.<p>&gt; That isn&#x27;t his claim here. It&#x27;s hard not to agree that books can be more polished.<p>Of course, but he presents the timings as 50 minutes as against 10. That&#x27;s not reflective of how long it would take a student to understand the material.<p>&gt; it limits the author&#x27;s temptation to squeeze in one more thing, one more generalization. And because it puts the experienced speaker&#x27;s thought process on show, not only the final tidied up result.<p>I agree on both points.')
