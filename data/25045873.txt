I hadn&#x27;t heard that one, seems like a low effort issue that is easy to debunk.<p>The first problem in Pennsylvania was that they kept all republican observers a football field length away from anything. On November 5th the Penn Judge ruled that the republicans can get closer and actually observe vote counts. The stupid republican vote observers didn&#x27;t bring their binoculars and therefore didn&#x27;t observe anything. Worse yet, Penn Democrats violated this judge&#x27;s order to give access to the observers. When they started recording showing the fraud they got thrown out.<p>The second problem is what the article confirms. As Trump said, &#x27;Voting needs to stop.&#x27; but that&#x27;s the problem with mail-in ballots being accepted up to 3 days after the election.<p>The third problem is Benford&#x27;s law. The actual math shows a confirmed amount of fraud occurred.<p>The 4th problem in Penn is that there&#x27;s video showing workers filling out ballots.<p>That&#x27;s just Penn. Michigan threw out all republican observers because of mask violations and &#x27;racism&#x27; and such. Immediately after they did that... 138,000 votes showed up, 100% for biden. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ericjgibbs&#x2F;status&#x2F;1324088038830624768" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;ericjgibbs&#x2F;status&#x2F;1324088038830624768</a> How can anyone watch this video and not question the veracity of Michigan&#x27;s vote.<p>Then there&#x27;s Wisconsin where republican observers were put in a separate room with a video cam feed. As per the covid rules. That&#x27;s basically useless and again benford&#x27;s law was violated for over 65,000 votes. Somehow 100% for biden.<p>Trump won Ohio by quite a margin and realistically should have won Wisconsin and Michigan by about the same amount.<p>Let&#x27;s just assume for a second there was absolutely no election fraud. The perception is everything. The political divide in the USA over the last 10 years has largely speaking been Democrats. Now it&#x27;s going to be both.')
