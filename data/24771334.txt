Whose location is it then?<p>&gt; nowhere states that your location is sent to Apple every time it is requested.<p>You&#x27;re right. It&#x27;s worse than that. I pointed out in that post that Apple periodically gets your location <i>even if no app requests it.</i> Apple also says that you consent to having your location collected every time another app requests it, so even if it is not true now (which you have not been able to show and which would mean they wouldn&#x27;t need such a scary consent, so I highly doubt it), it can be true tomorrow.<p>The <i>actually</i> privacy-respecting Android devices from Amazon and Google do not suffer from this issue. Nor do they require you to tell anybody if you install an app on your device, tied to your identity, which you have once again ignored.')
