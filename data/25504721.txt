It used to bother me but it bothers me less nowadays. My late teens through my mid thirties were spent being relatively very generous to worthy causes and people I would meet who were down on their luck. I gave a close family member doing charity work in Africa $80,000 so they could stay there and give their kids a good education.<p>Looking back - I don&#x27;t think any of it made much difference - though I have no regrets.<p>Now that I&#x27;m in my early 40s I&#x27;ve sort of lost the energy to care so much. I empathize with people struggling but sort of throw my hands up in the air.<p>I&#x27;ve shifted my focus toward my family and I feel pretty good about that.<p>It feels like I&#x27;m having A LOT more impact by investing time and money into my family than I was able to by investing in others and their families.')
