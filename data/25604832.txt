They claim they often are able to find the prescription drugs that retail for less money than insurance co-pays.<p>I’m not sure if these services are a scam or not, but anecdotally, the one time I needed medical care without insurance (due to a short inadvertent coverage gap), the out of pocket price was significantly lower than my co-pay would have been.<p>In fairness to the insurance companies, the doctor made it clear she charges people without insurance less money.  This bill will prevent hospitals from subsidizing uninsured people with money from the insured; that’s a potential downside.  We really need universal single-payer health care in this country.')
