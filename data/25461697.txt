As a side effect, contributions are often negotiated but rarely rejected, which exerts pressure in the direction of feature bloat: the acute needs of the contributor tend to outweigh the diffuse benefit of simplicity.<p>Such pressure is not impossible to resist, but it usually takes dedication and and superior negotiation skills from core maintainers.  A modular architecture is also very helpful for accommodating contributors without compromising usability, which is why so many successful ASF projects use plugins.')
