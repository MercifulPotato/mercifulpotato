(Even if it did by some metric, that <i>still</i> wouldn&#x27;t be acceptable; what constitutes &quot;better&quot; is entirely up to the site owner to determine. But it&#x27;s even less reasonable given that it wouldn&#x27;t have the intended effect, unless the intended effect is to cause harm.) Having many users should not suddenly mean you don&#x27;t own the site, nor should it mean that you cannot moderate the site as you see fit. &quot;We came up with a new algorithm to automatically detect spam&quot; should not need to come with &quot;and several years later we managed to get the government to say we&#x27;re allowed to use it without incurring liability&quot;.<p>&gt;&gt; for anything but the most massive sites that could theoretically afford an army of moderators<p>&gt; Ok, I have not considered this angle and it is indeed concerning.<p>That angle is why Section 230 was created in the first place, and why it should remain intact.<p>&gt; That may be the goal of the FCC, but I for one did not say that I am in support of destroying moderation.<p>Removing the liability shield for sites that moderate will destroy either the site or the moderation, and either way the usefulness of the site comes to an end.<p>&gt; Quite the opposite, I was thinking how it could be made to work while providing more open communication platforms and putting more control in the hands of the users rather than the companies.<p>Make a new network that puts control in the hands of the users in the way you envision, and test it to see how well it works. Or join one of the existing efforts already working on that. This isn&#x27;t a legislative problem; it certainly shouldn&#x27;t have a legislative non-solution masquerading as a solution.<p>I think most people&#x27;s experience with moderation puts more weight on any encounters they&#x27;ve had with <i>being moderated</i>, and little to no weight (except perhaps in the abstract) on the volume of what they don&#x27;t see. Moderation, when done well, is close to invisible; I think as a side effect of that, people underestimate its value in contributing to their good experiences.')
