Item(by='putlake', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610690767, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25785425, text='Ben Thompson had a good comparison of messaging apps [1, $] yesterday. He ranked them as follows:<p>1. Signal\nSignal encrypts your messages end-to-end, and does not back up your messages to either iCloud or its own servers. This is the most secure option (and also the option most likely to lead to data loss or getting locked out of your own account — it’s a tradeoff!).<p>2. WhatsApp\nWhatsApp encrypts your messages end-to-end (with the same protocol as Signal), and does not back up your messages to its own servers. By default it does not back up messages to iCloud either, but that is an option. If you enable that option then your messages can be accessed by Apple (who has the keys for iCloud backups) and, by extension, law enforcement with a warrant.<p>3. (tie) Telegram\nTelegram does not end-to-end encrypt messages by default; they are stored on Telegram’s servers where they are secured by Telegram’s keys, which means they can also be accessed by law enforcement with a warrant. However, you can turn on end-to-end encryption for one-to-one conversations (but not for channels).<p>4. (tie) Facebook Messenger\nMessenger does not end-to-end encrypt messages by default; they are stored on Facebook’s servers and can be accessed by Facebook and, by extension, law enforcement. However, like Telegram, you can enable end-to-end encryption for one-to-one conversations.<p>5. iMessage\niMessage encrypts messages end-to-end by default; however, if you have iCloud backup turned on, your messages can be accessed by Apple (who has the keys for iCloud backups) and, by extension, law enforcement with a warrant. Unlike WhatsApp, though, this is both on by default and cannot be turned off on a granular basis.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stratechery.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;the-whatsapp-kerfuffle-comparing-messaging-services-network-effects&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;stratechery.com&#x2F;2021&#x2F;the-whatsapp-kerfuffle-comparin...</a>')
