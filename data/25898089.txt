The learning process should accomodate the end goals.<p>Is that to watch Japanese anime without subtitles? To have a deep conversation with ordinary people? Or simply the language is too linguistically intriguing? (BTW, so many languages are just as intriguing as Japanese)<p>To me, a Japanese native majoring in CompSci, learning English has obvious benefits: there are 100x more learning materials, youtube videos, source code comments, and discussions, etc. And they&#x27;re better. Eventually, speaking English opens up the world. (Maybe that&#x27;s also true for Mandarin today.)<p>But Japanese? It&#x27;s a niche market for a smaller number of people. I think learning Japanese is much less practical than learning English&#x2F;Mandarin, so I guess you&#x27;d have to be more committed at it to actually gain something.')
