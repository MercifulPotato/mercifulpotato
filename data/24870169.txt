Can you really think of no scenario where there would be an sql injection string as a password? Perhaps some try-hard came along before you and attempted sql injection on the user creation form that resulted not in sql injection, but in the password being set to the literal string that the person used as input.<p>I realize that in this scenario it is literally designed-in, but I understand the point the author is trying to prove. If a &quot;scanner jokey&quot; gets results that tells him or her there is SQL injection, a competent tester will try to verify what their tool is telling them. If the tester is doing that in this case, they&#x27;ll find other injection strings not working and (hopefully) start looking under the hood to see what is going on and discover this pathological hard-coded pw and be able to tell the client that. Maybe it&#x27;s the work of a malicious dev?<p>I agree that a pentester with a lot of experience will have skills that are honed to find common bug patterns, but it&#x27;s nice to be able to find these seemingly bizarre issues and have an explanation for the client. It shows you really understood the app and what it&#x27;s doing.')
