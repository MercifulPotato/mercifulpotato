Item(by='sradman', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601919988, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24689675, text='&gt; It seems to me that this test from India is going in the same direction [as the antigen rapid tests]<p>I think the FELUDA CRISPR&#x2F;Cas9 test is more of an alternative to PCR with the potential for significantly reduced price per test. Michael Mina&#x27;s $1 Lick-a-Stick self-administered rapid test is much more of a game changer. The BBC article said that &quot;...the new test had 96% sensitivity and 98% specificity.&quot; The fact that we are talking about sensitivity without specifying the viral concentration of the test sample means that Mina&#x27;s message is not getting through.<p>We need rapid tests that target infectious viral loads, that is, equivalent to PCR Cycle Threshold (CT) of 24 or less.<p>EDIT: changed $5 Lick-a-Stick to $1 - the Abbott BinaxNOW test is $5')
