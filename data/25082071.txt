It&#x27;s silly to conflate the two.<p>Can you point out where he made such a claim? Because I don&#x27;t see it.<p>&gt;But computers are a very specific, highly specialized machinery that the vast parts of the population will never be able to directly understand or fix.<p>Computers are all that only in the vaguest of sense. They&#x27;re actually not specialised at all. They&#x27;re actually extremely general purpose. But whether that&#x27;s the case at all there&#x27;s a lot items, equipment and tools that are very specialised that most people don&#x27;t understand but if they were made in act in any way similar to this because someone somehow managed to use them in a retarded way it would surely raise some eyebrows.<p>Company incentives are trash and I trust them A LOT lot less to not make stuff designed to fail, to lock in customers, to snoop data, etc, etc than I trust myself to not do stupid shit when i want an exception to some safety feature or the like.<p>&gt;I can drive a car but I don&#x27;t know the first thing about fixing it.<p>And would you buy a car with the hood welded shut?

That however is not the case for a pc, phone, printer or what have you.')
