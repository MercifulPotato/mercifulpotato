Most of the families trying to adopt are looking for babies but we were looking for older kids. It still took almost 2 years to get our first kid placed with us because I think the social workers werenâ€™t sure if my wife and I really knew what we were getting into. But once we got the first kid I think they realized we were good. Then a year later they called us out of the blue about a second kid.')
