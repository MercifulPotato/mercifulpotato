Hypersonic weapons are very difficult to confuse with nuclear weapons. Combine that with cyber warfare and drone&#x2F;robotic warfare... And it is now possible to have an all out conventional warfare style war again. MAD no longer applies here. MAD was relevant when &quot;destruction&quot; required nuclear weapons. It didn&#x27;t really mean &quot;you destroy me I destroy you.&quot; It meant, you launch nuclear weapons (which will destroy me) and I have enough left over to destroy you. That warfare no longer presents the likely scenario as would unfold between two superpowers.')
