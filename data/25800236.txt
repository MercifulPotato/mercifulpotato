In Communist China if someone&#x27;s account were purged I doubt it would be reinstated, so regardless of what you think of Trump as a president, this action reflects very favorably on America with respect to free speech.  I hope Twitter will follow suit, and that Parler  will be reinstated on Apple and Google, and its AWS account on Amazon.  There are blacklists being written up, I hope those are dropped as well.<p>Ordinary Americans should not have to think about signing up to the dark web, which law enforcement can&#x27;t easily access, for their ordinary everyday lawful political speech. A former president certainly shouldn&#x27;t.<p>I myself am not angry at Twitter, Facebook, Google, Apple, or Amazon that this happened. I am just so sad that free speech could be taken away in the first place.<p>This is a big win for free speech.<p>Below I copy the lead sentences from Wikipedia on free speech:<p>Freedom of speech[2] is a principle that supports the freedom of an individual or a community to articulate their opinions and ideas without fear of retaliation, censorship, or legal sanction. The term &quot;freedom of expression&quot; is sometimes used synonymously but includes any act of seeking, receiving, and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the medium used.<p>Freedom of expression is recognized as a human right under article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and recognized in international human rights law in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Article 19 of the UDHR states that &quot;everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference&quot; and &quot;everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice&quot;.')
