Before I clicked the link I was expecting the tool set to be extremely minimal and focused, e.g. HTML+CSS+javascript&#x2F;node.js. I currently have a bunch of projects using PHP+javascript+HTML+CSS and I am seriously considering dropping PHP and focusing more on javascript, and thus using node.js instead of PHP, so I no longer have to keep up to date with PHP. Anyway, great you can manage it all and that it&#x27;s working for you.')
