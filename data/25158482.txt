DNSSEC does no transaction encryption. It allows full recursive resolvers --- the kind virtually nobody runs on their own machines --- to validate signatures on the tiny minority of domains (virtually none of them among the most popular on the Internet) that have opted in to DNSSEC over the last 10 years. Note that even in the unusual corner case where you&#x27;re looking up a name that&#x27;s actually signed with a DNS recursor that actually verifies DNSSEC signatures, the network between you can still snoop on all your DNS requests, because DNSSEC is bad.<p>If you&#x27;re worried that your network upstream is intercepting your DNS requests (and if you&#x27;re in the US on a mainstream ISP, you should be), this is the problem DoH is designed to solve, and it does so quite effectively.')
