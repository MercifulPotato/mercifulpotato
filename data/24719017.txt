Unfortunately I think I&#x27;ve only eve heard complaints about it, many being mentioned here (multicore support, bad tooling, things like utf support you&#x27;d expect to be built in, Windows pains, etc.). I&#x27;ve also read a number of admittedly older peices criticizing it&#x27;s type system among other things. When or why should someone consider using OCaml versus a lisp, modern mainstream languahes or even a purely functional language like Haskell?')
