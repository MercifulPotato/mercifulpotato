My point is the government&#x27;s deadline would surely be unreasonable.<p>&gt; I think people are too hesitant to admit that companies that violate the law should be eligible for the &quot;death penalty&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t believe in the death penalty for people, and I don&#x27;t believe in it for companies either.  I certainly think that companies get away with too much, and that their leadership should be more personally accountable for fragrant violations of the law.
