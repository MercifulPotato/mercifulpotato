It&#x27;s a rare person who knows all of these languages and is expert enough in them to be able to tweak, modify or extend all the applications they use that are written in them.<p>In Emacs you just have to know Lisp, and all of the applications written for Emacs are open to you.<p>That&#x27;s <i>hugely</i> powerful.<p>If you want these Emacs applications to behave a different way or integrate in to your setup in a different way from how they were designed, that&#x27;s super easy to do compared to doing the same thing outside of Emacs, and the workflow you can develop in a system that you designed to be just the way you want can be extremely streamlined and efficient.<p>I&#x27;m sorry to hear that trying Emacs hasn&#x27;t worked out for you.  I&#x27;ll just say that I used vi and vim for decades before switching to Emacs, and while it did take a lot of work to set up Emacs the way I wanted, in a very vim-like fashion using Evil, it was very much worth it, and now my Emacs setup could do many things that my vim setup never could and probably never will.')
