Item(by='HenryBemis', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611570755, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25884540, text='&gt; also have several family members that I can only get in contact with through Facebook.<p>This is a key failure imho. You find a long lost cousin, classmate, friend. First thing I would do is say &quot;hey, what&#x27;s your number&quot; or &quot;let&#x27;s jump on a skype call&quot; (come on, almost everyone has skype). Basically establish an &#x27;independent&#x27; communication channel.')
