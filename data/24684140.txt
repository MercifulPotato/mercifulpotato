Item(by='rsync', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1601866572, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24682038, text='&quot;Really, Sonos is a great example of what happens when you follow your instructions to &quot;make a good product and sell it at a profit&quot;... they did that for many years, and made money.... but now most people who want a speaker like Sonos makes already have them, and their growth has stopped.&quot;<p>No.<p>Sonos has a very small market penetration and could have continued growing, modestly, with enthusiastic reviews and glowing recommendations <i>forever</i>.<p>The problem was not that they did not have a business model - the problem was that nobody was going to get filthy rich with that business model.  They found that to be unacceptable and did silly things - like an IPO.<p>Now they&#x27;re stuck on a path that requires rapid growth.  You could have easily predicted, years ago, that any company in this position would do things like drop support for old devices and get pushy with people to adopt their app (although I have to admit, I never would have predicted that they would gut their desktop player and <i>force</i> people to use the app) ... and adopt sleazy and desperate relationships with data brokers, etc.<p>Fuck them.  I wish they knew how much I loved their company, and their product, and how much I hate them now.')
