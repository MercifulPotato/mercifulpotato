I expect that the majority of readers here are not particularly familiar with this problem&#x2F;field, so I thought it would be beneficial to have such a complementary explanation in the thread. (Yes, you can tell people to spend 10 minutes reading through Wikipedia and other supplementary material, but few will do so.) And indeed, I could get significantly more value out of this submission after reading some of the explanations I solicited. Others hopefully&#x2F;presumably had the same experience (instead of just having to move on).<p>I didn&#x27;t want to comment on the downvotes I received, but I would appreciate suggestions how my wording could&#x27;ve been improved to avoid the reaction that you had. It was precisely what I intended to curb with the quoted remark, but it seems it was not very effective.')
