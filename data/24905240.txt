They need to prove safety and efficacy, so they design a trial which will allow those factors to be measured.<p>Kind of difficult to prove efficacy if you don&#x27;t know how many people in your trial were infected with the disease you&#x27;re trying to vaccinate against though. But do bear in mind as mentioned in other comments this participant was not in the phase 3 trial, and phase 3 is where the immunity given by a vaccine is tested. Phase 1 and phase 2 are much more constrained studies intended to determine if it&#x27;s safe to give the vaccine to enough people to evaluate immunity.')
