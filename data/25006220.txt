This in turn means that the ground under the building becomes progressively more valuable as the average density of construction increases. This can happen either by permitting smaller units or by building taller, or both.<p>This feels transient to an extent no? At some point your building is tall enough and your unit as small as people are willing to accept.<p>But does this not apply primarily to the land underneath the building? Once you reach a certain plateau a 700sqft apartment on the 10th floor of a 50 story building isn&#x27;t worth any more than an apartment on the 10th floor of a 70 story building is it?')
