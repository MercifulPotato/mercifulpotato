The role you describe is that of a trader at the extreme end (little coding ability required, manual monitoring of strategies&#x2F;opportunities). But there are many traders who spend a majority of their time doing data analysis and programming while monitoring mostly automated strategies out of the corner of their eye. There are researchers who focus purely on statistics and ML projects. Some even get to spend a good portion of their time reading papers, expanding their knowledge and doing basic research, not just applying their existing knowledge to financial datasets. There are also Devs. Some work on ultra low latency systems (though this is not Jane Streets expertise). Some work on Jane Street&#x27;s OCaml compiler.<p>Apart from the OCaml compiler, everything else is fairly typical of the spectrum of roles you can find at the very large high frequency firms. And mid-sized firms are similar yet again, minus the basic research. I would say it is definitely worth working in this industry if anything above sounds interesting to you.')
