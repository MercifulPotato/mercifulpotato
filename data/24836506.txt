By far most people want police, fire department, roads, FDA, FCC, OSHA, national security, social security, and even the DMV. And the system of taxes is something that achieves that.<p>People want those things, and they don&#x27;t want the old Chinese drug dens.<p>Does that mean that the implementation is perfect? Absolutely not. Especially in the US. Mass incarceration is counterproductive and horrible. Cannabis illegality has a racist history. But personally I don&#x27;t think people should be allowed to use fentanyl, meth, and heroin.<p>Even libertarians should recognize that there&#x27;s no way such use doesn&#x27;t have a huge externality caused by people who are judgement proof, on people who had nothing to do with the use.<p>Looks like you are an ultra extreme libertarian. And that&#x27;s fine. But like anarchy I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad ideal, I just think it&#x27;s a pipe dream.<p>How do you mean reversibility leads to increased consumerism? You mean because I wouldn&#x27;t buy things online if my credit card wouldn&#x27;t allow me to reverse the charges if it&#x27;s a scam?<p>That sounds like capitalism, to me. You&#x27;re free as a business to only accept debit cards. Debit cards don&#x27;t (in my jurisdiction at least, and AFAIK most or all) don&#x27;t have the same protections as credit cards.<p>Do you not like capitalism? This seems incompatible with the libertarian values you seem to have.<p>&gt; Fraud protection could very well be kept under control and prevented with insurance,<p>I truly wish you good luck with that. No sarcasm. But I do also mean &quot;yeah, good luck with that&quot;.<p>&gt; instead of potentially invalidating every economic transaction.<p>Oh, you mean like the Ethereum DAO split? That was the true &quot;socialism for the people who have connections, capitalism for the poor&quot;.')
