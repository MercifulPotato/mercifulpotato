It isn&#x27;t about bias, it is about intent. MSNBC, CNN, etc are capitalist enterprises biased towards revenue and clicks - it&#x27;s in their DNA.<p>FOX was created explicitly by Ailes and Murdoch to prevent a second Nixon style teardown of the GOP. It&#x27;s the reason Disney wanted absolutely nothing to do with the news arm when it acquired the rest of the Fox media empire - it&#x27;s a capitalist enterprise only in the sense that it&#x27;s profitable as a side effect of their main goal.')
