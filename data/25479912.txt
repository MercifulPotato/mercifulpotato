The ads I&#x27;ve gotten have, indeed, become a lot less relevant. Honestly, it&#x27;s not great! Lowest-common-denominator ads feel really gross.<p>As an entrepreneur selling a consumer product I created on Shopify, access to well-targeted ads would make a huge difference to my business. (I can&#x27;t use FB to advertise since I sell a pandemic-related product, long story).<p>It&#x27;s a niche product, so non-targeted ads like &quot;local newspaper ads&quot; would probably perform far too poorly to justify their expense.<p>People who buy my product tend to be very grateful for it, but not many know it exists! It&#x27;s crazy how much your perspective on personalized ads change once you&#x27;re on the other side â€“ I really wish I could use them!')
