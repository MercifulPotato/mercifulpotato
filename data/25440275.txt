In the past year I&#x27;ve had several occasions where important messages get somehow &quot;lost&quot; in the UI. The ones I&#x27;ve noticed are messages I&#x27;ve been waiting for, so I&#x27;ve gone and dug them out of &quot;all mail&quot; in most cases. They just wouldn&#x27;t show in the normal inbox despite not being flagged as spam.<p>This outage has now convinced me I need a new email provider.')
