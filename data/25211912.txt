We know we have life on our planet, so we know it&#x27;s possible in an earth like environment. So the only evidence we have points to earth like planets being more likely.<p>The interstellar space craft is of course possible, but since we don&#x27;t have any ourselves, but we have radio for a while now, it seems more likely that the signal originated from a planet, since the interstellar space craft is much more complex technology for which we don&#x27;t have evidence yet.')
