And before that serialization happens, your config can be <i>expressed</i> using the regular-ass coding features of your program, however you like. (For optimal clarity, I personally would suggest creating a builder DSL and using it.)<p>† Technically a language doesn&#x27;t even need a YAML serialization library to emit valid YAML; because <i>valid JSON is also valid YAML</i>. You can just serialize to JSON on your end, and feed the result into anything that&#x27;s expecting YAML.')
