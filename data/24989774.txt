I&#x27;d much rather have the devil I know than a bunch of automation and technology that might have bigger issues.  Since it&#x27;s not nationally controlled, and each US state (and county) can do what it wants, a big push to use tech is almost sure to backfire. And backfire in ways that aren&#x27;t immediately obvious.')
