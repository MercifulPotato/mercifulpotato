Your customers are starting to notice your app is slow, and your boss asks you to work out what it&#x27;ll take to fix the problem, but the problem is you just don&#x27;t scale.<p>You get a pretty clear idea that by the time you hit 50k customers, you&#x27;re going to need 10x as many servers, and by 100k, you&#x27;ll need 25 times as many (because your costs per customer keep going up, and lots of things scale logarithmicly). Either you&#x27;re smart enough to know your boss will laugh in your face, or you&#x27;re not and they do.<p>So I guess it&#x27;s time to start optimizing. You cut some n^2 behavior down to nlogn with a smaller C, and you make your servers 4 times faster, but much more importantly you decrease your run rate. Now you only need 2x as many machines for 5x the customers, instead of 10x. That&#x27;s 80%, but you&#x27;re getting diminishing returns. Eventually you <i>have</i> to be 99% better because you have a million users and you couldn&#x27;t possibly return a profit if you needed that much hardware.')
