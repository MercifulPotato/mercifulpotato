Expect to see an explosion in bartering, the use of ad-hoc &quot;currencies&quot; (both physical and digital) and precious metals as this absurd scheme is rolled out.<p>Aside from the utter economic disaster that will result from central planners by the implementation of this scheme, just look at the situation in and around Nashville for the predictable disaster that will result from the first power or internet outage when legal, physical currency is eliminated.  Without physical cash or a means of exchange it would be absolute chaos.  This is perhaps the worst idea in history (which is choked with terrible ideas).')
