How so?  What are you seeing?<p>Tax benefits, work-life balance and bigger homes?  Really, you can see these changes in the last 6 months of a pandemic?    I could be wrong but I don&#x27;t think the majority of employers are letting employees change states (and state taxes).  WFH does not mean work from anywhere, especially tax-wise.<p>This all sounds plausible longer term but to say you&#x27;re inundated seems like it must be hyperbolic.')
