A child often needs to see just a few examples of an object, or even only one, before being able to recognize it for life.<p>I see this a lot. It&#x27;s completely wrong. I&#x27;m not trying to pick on the author here, I think 95%+ of people share this misunderstanding of deep learning.<p>If you see &quot;only one&quot; horse, say for even a second, you really are seeing a huge number of horses, from various angles, with various shades of lighting. The motions of the horse; the motions of your head (even if slight); the undulations of the light; are generating a much larger number of basically augmented training data. If you look at a horse for a minute it could be the equivalent of training on 1 million images of a horse. I&#x27;m not sure the exact OOM, but it&#x27;s certainly orders of magnitude more than &quot;one&quot; horse.<p>(Relatedly: Some people say there is an experiment you can conduct at home to see the actual images your brain is training on).')
