I&#x27;ve degoogled my personal life but still have to use it for work (i.e. G-Suite SSO). I can force all those sites to open in my work container which leaves my other containers Google-free.<p>Before Firefox I used Brave with multiple profiles and it was very painful to use in practice; two sets of extensions, two unlocks of 1Password X, no ability to force certain websites to open in Profile X or Y, etc.<p>But yes, Firefox feels like it&#x27;s getting progressively slower and I&#x27;m finding more and more things that don&#x27;t support it. In particular, many of the recent spatial audio tools just flat out refuse to run in Firefox, and tools like Apple Business Manager don&#x27;t run even though they typically work fine if you spoof the User Agent.<p>If a Chromium-based browser like Vivaldi or Brave added containers it&#x27;d be a very compelling alternative.')
