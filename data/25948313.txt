I can start a teams call with anyone and have a 1-on-1 conversation with no distractions. When we were still going to the office, it was difficult to have a 1-on-1 conversation because you would have all the noise of people around you talking loudly, plus my own conversation is distracting those other people who are sitting 3 feet away but are not part of the conversation. So we&#x27;d have to go to a meeting room nearby, but then you don&#x27;t have your computer screen available, so you can&#x27;t talk about the code you&#x27;re working on. The whole concept of trying to collaborate in the office was ludicrous. Adding insult to injury, the company calls these cramped office spaces &quot;collaborative&quot;.')
