What of it? The devil is in the details. The &quot;Opium Wars&quot; were about more than drugs and it is reductionist to only look at its impact on the drug trade.<p>&gt; And use it to prove that domestic merchants can challenge ccp and force the current Chinese government to change behavior is as about nonsensical as claiming Trump did a perfect job in fighting COVID-19...<p>The desires of Chinese people certainly do impact their government&#x27;s actions.')
