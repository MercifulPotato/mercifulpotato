The companies I&#x27;ve sold to could give you a copy if they wanted. But your rights aren&#x27;t omnipresent.<p>It&#x27;s even worse than that. You can sell the software without distribution modifications to the client. You only need to give modifications if the client ask for them.<p>There is no interest for the client to request unless they want to break off from the software contract. If you&#x27;re found to violate the GPL, the client will be unable to use the software, they have more to loose than you.')
