Everything beyond that is from other cues such as motion parallax, relative size, lighting and shading, and perspective.<p>The reason people become clumsy when using night vision devices is because they have a tiny field of view that only moves when your head moves. You can close one eye and walk around just fine. But if you attach two toilet paper tubes to your face, you&#x27;ll have trouble balancing and avoiding obstacles. The clumsiness is caused by the lack of peripheral vision and the inability to quickly glance (since the only way to change what you see is to turn your head).')
