You can make the case that that root finding algorithm shouldn&#x27;t be the default (if it is). You can argue for a warning, as mentioned in the bug, but what else? I personally prefer less magic in the algorithms (e.g. detect if it is a quadratic and pick a suitable algorithm), and more information in the docs about the method being used so the user is aware.<p>Actually, I can see the argument both ways. To each his own. You&#x27;re not fundamentally wrong, but you&#x27;re also not fundamentally right either :-)<p>I personally should think their returned result should display the value of the function evaluated at their root so the programmer can check it against his own tolerance.')
