Although we believe that x64 Electron apps will run under Rosetta 2, there are some important things to note (and reasons why you should ship a native arm64 binary).<p>* Your app&#x27;s performance will be significantly degraded. Electron &#x2F; V8 uses JIT compilation for JavaScript, and due to how Rosetta works, you will effectively be running JIT twice (once in V8 and once in Rosetta).<p>* You lose the benefit of new technology in Apple Silicon, such as the increased memory page size.<p>* Did we mention that the performance will be significantly degraded?<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.electronjs.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;apple-silicon#what-about-rosetta-2" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.electronjs.org&#x2F;blog&#x2F;apple-silicon#what-about-ros...</a>')
