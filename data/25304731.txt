Too many users grew up with this new model so they don&#x27;t see the loss.<p>None of the devices you mention are user serviceable in any way hardware-wise, the software is almost always locked onto the device and there&#x27;s no easy, or even supported way of changing it. And if you do change it you just get a small variation of the same software. Your phone may get a slightly degooglified version of Android but it&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;ll get it to run Ubuntu, Windows, or a FreeBSD without a <i>massive</i> investment in time and knowledge.')
