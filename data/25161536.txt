I can totally understand that a car has a software &#x2F; OS that is locked down. But a consumer device? - Apple is slowly moving the whole industry in a direction where in a couple of decades we can use electronic devices only in a way that the producer wants it to be used. Locking up systems, not allowing departure in any way, taking each and every freedom to tinker with devices we own: despicable.<p>Edit: I absolutely hate Apple‘s vision for computing devices. Don‘t tell me it‘s good for my grandma because she can‘t mess up with her computer. You can build machines that are both easy to use and give us the freedom to do whatever we want to do with them. Extend them, change them, hack them, open them up, change parts, install other OSes, and whatnot.')
