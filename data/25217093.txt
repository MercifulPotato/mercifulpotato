As much as possible, they&#x27;re anticipating what the story will reveal and getting their objections on the record so that a reader can&#x27;t help but view the story&#x27;s assertions in light of the responses they&#x27;ve already read.<p>Moreover, getting in front of this means adopting a stance of openness and transparency that, in itself, seems quite laudible.  As a PR strategy, this is good work, especially for a company that&#x27;s already raised its profile on these topics earlier in the year.<p>Whether it&#x27;s cynical PR strategy or sincere crisis management is left for the reader to decide.')
