As far as I can tell, Google itself is making the word &quot;droid&quot; a key element of its objection [1] (the author did not name his company OrpheusAndroid), so issues raised by its meaning, origin and usage are in scope (they may also be moot if Google has or licenses &quot;droid&quot; itself as a trademark.)<p>[1] &quot;As I guessed, on last day of the time period to object, there comes a mail from Trade Mark Registry of a opposition from Google claiming that I infringe the word &quot;droid&quot; and its similar to &#x27;Android&quot; for which they own trademark. The entire opposition notice was flooded with word droid.&quot;')
