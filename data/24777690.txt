I call it integration testing, some people call it functional testing.<p>The question is why you want to test that one class? We do have some modules in our (elixir) system that are &#x27;thoroughly&#x27; unit tested. These are modules that are algorithmically complicated so testing them in isolation is useful. Most of the code is tested in logical chunks though.')
