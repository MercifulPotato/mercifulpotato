Amazon, while being dominant in eCommerce, is still a small player in overall retail and has legit competition from Alibaba and the likes. eBay is still a thing as well. As is Shopify. So Amazon could argue to be less of an anti-trust candidat purely because of that. Whether this is true or not is a different matter, so.<p>Google on the other hand, well I don&#x27;t know about any legit compeitor in the web search field. They do have a quais duo-poly for ads together with facebook IMHO. Not saying they have to split up, but I&#x27;d expec Google to have a much harder time argueing against anti-trust charges.<p>And strangely enough, I don&#x27;t think that this is in any way a political stunt or politically motivated. The investigations are going for quite a while now already.')
