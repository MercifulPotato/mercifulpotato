When trying to use Wifi, she has frequent breakups of her stream.  Using <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;packetlosstest.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;packetlosstest.com&#x2F;</a>, we see that frequently many packets are delayed several hundred MS.<p>The only thing which has seemed to help is reducing the 5Ghz channel width and forcing the AP to use one of the lesser occupied 5Ghz channels.  This is what has made me think that interference is the problem.  A channel scan shows well over 100 APs..<p>EDIT:  Are there AP features or tuning which will influence how well, and&#x2F;or how quick it can react to interference?<p>I&#x27;ve been hoping that the 6GHz band will improve things for her when 6Ghz APs become available.  I was going to build her an AP using an Intel AX210, however I realized that the AX210 does not support AP mode so that plan won&#x27;t work.')
