We either find solutions (voluntary degrowth for instance), or physics laws will stop us, and from that point the societies us two live in collapse.\nBut who knows what will happen ? So far, we developed new tech not thinking about those physical limits. That state of mind is definitely changing, especially among students. With that said I also tend to be pessimistic, and I don&#x27;t think things are moving fast enough in the right direction. But if I do not hope for that, try to find where I can use my skills (and what I love to do) to help tackle those challenges, what do I do ? Because yes, egotistically, I still want to work in CS.')
