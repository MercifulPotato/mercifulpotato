We were a pretty early adopter I guess, we&#x27;ve been on it for well over a year now and it&#x27;s evolved a lot since then. That it&#x27;s now split up in separate modules makes it much easier to work with. Something that I couldn&#x27;t find back then was tutorials or blog posts on how to really work with it, not just deploy happy case apps. The product wasn&#x27;t very popular yet so there was really no community producing that kind of blog post.<p>Also that the Gitlab issues have now merged into one repository has made reporting an issue so much clearer. You guys are constantly improving at such a rapid pace, definitely kudos for that.')
