Or does it still pretty much require you to write a single superkernel in a buggy, difficult-to-debug language subset?<p>C isn&#x27;t usually a breath of fresh air, but the last two times I tried to use nubacuda and failed (~1.5 year ago), it sure felt that way.<p>EDIT: yes, looks like it supports on-device buffers now.
