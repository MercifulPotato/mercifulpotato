It&#x27;s such a common sense thing to me that WeWork would stuggle in a market abundant with vacant office space.<p>I almost feel like I&#x27;m shouting that the Emperor Has No Clothes.<p>----\nWhat makes everyone think that corporate landlords facing unfathomable vacancies won&#x27;t be able to hyper-aggressively compete with WeWork on short-term leasing, internet and amenities for tenants? They have much more leverage than WeWork does in terms of floor construction&#x2F;reconfiguration costs. In such an environment, WeWork would not be able to lease and make money and would likely have to transition more of its portfolio to owned-properties, slowing its growth and subjecting the company to more risk...<p>Companies like Convene are much better suited to what&#x27;s coming than WeWork is as suitable meeting space is likely to come at a premium.')
