But at a certain point simple&#x27;s budgeting system breaks, once you have another card. I would make payments per transaction on my CC to maintain that tagging data within Simple for reporting.<p>For years I was left unsatisfied with a tool that managed expenses with multiple cards and I found it half a year ago in CoPilot: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;copilot.money" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;copilot.money</a><p>Great app and handles internal transfers (ie payments to a card or another account) with grace. Smart rule system, recurring transactions, etc. Mint on steroids. Highly recommend for people like me looking for tools to replace simple.<p>Note: I am in no way affiliated with CoPilot, just found them super useful for that function as Simple wasn&#x27;t hitting it.<p>Shameless referral code for a free month: 7UWQ7W <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;copilot.money&#x2F;link&#x2F;cXPAZ3zJ3QT2N4LS6" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;copilot.money&#x2F;link&#x2F;cXPAZ3zJ3QT2N4LS6</a>')
