If you care about say privacy and you constantly receive news about surveillance, it can be disheartening, so it&#x27;s easier to dismiss the news with &quot;well, what did you expect?&quot;. I know I used to do that, in my head at least. I&#x27;m not advocating for cynicism of course, just saying that people might be doing it for deeper reasons than sounding smart and world-weary.')
