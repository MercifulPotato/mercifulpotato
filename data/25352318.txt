There will <i>always</i> be superstars that make the majority of the money, and tons and tons of wannabe artists that make almost nothing. That was just as true 20 years ago as it is today. If anything, streaming makes it possible to find those smaller artists and sample what they&#x27;re making without having to go to some esoteric store and pay $20 for an album that you&#x27;ve never heard before.<p>The system may be broken, but I&#x27;m not sure going back to the old system is the right approach.')
