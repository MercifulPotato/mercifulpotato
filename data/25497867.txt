He slogged through crap code happily. He did his job and went home.  Sadly, the first company I worked with him at fired him.  &quot;He wasn&#x27;t competent, blah blah blah.&quot;  He did a fine job, people just didn&#x27;t like that his mentality was different than theirs.  I tried to explain to them that the one person who would actually work on their horrendous software was the one they let go.  Was he a superstar? No probably not, but he was good and liked his job and went home to his family at the end of the day.  A lot of people don&#x27;t realize a great employee comes in many forms.')
