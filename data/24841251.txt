If I think something is spam, my 1st degree of separation (who has handshaked with me to verify that yes we&#x27;ve met) also probably does, but his colleague, maybe not.<p>MUAs and online email service providers would check the compiled whitelist for each account before running their own spam filtering.<p>We have good online adblock lists, can we do the same for email spamlists without 27 clicks to whitelist or blacklist emails?<p>Servers would have to not blackhole spam-tripping emails and reply with &#x27;you spam = bad&#x27;, that is another problem entirely.')
