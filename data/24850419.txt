Using a series of Raspberry Pi Model B boards is possible, but with the new range of Raspberry Pi Compute Modules, we can build clusters that offer the same or greater computational power while consuming less space. The Turing Pi 1 [1] from Turing Machines used seven Compute Module 3+, but with the announcement of the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4, the company has announced [2] Turing Pi 2, which will support up to four Compute Module 4 boards.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;turingpi.com&#x2F;v1&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;turingpi.com&#x2F;v1&#x2F;</a> \n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;turingpi.com&#x2F;turing-pi-2-announcement&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;turingpi.com&#x2F;turing-pi-2-announcement&#x2F;</a>')
