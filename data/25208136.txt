Until market is shown wrong, the value that market assigns to something is at least some evidence of it’s true value.<p>Do you have the ability to show that PoS is NOT as secure as PoW?<p>&gt; Also, sorry to burst your bubble, but universe doesn’t care about socially beneficial outcomes.<p>No shit. Never said it was. In fact when I mentioned market failures I made it explicit that I believe this to be true.<p>&gt; So right now you’re basically arguing that bitcoin isn’t valuable because you don’t like what it’s valued for. There’s nothing wrong with that, but at least admit how highly subjective and contrary to available evidence that opinion is.<p>What the fuck are you talking about?? I never said anything remotely related to this. I said that your idea of &quot;PoW is never wasteful&quot; was meaningless. Maybe you were paused from posting on HN for straw manning?')
