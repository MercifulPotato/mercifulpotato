Item(by='hedora', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609523849, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25604889, text='Oxford measured differently than the 90% mRNA vaccines.  In particular, the 60% was based on testing for asymptomatic cases, and 90% was not.  The three vaccines work on similar principles.  I’ll assume they are all the same.<p>So, expect them to cut symptomatic cases by 90% among people that get the vaccine, and to add up to (60% * the percentage of people that get the vaccine) to the herd immunity progress bar.<p>The vaccines will likely cut total deaths by less than 90%, because vaccines tend to be less effective on more vulnerable people, and of course, less than 100% of the population will get it on time.<p>We could get lucky, and they could cut deaths of immunized people by more than 90%; no one knows yet.  However the dosing screw up in the Oxford study inadvertently showed it is much less effective on old people.<p>The new variant speeds up the clock, which means more people will catch COVID before receiving the vaccine.  It’s an exponential curve, so if the current R value is 1 (optimistic), and with new lockdowns and the new variant it’s 1.7 (taking the doomsday “add 0.7” from the headline), then cases will increase ~1.7x every two weeks.  There are 18 two-week periods between now and fall, when Fauci says we’re likely to return to normal.  1.7^18 is ~14,000x.<p>There have been 83M confirmed cases globally according to Johns Hopkins, 83M * 14K &gt;&gt; the population of the earth, so the vaccine will be rounding error if the headline and Fauci’s warnings are correct.  (It will allow frontline health workers to keep working, but that’s about it, and the hospitals will still be overrun).<p>If we assume the roll out takes 6 months, and the new variant increases R value by 0.3 (in range according to the article), then 1.3^12 = 23x.  There’s some\ntime lag while the new virus is mostly in the UK, and more stringent measures could reduce 1.3 by a little bit.  In that scenario, the vaccine will still save many people.<p>I suspect the second scenario is more realistic.')
