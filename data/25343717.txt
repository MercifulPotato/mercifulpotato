I&#x27;ve always stuck with dot coms and just picked interesting suffixes - domains ending with cloud were very hot for a while. I do disagree about sites like Sedo not being a good place to sell - when people search for domains in their registrar, the similar results from sedo and others will appear in the list as available (at a higher price of course). Just having a landing page will simply list the domain as taken, so your potential buyers have to really want the name to contact you.<p>Basically, don&#x27;t rely on type in traffic alone - list buy it now prices on sedo and you&#x27;ll move domains with ease')
