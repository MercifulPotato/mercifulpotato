Item(by='tsycho', descendants=None, kids=[25152628], score=None, time=1605809366, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25151903, text='I hated it initially, but am fine with it now.<p>When YTM is better than GPM:<p>1&#x2F; Auto-created playlists, especially after you just search for a song and hit play. On GPM, it would play different covers on the same song (basically all the search results) by default, unless you started a radio, which is a cool concept but was hit and miss in practice. On YTM, it continues with similar songs, and I have liked their selection so far.<p>2&#x2F; The library seems to have increased; I guess they have access to more songs that were YT exclusive for some reason.<p>3&#x2F; While I normally never use video mode on YTM, but once in a while for a cool song, it&#x27;s nice to be able to seamlessly switch to video and cast to my TV.<p>On the cons side, I don&#x27;t like the playlist management and home screen UI (which is what I hated initially), but it&#x27;s not bothering me much anymore now that I am getting used to it I guess.<p>Initially, I had planned to just cancel the subscription, but held on because using YouTube with ads was just plain intolerable. I get reminded of this everytime I open a Youtube link on my work account Chrome profile by mistake.')
