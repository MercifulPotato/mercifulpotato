A silicon valley high tech story underlying the whole thing...<p>Combining different ingredients is basic food science and you&#x27;ll see fantastic things in the ingredient list of most modern industrial foods. No need for a made-up AI or stories about finding a match of &#x27;molecules&#x27;.<p>Happy to see the veggie space grow but this marketing is just outrageous...<p>P.S.: I&#x27;ve been veggie for more than a decade and Incredible Burger despite all its advertisement tastes rancid and sad compared to many existing alternatives. If you don&#x27;t like it don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking that all veggie&#x2F;vegan stuff tastes bad ;)')
