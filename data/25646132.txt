I smoked for at least 20 years. I cut the nicotine out very rapidly but kept using the vaporizer. Being able to nerd out about coils and mods and whatnot helped keep me interested because it allowed me to tinker too. The first year or two was difficult, when I&#x27;d go out for drinks. After that, the vaporizer did the trick and the two times I tried a cigarette, they were gross. These days, I just stare at the thing. It&#x27;s there if I need or want it but I never do. The oral fixation was harder than the nicotine. Gums don&#x27;t do a good job and you can&#x27;t taper off. Try a vaporizer.  Switching changed my life.')
