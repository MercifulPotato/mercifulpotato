I&#x27;m not a fan of any IM system. I will use iMessage, from time to time, but it&#x27;s usually email and Git Issues.<p>I use Slack as a &quot;store and forward&quot; system, like email; only checking it occasionally.<p>But I have the luxury of being the only tech person on one team; doing 100% of the coding, and being nothing more than a &quot;hands off peanut gallery&quot; on another.
