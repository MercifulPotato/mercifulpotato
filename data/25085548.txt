I have longed tried to map a project of mine (serverless game server for TGC based on workers) onto the available storage tech (KV), but consistency guarantees just weren&#x27;t where I needed them to be. Hope they&#x27;ll find a slot soon.<p>Edit:<p>(If someone from CF has questions, you can reach me at hn@elasticwaffle.com)<p>My use case is pretty much exactly the one described in the blog post (over on CF) for multiplayer games. Using DO for ongoing 1v1 matches in a trading-card-game style turn-by-turn strategy game. Players would play against a simple AI (which itself is a worker) or other players. The game is served from Workers Static Sites. But multiplayer required stronger coordination and the delay from KV writes to reach all PoPs is a deal-breaker. DO solve not only that, but the interface (just being classes) allows the game design to melt with the backend design.')
