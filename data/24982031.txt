The court has only the testimony and financial state of the two people on which to go with.  If he was the one making the money, and she was home with the child, what does that say about _who_ was doing what work?<p>And yes, it would be good for there to be more pressure on men to parent, and on there being more acceptable models of parenting partnerships than breadwinner and child rearer.<p>I don&#x27;t like the idea of court standards being tied to gender (or gendered roles), but it does have to take into account who was doing what work and how to ensure the safety of children while the parents disentangle their marital and financial bonds.')
