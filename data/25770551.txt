Pensions are contribution based but that contribution comes from taxes on your salary...\nWelfare is absolutely not contributory in Europe<p>This is just incorrect.<p>In Ireland, there is a contributory state pension [0] of up to €500 a week, which you are entitled to if you spent enough years in the workforce making tax contributions. There&#x27;s also a means-tested non-contributory pension [1] of €237 per week which you are entitled to if you don&#x27;t have other savings or income, such as the contributory pension. In addition to these, private pensions exist: basically savings vehicles with certain restrictions and certain tax advantages.<p>There&#x27;s a similar two-tier system for unemployment assistance and certain healthcare entitlements. I understand many other European countries have similar arrangements, despite your assertion.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.citizensinformation.ie&#x2F;en&#x2F;social_welfare&#x2F;social_welfare_payments&#x2F;older_and_retired_people&#x2F;state_pension_contributory.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.citizensinformation.ie&#x2F;en&#x2F;social_welfare&#x2F;social_...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.citizensinformation.ie&#x2F;en&#x2F;social_welfare&#x2F;social_welfare_payments&#x2F;older_and_retired_people&#x2F;state_pension_non_contributory.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.citizensinformation.ie&#x2F;en&#x2F;social_welfare&#x2F;social_...</a>')
