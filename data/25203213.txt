It&#x27;s more about them abusing their power&#x2F;influence&#x2F;wealth if anything.<p>The dynamics of dating in Asia amongst native population Asians is a whole different story than that experienced by Asian-Americans in the US (or other Western countries). The demographics there are largely homogenous and expectations by far are that you&#x27;re most likely going to date and marry someone of your own ethnicity.<p>If you&#x27;re a Korean man in Korea, you&#x27;re probably not at any disadvantage on the domestic dating scene because of your ethnicity, you probably have close to zero expectation that you&#x27;ll be dating someone who is not Korean, or at least not Asian.')
