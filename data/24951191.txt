You can even DIY for $115 including required tools.<p>I know someone whose iPhone XR glass back broke after a year (they had a super robust case), Apple&#x27;s response was it was not cost effective to repair. Ultimately devices designed to be repaired is the best answer (and maybe not have glass backs?), but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s that much difference in many cases here.')
