The casette-player was broken, so I started entering BASIC programs from the manual.<p>Later I hacked games for extra-lives, because I wasn&#x27;t a good game-player, and that eventually lead to me becoming a programmer - assembly and C, then later scripting languages and more high-level work.<p>Once programming for money became less interesting I switched to doing it for fun, and evolved into a sysadmin (and nowadays I get called &quot;devops engineer&quot; which is a horrible title, but a lovely niche).')
