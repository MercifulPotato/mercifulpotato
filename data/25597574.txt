Even the top pay grades come in at less than what an average (or even less than average) developer can make in industry.  <i>Much</i> less if you also consider equity comp.<p>Sure, there are some people who will see working for USDS or 18F as a call to serve their country, and will accept a pay cut in order to do that, but I imagine that&#x27;s a pretty small slice of the pie.<p>Beyond that, it&#x27;s the bureaucracy.  I would honestly consider said pay cut in order to help make dealing with government computing systems better, but what I will not deal with is layers upon layers upon layers of bureaucracy.  I&#x27;ve watched the 50-person startup I started at 9 years ago evolve into a 3500-person public company, and even here I find the bureaucracy and hierarchy stifling at times.  At a government job I imagine it&#x27;ll be orders of magnitude worse.  I wouldn&#x27;t even last half a year in that environment.<p>Yes, Play #4 in their list in theory suggests that they&#x27;ll try to cut through all that, but I don&#x27;t believe for a second that will go well.')
