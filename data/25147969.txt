Mine used to worry I was &quot;addicted&quot; to programming on the home PC. I&#x27;d say, no mum. I don&#x27;t go outside and frolic in the fields like a Victorian-era child because we live in the middle of a giant housing estate in the North West of England where it&#x27;s always cold and pissing with rain. My friends live a car drive away and we aren&#x27;t into football, which is the only thing available to do outside around here, plus I read most of the interesting books in the house already, I&#x27;ve grown out of cartoons, the computer is more interesting than children&#x27;s TV and <i>definitely</i> more interesting than homework, most of which is of obviously marginal utility when I become an adult.<p>Or at least that&#x27;s what I would have said, if I&#x27;d been articulate enough to know how.<p>The child in this article doesn&#x27;t sound &quot;addicted&quot; to her phone. It sounds like the wealth of social, creative and interesting activities available through it are just far more interesting than playing dolls with her mum. Maybe it&#x27;s tough for her mum to accept that her daughter is growing up, but she had to grow out of that at some point - it was inevitable that <i>something</i> would replace it. Would she prefer if it had been TV, like it was for prior generations?')
