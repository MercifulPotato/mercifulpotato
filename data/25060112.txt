My point is that the RIAA&#x27;s DMCA takedown request was valid.\n(IANAL) The law is also a lot more nuanced than how you described, since the hypothetical case would probably be thrown out with legal fees covered due to anti-SLAPP laws, but if it didn&#x27;t fall under that, you probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to recover legal fees without some sort of counter lawsuit.')
