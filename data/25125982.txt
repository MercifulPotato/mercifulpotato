But I&#x27;ve also been a programmer for 30 years so I can appreciate pure SW projects that are hidden from the end-user as technical achievements. So at first things like AirBnB or travel search engines don&#x27;t seem very techy but once these apps or websites are past their initial clunky releases there&#x27;s a lot of hard work in the background that makes for a pleasant user experience.')
