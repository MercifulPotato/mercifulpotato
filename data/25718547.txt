The child isn&#x27;t bound to it, but the other party is.  In this case, a corporation attempted to use an extreme disparity in knowledge and power to take advantage of a much weaker party.  The disparity is larger than that between an average adult and an average child.  As a consequence of this, it seems just as fair as in the case of contracts signed by children.')
