Item(by='pmiller2', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609800258, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25631848, text='This seems to be less about &quot;tech&quot; compensation than &quot;startup&quot; compensation, on a first reading.  The bits about having to wait for liquidity don&#x27;t apply when working at a public company, and 4 year vesting schedules don&#x27;t matter very much when you can sell immediately, either.  The only factor there is the 1 year cliff, which, for discounting purposes, is not very long relative to the 30 year timespans referenced elsewhere.<p>I&#x27;m between the 2 examples: I&#x27;m not a 20 year old, and not a 60 year old.  I think I would still take the promise of a billion in 30 years, but, only if there were a reasonable floor to that promise.  How high the floor would have to be depends on exactly what I&#x27;d be required to do to get it. In 30 years, I hope to be a few years into retirement, but still young enough that I&#x27;ll have a decent amount of life expectancy left to enjoy it.<p>This also means that, although I would be considered a senior engineer by now, I won&#x27;t be looking to &quot;cure cancer&quot; with a 2 year old startup, as one of the YC job ads on the front page suggests, simply because the risk of joining a 2 year old startup is so high, and won&#x27;t pay off for such a long time that the future discounted expected return is far, far less than just joining a public company now.')
