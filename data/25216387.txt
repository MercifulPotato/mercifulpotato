Beyond that, it holds incredibly little.<p>For a short while I dated a vegan, and that was the most veganism has had any impact on my life. Planning meals together required more work to find viable options. I enjoyed the few vegan meals that I ate during that time, but it never changed my personal eating&#x2F;purchasing habits. Nor have my beliefs been affected by any conversations I&#x27;ve had on the subject.<p>&gt; you have created an imaginary idealised version of veganism<p>I&#x27;m pointing out glaring holes in its fundamental philosophy. You didn&#x27;t respond to any points I raised about Nirvana Fallacy being a core part of veganism. Nor have any of my points been debated or addressed in this thread. Just a lot of &quot;Pro veganism! Yay! Shun the non-believer&quot; talk, which does nothing to actually support it.<p>The olive branch I offer from the other side of this argument is that there <i>are</i> positives to reducing the commodification of animals and animal products. It doesn&#x27;t mean that I believe it&#x27;s a solid, effective, or feasible philosophy to live by.')
