The Sebastopol Sketches about Tolstoi&#x27;s impressionf of the Crimean War, for instance?<p>For a (much more refined!) literary work, I think my favourite is Hadji Murat - where Tolstoi contemplates loyalty and honour.<p>And, of course, there&#x27;s Anna Karenina and War and Peace, though I&#x27;ll heretically admit that the latter didn&#x27;t give me much except relief I&#x27;d churned myself through it by the time it was finished; I think I&#x27;d have appreciated it more if I&#x27;d kept notes underway - the dramatis personae is mind-bogglingly huge, and I suspect I lost lots of nuance as I lost track of the characters and their relationships.<p>Bulgakov&#x27;s &#x27;Master and Margarita&#x27; was a great read, but I&#x27;d suggest you get hold of a good commentary or annotated edition; when I first read it, I lost lots of context as I didn&#x27;t catch references to contemporary Soviet society and persons (With several characters in the novel being modeled on real movers and shakers in the Soviet cultural scene)<p>The story is brilliantly absurd and funny, though.')
