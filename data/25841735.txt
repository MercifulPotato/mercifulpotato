At least 11 Secret Service agents had to be hospitalized after they defended the WH and President from angry rioters...how on earth is that materially different from January 6? Suppose they had succeeded in breaking through the line?<p>What exactly is so sacrosanct about elections that disputing them is an insurrection, but not storming Senate chambers to stop a Supreme Court confirmation, trying to storm the WH, or literally declaring an autonomous zone not subject to the US government?<p>It’s hard for me to understand how this is not simply nit picking some insubstantial detail and using it to put the things we like on one side and the things we don’t like on another. Never mind that the election nor the integrity  thereof were ever remotely threatened by these riots.')
