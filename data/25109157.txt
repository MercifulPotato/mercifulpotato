Item(by='ohazi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605512643, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25107900, text='&gt; Is there anyone shipping an ARM motherboard and ARM chip? I think the &quot;openness&quot; is also defined by what the market offers. All I see are non-extendable notebooks.<p>Pretty much all ARM application processors use soldered BGA packages over sockets, and there also isn&#x27;t the same tradition of defining a standard pinout for a generation or two (or five) of chips like there has been for x86 (e.g. LGA1151, AM4, etc.).<p>You can&#x27;t really design a motherboard without this, so each design tends to have a custom breakout board or carrier card that&#x27;s designed to be used in relatively specific installations.')
