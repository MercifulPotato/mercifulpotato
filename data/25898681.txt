This was going to be my dream home. It required stretching the budget but was doable.<p>I had panic attacks for a week and ultimately backed out of the deal. I didn’t lose any money other than realize that I got into something without thinking it through, was paralyzed by fear and anxiety, and then had to back out. It was a GREAT deal. There’s literally nothing in the same market that even close.<p>This was supposed to be my first home purchase. And I got lucky at the deal I was getting, but I just couldn’t go through with it.<p>My spouse isn’t saying anything, but I know I’ve disappointed them. I really did want that house but I think the right decision was to hold off for another year... but then I think about it and I feel we really need the larger space and now is the right time.<p>I realized how indecisive and immature was on something so important. Complete lack of backbone on my part.')
