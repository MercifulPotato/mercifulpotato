I like that the AI had a bit of a personality.<p>In terms of bad vs. good, though, music is like a lot of things in life, so subjective that you can&#x27;t judge another person&#x27;s taste. If for no other reason than people care about music to wildly different degrees. I&#x27;ve met people who say they don&#x27;t listen to music. As in ever. Others cannot let a minute go by without having something playing in their head. It&#x27;s akin to judging taste in food or recreational activities or movies. It&#x27;s not really about what&#x27;s good, rather, what gets a positive mental response.<p>That point aside, I&#x27;d say that what would be interesting is measuring how broad a person&#x27;s musical tastes are. I.e., how  much have they been exposed to and how much of that have they assimilated into their regular listening rotation. Pandora does a pretty good job suggesting artists I&#x27;ve never heard. When I hear one I like, I&#x27;ll incorporate some songs into my regular rotation on Spotify.<p>If you must know, I have Bad Taste. The bad as in Hawaiian shirt-etc.-etc.-etc.... bad.')
