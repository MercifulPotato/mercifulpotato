Butchers were goaded into closing, and those who refused were attacked. Their inventory was destroyed and in many cases their windows and fixtures were smashed. &quot;<p>So it&#x27;s okay if they do it, but not okay when it&#x27;s done upon them?<p>--<p>I don&#x27;t get the point of the article, they want a product includes more labor, more time and more duty to a select, niche, market -<p>&quot;Of course, not only kosher meat was affected. Prices rose for everyone. But the Jews were the first to feel the heat because kosher meat was more expensive. Prices had to reflect not only the wages of slaughterers and religious supervisors, but also the cost of transporting live cattle to New York. Because kosher meat had to be salted and soaked in the home within 72 hours of slaughter, it could not, like the non-kosher variety, be killed in Chicago and shipped more cheaply as a carcass.&quot;<p>--<p>&quot;As the Brooklyn Daily Eagle put it at the time, the women â€œseem to have imbibed a fundamental principle of Americanism as quickly as any earlier [immigrants] did. They decided that they were unjustly taxed, or charged, which amounts to the same thing for the person who pays, and they went out to find a means to remedy the injustice.&quot;<p>I disagree, it&#x27;s more labour intensive, it&#x27;s not unjust. Consumers demanded meat a certain way, and then refused to pay more for the product as it was more labor intensive, more transportation intensive, and have specific rituals associated with it.<p>Very disgusting piece of history imo and only further trains social behavior of being angry and making sure no one else has if it you can&#x27;t. Normal meat was affordable, they decided they wanted to force business to reduce prices of kosher meat which is more labor and transport intensive. That&#x27;s not okay.')
