As I said in another comment, I think we&#x27;re slowly approaching the point where you can mostly expect them to work the same. When the first Macbooks and other laptops with USB-C arrived, compatibility and adoption was awful, and we&#x27;re finally getting to a point where things are less awful.<p>Would it have been better if they all worked exactly the same from day 1? Absolutely. Do I think we&#x27;ll get to a point where USB-C is categorically better than what came before? Also yes.')
