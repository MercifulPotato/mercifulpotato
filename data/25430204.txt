Somebody is in charge of that prison&#x2F;jail. A person died under their watch. The equipment supposed to record how it happened malfunctioned right at that time. This should be <i>unacceptable</i>. The person directly responsible for the facility should bear at least some consequences for failure to do their duty. If they don&#x27;t have enough funding to make sure that things like this don&#x27;t happen then there should be an extensive paper trail of them asking for more funding for this. If not, then it sounds like it&#x27;s not a problem they care about.<p>For me it&#x27;s not a question of whether it&#x27;s a conspiracy or not. For me it&#x27;s a question about society. Not only can we not protect a very high profile individual from harm in a cell (self-inflicted or not), we can&#x27;t even make sure that the cameras in the cell work. What chance do we have that prisons <i>in general</i> can protect prisoners from harm? And if we can&#x27;t protect prisoners from harm then they&#x27;ll do it themselves. That&#x27;s how you get a gang culture. You also make sure that many criminals never even get a real chance at reforming, because they&#x27;ll have to protect themselves in prison with the limited means at their disposal instead of learning to become a better person.')
