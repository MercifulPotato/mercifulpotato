Item(by='simonh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604567702, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24991674, text='I am sympathetic to the libertarian argument, I agree that alcohol is also a dangerous drug and is the cause of a considerable amount of crime so why is it different?<p>On the one hand there is a considerable culture around alcohol that is difficult or impossible to expunge. Banning it simply isn&#x27;t practical in a democracy where alcohol is popular across all sections of society. Hard drugs like cocaine and heroine simply don&#x27;t have the cultural and social context that alcohol has, there isn&#x27;t a consensus that it&#x27;s acceptable.<p>Arguing that, well alcohol is dangerous too is a bad argument. We do this bad thing so therefore we should also be allowed to do this other bad thing doesn&#x27;t follow at all. Ideally we shouldn&#x27;t do either bad thing. Both alcohol and hard drug use impose considerable costs on society. If society has chosen to accept those costs in one case but not the other (while fighting to limit them) well, making such decisions is what democracy is for.<p>Ultimately I think the libertarian argument works for decriminalising uses, but fails at decriminalising the trade. There&#x27;s no inherent right to make a profit whatever the cost to others or society.')
