This discussion chain may have kicked of an existential crisis. I think you might have exposed me to a Lovecraftian horror. The article and your discussion have been, if not mind altering, very much mind expanding.<p>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve followed all of the nuance in your (argument?) comments. I do know I&#x27;m going to be chewing on this for a while. I&#x27;ve come to grips with horror of saccades, fascinating to learn about new ways my mind, uh, decides what is true.<p>In any case, I appreciate your long thoughtful responses. May not mean much to you, but for at least one reader, it means a lot to me.')
