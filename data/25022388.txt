Not even close.  Plus you can run 216-strand on telephone poles whereas undersea cables (due to repeaters) are generally 6-strand and almost never more than 12-strand.  Utility poles are cheaper even including the cost of the poles themselves.<p>However in order to put up utility poles you need a ROAD in order to get vehicles to the poles for maintenance.  That&#x27;s why you see offshore cables: when there are no roads through politically-stable territory.<p>Look at Alaska: the fiber runs overland all the way from the southern coast to the northern coast because the oil companies built a road next to the pipeline.  Then it goes offshore along the arctic coast because there are no roads between the coastal communities.<p>Once you have roads and political stability, utility poles win every time.  Underground is more reliable but more expensive.  Undersea is insano-expensive.')
