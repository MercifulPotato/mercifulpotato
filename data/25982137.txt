Most of the violence the country saw over the Spring, Summer and Fall were organized, and still are, on Twitter and Facebook.<p>Here&#x27;s just 1 twitter account that promotes the organized violence, with dates and times to appear. Just scroll through the last few months. Also check out the &quot;suggested&quot; twitter accounts to follow on this page, by Twitter. It leads you to more Antifa groups promoting the same types of things.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;pnwylf&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;pnwylf&#x2F;</a><p>Here&#x27;s just one tweet that organized the group, Antifa, on Jan 20th during Biden&#x27;s inauguration where they attacked the Democrat Headquarters and other small businesses in Portland: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;PNWYLF&#x2F;status&#x2F;1350938008254607361" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;PNWYLF&#x2F;status&#x2F;1350938008254607361</a><p><pre><code>  J20:\n  Fuck the state.

Most on the left, particularly media and social media companies, seem to only want to talk about what happened on Jan 6th on a fairly obscure app called Parler, but not the almost year long trail of destruction perpetrated by the other side organized on the big players platforms. A decent case could be made that more destruction was caused in American cities since May that was organized on Twitter and Facebook, than was on Parler.<p>Let&#x27;s just be honest about the shortcomings of both sides, or it perpetuates further divide.')
