Suspend and battery usage are, in general, still a decade behind the competition.<p>For suspend there&#x27;s been some regressions a few years back, but I use it all the time now on both Dell Latitude and Thinkpad X without any issue.<p>Battery usage is way better with Linux than with Windows, at least on the Latitude where I can easily compare with my Windows 10 using colleagues. It&#x27;s not even close, and I also avoid the constant fan noise ;)<p>Now there&#x27;s one thing to keep in mind: if you don&#x27;t use a pre-installed Linux distro (which I don&#x27;t, I use Debian stable) then <i>you</i> are the system integrator ;) No way around this.<p>But on well supported models like the Latitude and Thinkpad at least this integration is very easy: for me I just install the &quot;tlp&quot; (The Laptop Project) package, and because I only use SSD I aggressively idle the disk. This configuration I did years ago and simply reuse it. Done.')
