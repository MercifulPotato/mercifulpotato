You also end up making it easier for people to unlawfully get access to a gun. In Australia you have to be a reasonably &quot;hard&quot; criminal to get access to a gun illegally. There just aren&#x27;t that many guns around since the Port Arthur massacre, and gun deaths have decreased as you&#x27;d naturally expect.')
