One of the only (arguably &quot;the only&quot;!) remaining decentralized platform protocols we have on the Internet is e-mail, and using it for authentication is so much better for everyone than virtually every single alternative (absolutely including even a bespoke username). That tech people, of <i>all people</i>, hate on email so much that they refuse to give it out or use systems built on it--seemingly preferring worlds with walled gardens of centralized moderation and push notifications with permissioned &#x2F; gated sign-in systems--<i>makes the world universally worse for everyone</i>. Being so uptight about &quot;spam&quot; in general is a big reason why we are falling into the surveillance capitalism dystopia that even end users are finally waking up to hate.
