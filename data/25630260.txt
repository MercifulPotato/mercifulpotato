Always be kind, remain friendly, negotiate in good faith and explain your thoughts and concerns with respect. The best way to achieve your goal is by getting people on your side. Make yourself a friend. Imagine if you were a manager and how far you would go yourself for someone who you respect. How many hierarchies would you fight in order to secure a valuable employee&#x27;s pay? No supervisor or manager would want to lose a good employee on their team over a pay policy which is partially out of their control. People will jump through those hoops if you stand up for yourself in a positive and friendly way. Don&#x27;t underestimate what an amicable negotiation can achieve.<p>That&#x27;s a very European, even socialist opinion.<p>In the US, saying to your manager that you want a raise is basically your last normal day in that job.')
