There&#x27;s a theoretical non-Turing complete subset of HTML+JS that has all the problems you claim, meanwhile Markdown with a built-in lambda calculus interpreter is Turing complete yet much less problematic. I think you&#x27;re overcomplicating things for yourself by bringing terms like &#x27;Turing-complete content&#x27; into the discussion, surely it just suffices to explain that the more powerful the system, the more open to abuse it is?')
