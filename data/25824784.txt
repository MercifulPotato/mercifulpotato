FoxNews strikes the flames on the far right, and liberal media strokes the fans on the far left. The country has never been more politically polarized.<p>The moderate electorate has no choice but to go with a single issue from the far left or far right that mostly matters to them.<p>The amount of disinformation on social media doesn&#x27;t help, but it&#x27;s not the only source of disinformation. Trump was right to call news Fake News, in the sense that media doesn&#x27;t report facts anymore. The majority of their programming is &quot;Opinion&quot; based with extremist hosts, especially on the right.')
