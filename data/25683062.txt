Hopefully the titles that you put on your resume are your actual titles at the companies that you worked for, not something you came up with. Don&#x27;t worry about calling yourself anything.<p>At the same time if you are able to get a promotion or apply for a senior role, that&#x27;s great - go for it. It&#x27;s nice that people around you are recognising your progress in some way.<p>Last thing, titles have meaning within any given company but are almost useless when comparing across companies. In some places to get a senior developer title, you just need to ask. Your manager then tells HR to change one cell in a spreadsheet and congrats - you&#x27;re a senior software engineer. In other places you can become senior if you&#x27;ve been on a team for a year and everyone else has been there for a couple of months (&quot;you have <i>multiples</i> of their experience, of course we can call you a senior engineer&quot;). In those places you just need to be senior relative to the people around you. And in other companies it&#x27;s a much more rigourous process with very specific criteria. There are people will decades of impressive high-profile engineering work at big companies whose title is just &quot;Senior Software Engineer&quot;.')
