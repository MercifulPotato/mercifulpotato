Back when going to offices was a thing, I would keep multiple sets of headphones at my desk: an open-back headphone for really clear sound quality that lets sound through so that I could hear people if they tried talking to me (I like the AKG K240 MKII&#x27;s for this but beware you need a headphone amp for these), and closed-back headphones when I&#x27;m finding the external noise distracting. For passive isolation I use Vic Firth&#x27;s isolation headphones, they&#x27;re designed for drummers to use for monitoring while recording drum tracks. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sweetwater.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;detail&#x2F;IsoHdphV2--vic-firth-sih2-stereo-isolation-headphones" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sweetwater.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;detail&#x2F;IsoHdphV2--vic-firth...</a><p>also if you already have earbuds that you like but they don&#x27;t give you enough isolation, you can always wear earbuds under construction earmuffs, which is what I was doing before getting the Vic Firth isolation headphones.')
