For me, the sweet spot was about 9 months off at a time before, surprisingly, I&#x27;d feel like working again for a while.<p>So I modified my definition of Retired to mean &quot;retired enough for me&quot;, and kept doing short contracts to save up for the next trip whenever the mood to work struck.  Eventually, I built a couple SaaS products that have ramped up to the point where I don&#x27;t need to work at all anymore.  So I hit a point that people would more closely equate to &quot;actually retired&quot; when I was in my early 40s.<p>These days, I still do a bit of part time contract work here and there, more as a hobby than an income stream.  And I keep the product stuff ticking away at as close to zero hours of maintenance&#x2F;support as possible.  But any day (or week or month) I choose can be off, so that&#x27;s close enough to retirement for me.')
