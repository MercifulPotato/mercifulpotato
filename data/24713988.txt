What does that mean? Does it depend on a blood pressure? But my bp is pretty normal and lowering it would harm other things, I guess.<p>I also found out that tinnitus gets worse if I&#x27;m listening to it, and almost disappears when I quit giving a fuck about it. Also, if you have one, and you are subject to nervousness <i>do not</i> try that fingers-on-the-nape trick. It will disappear and then may return back two-three times worse for some time. Strangely, I have severe one, but don&#x27;t care much.<p>Also, it intesifies in threads like this one, probably because I&#x27;m actively thinking about it.')
