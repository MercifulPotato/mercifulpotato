Item(by='ric2b', descendants=None, kids=[25906991], score=None, time=1611535909, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25896967, text='&gt; The point is not that the driver magically didn&#x27;t feel inertia (he did, and you can clearly see it in the video)<p>He clearly didn&#x27;t experience 50g deceleration, he would have been sent flying through the windshield.<p>What&#x27;s more likely is that the car actually did take a lot more than 16cm to slow down to 0 m&#x2F;s or that it wasn&#x27;t going at 45km&#x2F;h. I would bet on the second, the car looks like it&#x27;s going at maybe 20km&#x2F;h in the video.<p>&gt;  The kinetic energy given up by the stopping car went into the flywheel rather than into violent deformation of the physical structure of the car.<p>That&#x27;s an interesting idea but if it ends up being less effective at protecting the humans inside I don&#x27;t think most people will choose it over normal crumple zones.')
