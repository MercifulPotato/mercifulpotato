The ones I mainly use are the semantic highlighting (it colours variables etc based on their type), and the auto imports (wow, I didn&#x27;t realise how much I missed that).<p>However, those are just sugary extras, the real benefit is the typescript based type analysis. This can be had using the open sourced pyright extension.')
