Item(by='dahart', descendants=None, kids=[24959920], score=None, time=1604241897, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24959023, text='Hi, thank you for the reply.<p>&gt; Personally, I&#x27;m just going to trust the experts on this as I don&#x27;t have the energy that you seem to have to go digging in this fashion. A quick cursory Google&#x2F;DDG search is enough for me.<p>Are you saying you&#x27;re dumping a pile of research links into this thread that you haven&#x27;t even bothered to read, just because it showed up on Google?<p>I do appreciate the diplomatic tone and pile of links (you seem to have plenty of energy!) but your appeal to authority is ducking the two actual questions I&#x27;ve asked: why do you care - what stake do you have in this debate - what is prompting you to keep posting links to SRBR, <i>especially</i> if this is only the result of a quick cursory Google search? And secondly, why are you convinced by SRBR&#x27;s position claims after I&#x27;ve pointed out several (easily verifiable) citations that fail to support the claims they&#x27;re being used to make?<p>Maybe I&#x27;m wrong, and there is scientific consensus. I don&#x27;t know because I haven&#x27;t studied long enough. All I know is that SRBR&#x27;s publications tickle my spidey sense BS meter a little bit. Now that I&#x27;ve verified myself they&#x27;re playing fast and loose with some of their scientific research, it&#x27;s going to be difficult for me to trust anything they say.<p>It would take less time than you&#x27;ve already spent promoting SRBR links in this thread alone to go verify a few of the sketchy citations I called out explicitly. Have you tried to verify the problems I called out?<p>Why blindly trust experts that mislead?')
