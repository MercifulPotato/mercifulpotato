Hackintoshs are real and there should be no reason for you to use Mac Mini&#x27;s in the first place. Of course you can&#x27;t use a Hackintosh, but the existence of this alternative suggests that this is a possible avenue to explore, especially when cooperating with Apple and keeping to a specific hardware that has the drivers or where drivers can be added easily.')
