On the contrary I usually keep the tabbed browser UI in a SSB.<p>I like SSBs because I can remain logged-in to a site without those cookies being available to a browser that I&#x27;m using across the open web.<p>Also I can clear all the cookies on my regular browser and not get logged out from the SSB site.<p>The killer aspect is being able restore workspace sessions:\nIt&#x27;s easy to close the SSB with multiple tabs and restore it later with all the tabs. For example lately I&#x27;ve been using Epichrome to log into various gsuite accounts. For any account, I&#x27;ll tend to have multiple tabs open to gmail&#x2F;gdocs&#x2F;gdrive&#x2F;gcalendar. I wouldn&#x27;t want to keep this these tabs open in my regular browser. I just need these tabs open (all at once) whenever I&#x27;m doing work for that particular client. So if I make a SSB for that account I can recreate my workspace session easily and close it all at once easily, and it&#x27;s not eating up laptop RAM&#x2F;swap space unnecessarily when I&#x27;m not using it.')
