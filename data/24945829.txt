Like, you create an applet, hit save, and then it&#x27;s set in stone. Can&#x27;t modify it, you&#x27;d just have to make a new one. Please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.<p>If that&#x27;s true, no way I&#x27;m paying $2&#x2F;month for that. I&#x27;m moving to Autocode.<p>Edit: OK I see I can still edit RSS applets after they&#x27;re created. Still doesn&#x27;t seem worth keeping the service.')
