This should all be part of the process. Nothing should be surprising, the feedback should be continuous and so should the attempts to rectify things.<p>I&#x27;m not saying disputes don&#x27;t come up, or that there aren&#x27;t issues that develop. But the idea of &quot;implied&quot; tasks or project needs that go neglected to me in turn implies that this should have been addressed immediately, not at the time of an annual review or something, after the fact, and after it&#x27;s been allowed to grow.<p>To me it&#x27;s a sign of lack of communication and management being out of touch.')
