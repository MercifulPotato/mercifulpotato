Apple doesn&#x27;t care about FB driving sales, people would by Apple devices FB or no FB. Apple doesn&#x27;t care about Pro-Trump loonies. (Or rather, they only care that the Pro-Trump loonies give them a pretext.)<p>What they care about is the opportunity shift more content from the control of large competitors, to content that is centered and dependent on their devices.<p>I&#x27;ll give you a for instance, have you ever wondered why they are so hesitant to allow other providers to link in to their messaging games tech? They&#x27;re slowly moving into these more social networking type areas, and very few consumers are even noticing. For consumers they just think, &quot;Hey! look what my iphone does now!&quot;<p>If you think Apple needs the money FB generates for them more than they <i>want</i> the money they can generate for themselves, you&#x27;re fooling yourself.<p>In short, with Apple, it&#x27;s not about social good, it&#x27;s about money. They don&#x27;t care about your cause, nor your enemy&#x27;s. They care about gaining greater control over more and more revenue streams. If they can use social good to justify that revenue grab, all the better. Anti trust law is what keeps Apple in line, not their FB partnership.')
