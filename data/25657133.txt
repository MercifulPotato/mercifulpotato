Item(by='ksec', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609936467, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25656231, text='&gt;Also goes to show what a shit show Intel has become since even he was not able to right that ship.<p>I think we are already starting to see fruit of his work. Intel doesn&#x27;t need Jim Keller for CPU uArch design. Intel has had their uArch roadmap ready, and they were the best in the Industry if it wasn&#x27;t for the 10nm delay. They also have work in the pipeline all being held back by their process node.<p>Jim described it in one of his interview ( Sorry I spent 10 min but couldn&#x27;t find the source, so I may have remembered it wrong  ) about not having process node held back your chip design, where he has experience in doing so in AMD and Apple. Being flexible enough to back port your design should anything happen as Plan B.  Where previously Intel was just keep waiting for the process guys to fix it. That in itself is a <i>huge</i> workflow changes. It is hard to imagine the amount of work required to push this through especially with all the internal politics at Intel.<p>And Intel is at least looking at TSMC &#x2F; alternative paths for some of their product lineup now ( Gaming Focused Large- Die Size GPU ) . Whether that is decided or not is unclear. But at least we have Rocket Lake launching soon which is sort of a half baked Willow Cove ( Used in Tiger Lake ) ported back to 14nm on Desktop. And we have Sapphire Rapid as well as other product roadmap <i>hinting</i> at multiple node ( Shown in Investor meetings notes ). That is at least showing Intel has changed their Internal design to be flexible enough in case of another 10nm like fiasco. And I think Jim Keller has some credit in this transition.<p>That is of course, having flexible design still doesn&#x27;t fix their problem if TSMC is <i>2 years ahead of Intel in leading edge node design, volume and cost</i>. And as I have repeatedly stated, Intel&#x27;s problem is not design, but their business Model. And <i>It would not surprise me if TSMC have shipped more 5nm wafers last year ( 2020 ) than Intel&#x27;s entire 10nm production history since 2017</i>.<p>Just let that sink in for a bit.')
