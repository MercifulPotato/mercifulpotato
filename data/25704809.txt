Cmake is extremely powerful, and it lets library authors make build configuration that is quite often too flexible. Combine that with no standardized package manager for c or c++ for decades, and much cmake evolution over that time, means you encounter many different ways to solve problems.<p>Opencv is up there for most complex cmake projects. Only behemoths like VTK, ITK, and ROS beat it in complexity of the build.<p>Also, don&#x27;t beat yourself up too much. :)')
