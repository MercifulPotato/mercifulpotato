As many others have already said, the AMA puts an artificial cap on the number of medical school graduates each year at around 20,000.<p>Anecdotally, I know several bright minds who either pursued a DO or dropped out of medicine entirely because they couldn&#x27;t pass the med schools&#x27; opaque admissions procedures. I&#x27;m cynical, but there&#x27;s something disturbing about the fact that GPs and family doctors have to invest so much time and undertake so much debt just to become professional symptom Googlers.<p>I&#x27;m glad this article has the chutzpah to call the AMA what it really is-- a protectionist guild.
