I actually prefer this to the GPIO, though it adds one more component. An advantage is that I can move my hardware projects between RPi and other computers in the house including my nice comfy and fast desktop workstation. With a bit of care, my Python support software runs the same on RPi and Windows with no code changes.<p>Also, if you keep things within the Arduino ecosystem, it&#x27;s easy to upgrade or downgrade your microcontroller as needed, with only minor changes to your embedded code. What I&#x27;d like to know is if the development environment for this board is as nice (or better, can always hope) than the Arduino environment.')
