Android 8.0 was already out at the time.  There is no valid excuse, it&#x27;s not like they were trying to offer continued support for a legacy device.<p>In a world that made sense, a company the size of Netflix should have the clout to say &quot;hey hold up here, what are you trying to push this out of date crap for?&quot;')
