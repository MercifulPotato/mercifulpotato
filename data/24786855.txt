There is a clear benefit to buying or building an open hobby 3D printer, whereas that&#x27;s harder to argue for a 2D one - while there is a lot of crap around, there&#x27;s enough workable choices, aftermarket inks&#x2F;toner works, you likely won&#x27;t be modifying&#x2F;tuning a 2D printer the same way you maybe would with a 3D printer, ...<p>Ink delivery is likely the main challenge (although I&#x27;ve seen some low-res attempts), combined with the speed and precision needed for a good printer - reaching a few hundred DPI requires positioning things quite precisely. Laser printers are interesting, but then you need specialized parts like the drum that I&#x27;d expect to be difficult to produce in single quantities.<p>Open pen plotters are a thing, but again not typically used for normal printing duties.')
