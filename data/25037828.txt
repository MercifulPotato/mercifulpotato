Who in this case would be the recipients of the service.<p>Not all tax payers are recipients of the service.  The government run entity can collect revenue from all taxpayers regardless of which ones are their direct customers.<p>That&#x27;s what makes it &quot;unfair.&quot;  The private entity has to turn a profit or break even on their sales alone.  The government run entity can subsidize their operation by taking funds from general tax revenue.<p>If one entity is allowed to take always take a loss on their operations how could another entity that needs to pay their employees ever be able to compete?')
