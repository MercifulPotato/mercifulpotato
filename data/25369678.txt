But there&#x27;s definitely a process of diffusion, where people are more likely to settle in jurisdictions amenable to their lifestyle and relocate when they&#x27;re not. This is especially true for the largely transient community of petty criminals.<p>I can speak from personal experience here. Our local town had one of the toughest-on-vagrancy laws in the country. Then it go eviscerated in court, and the laws struck down. Without taking a position whether that was a good or bad thing, it&#x27;s undeniable that the change was near instantaneous. Downtown became swarmed with aggressive panhandlers and park benches filled up with addicts on the nod.<p>It&#x27;s not like the homeless in other cities were closely following the local court decisions, then strategically relocated. But by definition transient populations bounce around a lot. In previous times they might pass through before getting hassled, then thinking <i>this place really harshes my mellow</i>, then hightail it out of town. Now they show up, enjoy the good weather, panhandle off the tourists, don&#x27;t get hassled by the cops, and what used to be a week-long residency turns into a year or two.')
