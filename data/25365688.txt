Take real life examples like - completely disbanding the police, emptying prisons, outlawing all criminal laws. Deciding that people of a certain race&#x2F;social class are the cause of all problems. Destruction of city statues without due process. These ideas are dangerous for any functioning society and saying every idea from 30 years ago is bad or backwards is wrongheaded.<p>In addition alot of the far left is pinning &#x27;nazi&#x27; or &#x27;facsict&#x27; on any politician or idea that does not meet their ever changing ideas. Even feminists are now getting trampled on if their ideas don&#x27;t meet up to the week culture temperature checks.')
