Item(by='ivalm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605433443, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25098976, text='Yeah, my point rests on the idea of dematerialization going forward. I think people have finite capacity of desire for natural resource limited products and it is possible that we are not too unreasonably close to “peak physical stuff.” I can get better more “intelligent” clothing but I will never need 100000 unique clothing items simultaneously. On the other hand, immaterial needs may continue increasing, my desire for AI assistance, computer-human interfaces, and augmented reality may be massive, but those have low marginal cost.<p>I do also agree that certain things that are scarce by design or by their nature and will continue to be so.')
