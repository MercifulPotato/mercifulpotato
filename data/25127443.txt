Face coverings will be required at stores like Walmart, Target and CVS, and in a growing number of Republican-led states where governors once resisted such mandates.&quot;<p>&quot;More than half the states have issued statewide mask requirements, including Arkansas, where Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, announced a face covering requirement on Thursday, after previously taking a more hands-off approach. Gov. Jared Polis of Colorado, a Democrat, also issued a mask order on Thursday, after questioning whether such a mandate would be enforceable.&quot;<p>&quot;But there remains firm resistance in many circles, including from some Republican leaders who view mask requirements as a threat to personal liberty.&quot;</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;16&#x2F;us&#x2F;coronavirus-masks.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;07&#x2F;16&#x2F;us&#x2F;coronavirus-masks.html</a><p>Unfortunately (I&#x27;ve been using that word a lot lately), Trump endorsing masks would have conflicted with his somewhat perplexing political strategy of gaslighting his base into thinking the virus wasn&#x27;t anything to take seriously.<p><i>&#x27;Speaking on Capitol Hill on 10 March, Mr Trump said: &quot;Just stay calm.
