Musk&#x27;s antics actually delayed the reopening of factories in California because health officials hadn&#x27;t contemplated that a billionaire would care so little about his workers or ad PR that he would try to force his workers back into a factory without even attempting the bare minimum to protect their health.<p><i>Chruches are only open because the highest court in the land, the surpreme court, overruled the Gov of Cali executive branches restrictions.</i><p>Churches have been reopened for indoor services (with limited capacity) since May. The SCOTUS didn&#x27;t rule on the CA case <i>for the second time</i> until a week ago. Notably, you are ignoring the first time SCOTUS ruled on CA church restrictions, when it <i>upheld</i> the restrictions on indoor services earlier during the lockdowns.<p><i>Amazon is from Seattle and Bezos owns the WaPo. It&#x27;s not conservative.</i><p>I do not claim that Amazon or its CEO are conservative. But the overwhelming majority of Amazon&#x27;s CA employees, it&#x27;s warehouse workers and delivery drivers,<i>are</i> conservative and live in areas of CA that still have conservative supermajorities.<p><i>Simply put, Corona restrictions can easily be viewed as being ideologically based and also be viewed as having been weaponized against opposing political groups in California to hurt them, and its very concerning to see. </i><p>Yes, in the same way that HTML5 can be seen as a supercomputer. Notably, <i>conservative</i> governors have issued the same restrictions in red states, which is overwhelming evidence that these restrictions are not ideologically motivated.<p>I think we both agree that the new restrictions are problematic. You, for ideological reasons, and me, because they&#x27;re clearly not based on any sort of scientific or empirical evidence. (There is absolutely no reason for subjecting counties like SLO or the OC to the same restrictions as LA County, which has one of the highest spread rates in the world.)')
