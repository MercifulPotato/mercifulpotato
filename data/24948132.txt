I&#x27;m not an addict and I shouldn&#x27;t be punished for other peoples acts.<p>I find myself agreeing with this. Opiate overuse and addiction is certainly a problem, but I also question some of the negativity I see regarding their use (from a UK perspective). I was on tramadol (200mg&#x2F;day) for about six months, and was told, by my consultant, that coming off them &quot;will be worse than quitting heroin&quot;. I just stopped taking them, and saw no ill effects. I&#x27;ve twice been on codeine (240mg&#x2F;day) for around 8-12 months, and was given similar, albeit less severe, warnings about withdrawal. In both cases, there were no side effects upon stopping. I have to wonder if such warnings make withdrawal symptoms more likely through the nocebo effect[1].<p>They certainly have been misused in many ways, but they also have their place and make long-term pain much easier to deal with.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3352765&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;pmc&#x2F;articles&#x2F;PMC3352765&#x2F;</a>')
