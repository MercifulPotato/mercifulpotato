Even overly-complex code is not an accurate term for that because overly-complex code can be caused by an overly-complex valid spec.<p>&quot;Stupidly out-of-spec code&quot; or &quot;Stupidly prematurely abstracted code&quot; are more fitting to describe those kind of code.<p>I personally feel uncomfortable calling them clever code because they are not clever at all so that they are causing physical pain.<p>I&#x27;m fortunate to have a complete &quot;creative-control&quot; over a code several times. I frequently tell people to stop writing code that we don&#x27;t need for the moment. Most of them are anticipation of reuses.')
