I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s relevant to battlefield.&quot;</i><p>In <i>&quot;Paradoxes of Defense&quot;</i> Silver talks about both:<p>a) He believes that dueling traditions adopted from other cultures are wasteful of English life and limb and provide little or no training for use on the battlefield. It was important that each well-bodied Englishman be able to serve his country in a war. Once war was declared, there was scant time for training with new weapons and the dueling skills were not very useful.<p>b) He discusses most weapons and considers their use in  one-on-one, one-on-two and battle situations.<p>user5994461 says <i>&quot;I expect stick would have the problem of not killing.&quot;</i><p>Many have been killed&#x2F;wounded by a &quot;stick&quot;(AKA rolling pin, tire tool, baseball bat, 2x4, flashlight, etc.). But &quot;sticks&quot; per se vary from a short stick, e.g., police baton, to a short staff, e.g., 1-2 inch diameter by  ~1 meter length, to a longer staff (maybe ~3 meters and longer). Sizes differ for different cultures. Some &quot;sticks&quot; have lead&#x2F;iron weights in them. Some are wrapped with metal.<p>A larger weapon is usually capable of dealing harder blows. &quot;Sticks&quot; kill by breaking heads and bones (ribs, shins, arms and legs, the neck, eyes, throat), etc. Usually they disable immediately (hard to fight with a broken leg or if your larynx has been crushed). It would be foolish to fight with a broken arm or missing eye if one could simply play dead.<p>user5994461 says <i>&quot;...yet you hit them 5 times and they keep coming at you.&quot;</i><p>You need a bigger stick or some exercise. Oh, and don&#x27;t mess with those Orcs!8-))<p>Silver(author of <i>Paradoxes of Defense</i>) was likely more familiar with this than you or I. I don&#x27;t doubt his experience.<p>An English nursery rhyme:<p><i>Sticks and stones<p>may break my bones<p>But words shall never hurt me.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sticks_and_Stones" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Sticks_and_Stones</a>')
