Item(by='throwaway894345', descendants=None, kids=[25001079], score=None, time=1604604030, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24999995, text='Hah, `man aws` prints `No manual entry for aws`. You can of course dig around the help pages for each individual subcommand, but it doesn&#x27;t give a very good idea about how the resources stitch together. More importantly, you miss out on the wizard-like behavior for spinning up new resources without needing to provide a reference to each upstream resource (the GUI can create these upstream resources for you or let you bring your own depending on how you navigate the creation wizard). I&#x27;m sure this is all possible with a sufficiently well-designed CLI (`eksctl` does this for EKS), but no such CLI exists for AWS holistically and these are pretty rare for any kind of application.<p>Also, personally I really dislike man pages--paging through tons and tons of text that has nothing to do with my use case to find the one or two bits that are actually relevant is not really my idea of a good time. They are the most flat-footed solution to the discoverability problem, but they leave a lot to be desired.')
