The GOP is actively supporting and implementing systems of voter suppression, and the opposition party doesn&#x27;t seem to have the will to do anything about it.<p>I was concerned about the reports of foreign influence on the 2016 election. Since then, the senators in Washington have made it crystal clear that they do not want to protect the integrity of the election. The Republicans want to win at all costs, and if they can&#x27;t win they want to poke enough holes in the system to completely undermine trust in American democracy.<p>And I don&#x27;t see it getting better. If the GOP stays in power after this election cycle, I am going to be trying to get out of the country ASAP. I&#x27;ve read enough to know that it doesn&#x27;t get better when the single autocratic power is able to fully insulate itself from the will of the public. At that point, it becomes fight or flight time, and the local gun stores have been sold out for a while.<p>If the Democrats win this election, their first priority should be holding vote suppressors accountable, and trying to restore faith in the federal system. But I&#x27;ve seen Democrats win before, and they have never failed to disappoint. I am sick of trying to pretend they&#x27;re good, when the reality is that the opposing party is just so, so bad.')
