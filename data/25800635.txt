So in this case we actually picked &quot;Me too&quot; as the translation for that, which definitely sticks out, but comes across as a little bit of a teaching French moment, because you can clearly hear that the character isn&#x27;t saying &quot;Je t&#x27;aime aussi&quot;.&quot;<p>true! and to be honest, also the first one isn&#x27;t probably meaning &quot;je t&#x27;aime&quot; at all')
