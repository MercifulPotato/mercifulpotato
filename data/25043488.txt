The EU is fighting this back, rich investors buying their way into Schengen with no ties (or even residency requirements) to the countries they get passports from is very frowned upon.<p>Apart from that quite a lot of other EU members offer residency for investors, not ideal either but better than outright sales of passports.<p>If you aren&#x27;t rich the rules for citizenship vary quite a bit between member states but they all require some years of residency and tax payments to qualify for citizenship.<p>Here in Sweden I&#x27;m going through the process and it&#x27;s one of the most straightforward citizenship processes: live here for 5 years legally on a visa, pay your taxes and you qualify.')
