Item(by='PEJOE', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605548119, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25114172, text='&gt; Funny you mention ANSYS specifically as they seem to have pretty decent Linux support:<p>With ANSYS in particular the question is who is doing the simulation. If the engineer is doing it, many engineering tools are windows only (although this has been improving) so it makes sense to run ANSYS under windows as well so you can be close to your modelling software. If the stress or EM guys are separate from the designers, then it shouldn&#x27;t matter as much.<p>I would love to see all productivity tools move to Linux and things have been getting a lot better over the years. Personally I&#x27;m excited around the noise that Microsoft was exploring office for Linux, as office is the only reason I ever boot into windows. What a godsend it would be to be able to program and run all my productivity software at the same time.')
