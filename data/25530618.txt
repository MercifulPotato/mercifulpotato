All of them are best guesses and far from certain. Income targeting may be inferred by their (inferred) zip code and (inferred) age for example.<p>Identifying what to optimize is trivial at scale, simply look at your campaign performance by targeting options and it usually screams out at you. Doing better in the female, 18-25, urban demo? Raise bids for them and lower bids in the non-performing groups. It hardly matters to me how often Facebook or Google got it wrong if pulling the lever still works.<p>Most of the sour grapes I&#x27;ve seen are brand or lead gen campaigns run by the inexperienced griping about individual clicks. If you can&#x27;t start broad and prune, you need to start hyper targeted and closely monitor.')
