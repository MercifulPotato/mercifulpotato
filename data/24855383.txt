I got the impression that heat flows into the hot rock are orders of magnitude lower than the heat flows out required to make power generation efficient and useful.<p>The radiator design is interesting but ultimately it&#x27;s a heat sink and power output will be limited. Initially I bet the power output is great, and as the area cools they tap it out. Who knows how long it&#x27;d last, you&#x27;d think the higher the power capacity the faster it would cool down underneath.<p>So really you need to be able to build new mines cheap enough to justify doing such a hard mine knowing it&#x27;ll only last for 22 years.')
