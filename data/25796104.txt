The Surface families have a history of doing things their own way, which means being poor at running Linux until people reverse-engineer things. Per <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;linux-surface&#x2F;linux-surface&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Supported-Devices-and-Features" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;linux-surface&#x2F;linux-surface&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Supporte...</a>, Surface Laptop 3 (AMD) still isn’t perfect: like most of the Surface families it requires a special kernel for most stuff to work, and the touchscreen and pen support don’t work (admittedly functionality outright missing from most laptops, so perhaps not a big deal), and if you suspend it, you need an external keyboard to wake it up again!<p>Also I’m shocked at the price hike from 16GB RAM, 512GB storage to 32GB RAM, 1TB storage: it goes up from AUD 2931 to AUD 4399. <i>A $1,468 increase.</i> I would consider $468 not unreasonable (even though the retail cost delta on the actual <i>parts</i> should be under half of that), but it’s like they hoped you wouldn’t notice them slipping an extra $1,000 onto the price. But then, given that the second and third configurations increase the first’s $1,699 by $425 to increase 128GB of storage to 256GB (that’s more than even <i>Apple</i> charge for such things!), and then by another $255 to increase 8GB of RAM to 16GB, perhaps I shouldn’t be surprised. Still am, though.')
