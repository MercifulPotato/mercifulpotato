Local caching means that every node can disagree on what the tag resolves to, and so can the registry. What version corresponds to which tag at which location at a given time is <i>not deterministic</i>.<p>The only way out is to use fully-digested references. The digest means that there can be no mutation of what&#x27;s being pointed to. It will mean the same in every configuration and on every node, no matter when the reference is resolved and no matter when the reference was created.')
