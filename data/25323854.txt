WeChat already has an effective digital payment system, with the tasty tasty analytics and surveillance capabilities (which yeah, Zuck also probably wants).<p>As to blockchains, that&#x27;s because this is the hype of the last few years, is it not?<p>As to currencies, IMO the vision of the people hyping bitcoin was that your pizza place would accept BTC (and not after converting their USD price to BTC) because their supplies would be happy to do as well. A single currency for the world would be interesting, but as economists have pointed out, devaluing your currency is a way to escape economic crises, but e.g. Euro countries can&#x27;t do this any more, hence the problems the PIIGS countries had.')
