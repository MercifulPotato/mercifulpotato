That&#x27;s my point. Systems aren&#x27;t better than goals, and goals aren&#x27;t contradictory to systems. They feed on each other. Goals are motivation to create systems, systems are mechanisms to achieve goals.<p>Goals can also be &quot;repeated&quot; goals. Like my fitness example, I didn&#x27;t want to make it through 140 minutes of soccer on just <i>one</i> Saturday (this is a problem with &quot;I want to run a marathon&quot; goals, it&#x27;s a singular achievement). I wanted to do that every Saturday throughout the season so the system enabled perpetuating that ability throughout the years.')
