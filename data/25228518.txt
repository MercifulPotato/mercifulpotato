They sensed that there was something about the essay that they disliked intensely, but they had a hard time finding a specific passage to pin it on.</i><p>Isn&#x27;t it much more likely that the conventional-minded people actually liked the essay because it confirmed their values and world-view? Presumable the essayist can&#x27;t read minds, so this is just how he <i>hopes</i> they reacted.')
