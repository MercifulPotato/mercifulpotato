Honestly don’t believe this stuff, please go and look up how other countries do mail in ballots... it isn’t controversial or insecure. Showing stats of how upset people are isn’t evidence is fraud...<p>“Witness count” is not evidence of anything, and could imply there are just more people willing to lie. Which is the more believable narrative given lying is happening.<p>They audited the votes in almost all the swing counties... nothing... in fact it was miscounted in trumps favour in some.<p>They did do a full audit in Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania ... where else would you like one?')
