The iPod was fundamentally a game changer in the music space. The iPhone caught Blackberry with their pants down and they never recovered. Macbooks were a level up in so many ways to their competitors.<p>It was <i>worth</i> paying extra for the device Apple was selling because everyone else was years behind them.<p>Now it&#x27;s wireless headphones with technologies that have all been done before, for more than $500. Or the same iPhone as last year, with a slightly better processor. Why pay more for that? I mean, sure, they seem high quality enough- but $549 level high quality?<p>Come on Apple, surprise me. Make me feel like the iPod announcement again.')
