These facts are why I so highly value my own awareness and willingness to change my mind.<p>I&#x27;d love to have someone prove me wrong.<p>Over the years much of 9&#x2F;11 has received reasonable doubt worthy mythbusting.<p>But at some point the arguments are just too overwhelming. To me, the &quot;MythBusters&quot; actually sound delusional. They&#x27;re unwilling to confront evidence, and are guilty of most the things this article lists.<p>One of the problems with this case in particular is how isolating it all is. I don&#x27;t tell people I&#x27;m a truther. You learn real fast how &quot;wrong you are&quot; from the screeching mother&#x27;s about how dare you? As if questioning the so trustworthy media narrative is somehow offensive just because people died.<p>Yes they died, I&#x27;m disgusted by it. I&#x27;m more disgusted by the idea that the govt was behind it.<p>But the problem with this isolation is that you can&#x27;t get dissenting ideas. I have to seek out confronting views this in itself is uncomfortable. Past this, I have to wade through the myth busters jokes and jabs at my expense, being compared to moon landing hoaxers and antivaxxers.<p>I can see how people fall into conspiracy theories and get shutout of society for it.<p>To this day I hope I&#x27;m wrong  I hope one day someone can convince me. But to this day. Nobody has, and given how much evidence is now lost or destroyed there really isn&#x27;t much chance of this happening.')
