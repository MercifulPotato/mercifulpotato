Whenever you try to have a discussion that goes against some sacred assumptions, which happens very often when talking about sociology or (political) philosophy, or non-liberal politics in general, no matter how respectfully or qualifiedly you make your point it&#x27;s almost certain your interlocutors will not engage productively.<p>And indeed, because these assumptions are not even known to be assumptions, it&#x27;s not even visible to the reader that this is a case of conformity.<p>Interestingly, I&#x27;ve noticed that these modes of conformity often come in temporal waves, in that at different times of the day you get downvoted - or receive less constructive discussion - for differing subjects. I should try to make a more involved analysis eventually.')
