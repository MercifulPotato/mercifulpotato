Unfortunately, my experience with Android Auto has been abysmal. Before the pandemic, I used to use it on my commute every day. At least once a week, it just wouldn&#x27;t work and I would have to go through the ritual of trying the following things, until it started working again:\n* turn the car off and on again\n* turn the phone off and on again\n* forget and then re-create the Bluetooth pairing\n* delete the car from Android Auto and add it again<p>Also, it would randomly decide to stop heeding voice commands.<p>On top of that, any time there&#x27;s an update to either Android Auto or Spotify, I had to pray things would keep working. If they didn&#x27;t, sometimes The Ritual would fix things. Other times, it stayed broken until the next update.')
