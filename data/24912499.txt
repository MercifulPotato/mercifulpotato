Frankly, it was shocking, as I definitely have the skills, experience and &quot;soft&quot; skills, like Accountability and Responsibility, as well as years of experience at selling difficult projects to real hard-nosed, empirical managers.<p>I also would have been quite willing to work for a fraction of what people that don&#x27;t have my chops would want.<p>The worst was working with recruiters. They are downright insulting. Quite jarring.<p>Whiteboard&#x2F;LeetCode tests are a flat-out insult to me. I won&#x27;t do well at them, and I&#x27;m quite aware that people spend <i>huge</i> amounts of time, practicing for them, so I don&#x27;t have a chance.<p>I do have a few hundred thousand lines of code, dozens of blog articles, dozens of repos, and a decade or more of checkin history. I&#x27;ve been told that I &quot;faked&quot; it, which would be hilarious, if it weren&#x27;t so insulting.<p>In the end, I just decided to stop looking for work, and I&#x27;m working in a small startup team, writing some fairly powerful software, for free; because I enjoy doing this stuff.<p>It&#x27;s pretty odd that the current scene is actively hostile towards folks like me. I feel that it&#x27;s fairly self-destructive.')
