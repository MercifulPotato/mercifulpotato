This is a question of lesser of two evils, or ends justifying the means. Not everyone agrees with the far left (the faction doing most of the rioting); being from an ex-socialist country I quite literally, not exaggerating, think they are morally equivalent to nazis. I think the US constitution really needs a &quot;self-protection&quot; amendment that would remove the first amendment protection for an enumerated list of ideologies explicitly hostile to the rights that it gives (free speech itself, freedom of&#x2F;from religion, due process,  to some extent racial&#x2F;gender equality&#x2F;private property&#x2F;gun rights, etc.), then make them a crime and throw anyone marching with a hammer and sickle (or swastika) in jail; but you don&#x27;t need to go that far to think roughing up rioters is justified as a deterrent. Kinda like shooting a burglar in your house is a justifiable self-defense, although shooting a burglar who is running away is not.')
