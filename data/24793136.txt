Item(by='wahern', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602792152, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24793027, text='Presumably that the Kroomen were anti-slavery, and more generally black saviors, which are typical themes (along with their antitheses if your beliefs skew a little more anachronistic) of American literature on African culture and history. The author left it conspicuously ambiguous whether the Kroomen previously assisted slavers. AFAICT from a brief Google search, in earlier years Kroomen didn&#x27;t just trade with slavers but also assisted them in their activities--possibly even going so far as being purchasing agents[1]. Which is unsurprising. Africans&#x27; relationship with slavery was different, to say the least, than Americans&#x27; comparatively simple, black and white, relationship.<p>[1] Though I&#x27;m a little skeptical. I didn&#x27;t have the time to dive down deeper into the material. The urge to <i>blame</i> Africans&#x27; for slavery arises from the same sort of biased American perspective as the urge to create black saviors.')
