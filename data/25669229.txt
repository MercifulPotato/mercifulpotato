Weirdly when I tried to edit the title to keep it as close to the original as possible, HN always auto-corrected it back to the 81 char version and then failed over itself by telling me that it exceeds the limit of 80 characters. I had to massively change the title for HN to not apply it&#x27;s auto-detection magic and trip itself up.')
