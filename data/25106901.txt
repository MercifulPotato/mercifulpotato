Because that is truly scary. I&#x27;ve heard of isolated instances of the <i>manufacturer-installed</i> crapware silently trying to update the BIOS in the background, failing, and resulting in bricked machines upon the next boot, but that wasn&#x27;t Microsoft&#x27;s doing.<p><i>including security risks</i><p>That is BS, unless you are talking about things like user-hostile &quot;secure&quot; boot, which are firmly in the area of &quot;do not want&quot; anyway.')
