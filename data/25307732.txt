There are lots of possible answers:<p><pre><code>   * you bought in bulk but will sell small\n   * you did a bunch of work to make the stuff&#x2F;services available\n   * you did a bunch of work to find customers\n   * you did a bunch of work transforming the inputs\n</code></pre>\nSo, the question about exploitation really comes down to: do you make more profit than can be justified by whatever work that you personally put in?<p>In the case of anyone who makes US$1B or more by selling stuff&#x2F;services that other people produce, I think it&#x27;s fairly clear most of the time that they have exploited those other people: that is, their profit (vastly) exceeds the value of the work they themselves did.')
