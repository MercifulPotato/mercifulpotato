In other words, what does &quot;work&quot; mean?  There are so many dimensions to consider there, including technical, social, business, developmental, and legal ones.<p>Sometimes the most extreme NIH tendencies are perfectly justified due to these constraints, and sometimes they&#x27;re absurd.  I don&#x27;t think any point on the continuum is generally &quot;correct&quot; nor should be generally advocated for.
