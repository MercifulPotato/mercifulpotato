I&#x27;ve read that FSF document.  I read it when it was published in 2010, and because I&#x27;m not careless I read it again this morning before and after I posted my comment.  I&#x27;ve also looked at it more than once in the intervening years.<p>&gt; Or the VLC devs<p>VLC is on the App Store right now.<p>The FSF post was true in 2010, but unlike GPLv2, v3, etc, the Apple terms are not static documents.  They&#x27;ve been revised multiple times in the last 10 years, and the FSF post hasn&#x27;t been updated.  The last time I spent an afternoon doing an analysis, I found that the terms at the time didn&#x27;t conflict with GPL.  At this point, if a person is going to claim that there&#x27;s a conflict, the onus is on them to show that it&#x27;s trueâ€”just like the FSF did at the time they published that blog post.  It doesn&#x27;t suffice to show that it was true in 2010.  But again none of this matters here, because Maps.me isn&#x27;t GPL software, so this entire diversion has been a waste of time.')
