Though many will use more products - and as of lately, microneedling your scalp has gained popularity.<p>Some of these meds have adverse health effects, but in the end - they can be expensive and time-consuming, and results range from poor&#x2F;no effect, to good.<p>A hair-transplant could cost you between $10k-$50k, depending on where you get one. Musk has had a HT, but probably needs to stay on the meds mentioned above, to halt any other loss that&#x27;s going on.<p>Long story short: The current solutions are expensive and time consuming. It becomes a lifestyle &#x2F; daily routine, like with other chronic illnesses. And the effects can disappear if&#x2F;when you can no longer afford them.')
