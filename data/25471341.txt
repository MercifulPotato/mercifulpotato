I&#x27;m not trying to nit pick, but if other people had similar reactions, it could affect user acquisition.<p>There&#x27;s lots of big bold text and not a lot of use of negative space, so it&#x27;s really hard to know what to focus on. I feel like a little more vertical space between posts and maybe making the URL smaller or moving it below the post title (or both) could really make the homepage a little less overwhelming with only a few minor changes.')
