A steam engine requires tools made of matter to make it provide mechanical power to another system. In essence, a steam engine is just a power supply.<p>A general purpose computer, on the other hand, <i>includes</i> a power supply, and generally doesnt need tools that change matter to retarget it for another application; the tools needed to do so are made of information, and are thus readily available.<p>Granted: we as CS folks and business folks are choking off our own sources of talent by hiding the tools and keys needed to truly examine our systems, all in the name of &quot;user-friendlines&quot;, but its still possible to use what is exposed to learn computing basics like how wifi works, or what a proxy server are.<p>To be frank, I think this distinction is precisely why I get frustrated at computing incompetence: a PC at home isn&#x27;t locked down and has access to these tools. Anyone can learn -- even using a web browser and notepad to write JS.<p>In contrast, learning how an engine works requires mass-based tools that are big and expensive and require careful knowledge of how to not harm yourself when disassembling or working on the engine.<p>This distinction is massive, and yet we still use analogies to cars. Shops with tools are not plentiful and readily accessible to average people, the engines can&#x27;t be examined from the inside out, coils and springs are dangerous physically. I can&#x27;t just go looking to take a class, either: not all schools have shops!')
