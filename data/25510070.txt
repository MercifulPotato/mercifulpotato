I despise Nintendo&#x27;s approach to the mod community, and their pitiful online implementations, but I still think they make great games. I&#x27;m not really a fanboy either, I just enjoy some of their games. I could take a stronger moral stand and and boycott them, but let&#x27;s be realistic it&#x27;ll be just a drop in the bucket, just like boycotting Disney.')
