Most stocks are generally way more liquid. Also you&#x27;ll find you can get hit at&#x2F;near the midpoint even when the bid&#x2F;ask spread is large. (Which makes sense ... as long as you offer a price slightly worse than what the theoretical pricing model dictates ... why wouldn&#x27;t the market makers want to trade against you?)')
