The whole continent was a basket case and hadn&#x27;t advanced at all, and often regressed from the complexity&#x2F;organization of civilization of the Roman empire.  Even some of the major battles of the time, had only few thousand combatant, not more than a couple of Roman legions. Kings couldn&#x27;t field armies, even larger to ancient greece, or persian empire (we are talking about 400-500 B.C.).  The regress in overall state structure and organization was astonishing.<p>It took the renaissance to change things up and for innovation and cultural progress to pick up. So, it was more than a 1000 years lost to petty warfare, destruction and general ignorance.<p>If the Roman Empire had endured, who knows how things would have evolved.  We would have been a different civilization by now.  We probably would have had colonized mars by now :)<p>Ps. The byzantine empire, the eastern side of the Roman empire, after the late 600s - 700s, was just a shade of its original, and kept losing territory and influence until it was just a city state conquered by the Ottomans in 1453.')
