But the people on the fringe of the detonation will suffer from radioactive fallout, and will eventually succumb to diseases and leukemia.<p>And with MIRV ICBMs, a single missile can easily target multiple distant locations, population centers, and food production centers, to ensure that the enemy is thoroughly eliminated with extreme prejudice.
