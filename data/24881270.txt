Performance doesn&#x27;t just happen. Within limited constraints, focusing on performance will necessarily imply less feature.<p>Ultimately, it&#x27;s about balance. Personally I find VSC&#x27;s performance to be good, and at lot of other devs find it at least good enough (it&#x27;s a widespread editor). I&#x27;ve actually switched away from ST3 because the development of their current version stagnated, and there are unresolved bugs and limitations that affected my everyday usage.<p>In other words, the performance&#x2F;features (and let&#x27;s throw flexibility) balance of VSC is, for me, better than ST&#x27;s (others may have have different requirements and different balances, of course).<p>Ultimately, VSC is a bad example of tradeoff performance&#x2F;ease of (internal) development. If people wants to find an example, Slack is by far the best (worst).')
