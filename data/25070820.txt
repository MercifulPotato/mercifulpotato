I use it regularly, with an external mouse&#x2F;keyboard for dex desktop on a TV, and I can use the phone normally. They supported linux on Dex for a while, but that is unsupported now. If Samsung brings a linux desktop with Miracast as an alternative to their own desktop, I might just switch full time to that.')
