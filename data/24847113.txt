Mainstream adoption and seriousness - whatever that might be exactly - are certainly not the same metric. For example, in your sibling comment, you mention ADA as serious language. ADA certainly is not mainstream.<p>&gt; The fact that a specific corporation has implemented a specific project by using a specific tool is completely meaningless as to the appropriateness of using that tool in another context.<p>You&#x27;re entirely correct. That&#x27;s another goalpost move - nobody proclaimed that being used for business critical projects makes rust in any way magically fit for any and all other conceivable projects.')
