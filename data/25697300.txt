Doesn&#x27;t that mean the evidence hasn&#x27;t even been heard? How can the &quot;courts think so too&quot; if they haven&#x27;t heard evidence?<p>Also, it&#x27;s offensive when people say the election wasn&#x27;t crooked to people that witnessed its crookedness firsthand. I am one of the many people whose ballot went uncounted.')
