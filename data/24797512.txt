I didn&#x27;t say all societies of that time had the same wrong mainstream beliefs as the Puritans. I just said they all had <i>some</i> wrong mainstream beliefs.<p><i>&gt; the situation is certainly dire. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s far fetched to think that if we continue in business as usual, modern industrial civilization could be at risk.</i><p>I disagree (to be clear, I disagree about the &quot;civilization could be at risk&quot; part, I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m in favor of just continuing business as usual--I think there are certainly things we could and should do better). But I don&#x27;t want to hijack the discussion into a debate about climate change and what we should do about it. My only point here is that there is significant disagreement on this point, and the various sides (there are more than two) can&#x27;t all be right since they hold beliefs that are inconsistent with each other, so clearly <i>some</i> widely held belief in this area is wrong, we just have no consensus on which belief it is, so society as a whole can&#x27;t make a correction.')
