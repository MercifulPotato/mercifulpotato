That peasants 100 years ago had it worse is just irrelevant here, in my view.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure what the intention of your comment was, but by your reasoning we could relativise every war as &quot;it&#x27;s not as bad as WWII&quot; or every pandemic as &quot;it&#x27;s not as bad as the black death&quot;, and that doesn&#x27;t strike me as a helpful or constructive way to deal with the problems that exist in the here and now.')
