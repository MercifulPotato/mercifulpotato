And they don&#x27;t seem keen on providing access for other people to investigate the authenticity - as people have pointed out, it would be trivial to prove the email authenticity given the DKIM headers.  Yet they remain stubbornly absent from the story, no?<p>&gt; The evidence for the story, at this point, seems at least plausible<p>It doesn&#x27;t even pass a simple smell test - who drives cross-country to drop off their laptop at a cheap repair shop and then doesn&#x27;t pick it up?  Another smell test - you have a bunch of emails that you could trivially prove are authentic but for some reason you&#x27;re avoiding doing that.')
