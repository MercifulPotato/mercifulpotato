Two walks a day (typically a long ~45 minute one after breakfast, and a shorter ~20 minute walk after lunch) are non-negotiable activities.<p>I feel _so_ much better after a walk; I have better concentration and increased motivation to tackle difficult problems. Even if I&#x27;m having a particularly busy day or with a deadline coming up, I&#x27;d rather sacrifice some personal time after hours than my walks.')
