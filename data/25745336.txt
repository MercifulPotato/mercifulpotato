I don&#x27;t see how this would be fundamentally different from, for example, requiring newspapers to publish every letter their receive irregardless of their editorial stance.<p>The real problem is that the market is dominated by a couple of huge companies that have disproportionate power and can pretty much do whatever they want without the risk of losing significant numbers of users. I don&#x27;t see how legally requiring them to be content neutral can fix that, even if Twitter can&#x27;t just remove your posts or ban you I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll manage to find legal ways to make your content virtually invisible if they want to without directly removing it.')
