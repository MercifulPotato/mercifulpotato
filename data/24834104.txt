However your choice of words betrays you. How can you define neatness without taking culture and aesthetics into consideration. Lodash doesn&#x27;t make possible any things that weren&#x27;t possible before. It just provides a succinct notation for common use-cases with for loops. Which use-cases are common depends on your programming culture. Which library looks most fashionable at solving them isn&#x27;t that much different from reading Vogue.<p>Even comparing it to for loops is in itself biased, because there are other cultures that are able to do looping without looping at all, like how John McCarthy favored recursive functions. Then the Common Lisp crew invented their own preferred predecessor to lodash called the LOOP macro. I&#x27;d bet Urbit does something even crazier.')
