We <i>do</i> actually own the hardware we buy even if we don’t know how to reprogram it.<p>My car has a digital speedometer that reads in kph only.  I want it to read mph, but there is no software update available to do this, and nobody seems to know how to hack it.  I still own the car.<p>Everything produced by a big company works in the interests of the big company.  There are no exceptions to this, ever, unless the company is simply failing.<p>Any time we buy something, we do so because our interests are sufficiently aligned with the interests of those who made the product.  The alignment is <i>always</i> partial.<p>If you don’t want hardware that works in the interest of a big company.  The only way to achieve that is <i>not to get it from a big company</i>.  The same is true for software.<p>I’m totally in support of this.')
