I had to fight everything on my phone (and occasionally, my system) to <i>stop</i> doing updates and backups over mobile connections, because those were always limited in Poland. I&#x27;m not sure if anyone truly does offer an unlimited plan here (other than bullshit &quot;unlimited, but we&#x27;ll throttle you down for the rest of the month after a gigabyte or three&quot;). Bottomline: it&#x27;s not just US. I think most of the world doesn&#x27;t have ubiquitous unlimited mobile data.')
