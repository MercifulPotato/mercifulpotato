Furthermore, I think metrics that measure the technological progress of the silicon manufacturing are a useful tool for enriching comparisons of chips. Yes, numbers like cache sizes (or transistor density) aren&#x27;t what people ultimately need&#x2F;want, they want speed, but it still helps them compare chips. Improvements of the underlying process alone could lead to improvements of power efficiency, speed, and price.')
