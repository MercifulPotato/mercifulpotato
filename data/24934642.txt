Overall Greenwald seems like a remarkably average journalist with strong rhetorical chops who lucked into a couple good stories. But he&#x27;s spent the past few years squandering that social capital on a mix of conspiracy and irrelevance, and this may be his bankruptcy.<p>&gt; He gave up his career as a lawyer to do what he does.<p>This means absolutely nothing. If anything lawyers aren&#x27;t especially known as paragons of truth! (And that&#x27;s fine for a lawyer where the adversarial system holds, but can make you a bit shit as a journalist.)')
