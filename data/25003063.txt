This isn&#x27;t important though - you use a queue <i>when</i> you think tasks will have some level of build-up anyway i.e. the chance of the task being above your processing speed is non-zero.<p>&gt; Because two ppl working on tasks coming in will be able to respond in the minimal time, rather than them banking up<p>No - that&#x27;s not what the article is suggesting at all. It&#x27;s saying that when you have two workers, the relative <i>probability</i> that <i>both</i> workers are queued up <i>at the same time</i>, causes the loss of the quadratic relationship between latency and N (see formula at the end).<p>EDIT:<p>Clarification on the first part. It is not that they <i>will</i> come in faster than the processing speed, but they that they <i>can</i>.')
