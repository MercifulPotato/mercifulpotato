In fact, quite the opposite.  Much of the original Bitcoin discussion had its roots in von Mises&#x27; theories and beliefs, one of which was the rejection of empiricism.  It&#x27;s tough to fruitfully discuss a topic when the conversants disagree over epistemology.  We can try nonetheless.<p>&gt; Currency debasement ... creates wealth inequality.<p>I see it the other way.  The government can print money and distribute it uniformly, such as with this year&#x27;s CARES act (which is about as uniform as one can ask for in this political climate).<p>Regardless of government policy for how it distributes newly created currency, inflation is fundamentally beneficial for debtors and bad for creditors.  Are &quot;the people&quot; predominantly creditors or debtors?')
