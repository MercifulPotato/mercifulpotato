With cleartext, vulnerabilities tend to range from simple things like &quot;find the switch, plug in, sniff traffic over the wire&quot; to slightly more complex, but still viable things like &quot;sniff wifi traffic now, worry about cracking WPA-2 later&quot;.<p>Your typical TLS certificate is going to be more robust than your typical consumer &#x2F; prosumer LAN security, and you typically have better tools (SSH certificates, 2FA, encryption at rest, etc, etc) for locking down a machine running a CA than network gear you either don&#x27;t control or bought from a consumer-focused vendor.<p>Its a typical example of defense-in-depth. Hopefully your network is trustworthy, but if for whatever reason it becomes insecure&#x2F;vulnerable you now have genuine encryption between client and server at application layer.')
