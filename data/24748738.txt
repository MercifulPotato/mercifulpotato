It’s of course easy to leave and become one with nature if you force all the duties of being a human in society(taxes, cleaning, groceries, raising a child, etc.) onto someone else (in this case the  wife).<p>I highly doubt that’s what actually happened but that’s essentially the first 10-15 minutes of the documentary and really took me out from the main portion, which was the friendship being formed. Then I couldn’t stop thinking whenever I saw this- the octopus is dealing with her life all day, risking life and limb, and in her periphery is a guy who is escaping his everyday life and making someone else deal with it.')
