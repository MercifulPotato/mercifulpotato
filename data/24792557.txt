It&#x27;s also not all that important; I&#x27;m basically using the same bones of the Windows 95 DE, 25 years later. Except Win95 was fast, lean, and incredibly unstable. ;)<p>I try KDE every year or so, and _always_ abandon it due to instability. I&#x27;ve filed tickets in the past but KDE developers, and to be fair Gnome devs too, seem to have your attitude: old and slow devices aren&#x27;t worth their time, despite the large install base worldwide.<p>Hell, they&#x27;re not much slower than Chromebooks or the previously popular Netbooks.')
