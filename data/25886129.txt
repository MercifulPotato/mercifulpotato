Right now we have a PR breakdown on the user overview (Completed&#x2F;Rejected). So that could be a good judge of quality. And I could see pulling in stats from Github (i.e. &#x27;this user has contributed to 25 projects&#x27;).<p>But I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily want to block new developers from being able to contribute to a project. I think it would be best to have anyone able to contribute, but perhaps a flag on the project owner side to see that user&#x27;s rating.')
