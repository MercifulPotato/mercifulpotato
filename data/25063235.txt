I go for the middle ground options that give me the most bang for buck. Planning for a total breakdown of society and investing any major amount of time into it is a depressing concept for me as well. I can see how its a lot of fun for many people but I&#x27;d rather build for an optimistic future rather than a bleak one.<p>I meal prep out to a buffer of about a week. These are extremely high quality meals that I eat regularly. Beyond this, I have about 2 additional weeks worth of dried, frozen and canned foods sitting around that are sub-par but get the job done. None of this requires any extra ongoing maintenance aside from the occasional 5lb bag of rice or can of beans at the grocery store.<p>I also have a way to distill water in reasonable quantities and a power source that can run my entire house for as long as I can locate fuel. I have a rotating 48 hour supply on-site and burn older generator fuel in my car so I don&#x27;t have to waste anything or worry about it going bad. I also have a very small generator that can run critical loads (fridge&#x2F;freezer) for a much longer timeframe if I have trouble finding quantities of fuel that can support the larger unit.<p>Anything that causes disruption beyond a month, I don&#x27;t bother planning for. After the 3rd week of apocalypse I figure I am going to try to venture out into the hellscape and start working with others to put the pieces back together.<p>Being able to defend yourself is also very important, but going overboard is ridiculous and can even make you a target if you are open about it. A good shotgun and&#x2F;or handgun are all you really need if you aren&#x27;t planning to go out and assault other people. Ample ammo is always good, but you can only effectively use 1 weapon at a time unless you have friends&#x2F;family&#x2F;neighbors who can also use them on your behalf.')
