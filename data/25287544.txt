Maximum resource cost is bounded by the cost of the renewables. Yet their cost is going down despite producing the same or even more energy. This is completely incompatible with your premise of ERORI always staying below 1.<p>If burning oil and gas directly was more efficient then it would be impossible for costs to go down beyond a certain point and subsidies would have to grow over time as more and more renewables are deployed.<p>The reality is that the opposite happened. Countries jumped onto renewables as they became cheaper [0] and subsidies are shrinking across the board.<p>So whatever your source is, it either had an agenda or it is simply incompetent.<p>[0] please don&#x27;t tell me that they didn&#x27;t become cheaper when the submission article is entirely about renewables becoming cheaper')
