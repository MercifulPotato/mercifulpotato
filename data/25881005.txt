Every single human has the same basic needs. Cover those and you&#x27;ve already done a great step towards collective happiness.<p>&gt; In the absence of infinite and exploitable energy it&#x27;s hard to see how you wont have a society that is going to directly or indirectly impose limits upon the individuals life and well being.<p>How, besides lying to ourselves, can we then justify the fact that in some countries children starve to death, while in others  people&#x27;s biggest issue is what model of smartphone they&#x27;re going to buy next?<p>Aren&#x27;t we already imposing material limits to billions of people who don&#x27;t have access to basic resources? Is that kind of limit somehow less important than the limit we might impose on someone else to not own a yacht?')
