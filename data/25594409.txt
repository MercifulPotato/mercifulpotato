More than 0.1% of all Americans (340k) have already died of COVID-19. If the IFR were 0.15-0.2%, more than half of the population would have been infected already and the spread would be pretty much over. Instead, seroprevalence shows that about 20% of Americans have been infected, meaning we have 600k or so deaths to go in the absence of controls.<p>As for &quot;99.96% of nearly everyone who gets the virus lives&quot; this is weaseling even given their low IFR estimates. It deliberately excludes those most likely to die! This doesn&#x27;t look like good faith. An article about the harms of isolation doesn&#x27;t have to, and shouldn&#x27;t, minimize the facts in this way.')
