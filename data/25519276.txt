I called it Channel Tree. The goal is to start out with a list of YouTube channels provided by the user.<p>Then my software will go look for the channel section of each channels to look for other channels there. This has the effect of building a deep tree of different channels related to each other through the channel section. The user will only have to specify how many layers of the tree he would like to have so the algorithm can stop there.<p>Finally, you&#x27;ll only have to look at the tree and look out for channels that may seem interesting based on who&#x27;s the parent in the tree.')
