It’s not that you did something wrong but that you realize what’s happening and change. It’s not that you messed up as a friend or lover, it’s that you see ways you can be better. Having the wrong priorities is bad enough, but realizing that and refusing to change is worse.<p>We have a new hire at my work. He&#x27;s been on board 10 to 12 weeks now. His skill set is the least of our bunch. Fair enough, we all have to start somewhere.<p>The problem is, he refuses to change. He&#x27;s some form of Bartleby the Scrivener. Speaks 5x more than he listens. He has been asked to not do certain things certain ways, he&#x27;s acknowledged those requests, and then has gone and done otherwise. He&#x27;s been hand-held by people with experience very much his senior and yet he seems completely unwilling - we believe he&#x27;s able - to &quot;update his software.&quot; We&#x27;ve missed client deadlines because of him and he&#x27;s yet to own a single misstep. The point is, it&#x27;s not only himself who is compromised by his &quot;learning disabilities.&quot;<p>He&#x27;s not young. Fifties-ish I guess. I also haven&#x27;t seen his CV so I&#x27;m not sure how he sold himself. That said, if he&#x27;s typical of people in that age range I now understand why many employers are reluctant to hire the &quot;over-experienced.&quot; It&#x27;s not that they fear paying more, it&#x27;s that they&#x27;re not going to get current and contemporary value.<p>Note: Before you accuse me of age stereotyping I&#x27;m actually older than he is. I&#x27;m also skill for skill one of the least robust members on our team. But I listen. I openly ask for feedback. I&#x27;m still wanting to learn and grow. Perhaps I&#x27;m some sort of freak?')
