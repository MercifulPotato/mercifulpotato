Item(by='luckylion', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1603959283, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24928186, text='&gt; But currently decided against it because I do not think the purpose of a code of conduct should be written down as potential punishments as consequences.<p>I believe that it would be a good thing if you could write it down, but you can&#x27;t, or you&#x27;ll spend your time writing down what is and isn&#x27;t allowed. What&#x27;s bad about the CoCs of today is that they are vague and are built for selective enforcement. There&#x27;s no definition of &quot;kind&quot; that includes &quot;don&#x27;t say other people are wrong&quot;, but the people who love to wield power will simply read into it whatever they please and hang you with it. At the same time, they will say that much worse acts aren&#x27;t &quot;unkind&quot; because the target deserved it.<p>Don&#x27;t do a CoC, just kick out people who are actually assholes. You don&#x27;t need a CoC to do that, and somebody who is an asshole won&#x27;t stop being an asshole because you&#x27;ve written that they can&#x27;t contribute if they are.<p>I consider CoCs harmful and they&#x27;re a negative indicator for projects to me. Not because I&#x27;m not kind, but because it hints that the maintainers are easily swayed by outside forces and will bend to pressure.')
