The thing that was hidden under a flag for the executable, that you had to actually dig for quite a bit to find. The thing that didn&#x27;t work that well to begin with. Link in your site that redirects to another site? Well, your window is now a... multiple site browser, because it&#x27;s going to stay in there.<p>But no, surely it&#x27;s Firefox moving away from a key piece of the open web, and not because the feature never worked that well in the first place. Or that barely anyone used it.')
