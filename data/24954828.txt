That&#x27;s over 8m at 60mph (not sure why we&#x27;re combining unit systems here). So I&#x27;ll stand in front of the Model S in this particular scenario and hope to get away with &#x27;mere&#x27; broken legs&#x2F;pelvis. Give the human more time and is probably take the human, not because that&#x27;s necessarily the more reliable option, but because its distribution of outcomes is more well known to me.')
