People can sign papers with false signatures and be erroneously identified as the actual party.  That is why there are notaries, to authenticate the identity of the signer, subject to trust in third party documentation.<p>For example, people steal houses by signing false quit-claim deeds.  Signatures on paper do not have any positives properties over cryptographic signatures.')
