If all systems and locations served the same purposes, everyone should have equal say. But that&#x27;s not the case at all. What we&#x27;re actually talking about are segments of people who hold largely the same beliefs as other people in their spheres based on geolocation, natural resources, and livelihoods. Their beliefs are based on their context, along with other factors. Of course there&#x27;s crossover, moral issues, etc. But there are going to be issues that don&#x27;t cross over into other areas.<p>Let me give a practical example. Aboloshing guns. Note I&#x27;m not even talking gun control, but actually getting rid of classes of guns.<p>I&#x27;ve lived both in Texas ranch land, and in New York (Jersey, commuting to Manhattan). Those are very different contexts. In New York, guns are seen as nothing but a weapon. In Texas, guns are seen as a necessity in places. In New York, guns are to defend yourself or to hurt someone else, and are almost exclusively used against people. In Texas, guns are used for those purposes, but also to hunt, to kill boars that would hurt people otherwise (and are invasive, dangerous, and could kill animals and children), to put down animals, to kill coyotes who steal chickens, to kill a rattlesnake that is in the horse pen...they&#x27;re tools. You know what AR-15s are useful for? Boars and coyotes, as well as cougars (not in Texas that I&#x27;m aware of though). They&#x27;re great against small fast predators where you would need more than one shot in an easy to shoot gun. Wouldn&#x27;t carry one for a minute in Alaska against Grizzly bears. That&#x27;s an entirely different context than Texas, even though it&#x27;s &quot;rural&quot;. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much need for one at ALL in Manhattan where if you fired one it&#x27;d shoot through three apartments&#x27; walls defending yourself. Second amendment and the right to defend yourself aside.<p>Even talking about defending yourself, how long do you think it&#x27;ll take to get a county sheriff out to a 1,000 acre ranch in the middle of nowhere if someone is shooting at you?<p>The context matters. There&#x27;s a lot fewer rancher Texans than there are people in Manhattan. Why should Manhattan get the full say in saying that the rancher&#x27;s way of life is invalid? Maybe there is compromise, but I honestly don&#x27;t think there is such a thing in our current climate.<p>This crosses many areas...which business get incentives? Should we give subsidies for corn, for food, etc. Should we encourage tech growth? What about migrant workers? Visa workers are very different than someone coming in to work a ranch or construction.<p>On some issues I agree with you. Particularly moral issues. We need to be &quot;American&quot; at some point, and not bipartisan. We need to have discussions on issues and not fight across party lines.<p>But some issues, the party lines are there because the parties represent different groups of people. We should discuss those issues too, but in almost all cases I&#x27;ve seen both sides don&#x27;t even begin to understand the other side. They can&#x27;t comprehend it because they&#x27;ve not walked a mile in the other people&#x27;s shoes. &quot;Who cares about coal miners?&quot; Or the thoughts of Ivory Tower academics.<p>There&#x27;s probably a more fair system than what we have. We need to destroy bipartisanship and limit the federal government so that local governments can give their people what they need, in my opinion, while keeping national issues like the environment as a topical national discussion. We&#x27;re a LONG way from any of that though, and will continue to as long as there&#x27;s this left&#x2F;split divide, unwillingness to cross the aisle, and the view that the other side is the enemy, stupid, or evil&#x2F;racist. BOTH sides see each other that way, my Facebook is full of people from both Texas and New York who see each other that way, and just don&#x27;t understand...both sides mean well.<p>Economically, structurally, contextually, we need a government that gives some level of power to people who live in more rural areas. Not absolute, but a balance. Pretty much everyone in Manhattan I knew were either party line democrats or libertarians. Nothing wrong with that, but that is a big bucket of people that pretty much all believe the same things because of their context, and don&#x27;t understand other areas as well. New York itself is split into different contexts, upstate New York seems an entirely different state&#x2F;country than New York City.<p>Maybe some people do understand the issues and each other...again, we&#x27;re people, it&#x27;s complex, we have different backgrounds. But as it stands, our system is polarized into two groups that don&#x27;t understand each other, but help each other in a weird symbiotic way. If you switch it to be purely population based...it&#x27;s going to be one group that now doesn&#x27;t understand 95% of the country&#x27;s land area, and very little of the supporting infrastructure that enables things like tech or finance.<p>Note what I&#x27;m NOT saying...that the electoral college fixes all of this. I&#x27;m just saying that a purely popular democratic vote would not work like people think they would, because all they see are their issues, and the most populous groups mostly live in the same types of contexts (cities with tech, finance, medical, and business sectors).')
