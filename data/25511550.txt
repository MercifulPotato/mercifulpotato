I picked it up on Google Stadia since my PC definitely isn&#x27;t up to the task, and it has been an OK game. It is no Red Dead Redemption 2, or Fallout, and the story feels pretty weak so far, but the game play is enjoyable.<p>I likely wont finish the story, but will continue to futz around in game for a while when I&#x27;m bored.')
