They are controversial, possibly.<p>Of course, nobody has to buy her books. It&#x27;s a little infantile, but it&#x27;s fine. I don&#x27;t.<p>The issue is not &#x27;people not buying her books&#x27; - the issue is that people are trying to suppress and silence her, and stop the publication of her books &amp; material.<p>It&#x27;s 100% &#x27;cancel culture&#x27; for groups to organize and vent their petty, minority opinions towards instilling fear in publishers, distributors, points-of-sale, and pressure other groups (i.e. Hollywood, Netflix) to suppress the voices of those they disagree with.<p>That is exactly cancel culture - and it&#x27;s why so many of those luminary thinkers had to take out a page in Harper&#x27;s.<p>If we were allowed to do anonymous voting on these things it would be snuffed out immediately, the antagonizing base is very small.')
