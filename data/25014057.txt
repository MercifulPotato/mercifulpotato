I first played hack on my friend’s actual IBM PC with 2 5.25” disk drives back in 1985 I think. I was addicted and the only reason I begged my parents for a computer was so that I could play hack.<p>My friend’s floppy disk of hack got corrupt so whenever he read a scroll of identify the game would crash. So he ended up finishing the game without ever reading a scroll of identify, which I admit is quite impressive.<p>I just played a game of nethack tonight after my family went to sleep!')
