Let&#x27;s take this to its logical conclusion - you&#x27;ve got people on the left upset about &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; (which is, itself, a pejorative term with problematic origins rooted in thought control), you&#x27;ve got people on the right upset about &quot;bias&quot; against their stances.<p>When both sides of the political aisle are demanding tighter control over speech for <i>any</i> reason, the intended result should terrify the hell out of you.<p>The problem you speak of is not &quot;people say false things&quot; (which is <i>not solvable</i>), the problem should rather be seen as &quot;people demand the ability to censor people they disagree with&quot;. The solution to that problem is telling both sides to pound sand and take responsibility for their own beliefs, not foisting that responsibility off onto third parties in a way that necessarily restricts freedom of speech.')
