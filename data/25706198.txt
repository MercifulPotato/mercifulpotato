It would start every day at 12-2pm, and continue for the rest of the day.<p>I worked out (incl. DL, Squat, running), but had to stop because it exacerbated the pain.<p>Physio&#x2F;Doctors&#x2F;specialists&#x2F;X-ray&#x2F;MRI came up with nothing.<p>WFH exacerbated the issue.<p>It was impacting my life every day: I could only work for ~3 hours per day, and walking&#x2F;driving became painful.<p>I&#x27;m 95% better now, and working on rehab.<p>Here&#x27;s what helped (thanks to a spine physio):<p>* Avoiding craning my neck: raise monitor, raise phone.\n* Frequent breaks.\n* Scapula mobility.\n* Deep neck flexor exercises.<p>I think this started when I heavily used my laptop on my couch, which relied on craning too much.<p>Resolving this has been my highlight of 2020.')
