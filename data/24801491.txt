There has been a lot of discussion on how social services, mental health services, and demilitarization of police tools and tactics would benefit cities.<p>In a near-zero-sum municipal budget, funding increased homelessness assistance, increased staffing for mental health response, increased investment in lower income&#x2F;higher crime areas would necessitate funds being reduced elsewhere; many suggest reducing police funding in places where those new services would step up.<p>If cops stop responding to certain kinds of emergency calls, is it not reasonable the funding for that capacity get shifted to the group that does respond? If cops were fighting fires and then a fire department was created, wouldn&#x27;t you shift some of the firefighting budget to the new crew?')
