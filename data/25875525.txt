The (brand-new) XC40 Recharge BEV is based on the new &quot;CMA&quot; platform that is designed to be flexible enough to support ICE or PHEV or full BEV configurations.<p>The S90&#x2F;V90 are built on a platform that wasn&#x27;t designed to support BEVs, but given Volvo&#x27;s commitments I expect the next V90 will be available as a BEV.  But the current V90 was released in 2016 so the redesign probably won&#x27;t arrive til 2024 or so.<p>My neighbor has a gorgeous [*] new V60 sitting out on his driveway. But that model was just refreshed a couple years ago, so given usual model lifetimes, I figure it&#x27;ll be five or six years before the next V60 redesign, and that there won&#x27;t be a true BEV V60 until then.<p>On the other hand, I hope they don&#x27;t retire the &quot;Eurowagon&quot; form factor at the same time! I don&#x27;t like crossovers and SUVs, so I&#x27;m hopeful that Volvo and VW Group (Audi, VW, or both) will have compelling electric wagons for sale by mid-decade when I expect to retire my ICEmobile.<p>[*] Yes, I just described a Volvo wagon as gorgeous, but there it is. What is this world coming to.')
