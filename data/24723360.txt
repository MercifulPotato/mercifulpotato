I see in the security section it says &quot;We secure your data at rest through a mechanism called tokenization, which ensures our systems only store references to your secrets. In the event of a data breach, attackers would only gain access to the references.&quot; If this is the case, then where are the secrets stored? How can you view the secrets from the web console if they aren&#x27;t stored anywhere? Thanks!')
