Versus HMMs and linear autoregressive models, I think avoiding the need to predefine the form of the autoregression is a bigger leap than it might appear right now.  I&#x27;d always been a neural network skeptic, thinking they&#x27;re excessively complex for no benefit.  It seems to me that&#x27;s no longer true.  I&#x27;m not certain that&#x27;ll hold, but it&#x27;s exciting.')
