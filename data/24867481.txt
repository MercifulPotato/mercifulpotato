I can go about my business around the house and get back in minutes if someone pings me on Slack.<p>If I&#x27;m at the office, I can still just walk out when I&#x27;m done, but I can&#x27;t get back to work as quickly if I&#x27;m needed. So it&#x27;s just polite to be physically present for the full work day.')
