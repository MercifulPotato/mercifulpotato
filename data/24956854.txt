But I&#x27;ve recently been wondering about how much of a difference it makes today. I used to follow this space fairly closely 4-5 years ago, but I don&#x27;t know what has changed since then.<p>Once a typical use-after-free vulnerability is disclosed publicly, for example, how quickly does it get weaponized? I remember reading some academic papers a while back, which claimed to be able to automatically generate exploits from a patch. I believe ROP compilers exist also that will take some logic and string it together with a given set of gadgets in a binary. What is the current state of all that tooling?<p>Bottomline: Are there stats (e.g. from honeypots) that tell us the likelihood of a typical laptop&#x2F;mobile user being compromised based on a given security flaw, given the amount of time they run unpatched after disclosure?<p>I figured there must be experts here who have been keeping up with all of this better than I have. I&#x27;d love to hear from you all!')
