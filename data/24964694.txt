Although there are probably better tools, it&#x27;s standard for their lab so they have to use it.<p>EndNote, on her machine, was just absurdly slow. Operations like editing a single reference would beachball for 30-60 seconds. She has a moderately-sized library - about 1000 references - but nothing that should be causing a modern MacBook to slow down that much. So I took a look. Happily, on a Mac, you can use spindump to automatically take a sample-based profile of any process, and you can even do it from Activity Monitor. Endnote had their symbols partially stripped - but the Objective-C functions weren&#x27;t stripped, so I got to see that somewhere in the call chain was a &quot;recalculateColumnWidths&quot; function. That was apparently getting called on practically every operation with the library.<p>I got out Ghidra, traced the caller of that function, and `nop`ped the call site out. Problem fixed - no more random slowdowns, no more beachballs. Resizing the columns manually worked too - I never really saw any cases where the columns seemed out of whack.<p>If I had to guess, she probably had some reference with some unusual characters in it that was causing Endnote to think it needed to resize all the columns. I never quite figured that part out - but that would have been another way to solve the problem (e.g. by bisecting her library to find the offender(s)).')
