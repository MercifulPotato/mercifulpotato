I&#x27;m not at all a fan of how some packages try to install non-Julia stuff for you behind the scenes by default as mentioned in TFA. It&#x27;s a surprising default and it makes a mess of your system that is hard to clean up.<p>GNU R and Common Lisp (especially Quicklisp) already made these design mistakes, and let&#x27;s please not repeat them. The initial of friendliness &quot;do everything interactively right in the REPL&quot; quickly gives way to &quot;arggghhh&quot;.<p>Edit: on second thought, I guess there is a fine line to be drawn here. We are already accustomed to R, Python, Node, Ruby, etc. building C stuff at package installation time. I don&#x27;t have a great sense of where to draw the line, but somehow I feel the Julia convention crosses it.')
