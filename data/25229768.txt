But that is great, it means there is a company for everyone.<p>At my company one of our most important values is &quot;live the life you love&quot;. For each person we try to understand how the company can help them achieve their personal goals.<p>If someone wants to work a ton of hours to get promoted as fast as possible, we support that. But if they want a balanced life we support that too. We have people that are close to retirement that want to work half time. We support that. If people want to work remotely, we support that. Some people really want to work in an office. We support that. One person wanted to buy a ranch, another wanted to write a book, many people want to start their own companies.<p>We are running a marathon, not a sprint. We monitor people&#x27;s hours and have a discussion if their hours are regularly at too high a rate (some people like it). We know that they will eventually burn out, will start to make bad decisions etc.<p>I don&#x27;t want to be party to a cult where people&#x27;s every waking moment revolves around the company. I dont want people to be obsessed with what we do, though I do want people to have fun. I dont need to wring every ounce of profitability out of the company at the expense of the people.<p>I mountain bike before work, sometimes leave work to kitesurf if the wind is up, work on another startup on the side, go to most of my kids&#x27; presentations, take them to afterschool activities where I stay and watch etc. I want all of my employees to be able to do those things too if they want.')
