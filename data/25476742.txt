For me music discovery is an active act, so every other month I spend an afternoon to find new things read up on certain scenes etc. E.g. I stumble uppon Iranian 60s rock and roll, find a few artists that are more unique in aound and the way they do &quot;rock&quot;, I download things, tag them, sort them, create playlists and store them away.<p>This way when I play the music (e.g. at a dinner with friends) not only do I know what it is going to be, but I can also tell them a little story about it.')
