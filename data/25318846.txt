They hired her because they are a massive AI company operating on a multi-billion user scale that will very likely produce massic impacts on our society, impacts that we can&#x27;t even imagine today. They understand at an intuitive level that what they&#x27;re doing is risky and (perhaps at minimum) they understand there&#x27;s a risk that it will provoke a backlash. To insulate themselves, they wanted a credible AI ethics researcher even at the cost of her being potentially a bit difficult to manage.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t fully understand what happened in this incident, but I think there&#x27;s a chance that it&#x27;s far more impactful than some internal workplace spat. To put this succinctly: businesses like Google are playing cards for thousand dollar bills, and HN is interested in debating their favorite game of nickle poker.')
