I didn&#x27;t respond here to argue protobufs actually is bad, since all software is suited to something for somebody somewhere.<p>In fact, I can just do that now: Protobufs <i>is</i> bad. You seem to agree, because you haven&#x27;t even advocated for it -- just flatbuffers and Cap&#x27;n Proto and the phonebook of alternatives. Listen, I don&#x27;t care who you&#x27;ve worked for or what you&#x27;ve done. As a scientist and engineer I&#x27;m totally ready and able to entertain critiques of my prior works without being offended. I&#x27;m offended that this is the quality of your participation here.')
