And unfortunately, it has always made me somewhat envious at the opportunities of students who study full time at universities in the U.S, especially so in places like Stanford&#x2F;MIT&#x2F;Berkeley&#x2F;etc. Though I suppose, I ended up here in the same place as everyone else regardless, which is what ultimately matters.<p>I wonder what it would take to build up something like Silicon Valley in my home country, or even just within the EU in general.')
