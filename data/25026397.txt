How is the pay band of the company compared to local competitors? How are the perks?<p>I don&#x27;t expect managers in a tech hub to be able to keep younger employees for many years, when they can jump ship after 1-3 years to get a huge pay raise somewhere else.<p>Then there&#x27;s the grade of the company, if you&#x27;re at a lower grade company (low pay, mediocre projects, no pension, bad health insurance) good luck keeping people around. They will figure out soon enough the grass is greener elsewhere.<p>The few people I met with 10+ years of tenure were mostly in large companies with benefits and comfortable positions. They&#x27;ve changed roles internally a few times over the years.')
