I just signed up for PACER this year, and I&#x27;m still trying to work out how to access State and local court system&#x27;s records since they&#x27;re so distributed.<p>Like it or not, we haven&#x27;t exactly done a great job at exposing primary sources to everyone. Until that can happen, media outlets who pay for boots on the ground will still have a degree of intutively granted credibility. Once everyone knows how to access it at will (and can be bothered to) we may see some better measurement on the reliabilitt of information sources.')
