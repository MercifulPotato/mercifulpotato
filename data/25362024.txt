I generally agree with Buffett on it: &quot;diversification is protection against ignorance. It makes little sense if you know what you are doing.&quot;<p>If a person is willing to spend time learning some the basics of finance, and learning about different companies, I think they would be fine with just picking a few stocks. They just need to be watched carefully. As they start to have more capital, they should look to diversify and look to take on less risk.<p>Plus, everyone wants different things. Many on &#x2F;r&#x2F;wallstreetbets see gambling on the stock market as a way to improve their lives, and I don&#x27;t think it is the worst option. A risky stock investment is better than wasting money on a sports car or something.<p>In general, I think when you are very young a very risky investment is not a bad thing. As long as the money isn&#x27;t needed for other things.')
