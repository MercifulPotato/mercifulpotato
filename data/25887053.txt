You could use that immediately and find value. You would not need to export whatever mess and try to make it work assuming they even let you do that.<p>That’s the idea, anyhow. I feel very strongly that YOU should own YOUR DATA and applications should provide value ON TOP of your data. This provides you true freedom of choice.')
