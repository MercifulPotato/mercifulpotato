It&#x27;s definitely an immigrant-friendly culture (more so now than several years back), but that&#x27;s not quite the same thing as &quot;easy to immigrate to&quot;. Many of my acquaintances (from India, South Africa, and the EU) have found it very hard to find work here, extremely time-consuming and tiring to get through the visa process, and some have had to return home. I&#x27;m not saying it <i>should</i> be super-easy, and maybe it is easier than some other countries (I don&#x27;t really know), but it&#x27;s definitely not &quot;easy&quot; for most people I&#x27;ve talked with.')
