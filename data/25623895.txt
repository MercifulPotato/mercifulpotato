Item(by='lcall', descendants=None, kids=[25625330], score=None, time=1609699299, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25620809, text='Asking him would get a more currently accurate answer, but the parts I do know include that he had the knowledge and so wrote a self-published book (paper and digital) about GameMaker some years back, and he is good at knowing about and being a positive part of his gaming communities, so he has built his name recognition over time, initially while working a full-time job and going to school.  And I think toward his customers (&quot;students&quot;), he treats them with respect, and they say good things about him.  I think he has a designated # of hours per week he spends on things like those.  Plus, his personality and strengths line up well with the kind of work he does: he likes art, and gaming, and talking about them, and helping people, and has a sort of natural sense about people and a speech cadence that work well in instructional videos.<p>Other things that have helped him <i>stay</i> in business are that he and his wife both wanted and agreed early on to take Dave Ramsey&#x27;s advice (which somewhat they also got from their parents&#x27; example), that it is worth being very frugal to prioritize debt avoidance, having some savings, and paying off a house, over many other kinds of expenses, so when there are ups and downs, they can ride them out.<p>Edit: They drove that old car for a long time even though the A&#x2F;C didn&#x27;t work right and the windows wouldn&#x27;t all roll down properly etc.  Then they saved up for a while, watched for good buys, and replaced it with a reliable used van for cash.<p>Edits: They also pray and pay tithing, and there are blessings promised in Malachi 3 (Bible) and elsewhere to those who do that (properly?), which I have also experienced, not in identical ways.  And they are family, so my wife and I pray for them all, often.<p>Plus he sets objectives and works regularly on weekdays, and takes breaks on evenings&#x2F;weekends to enjoy the family.  And they read business books and discuss them.')
