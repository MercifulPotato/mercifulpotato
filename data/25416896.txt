Item(by='jacobion', descendants=None, kids=[25417146, 25417402, 25417206], score=None, time=1607950437, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25416082, text='The way apprenticeships traditionally worked is that the apprentice was bound to the master for a certain number of years, and his parents also often had to pay to have him taken on. The tension between needing trained labour, but not wanting your trained labour to walk out the door and seek employment elsewhere (literal meaning of &#x27;journeyman&#x27;) was resolved firstly by extremely severe constraints on the apprentice and his freedom, and secondly by pretty severe regulation of the master, to ensure quality of training, and prevent exploitation. In practice there still was a lot of exploitation.<p>Today neither employers not bootcamps would be able to take on risk&#x2F;exert control over the apprentice&#x27;s career to the extent optimal from a strictly economic point of view. You can look at the service-for-education deals offered by the military (for both low-skilled and highly skilled people) to get an example - no other organizations would be allowed to restrict a trainee&#x27;s liberty to the same extent.<p>While I don&#x27;t agree with the moral spin that is sometimes put on this of &#x27;greedy juniors&#x27; getting trained up and then abandoning their benefactors for higher salaries, this is a real collective action problem, not just shortsightedness in behalf of employers.')
