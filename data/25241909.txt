All the subsequent generations went back to the norm, with the exception of the Atom series, and even that one is not as unusual as the P4.<p>[1] Even the family&#x2F;model&#x2F;stepping designation has an oddity: the 486 was family 4, the Pentium was family 5, and then everything from the Pentium II&#x2F;III up to the latest Core series, as well as the Atoms, uses family 6; but the P4 was family <i>15</i>.')
