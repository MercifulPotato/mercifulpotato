Then when they tried to replace HTML with XML and the browser vendors revolted, the W3C essentially lost control over this.<p>Basically the W3C over-played it&#x27;s hand.  It thought by re-writing standards from HTML to XML it could force Apple&#x2F;Opera&#x2F;Mozilla to re-write.  In the end, the browser vendors got together and created a new body that would be responsible for HTML.  They&#x27;ve skirmished for control, but there&#x27;s no question WHATWG and browser vendors are in ascendency. From 2007-2019 they both had competing standards of HTML, but since the browser vendors were on WHATWG they would just implement their own  version making it the de-facto standard.  So, in 2019 W3C announced they&#x27;d just use the WHATWG HTML.[0]<p>I expect if the W3C pushes anything the vendors consider too arduous (eg a re-write of CSS into constraints), then WHATWG would create a CSS working group and the process would repeat.<p>This reminds me a lot of the power of the Supreme Court, specifically President Johnson&#x27;s quote about it when they made a ruling he didn&#x27;t like. &quot;[The Chief Justice on the court] has made his decision; now let him enforce it&quot;[1]  The stakeholders of WHATWG have an army (of browser coders), whereas W3C needs to rule by consent of the ruled like the Supreme Court does.<p>----<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;WHATWG" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;WHATWG</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Worcester_v._Georgia#Enforcement" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Worcester_v._Georgia#Enforceme...</a>')
