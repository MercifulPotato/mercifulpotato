He turned out to be more of a mentor&#x2F;big vision&#x2F;best practices guy.  Which is probably OK to have one or two of those if you&#x27;re a large enough org.<p>But we had 3 devs.   I think he gave some great advice (and looking back - still think so 12 years later), but it just wasn&#x27;t what we needed at the time.<p>The funny thing is, when we let him go (he knew it was coming - he wasn&#x27;t blind to the problems) he got hired at a company we worked regularly with.  Things worked out much better for him there.')
