They crush everyone like ants. They&#x27;re a gravitational black hole in our industry.<p>We need the DOJ to force Apple to open the platform. Nobody should be forced to give up their customers to &quot;Apple Login&quot;, pay a 15% tax, or be tied at the neck to Apple for distribution.<p>And not just apps! Web on Apple is held back because nobody can put a non-Safari rendering engine on the device. Or custom runtimes. This, too, needs to end.<p>Apple already makes a fuck ton of money, and they will continue to do so. They&#x27;re making a car and a film studio, for fuck&#x27;s sake. They shouldn&#x27;t own all of computing for 50% of Americans. Not to mention these people will be increasingly cut off behind their own commerce Berlin Wall. It&#x27;s like Apple customers are a nation state of pawns at Apple&#x27;s disposal.<p>Complain to your representatives. Use the government. That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s there for.')
