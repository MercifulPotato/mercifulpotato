I don&#x27;t have friends or co-workers that talk about topics such as depression, burnout, and personal growth. The comments posted often serve as a passive mentorship for me. I wish I didn&#x27;t have to depend on a message board for help, but I&#x27;m happy it&#x27;s here. I want to thank you all for being open and honest and I want to thank Dang personally for making it all work.')
