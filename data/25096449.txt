That&#x27;s a lofty goal, and maybe attainable, but probably far off for humanity as a whole.<p>It&#x27;s not only lofty and &quot;maybe&quot; attainable, it&#x27;s already happened, beginning decades ago. You&#x27;re living in the most peaceful time in human history. There are almost no international wars (maybe Armenia and Azerbaijan count?). The great powers fight no wars with each other. War is almost unimaginable across vast geographic areas: Europe, especially sans Russia. North America, South America - <i>the entire Americas</i>. South and Southeast Asia, with the possible (and significant) exception of India and Pakistan. East Asia except North Korea. Etc.<p>It&#x27;s not an accident or luck; it was a program of the early 20th century to make war illegal, and that came to fruition after WWII when the victors (who were not daydreamers - they knew more about war than we can ever imagine or want to know) formed the UN and the roots of the EU explicitly to prevent future wars.<p>It&#x27;s like saying that extending human average human lifespan past 50 years is &quot;a lofty goal, and maybe attainable, but probably far off for humanity as a whole.&quot;<p>&gt; Critical to any military, much less society, is the concept of a warrior class.<p>There is no &quot;warrior class&quot; in the West or in the democratic world. For most of American and democratic history, wars were fought using draftees and citizen soldiers, like the Minutemen - everyone, not a class. The current American and most wealthy country militaries are filled with volunteers, people from all walks of life - not a class, unless we redefine the meaning of &quot;class&quot; as &#x27;any group of people in the same job&#x27;. They are not trained over generations; in fact, many in the U.S. military are immigrants and the children of immigrants.<p>A &#x27;warrior class&#x27; doesn&#x27;t have a place in U.S. society, which is explicitly anti-class. That doesn&#x27;t mean there is perfect social mobility, but generally we expect and encourage individuals to follow their own paths - not many reading this follow the family profession (especially in IT!) - and to succeed or fail by their effort and merit. If Mary&#x27;s mother was a farmer, we aren&#x27;t shocked if Mary becomes a programmer or doctor or artist. Obviously, we have much work to do to achieve those ideals, but the ideal is certainly not a caste system.')
