A certain level of Vitamin D is strongly correlated with a lot of health indicators. But there is no strong evidence so far that it’s a <i>cause</i> of good health.<p>If that’s the case, that Vitamin D doesn’t <i>cause</i> good health, it just happens to be present in people with good health — and I could be wrong in both of my previous statements, I am not a specialist, I just read specialists claiming this. So, if that’s the case and Vitamin D supplement intake becomes widespread (a lot of dairy products in the US includes Vitamin D already), it might interfere in research trying to understand the relation of Vitamin D and good health.<p>Not just research, but a doctor checking a patient blood exam wouldn’t notice anymore the low Vitamin D and wouldn’t recommend a, probably beneficial, larger exposure to the sun.')
