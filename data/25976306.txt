Flights to Florida are dirt cheap from the northeast or Spirit hubs (like $30-$120 round trip, you can&#x27;t even drive to NYC from DC for that).<p>Even if you&#x27;re socially withdrawn (hell, I am) you can get so much more out of life even on your own in a place where there&#x27;s nature, culture, diversity, nice people. Where you don&#x27;t have to drive four hours to get to another large metro area. And that&#x27;s just one area of the U.S.<p>It&#x27;s a big world out there. Moving to Florida is like throwing the world away. You only get one life, don&#x27;t waste it.')
