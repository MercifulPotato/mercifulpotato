In that sense they act somewhat similarly to Certification Authorities, in that I as a user will not blindly trust a self-signed certificate but will trust a certificate that was vetted by this third-party.<p>In practice when you install something from AUR with a helper, it&#x27;s not that far from doing a curl|bash (except the helpers will nag you to inspect the content, but allow you to skip doing it by default). The difference is who you curl it from.<p>Edit: as a precision, I do differentiate official repos and &quot;third-party&quot; repos; the latter are definitely a more integrated curl|bash, the same precautions apply')
