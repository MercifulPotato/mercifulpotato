But recognize that your rewrite is going to introduce new bugs (funny, your answer to that was &quot;deal with it&quot; instead of &quot;hire better programmers&quot;).  And recognize that, better programmers or no, <i>some of those new bugs are going to be security bugs</i>.<p>Now, that may still be better than the current situation.  But glibly saying &quot;just hire better programmers&quot; means you&#x27;re hiding your head in the sand.')
