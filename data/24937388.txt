It would be more persuasive if you presented an “anti-space” (?) actually expressing this argument.  Otherwise it could just be a fantasy you’ve concocted in your head...<p>A counter argument to your theology: I personally know of no one who has proposed <i>banning</i> space exploration.  <i>Banning space travel</i> would follow your created theology, since banning is what morality normally does.<p>A more widely held theology might be that “anti-space” believes that human space exploration is a cowardly, and not a heroic, endeavor.  One person’s exploration is another person’s escape.  That <i>is</i> off-message for selling space tourism and tchotchkes, so there could be some pushback from those with “skin in the game”.<p>And it shows some unintended disrespect for those who gave their lives during early space missions.<p>PS: In fact, I know of nobody who, now and then, hasn’t wanted more human space travel.<p>They just want to choose who gets sent and whether they are permitted to come back alive.  Two birds, one stone...')
