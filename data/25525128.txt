Google services on entities that can potentially have an address revolve around Maps - restaurant, hotel, location ads all seem to join against their map data at some point as itâ€™s impossible to purchase any of these without providing a source address. They likely did not design for physical businesses without an address. Interested to see how they handle food trucks or ice cream trucks.')
