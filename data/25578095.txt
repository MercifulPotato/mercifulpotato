Item(by='dirtyid', descendants=None, kids=[25582235], score=None, time=1609298676, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25577055, text='&gt;Each one of those people is as important as you or me.<p>Yeah they are.<p>The reality is also that frontier territories have been historically spared the harsh repressions rest of country &#x2F; populus went through postwar like cultural revolution, great leap forward, strict family planning etc, simply by virtue of being too far. Enter infrastructure and billions in spent on connectivity. Secessionism had to be reign in eventually, and current systems has as much carrots as sticks. Also carrots that was not available to a much poorer China. There&#x27;s a reason why disproportionate resources are diverted to Tibet and XJ for development. Carrots that freedom + human rights countries typically do not extend to their own repressed minorities. Indigenous camps in Canada still don&#x27;t have clean water, because voters in democracies do not want to give carrots when virtue signalling is sufficient. CCP doesn&#x27;t have to listen to majority Han reee about spending money on minorities. Last time I calculated enough money poured into XJ to cut every Uygure a 200K RMB &#x2F; 30K USD check.<p>The fundamental issue is carrots are not enough, you cannot pay people to secularize&#x2F;sinicize&#x2F;integrate. You have to indoctrinate, not just future generations, but also current. This is not endorsement of the policies. Merely it is predictable next step with new Chinese capabilities, further made inevitable by salafist terrorism fermented by blowback of foreign policy decisions of USSR&#x2F;West&#x2F;ME and other geopolitical factors. Things would be very different in a world without mujahideens inspiring drama in XJ or CIA fucking around with Tibet or general US pivot to Asia or current great powers competition. This is why CCP is obsessed with with foreign meddling. Nevermind that Tibet&#x2F;XJ is 2&#x2F;3 of Chinese land and contain vast security benefits. More relevant to &quot;as important as you or me&quot;, these minorities are _more_ important than the average Han. Security is paramount state responsibility, more so in an authoritarian one because there is no one else to shift blame. And even then blame is no replacement for overwhelmingly excessive counter-terrorism response where possible. Incidentally why XJ is getting the full measure while Tibet gets half. That&#x27;s baseline populist expectation, CCP is adding the carrots when the people scream for sticks. A democratic China would just lockup the Uyghurs and Tibetans in perennial prison industrial complexes like US or sequester them away in generation ghettos like France. An imperial China would actually genocide them. Trivially. That&#x27;s the dynamic of in a capitalist ethnostate with &quot;problematic&quot; minorities. What currently exists is not the best timeline, but it&#x27;s also not remotely the worst for security logic, which again, trumps all other considerations. Incidentally, this applied to HK, and will apply to Taiwan.')
