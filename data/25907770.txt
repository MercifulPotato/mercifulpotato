If group A, group B, and group C all agree and group D disagrees, then we can say with relative confidence that D is probably wrong in this case. It is safe to go with the consensus.<p>However, if A, B, C are notoriously unreliable and have a history of distorting claims, then it is beneficial to see why D disagrees with all three. Or even not use A, B, and C as sources.<p>We can also judge a fact-checker&#x27;s veracity by how they evaluate a claim. Do they provide sources for their claim. It&#x27;s one thing to say &quot;This will murder 40 people a minute&quot; and quite another to say &quot;This claim disagrees with a recent study by the CDC [link to study] that says it will only murder 39 people a minute&quot;.<p>The only reason to cast doubt on the process or activity of fact-checking is if you don&#x27;t want people checking your facts.')
