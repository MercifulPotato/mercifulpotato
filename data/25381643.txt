Item(by='lmm', descendants=None, kids=[25383495], score=None, time=1607654611, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25381219, text='&gt; That doesnâ€™t solve illegal immigration, it just promotes illegal documentation forgery and illegal under-the-table employment on top of illegal immigration.<p>Anything that increases the costs of illegal immigration will reduce the incidence of it. It will probably never go all the way to zero, but the harder you make it the less it will happen.<p>Many people, both outside and inside the system, are openly obstructing enforcement of even existing laws and policies. That&#x27;s the biggest reason illegal immigration continues - a lot of people want it to.<p>&gt; OTOH, illegal immigration is easy to solve, you first align the numerical limits of your immigration system with demand by retaining only in-total and not per-country caps, and then, if you want a more complete solution, you make those caps soft caps instead of hard caps by allowing supernumerary immigrants that would be qualified but for numerical limits to temporarily reside while waiting in line for a regular slot (or just bypass the line entirely) by paying an annual (or, for the bypass mechanism, larger one-time) impact fee to address expected social costs.<p>That&#x27;s like telling people who want to &quot;solve&quot; a high murder rate that they should just legalise murder, problem solved. The limits that we have are the product of our democratic process, even if you disagree with them. Even many pro-immigration people are against the idea of selling extra spaces, and many anti-immigration people would be (rightly!) dubious that the people who the social costs actually fall on would see any of the money.')
