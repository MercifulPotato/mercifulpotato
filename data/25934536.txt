The only button like thing before HTML4 was &lt;input TYPE=SUBMIT&gt;.<p>And, as you mention, the default styling was typically &quot;make it look like the button in the underlying OS&quot;.<p>So there was a lot of inertia from existing code, examples, and docs that predated buttons. And a (misinformed) avoidence of it when it did appear because of styling.')
