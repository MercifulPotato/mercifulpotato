The Conservatives and Right Wing of these countries call it a Capitalist Welfare State. Most people over here agree that none of these countries are under Socialist Rule however. Instead they are democracies that are run mostly under capitalism, but with more state-run regulation and taxation than that of the USA. However, as the keen-eyed will see, what you guys pay extra in medical insurance, is kind of like a tax too, so when you add that in, Americans sometimes end up paying <i>more</i> in &quot;tax&quot; than many Europeans.')
