You still paid a reasonable price for it, and can rewatch it many many many times if you want.<p>This isn&#x27;t the same with the music cost - you paid a tiny amount; they made a tiny amount of money - that&#x27;s the unsustainable bit.<p>I&#x27;m the opposite to you - I will watch a film a few times, but only if I enjoyed it (as you said). I don&#x27;t listen to the same song multiple times per day, let alone multiple times per week.')
