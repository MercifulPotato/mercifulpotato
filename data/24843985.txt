Item(by='nickik', descendants=None, kids=[24845841, 24844265], score=None, time=1603243151, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24843385, text='&gt; So I started reading everything I could about our monetary system and learned that it essentially became a ponzi scheme in 1971.<p>Even if you want to argue that all fiat money are &#x27;ponzi schemes&#x27; then it would have been a ponzi scheme many times over. In fact if you assume the pre 1971 system to be ok, then it might surpirse you to learn that it only came into effect in the late 1950s. That system (Brandon Woods system) actually was not even close to a real gold standard and didn&#x27;t operate like one either. I don&#x27;t see how you can say its not a ponzi scheme while those system before and after it were. If anything Brandon Woods was a US controlled ponzi scheme where the US could inflate their currency while pretending it was gold to other currencies.<p>So the system you think of as non-ponzi existed for 10-20 years max. And before that it was a ponzi scheme again? It was also a ponzi scheme in and post WW1 if that is the case?<p>Not even sure what it means to be a ponzi scheme for money. In a ponzi scheme you pay interest on old money with new money, that is very different from the goal of a monetary system.<p>The way you talk about it, it seems to me you read a heavily &#x27;bitcoin fan&#x27; recommended literature on monetary history. What you say is very far away from almost all academic literature on money.')
