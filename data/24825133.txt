There are two major parties, but afaik anyone can start a party. This means two parties dominate, but that&#x27;s actually the same in most countries in Europe. There are many parties but for most of the 1900s you&#x27;d get two large parties and a large number of very small ones. In more recent times some of the smaller parties have grown large enough that parties group together in order to secure a majority. But this means that although there are many parties, there are still only two sides (practically) to chose from.')
