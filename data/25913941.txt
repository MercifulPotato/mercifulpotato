The vast majority of hedge fund managers aren&#x27;t doing anything that you couldn&#x27;t do yourself, i.e. pick a few stocks out of the S&amp;P 500 and hope that they outperform the market.<p>&gt; The returns I get are way better than I could get on my own.<p>Look into index based ETFs. They simply track an index so your performance is equal to the market&#x27;s, so no handpicking stocks or gambling. They are traded like stocks, so you can probably buy them with your broker. The best part about them is that they have almost no fees - the most popular ETFs cost 0.10-0.20% per year.<p>If you&#x27;re American and believe that the American stock market will continue to outperform the rest of the world, then an ETF like SPY (tracks the S&amp;P 500) would be a good bet. If you&#x27;d like something more diversified, have a look at funds tracking indices like the MSCI World or FTSE All-World.')
