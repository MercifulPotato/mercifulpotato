Producing hydrogen is inefficient and unnecessary if you have a consistent source of energy, which nuclear provides.<p>Renewables + short term storage + hydrogen will likely be cheaper than a grid based on nuclear, even with the inefficiency of hydrogen.  One contributing reason for that (for the hydrogen) is that a simple cycle combustion turbine power plant is 1&#x2F;20th the capital cost per MW of a nuclear power plant.<p>You can check this out with some plausible assumptions for 2030 technologies and real climate data at<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;model.energy&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;model.energy&#x2F;</a>')
