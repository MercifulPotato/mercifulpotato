I don&#x27;t know where the idea that Lean is classical is coming from. Lean is constructive. It is consistent with classical axioms, just like Coq is, and just like Cubical is in the propositional fragment. Isabelle&#x2F;HOL on the other hand is classical, and is quite a natural choice if classical logic is what you want, which is why mathematicians have been using it for decades now.<p>I know Kevin. He does good work. He also heckled every talk at ITP, including my own, in the middle to express his opinions. I have never met another researcher in my life who does that. Media outlets interview him and not the other 50 years of researchers doing work on proof assistants and using them both for mathematics and for verifying systems. I wrote a whole book about the history of program verification and for sure nobody has ever interviewed me about it. Kevin is loud and bold, that is why his opinions spread like fire. But they are just that, opinions.')
