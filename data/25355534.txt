It has three major changes along with a bunch of more minor cleanups and improvements:<p>1. Protections against patent trolls (similar to Apache-2.0, so this is a clear improvement over the GPLv2 which didn&#x27;t protect users from patent trolls <i>at all</i>).<p>2. The enforcement provisions were made much less harsh (the GPLv2 immediately terminates your rights upon any violation of the GPLv2) with a curing period so that distributions could rectify honest mistakes without losing their rights.<p>These two are both clearly improvements over the GPLv2 (so much so that many distributions in the Linux community have explicitly promised to only enforce GPLv3-style enforcement for non-compliance of their Linux copyrights[1]).<p>3. The &quot;tivoisation clause&quot;. This one is probably the most controversial change, but honestly it&#x27;s actually a fairly understandable extension of this clause of the GPLv2 (s3):<p>&gt; For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, <i>plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable</i>.<p>In 1991, firmware keys and walled-gardens were unheard of and so I would expect that most people living in 1991 would expect the above line to mean that you should be given everything required to install a program (including if it came with a piece of hardware). You may not personally feel that this is reasonable, but given that the FSF&#x27;s main goal is complete software freedom, I am surprised people can&#x27;t see the above clause from their perspective. Today we know that firmware keys aren&#x27;t part of &quot;the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable&quot; and so with the GPLv2 you can still get locked down devices. Hence the &quot;tivoisation clause&quot;.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redhat.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;about&#x2F;gplv3-enforcement-statement" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.redhat.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;about&#x2F;gplv3-enforcement-statement</a>')
