We agree that this is creating even worse problems.<p>The wealth divide in the U.S. has been steadily increasing, and the solution for the working class (higher education) isn&#x27;t working like it used to, even making it worse for young people.  This has lead to an angry working class who feel justified in blaming their problems on other out-groups, whether that&#x27;s BLM, democrats, China, Mexicans, tech companies, doctors, lgtbq, etc.<p>This is what fascism is feeding on in America, and it has to stop.')
