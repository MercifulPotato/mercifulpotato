It saves you minutes in the beginning in return for hours within a week’s time, then hours in return for days, then it just keeps costing.<p>Especially since Postgres supports JSON properly, I’ve found no reason to use anything else except perhaps when you want eventual consistency, which couchdb may do better out of the box, but is a whole big can of worms.<p>Added: I find DALs are the only acceptable layer over relational data, and other than BLOBs (which unfortunately no database seems to deal with nicely, and are thus relegated to the file system), everything that fits into a NoSQL fits at least as well into a modern RDBMS (e.g. Postgres)')
