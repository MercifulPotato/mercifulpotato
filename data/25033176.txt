For justice reasons we had to be treated equally to the guys (and it was only guys back then) doing military service. That meant not only that we had a right to our <i>service banana</i>[1], but also that, at least a percentage of us, had to go through boot camp.<p>It was only a small percentage, but of course, I won the lottery ticket and was sent off for six weeks of <i>conscientious objectors boot camp</i>.\nApart from the usual indoctrination, which I suppose was similar to military boot camp, we had to do things that were supposed to prepare us for our jobs in hospitals and homes for the elderly.<p>One of these things was the <i>Wheel Chair Experiment</i>. Groups of three: one guy in a wheelchair, one guy playing the nurse, third guy observing how people react. To make it interesting, we made a day trip by train to a nearby tourist town - and coincidentally place of pilgrimage. Of course, we were given stern warnings not to pull off what some of our predecessors allegedly had done: \nRoll into the sanctuary, jump out of the wheelchair and shout: &quot;I am healed! I am healed!!&quot;<p>Apart from the joking and fun young people have together, it was a very chilling experience. Going up, only a slight rise is strenuous, and for steeper rises, the pivoting front wheels of the chair always turned crosswise.  \nEntering the train in the morning we cheated because we were overburdened with the task. That made our instructor really mad because we couldn&#x27;t stay in character for not even half an hour. I never dared to lift the front wheels because I was too afraid of falling backward with my head hitting the ground. When it comes to people, most just look away from you, which made me very uncomfortable.<p>It was an experience I will never forget. I have the deepest respect for anyone managing life in a wheelchair.<p>[1] Service personnel on ships had the right to receive a part of their pay in fruit or vegetables for historical reasons. For equality, this was extended to every soldier and later to conscientious objectors too. Humorously this was called the <i>service banana</i>. I only know this because it was part of our boot camp curriculum.')
