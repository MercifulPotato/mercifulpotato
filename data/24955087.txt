As a result, some companies have a blanket rule that any code has to either be written in house, or come with a clear purchased licence granting them the right to use it.<p>I can&#x27;t recall who it was now, but I remember reading about an open source project that makes considerable money from selling these licences, even though they weren&#x27;t necessary (the licence was MIT). The licence even had an explanation around it stating (paraphrasing) &quot;Hey, this isn&#x27;t required, but if it makes you feel better, you can pay for it&quot;.')
