Seems the far simpler explanation.<p>Further the &#x27;explanation&#x27; that males might have taken more risks, explains nothing. The one common denominator between every single mammal from ancient times is, they are <i>all dead</i>. It doesn&#x27;t matter how; all their skeletons should be somewhere in the fossil record. A disparity would have to explain how male skeletons died in precisely the right way to be preserved more often. Which seems like nonsense.')
