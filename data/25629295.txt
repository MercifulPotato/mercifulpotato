I&#x27;ll just assume you are a software developer: to be honest, except for some niche or company-specific fields, that are tied to a narrow or harder to grasp field of the industry - networking, or Oracle&#x2F;Microsoft ones come to mind - certificates are a waste of time.<p>The internet is full of knowledge, tutorials, blog posts, courses. Complete some and start some own (pet) projects. Contribute to an open source product. Be an intern and have that time show on your resume. Snapping up certificates will make your CV look like Michael Scott&#x27;s wall from The Office. Honestly, at interviews I don&#x27;t even look at college degree, let alone random certificates. All that matters is on-field experience and work that you did.')
