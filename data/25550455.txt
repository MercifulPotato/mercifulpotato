They are extremely formidable who don&#x27;t stand down from their idea or startup no matter what fate throws at them.<p>I am struggling with building persistence in my pursuit of startup ideas or side projects. I am a decent hacker - can crank out a simple MVP fairly quickly. I keep getting ideas and usually I start out with a lot of enthusiasm which begins petering out as I encounter technical difficulties or learning areas, or customer nonchalance. My question to those who have been at it, for quite some time. How do you maintain the enthusiasm for your projects esp when it&#x27;s not a bread-winner?')
