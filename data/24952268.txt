My GPS module was in simulate mode and wasn&#x27;t giving correct data to the feedback loop that needed it. In the absence of correctly changing data, a runaway effect took over.<p>It&#x27;s the same basic failure that crashed the 737 max.<p>When the feedback loop is broken in closed loop controls, failures like this happen.')
