They wouldn&#x27;t even give an advantage to the party they wound up with, they&#x27;d just compete for the same naturally occurring 50% of people.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;m in kind of a leftist bubble.  I find our typical factiousness endearing most of the time, but it probably skews my view.')
