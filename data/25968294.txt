The data is explicitly for the first dose and not the second. The paper also mentions the effect <i>starts</i> from day 18, not beforehand - maybe you should read it again.<p>What Maccabi did publish on the second dose, it was in a much more encouraging note. Granted, not a peer reviewed paper, that would be difficult given lack of time.<p>Claiming Yediot is parroting the government is delusional. I won&#x27;t belabor about it, since most HN readers deserve better than Israeli politics or the eternal elections.')
