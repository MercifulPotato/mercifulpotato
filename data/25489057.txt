Seems fine to me, but I think it would be funnier if a king in check could stay put, with the player in check betting that the opponent’s next move will end the check.<p>There also is the possibility of simultaneous checkmate.<p>Another edge case is pawns taking pieces. Could a pawn move diagonally into a square being vacated by the piece standing there? Could two pawns simultaneously not take out each other (say by the simultaneous moves d4×e5 and e5×d4)?')
