I was one of the first to identify children&#x27;s fiction author Robert Stanek as both a terrible writer and an Amazon astroturfer. My blog post about him was widely cited by other critics as they discovered the same things. Eventually this led to posts on a couple of his &quot;fan&quot; sites - almost certainly set up and most content written by Stanek himself - including my home address and accusations that I&#x27;m a child molester. He also tried sending me emails threatening legal action. Besides the claims being utterly fraudulent, the letters were so clearly fake that I replied telling him to piss off (in exactly so many words). With a little effort I succeeded in having the posts taken down, or at least made invisible to Google. The more generic attacks continued on and off for years, again as more people discovered the now-numerous accounts of his transgressions and re-triggered Stanek&#x27;s delusions about a cabal, but it has been at least a couple of years since the last one. Who knows, maybe he&#x27;ll try again now.<p>The point is that these kinds of revenge campaigns have been easy for a <i>long</i> time (my blog post was in 2003) and keep getting easier. Using Pinterest in this case seems like an interesting twist, since Google&#x27;s suspicious love for them is already a matter of some discussion. It&#x27;s also interesting that an NYT reporter takes a so-predictable swipe at Section 230 as part of the story. While I wouldn&#x27;t be in favor of holding platform providers responsible for users&#x27; content, I do think defamation deserves to be treated with at least the same seriousness as copyright violation, for which special provisions already exist.<p>P.S. I&#x27;m well aware that Stanek accuses <i>me</i> of being the defamer. Such reciprocal accusations are practically always a feature of these cases, including OP, and that should be kept in mind when considering them.')
