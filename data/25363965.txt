He&#x27;s their commander in chief, authorized by Congress to attack anyone or anything in the name of &quot;fighting terrorism&quot; with zero immediate accountability to anyone.  (And yes, as you suggest, this is a problem Congress created for itself.)<p>POTUS also has the ability to invoke something called the &quot;Insurrection Act,&quot; which effectively deploys the military on domestic soil for law-enforcement purposes.<p>Oh, and speaking of Federal law enforcement, that&#x27;s an executive branch function as well.<p><i>as much as the current occupant of the office would like them to have loyalty to him personally, they don&#x27;t</i><p>An idealistic perspective that isn&#x27;t always borne out by reality. [1]<p><i>still, Congress has given up too much control and needs to take it back</i><p>That&#x27;s for darned sure.
