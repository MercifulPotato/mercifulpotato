Just my two cents, but I think that&#x27;s missing the real point of this work.<p>It isn&#x27;t about whether Bazel is a better build system <i>for LLVM</i>. At least, that isn&#x27;t my motivation.<p>There are <i>users</i> of LLVM&#x27;s libraries that use Bazel. Whether for good or bad reasons, it is extremely useful to enable them to use LLVM&#x27;s libraries with a fully native Bazel build. That is my motivation: enabling the <i>users</i> of LLVM libraries that need to use Bazel for whatever reason to have the best possible experience.')
