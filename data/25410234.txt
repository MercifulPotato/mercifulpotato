Over in Kirkland we have some reasonably good bike lanes (some green, some not). Dooring is still a highly rational fear, though, and when I&#x27;m going past cars that are parked I slow down quite a bit and I presume that pretty much any car might contain a driver that&#x27;s opening a door without looking. Hugging the left side of the bike lane is also helpful.<p>The biggest lesson I had in my first season of commuting to work was &quot;TRUST NO-ONE&quot;. Do not trust cars to do what they are supposed to do under any circumstances. Do not assume that eye contact with drivers will affect their behavior. Do not assume that slow car speeds are safe speeds. Any given car can turn in front of you at any time, or flip open a door on any side.<p>I once had the <i>same guy</i> almost get me <i>twice</i> in a single commute. He didn&#x27;t mean to do it...just a very distracted driver.')
