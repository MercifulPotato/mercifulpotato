They had a similar clause regarding data protection issues - it basically said &quot;all your data is going to be sent to US servers and we&#x27;re going to do basically whatever we want with it and there&#x27;s nothing you can do to opt out. It&#x27;s your responsibility to let your customers know about it&quot;.<p>I told my boss that, while I was not a lawyer, in my opinion we simply could not sign that contract and provide a service without blatantly violating the then-recent GDPR. (We didn&#x27;t sign it, although I don&#x27;t know if that played a part.)<p>Chec seems to be using a similar approach? They&#x27;re running a B2B service which doesn&#x27;t provide analytics opt-out, and their B2C users are supposed to tell the customers &quot;hey, we can&#x27;t offer you an opt-out on data collection because it&#x27;s required to make the software platform work&quot; (except that you&#x27;re not required to run your store on Chec specifically, otherwise it would be a trivial method to bypass the GDPR).<p>Nonetheless, it&#x27;s inexcusable that the words &#x27;purpose&#x27; and &#x27;analytics&#x27; do not appear in that blog post. Those are essential aspects of the GDPR, and if you&#x27;re not explicitly stating that you won&#x27;t re-sell the collect data to third parties without the owner&#x27;s consent, I assume you do.')
