I’ve measured my traffic every month for the last 3 years. Some how, during December, I magically went over my 1.2TB cap for the first time (now that they are actually enforcing caps).<p>I checked my network and my data was 987gb. Well below the 1.2TB cap that Comcast said I went over.<p>Data caps are just atrocious behavior. Truly barbaric. I’m a hardcore capitalist, but I’m directly opposed to corruption, and that’s what cable and ISPs like Comcast are. Corrupt, archaic, welfare corporations that drain the soul out of society.')
