I have been playing with lots of niche languages but in the end I also find that focusing my learning elsewhere is usually a better idea. Even more, I don&#x27;t know many of the features of the languages I use although I have been working on rather tricky topics - from 3D viz to medical computer vision, low power device soft-realtime streaming deep learning inference ;) etc. and in decades of C++ I still only know the basics of metaprogramming (means standard template functions and classes). I am pretty dogmatic about RAII and similar but try to keep things simple. Even dropped most of the abstractions over time - sometimes 3 else ifs that then never change again are probably better than polymorphism, command pattern, lambda etc. stuff - at least you know what will be called there just by looking at the code.<p>Similarly I feel my Python code is getting simpler and simpler over time.<p>I&#x27;d probably even gravitate towards Go at some point nur there I do muss a few things.<p>I usually find the pay off is just better when I rather learn more about deep learning, statistics, domain knowledge, security, visualization or stuff like AWS, Kubernetes, Unity etc.<p>The language ends up to be a very small piece and usually more important to have the ecosystem and community available. Like Julia also does not solve the 2 language problem for me but leads to a 3 language problem.')
