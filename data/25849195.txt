Item(by='loeg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611163898, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25837616, text='Seattle protesters were unarmed and getting tear gassed by SPD for a solid month before SPD decided to just leave the East Precinct on their own.  &quot;Armed protectors took over gov. buildings and city blocks&quot; is just completely false.  After SPD left, some people put up some signs and blockades and that&#x27;s about it.<p>SPD is an arm of executive branch of the municipal government.  Again, SPD was beating and gassing protesters (and the entire neighborhood — gas spreads) for a solid month.  That is the city&#x27;s clear policy on protests against police brutality — bash the protesters until they stop protesting.  Outside of maybe Sawant, who is a weirdo, no city official promoted, condoned, or &quot;excused&quot; SPD leaving the east precinct.<p>Lots of violence and murder: your implication is that the handful of shootings in cap hill while SPD were out of the precinct were caused by CHOP&#x2F;CHAZ, but correlation isn&#x27;t causation.  (And N is also pretty small.)  Outside of the handful of shootings, there was only increased violence in Cap hill after the cops left if you don&#x27;t count violence by cops.')
