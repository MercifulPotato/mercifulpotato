Nothing worse than a playing a game no one understands and ruining the fun. :(<p>So, rocketcrab opens games in iframes, so techincally I could have a mode where it would open four or so iframes on your screen to demo a game. The problem is that this would not work for many of the games as they rely on cookies&#x2F;local storage that would be messed up with multiple iframes.<p>You could also just try opening rocketcrab as is in multiple tabs, but you&#x27;d run into the same issue with some games. Best you could do is open Chrome, Firefox, Safari&#x2F;Edge, and your phone to get 4 players xD<p>Ultimately, my plan is to add screenshots of each game. Kind of like the App Store. I&#x27;ve been slacking on doing it for more games cause it&#x27;s a lot of work, but here&#x27;s an example:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rocketcrab.com&#x2F;game&#x2F;drawphone" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rocketcrab.com&#x2F;game&#x2F;drawphone</a><p>Otherwise, developers are free to add their own demo mode (Drawphone has this!)')
