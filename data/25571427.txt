I&#x27;m not trying to argue to stop anyone doing it, but I would really like to understand it better.<p>Many video games are essentially simulators of things that we&#x27;re prevented from doing in reality, because of the laws of nature or society. Whether that&#x27;s dropping blocks into place, building a city, chasing and eating ghosts, flying a plane, performing magic spells, or engaging in physical violence.<p>And there&#x27;s a never-ending push to make experiences more photorealistic, to make simulator even better. From that I can only conclude that people want to get as close to the experience of perfoming the prevented act as possible.<p>Chopping someone up is heavily frowned upon in real life, but perfectly acceptable to emulate in someone&#x27;s living room. Somehow the simulation escapes the taboo. And that escape seems to be absolute: In the range of violent acts you could commit, from a gentle nudge to grisly murder, simulation of the most extreme extent is permitted.<p>But if that&#x27;s the case, why is the realistic simulation of some societal taboos (e.g. physical violence to the point of murder) mainstream, but others (e.g. sexual violence in any of its forms) not? They are both very serious offences, but somehow one gets a free pass to let anyone pretend to do it, but the other not.<p>Is it a reflection on the ultimate limits of those taboos in the society that produces most of these games? Or is my logic broken somewhere?')
