No. That&#x27;s not how it works. You don&#x27;t just magically wish demand into existence.<p>You&#x27;ve already transformed the neighborhood by putting almost no barriers on commercial real estate. The demand you are so scared of is already there. That commercial real estate produces a massive surplus of jobs because there is not enough housing. That&#x27;s where all the demand is coming from. If you really, really wanted to solve this problem on the demand side you would have prevented commercial real estate development. Nobody is proposing that. Local people are proposing that residential construction should be prevented and then they hate on the people they built offices for, because they had the audacity to work there.')
