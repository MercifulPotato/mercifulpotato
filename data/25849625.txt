My job is to develop and ship software to customers that used to run Ubuntu, CentOS, and sometimes RHEL. To compile&#x2F;build&#x2F;package that software we use docker containers, which provide nice isolation and hygiene and also guarantee user-space ABI compatibility to the target system. What I&#x27;d like to know: How can I user containers to develop for RHEL now? Is there some &quot;short-lived&quot; clause I could depend on or do I have to buy a license for every container I might want to spin up?')
