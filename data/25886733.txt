The things that can make or break satisfaction are to me:<p>- coworkers, clients, and the political environment. This is <i>completely independent</i> of the technology and project requirements. As a consultant I did very different projects with the same co-workers.<p>- iteration and debuggability. The best for this, for me, is C# in Visual Studio. GDB is an acceptable substitute for the C family. Web applications .. the browser is OK, but now your app is always and forever in two pieces, and you can&#x27;t cross-stacktrace. Many embedded environments are bad at this; you may find breakpoint debugging <i>and</i> printf debugging are both impossible. Or you have to do an Elon Musk and recreate the crash cause from the smoking debris field.<p>- fundamentally interesting problem <i>and</i> ownership of work. This can be tricky, but when you get to do things your way and produce great results that can be very satisfying. Again, completely independent of language; depends what impresses you and your circle.<p>Do you want something you can talk about at parties? I met the last surviving maintainer of the Aston Martin Lagonda&#x27;s bonkers 1980s CRT-based 6V digital logic dashboard.<p>I have only a very few times got to choose the language for a new project, or indeed start a new greenfield project at all.')
