Moths seem to have a wide variety of wing patterns and heavily rely on them for camouflage and mimicry (like when eyes are mimicked). Maybe the genes related to wing surfaces reduced in number over time, making wings more sensitive to mutation and variation. Kind of like increasing the wing learning rate at an evolutionary level.<p>That could increase the odds that they&#x27;d eventually stumble upon things like this anti-sonar texturing, and that more advanced versions of it would start to appear. Maybe it could also have a role in the infamous peppered moth&#x2F;pollution story.<p>And by contrast, maybe nature would also select for extreme resiliency of critical genes, like ones related to heart function and efficiency of resource use, so that they&#x27;d be less sensitive to generational variation.<p>I&#x27;m sure this could all still be explained even without that, but it&#x27;s interesting to think about.')
