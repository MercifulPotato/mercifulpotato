Those interrupts can cause a domino effect with Windows doing god-knows what else in the background, leading to a stutter.<p>You&#x27;re right though, PCs will get brute-force faster, while devs will squeeze more out of consoles. I just find it hard to make the case for building something right now given the apparent bang-for-the-buck of these consoles. That said, I do kinda need a new Plex server... :)')
