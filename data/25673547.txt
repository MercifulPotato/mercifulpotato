The result of Kavanaugh protests? 128 people arrested.<p>You&#x27;re comparing that with a mob of people who violently clashed with the police outside the Capitol, then stormed inside, broke windows, climbed the walls, sat inside offices with their feet up on desks, walked away with &quot;souvenirs&quot;, and planted IEDs. The result of that? 13 arrests.<p>Can you please explain why your comparison is not disingenuous?')
