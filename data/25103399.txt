This just stinks of doing things the old way in cargo cult like fashion. This whole approach, some development in email, some on the web, and some on a disused IRC channel is exactly why projects like Cairo suffer from lack of contributions. Do people really want to deal with text patches in 2020? I appreciate the back-to-basics approach and aesthetics, but srht just seems to be throwing out the baby with the bathwater.')
