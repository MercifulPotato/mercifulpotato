I get distracted by anything and don&#x27;t push the code for a few hours.<p>I come back and push the code. CI picks it up and runs a docker-compose build and pushes the image to a container registry, then my production server pulls that image.<p>With this work flow there&#x27;s no guarantee that I&#x27;m going to get the same dependencies of dependencies in dev vs prod, even with using Docker. During those few hours before I pushed, a dep of a dep could have been updated so now CI is different than dev. Tests will hopefully ensure the app doesn&#x27;t break because of that, but ultimately it boils down to not being able to depend on version guarantees with Docker alone.<p>There&#x27;s also the issue of having multiple developers. Without a lock file, dev A and B could end up with having different local dependency versions when they build their own copy of the image.<p>I&#x27;ve seen these types of issues happen all the time with Flask development. For example Flask doesn&#x27;t restrict Werkzeug versions, so you wake up one day and rebuild your image locally because you changed an unrelated dependency and suddenly your app breaks because you had Werkzeug 0.9.x but 1.x was released and you forgot to define and pin Werkzeug in your requirements.txt because you assumed Flask would have. The same can be said with SQLAlchemy because it&#x27;s easy to forget to define and pin that because you brought in and pinned Flask-SQLAlchemy but Flask-SQLAlchemy doesn&#x27;t restrict SQLAlchemy versions.<p>Long story short, a lock file is super important with or without Docker.')
