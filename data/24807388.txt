I do rather strongly disagree with your example as being relevant, but I think you&#x27;ve made a lot of good, relevant points. Your example of stimulus being a gift is incorrect. We explicitly pay into social programs as a society with full expectation that those funds will be used to help us.  Stimulus isn&#x27;t a gift.')
