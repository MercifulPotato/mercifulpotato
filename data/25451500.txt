Where are you seeing that it&#x27;s not faster? This article is from &#x27;18 so perhaps there has been a change in how well AMP performs versus the baseline.<p>Also worth noting that we should probably judge AMP as a whole product. What if it didn&#x27;t make things faster at all, but did make them predictable and amenable to prerendering? The product is AMP+Cache+Prerendering. Prerendering unquestionably gives huge speed advantages in many scenarios. If you don&#x27;t have AMP, you don&#x27;t have prerendering, which means AMP-as-a-product gives significant speed advantages, since it&#x27;s on the critical path to prerendering. (All of this is of course predicated on the idea that you can&#x27;t practically prerender normal HTML pages, which perhaps you can, I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m just saying if that justification for AMP is correct, it shouldn&#x27;t necessarily matter that HTML+AMP markup is not faster than HTML markup.)')
