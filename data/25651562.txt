Their internal boot ROM? Their microcode? :-)<p>What I&#x27;m trying to say there is, there is always a line. There is always some secret sauce. Even if you have fully open HDL, you won&#x27;t have documentation for the proprietary fab processes required to implement it in a way that performs. Even if the fab process were somehow fully open, you may not have public documentation on how to manufacture some of the required chemicals and raw materials available. And so on and so forth. The rabbit hole always goes deeper, and the lines between parts aren&#x27;t entirely bright, and so making some kind of blanket statement that one is &quot;fully open&quot; is usually a marketing tactic and not actually truthful.<p>That said, yes, Raptor stuff is pretty much as open as it gets, today, in the high-end space. They are pretty much the only modern platform which doesn&#x27;t use blobs to train RAM on boot, for example. They are not perfect - for example, their motherboard schematics are only available to owners, so I assume they are not redistributable under an open hardware license.')
