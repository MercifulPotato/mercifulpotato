If the reward function is made to compare traffic patterns of the simulation vs real life, then eventually the RL model (a combination of agents) should converge to how humans drive.<p>So you would have various transition probabilities of a car driver moving from an attentive state into various inattentive states, with drivers having different reactions in each state.<p>It would also help to have a level of &quot;variance&quot; in individual drivers. So instead of having a bunch of drivers who are just as likely to make mistakes, you have some who transition far more easily into inattentiveness and some whose likelihood of damage&#x2F;nuisance is higher than the standard driver when inattentive.<p>It seems entirely doable.
