The problem appears to be the android &quot;server&quot;, not the connection (or perhaps android bundles its network traffic and turns off the modem periodically to save power?)  Regardless, messages get delayed, frequently, especially if you haven&#x27;t touched your phone for a while.  The desktop client notifying me that my idle phone isn&#x27;t actively using the internet at the moment (something that merely saves power and is otherwise completely harmless, and essentially unobservable) is useless.  I don&#x27;t mind it telling me that the <i>computer</i> has no connection, but that&#x27;s not what happens.<p>As to the &quot;only one client is a feature&quot; thing - it isn&#x27;t for me.  And if I didn&#x27;t quite trust any others using my devices, chats aren&#x27;t near the top of my priority list - if they have access to all my browsers cookies, and apps, and can change system settings etc etc etc I&#x27;m much more worried they&#x27;ll accidentally install malware than anything else.  Don&#x27;t share your account if you care for privacy, it&#x27;s a losing game.<p>I use multiple devices at a time, merely locking them.  I don&#x27;t want to also have all my apps go into an pseudo shutdown; and it&#x27;s annoying to not be able to read old stuff during a temporary network hiccup.')
