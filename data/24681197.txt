Item(by='ivalm', descendants=None, kids=[24681975], score=None, time=1601836500, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24680778, text='I think your post comes from a non-academic viewpoint.<p>A research prof’s concerns are about research, their scientific progeny (phd students and postdocs) and pressures to succeed in the related publish or perish&#x2F;grant writing games. In this context the blog makes perfect sense and I agree with it. However, you write:<p>&gt;Athletes getting easy courses<p>A prof doesn’t care about athletic admissions (those are undergrads anyways?).<p>&gt;there are ridiculous projects, bias, and people getting paid in “non-standard” ways.<p>I am not sure what you mean about “ridiculous projects”? The university generally doesn’t control or fund a PI. Funding is nearly  always external (in the US).<p>&gt;Backroom deals with private industry and government.<p>I am not exactly sure whose research or publications this affects but I bet the number is tiny. This is not a concern I’ve actually ever seen play out in real life (again, I am sure you can find news where it happened, but it just doesn’t reflect the lived life of most PIs).<p>&gt;Universities should work more with private industry like they used to many years ago, government money should be poured into research more openly,<p>I mean, I don’t think PIs are against working with industry, but industry usually wants IP, doesn’t want to publish, and wants RoI. The government funding process is already pretty open (at least NSF&#x2F;NIH) but of course can be improved.<p>&gt;tuition needs to rise, then they can hire the best from private industry that are also excellent teachers or researchers.<p>Most PIs are funded effectively from research grant overhead. Tuition is usually a smaller budget line. Increasing tuition will both not overall increase budget by much and add hardship to students. I do agree that more gov funding would be nice.<p>&gt;To do that, administrations and staff will need to be gutted<p>I don’t think this follows from your previous statements but I do agree there is an explosion in administrative overhead that should be curtailed.')
