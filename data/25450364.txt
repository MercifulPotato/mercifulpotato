When we were kids in the 80s, we bicycled to school. My parents heard about bike helmets (which were pretty new at that time) and bought them for us. I kept mine on the back rack, because I thought they were utterly uncool.<p>Then one day, a guy wasn&#x27;t paying attention, ran a stop-sign at high speed when we were still in the intersection, and hit my sister&#x27;s bike&#x27;s front wheel. There was no way she could have gotten out of his way.<p>I can still hear the <i>THWACK</i> of her helmet hitting the pavement. The helmet did its job, and absorbed the impact by cracking. She got out of the experience with a few days of pain.<p>I&#x27;ve always worn a helmet after that.')
