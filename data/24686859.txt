In my experience, there&#x27;s nothing worse than looking for when a value was changed from 10 to 100, and finding it in a &quot;Merged from X&quot; commit with the history of why the value was changed from 10 to 100.<p>I don&#x27;t often (ever?) browse the history, but I _do_ regularly search the history using tooling, (git log | grep &lt;something&gt;), and more is more in that case, even if the history isn&#x27;t perfect.')
