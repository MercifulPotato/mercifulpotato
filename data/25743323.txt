Instead, oppose them with your own, better speech.  That way you don&#x27;t give them the validation of making you look too afraid to let them be heard, and you haven&#x27;t set the precedent of banning political speech you don&#x27;t like.<p>If you can&#x27;t allow an idea to be expressed, you are admitting that idea will overcome your ideas if it is heard. Can you really say that about the ideas that led to the Capitol fiasco?  I hope not.')
