I didn&#x27;t get the budget for a system administrator, and I spent all my budget on developers that could build our application and automate our preprocessing, overlooked system administration skills. So besides the DoE, managing 3 small teams and being the lead developer, I also am the system administrator.<p>So no fancy answer, our 3D experts got TeamViewer access to the nodes running Windows Pro. Sometimes our renders fail on patch Tuesday because I forgot to reapply the no-reboot hack.<p>We&#x27;re professionalizing now at 12 nodes, we got to the point where the 3D experts don&#x27;t need to TeamViewer in, so we&#x27;re swapping them to headless Linux. No idea on the update management yet, but they&#x27;re clean nodes running Ubuntu server.')
