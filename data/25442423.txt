Their developer experience is incredibly friendly and they&#x27;ve contributed extremely useful libraries to open-source, including micro and next.js. I&#x27;ve had great support experiences for some serious issues like platform bugs. They&#x27;re in a tough position because the serverless paradigm is still foreign to many people, and many typical project dependencies won&#x27;t operate in a serverless environment.<p>I have a set of critiques just like any infrastructure user, but by and large Vercel is moving in the right direction and I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing them succeed!<p>[1] My bill running CollegeAI.com on Kubernetes went from $600&#x2F;mo to $20&#x2F;mo with Vercel. It required a large refactor to serverless and the initial week of deployment the performance was so much better I got a massive traffic spike that increased my traffic from tens to thousands of daily signups. The bill that month was over $1000 because I didn&#x27;t have the serverless parameters set up totally correctly.')
