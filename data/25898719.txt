Item(by='dvt', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611545451, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25895996, text='I don&#x27;t mean to be the typical &quot;stick-in-the-mud&quot; HN poster here, but the concept of &quot;proof mechanisms&quot; is absolute nonsense. Anything can be a proof mechanism, and therefore nothing is. See that Benz? It&#x27;s proof that she&#x27;s got money. See that guy&#x27;s biceps? It&#x27;s proof that he lifts heavy weights. See my clean apartment? It&#x27;s proof that I just spent 4 hours cleaning it.<p>&quot;Proof mechanisms&quot; are vacuous. It would be more interesting to see why some social networks nail building feedback loops that give us that sweet dopamine hit and compel us to come back for more (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook) and why others suck at it (Google+, MySpace)')
