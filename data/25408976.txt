The odds of that happening would be crazy low for an individual user. However, if you deploy the same generator for a billion people it could realistically happen, and you might want to filter against outputs like that. Of course if all passwords are autogenerated (users cannot choose), the attacker gains no advantage from choosing &quot;password&quot; instead of &quot;tlnNHJ4x&quot;.')
