Companies buy other companies to get so big, they are too big to fail, they have money to &quot;optimise&quot; taxes, lobby politicians to introduce barriers to entry for the competition and then gather personal data to be able to manipulate people and extract as much value as possible off of them. I think this is where we need strong regulation. Companies should not be allowed to buy other companies if there is no legitimate need for that.')
