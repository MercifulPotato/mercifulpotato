Nobody questions it, I don&#x27;t know why. I guess the school thinks it&#x27;s useful to be associated with some future leaders?<p>The thing is leadership ought to be like you say. Some kind of competence that allows you to help a group of people complete some kind of task.<p>But let&#x27;s be honest. The kids want to be student council president because it&#x27;s prestigious. They grow up and then they want to be CEO because it&#x27;s prestigious and well paying. They pay lip service to the idea of helping a team, but really, we know they don&#x27;t care all that much. It&#x27;s ass backwards, people want to be leaders because {prize} and then they think about how to get there. Sometimes we get lucky and they conclude that they need to climb the ladder by being competent (this fails a lot due to pyramid structures and politics), but often they just figure out that to seem competent, you have to shout a lot about how competent you are.')
