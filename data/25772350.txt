He had failed a test necessary to even see data collected under Section 702, so he couldn&#x27;t so much as see the data that PRISM ingested. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;mb9mza&#x2F;exclusive-snowden-tried-to-tell-nsa-about-his-concerns" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.vice.com&#x2F;en&#x2F;article&#x2F;mb9mza&#x2F;exclusive-snowden-tri...</a><p>&gt; and the claim is that the data can be requested as long as the individual is suspected, which can be for something as frivolous as a ML look-alike match on traffic patterns.<p>No. It goes through the normal court order process where the company will push back if it isn&#x27;t legit. Section 702 court orders can only request data for non-Americans outside the US, and the company that gets the order will have a good idea of whether this is true for a particular account.<p>&gt; Also the key piece of the reporting was on the abuse of the Patriot’s act.<p>The <i>only</i> illegal US program that they exposed was phone metadata collection. The pair of illiterates thought that PRISM was something supremely sinister (that anybody with the most rudimentary computing and reading skills can easily figure out it isn&#x27;t), so they hyped that story a lot. People corrected Greenwald on Twitter on day one, but it took years for him to understand how much he botched that story, and his ego prevented him from issuing a correction. Instead, he just stopped talking about it and now only ever mentions phone metadata.  <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greenwald.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-case-for-a-pardon-of-edward-snowden" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;greenwald.substack.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;the-case-for-a-pardon-of-ed...</a>')
