We couldn&#x27;t release the dos code because of a copyrighted sound library we used (wow, was that a mistake -- I write my own sound code now), and I honestly don&#x27;t even know what happened to the port that microsoft did to windows.<p>This isn&#x27;t always a true dichotomy. Any code is better than none, you don&#x27;t have to release <i>all</i> of it to make a difference (especially if the closed-source library is provided as a shared object). The code could be provided in a non-functionning state, it would already be a lot more helpful than binary patching while relying on disassemblers. A closed-source library can be worked around (stripping functionality), replaced, re-implemented, linked against a blob, reverse-engineered, etc.')
