This is an expedient account of Lisp by way of real examples geared toward programmers and scientists. The examples showcase real Common Lisp code, and it&#x27;s not expected the unfamiliar reader understand every intricacy. I decided not to pursue much detail about the grand, rich, and dramatic history of Lisp---which could fill an entertaining book unto itself. My writing is loosely based on a presentation of the same title I gave at Rigetti Computing in 2016, in which I justified the growing use of Common Lisp for critical projects. This essay is not a tutorial, it&#x27;s a pitch.</i>')
