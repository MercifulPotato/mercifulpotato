I don&#x27;t care if I still have good hearing at 8khz, my left ear hears up to 16k, and my right ear barely registers at 10, yet no is not testing for you if you&#x27;re a musician. And ever had an ENT condescendingly tell you &quot;you can still hear about the same as a normal person, what&#x27;s the problem?&quot; while smugly writing you a free hearing test?<p>And no one&#x27;s going to actually figure out treatment, because there&#x27;s no money in it.')
