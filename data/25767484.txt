And those require trusting organizations that lots of people don&#x27;t want to trust. We don&#x27;t have an equivalent system for individuals. There is no trivial push-button key verification process for peer-to-peer communications. Key signing parties suck and never worked. Key validation for things like Signal is nicely automated if you are physically near the other person. But beyond that it is tricky.<p>It is hard enough to get my parents to use a secure messenger. If I told them they needed to do a key verification process for every person they ever communicate with... they&#x27;d just go back to facebook messenger or sms.<p>I think it is completely reasonable for somebody to say &quot;I don&#x27;t care enough to worry about validating public keys&quot; while also educating people like journalists about how to do that correctly.')
