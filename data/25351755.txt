Which takes us to the last point: absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Just because all the of the studies about Q-Tips are low quality doesn&#x27;t mean a better study would find something different. We don&#x27;t know the answer to that, and that would be a big assumption to make.<p>So, sometimes the best available evidence is not statistically ironclad. It falls on us to use a reasonable approach about how hard a line to take. Some do a better job than others.<p>That was long and rambling, but hopefully it helps to clarify some misconceptions. As an applied science, we have to go with the data we&#x27;ve got, which is almost always not an ideal fit for the patient in front of us.')
