It matters when you say &quot;Hi&quot; to someone. Differently timed &quot;Hi&quot;&#x27;s can say different things. Even if you repeat &quot;Hi&quot; many times, it&#x27;s still just &quot;Hi&quot; but the amount of them also matters and becomes part of the transmission when looking at all of them together.<p>I feel like many, especially developers, fail to see what is in between the data to matter as well as the data itself.
