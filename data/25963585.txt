Forcing an open API would immediately create the opportunity for people to offer competing clients for any Apple (or Facebook etc) service, drive down costs, produce new ways to interact with the services of large companies and so on, it would immediately unlock the ability of countless of independent creators to produce new products.<p>In fact if you were to open up Facebook, Apple&#x27;s apis and so on and turned them into open protocols you would not even necessarily need invasive privacy regulation, people could just build a privacy respecting Facebook client that lets people interact with the service in a way <i>they</i> want, getting an algorithm free news feed if they want, stripping out baggage they don&#x27;t need. It would solve a large majority of the exact issues that we have with large tech companies.<p>Apple does hold a monopoly over all Apple users, which gives them market power the same way a monopolistic company in a larger market exercises power. It&#x27;s actually straight up depressing for someone to say &quot;well I benefit from the walled garden&quot;. It&#x27;s no different than someone saying &quot;I like the oligarch because he treats <i>me</i> nicely&quot;')
