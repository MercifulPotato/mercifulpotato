Local file I&#x2F;O are often not exposed with asynchronous APIs (yes I know it&#x27;s changing on linux quickly). But what about locks? Let&#x27;s say you want a tread safe queue, how do you wake up the right function when the mutex is unlocked? I suspect this is the reason of all this complexity.')
