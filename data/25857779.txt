Previously, I had used a blade grinder but the problem with those is that they do not &quot;grind&quot; the coffee evenly (produce a mixture of fine and coarse particles).<p>I can&#x27;t compare the De&#x27;Longhi with any other burr grinder but the results are similar to those of the shop that I get my coffee from. Its one downside is that the minimum grind quantity is too much coffee for one person so I try to time it for when my wife will share the coffee with me. The whole point of grinding your own is that you can then brew the coffee at its freshest.<p>So far, I&#x27;ve been enjoying the results of having freshly ground coffee. Best of luck with your own grinding.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.delonghi.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;products&#x2F;coffee-and-espresso&#x2F;coffee-makers&#x2F;grinders&#x2F;kg89-0177111020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.delonghi.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;products&#x2F;coffee-and-espresso&#x2F;...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Burr_mill" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Burr_mill</a>')
