Many are lonely on the internet, trapped in student loans, and searching for decent jobs. On average they are having to postpone leaving their parents houses, getting married, having kids and buying a house, waiting to do these things until significantly later in life than their parents and grandparents. They&#x27;ve heard about the American Dream and don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;ll have it. And there&#x27;s a lot of them.<p>I know that this is not true for everybody, lots of things are better, and it&#x27;s relative - other people have it worse, etc. But this sentiment is still a thing - a lot of young people feel like they have it worse than their parents and grandparents.<p>I don&#x27;t know that debating the details will change their minds.')
