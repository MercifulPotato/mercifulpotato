But the instance and people involved are largely irrelevant; it&#x27;s merely the illustration of a point that will become more and more pronounced as more people realize this power. And it&#x27;ll be confounded by the fact that no company can be fully up to date with the local foibles of country X and their issues that the company must now decide the truth of and censor whomever they believe to be the bad actors (yeah, good luck!).<p>Although social media companies have allowed more of us to broadcast to an unprecedentedly large audience, we&#x27;re not actually ready for the Pandora&#x27;s box this opens in terms of free speech, corporate rights and obligations, and national sovereignty. The near-term solution will be selective censorship by companies and blocking by governments unhappy with the censorship choices (for both good and bad reasons). But as the decade drags on, we&#x27;ll be forced to recognize our lack of psychological adaptability to this kind of influential power that can destabilize societies to such a degree (by individual, group, AND state actors), and try to come up with a least-worst solution that we&#x27;re probably not going to like.<p>It&#x27;s not like this is completely new; larger countries with information dissemination advantages have used that power to destabilize smaller countries for centuries, most recently in South America and the Middle East.
