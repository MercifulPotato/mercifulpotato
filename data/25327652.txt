Item(by='bbarnett', descendants=None, kids=[25327957], score=None, time=1607297021, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25327420, text='Your ID is most certainly secret.  There are acts all over the world, protecting Personal Identifiable Information (Pii).  ID, as it includes things like name, address, sex, height, weight, age, eye colour, signature, falls under a variety of legislations.<p>My ID is <i>not</i> having any of the things you said, done.  Not <i>legally</i>.  It is illegal where I live, for companies, or persons, to share PII without permission.  And even if permission is granted, there are massive restrictions on how to store it, share it, and so on.<p>My ID is seen as &quot;a secret to be kept&quot; by the state.  Laws exist for the purpose of keeping it as secret as possible.<p>Due to all of these laws, ID is not asked for, at least where I live, in the bizarre fashion it seems to be asked for, where ever you live.  For example, when I open a bank account, the banking rep does ask for my ID, look at my ID, and... return it!<p>No copying, cloning, scanning, or even writing down the number!<p>Why would they?  The purpose of ID is to show &quot;Yeah, this guy is who he claims to be&quot;, and that&#x27;s it.  Purpose over.<p>Once done, the bank issues me ID to use with it, and its services.  My bank card.<p>And remembering ID?  Who would I even be sharing my ID with?  I&#x27;ve gone <i>years</i> without pulling it out of my pocket.  Why do I need it?  For whom?  When?<p>Regardless, your last paragraph isn&#x27;t relevant.  You&#x27;re discussing someone pulling an illegal act, compared to my desire to <i>reduce the probability</i> of an illegal act happening.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much left to say here.  You seem to want to ignore all differences of scale and scope, and just pretend that things with different risk factors, are 100% identical.')
