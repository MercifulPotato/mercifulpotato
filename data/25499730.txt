I&#x27;ll give an example from the google feed on my phone, now. Some article on zdnet about RedHat discontinuing CentOS in favor of stream.<p>If I open the AMP link [0] in Firefox and measure the bandwidth used, it&#x27;s around 685 kilobytes transferred in 1.32 seconds. The original article transfers almost 3.6 megabytes over 3.89 seconds, with the page taking almost 9 seconds total to load in, vs only 1.43 seconds total on the AMP page.<p>This is on my residential internet on an 8 core, 32 thread POWER9 workstation. My internet isn&#x27;t great, but it&#x27;s a heck of a lot better than the 15-40 kb&#x2F;s I got overseas. There, that full page would take almost 2 whole minutes to load, versus only 20 seconds.<p>Obviously, there&#x27;s more to this -- the non-AMP page loads its text before the other elements, so it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;d have to wait the entire 2 minutes to begin reading. And beyond the technology, there are other reasons to not use AMP.<p>But suggesting we shouldn&#x27;t use AMP because it&#x27;s bad technology or broken isn&#x27;t really telling the whole story. There are plenty of people who will get much better experiences with AMP than whatever fat pages would otherwise get shoved their way.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t become dependent on google for this, but we also shouldn&#x27;t pretend like there isn&#x27;t a need for AMP, at least for some people.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-zdnet-com.cdn.ampproject.org&#x2F;v&#x2F;s&#x2F;www.zdnet.com&#x2F;google-amp&#x2F;article&#x2F;why-red-hat-dumped-centos-for-centos-stream&#x2F;?amp_gsa=1&amp;amp_js_v=a6&amp;usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D#ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zdnet.com%2Farticle%2Fwhy-red-hat-dumped-centos-for-centos-stream%2F" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www-zdnet-com.cdn.ampproject.org&#x2F;v&#x2F;s&#x2F;www.zdnet.com&#x2F;g...</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zdnet.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;why-red-hat-dumped-centos-for-centos-stream&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.zdnet.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;why-red-hat-dumped-centos-for-...</a>')
