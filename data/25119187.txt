In Europe, Asia and Australia I have always found AirBNB more expensive than hotels which incidentally waste less of your time, have better signage and access, and can provide value-added services like multiple contactless keys, key replacement, waste disposal, laundry, holding luggage and local recommendations. Oh, and they support three sometimes-killer features: payment on arrival, cash, and pre-inspection of rooms.')
