Item(by='rob74', descendants=None, kids=[24836654, 24836467], score=None, time=1603195886, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24836281, text='This reminds me of the (by now) old saying that code is more often read than written - sure, you&#x27;re not forced to write macros, but if you use macros (or more exotic features), you force the developers who read your code to become familiar with (possibly arcane) features that they maybe would have never used (or needed). That&#x27;s why I think Go&#x27;s approach to not try to be &quot;everybody&#x27;s darling&quot; by implementing every conceivable feature is commendable (even if mentioning this in a Rust-related thread will get me downvoted again).')
