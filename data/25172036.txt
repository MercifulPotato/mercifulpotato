It was difficult at first, but now I can weld steel, aluminum, and stainless and it usually doesn&#x27;t look like crap. It&#x27;s very fun.<p>Then last year at 49 switched from right handed to left handed guitar since I&#x27;m left handed and was never very good right handed. I&#x27;ve been practicing every day for at least an hour for 11 months now and enjoy it a lot.')
