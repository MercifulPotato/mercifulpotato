Stuffing something like Tomcat into a Docker container is trick, you risk having your application crash, but Docker doesn’t handle it, because the Tomcat process is still running. You also see people use different supervisor processes to have multiple application in one container, e.g. a uwsgi app and nginx in one container, while that should be two seperate containers.')
