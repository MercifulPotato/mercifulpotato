This means you should not connect any external drives &#x2F; USB sticks on this hub, due to data corruption risks. This is a known issue without any workarounds as far as I am aware. Just a minor annoyance if you are aware of it, but I have lost data to this so please be aware of that risk.<p>The monitor is otherwise pretty good, with decent latency and color accuracy in SDR mode. HDR mode is not good (which is expected for standard LED backlighting without local dimming), so don&#x27;t forget to turn OFF HDR in the display settings of your computer. Image quality is way better in SDR.<p>Edit: latency and VFR (freesync &#x2F; g-sync) is also decent on this monitor, despite not being marketed for gaming.')
