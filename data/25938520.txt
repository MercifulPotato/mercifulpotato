College is a level of education and a university provides that level of education. One alternative to a college education is what&#x27;s called a &quot;technical school&quot;, and you&#x27;re right, the submitter probably doesn&#x27;t need a technical school.<p>(To add to the fun, there are also community colleges, state colleges, and private colleges, all of which provide a college education but on a smaller campus than a university. Universities are generally quite large.)')
