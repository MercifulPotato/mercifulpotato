Item(by='manfredo', descendants=None, kids=[25390100], score=None, time=1607715613, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25389155, text='Storage costs, despite being in freefall still are still in the hundreds of dollars per kilowatt hour range. And it&#x27;s kind of moot since the total amount of storage produced globally is still a fraction of what is necessary to make renewables feasible as a primary source of power. To put this in perspective, the US alone consumes about 500 GWh of electricity every hour. The entire <i>world</i> produces about 300 GWh of lithium ion batteries every year. It&#x27;s dubious whether electrochemical storage will ever be able to match the requires scale, hence why a lot of renewable proponents turn to experimental solutions like the Sabatier process, hydrogen storage, or things like cranes lifting weights.')
