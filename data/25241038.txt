The one thing I always hated about wikipedias .zim files is that they&#x27;re not really a standard I can use elsewhere. Although I&#x27;m having trouble understanding the sorting structure with just one json file I&#x27;m looking at. I realize it&#x27;s sorting by the ID, but is that just simply based off of when the ID in wikipedia was created?<p>However, I think the json file is extraordinarily nice to have because it&#x27;s all of wikipedia in just a simple text format. If we could get wikipedia as an entire package with all the html, css, javascript but capable of being run locally, I think that would be an amazing game changer using wikipedia offline, especially on a pi! While kiwix &quot;works&quot; in some ways, it also has some major issues that makes using it such a pain. I&#x27;d like for wikipedia to be just a completely source of data and information that I could search and pull up just even a basic html file and read that article from looking it up just in my own directory.<p>Overall though this is a super cool project!')
