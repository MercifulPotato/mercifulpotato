Item(by='dvtrn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609013045, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25545905, text='I recently upgraded displays to a widescreen 4k display, and &quot;OLED burn-in&quot; was something I routinely came across while shopping around (not that I was in the market for OLED specifically because OLED, but more just &quot;seeing what&#x27;s out there&quot; in that spec). Ended up settling on an Acer Nitro because it was on sale at my local Microcenter. Has done it&#x27;s job quite well for me--but I&#x27;m also one of kinds of people who buys a thing and uses it until the screws are falling out before upgrading and otherwise considers good enough, heh.<p>Appreciate the knowledge share, though!')
