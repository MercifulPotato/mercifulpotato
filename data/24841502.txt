Because MIT had so many IP addresses they didn&#x27;t need to use a NAT. Everyone connecting over wifi got a real world 18.* IP address.<p>It also made network architecture easy. Every MIT building got its own B class subnet.  Hilariously, even the MIT boat house which couldn&#x27;t have had more than a dozen computers online at once had 65,534 addresses.  It made it very easy to find out which building someone was in based on their IP.')
