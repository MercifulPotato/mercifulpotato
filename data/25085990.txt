I started hosting my own code at gopherworks.io if you want to see what that roughly looks like.<p>My idea is that, as I said, I can&#x27;t stop the DMCA train but it&#x27;s a whole lot harder to take on thousands of small Giteas and SourceHuts than it is to open a pull request on GitHub. We can get the meta-wins of GitHub later by designing some aggregators that talk to Gitea and SourceHut in efficient ways in the future, but for now the pressing matter is to decentralize code hosting, in my view.')
