It&#x27;s a bit more expensive at $50&#x2F;year&#x2F;user (about $4.17&#x2F;month), but you get 25GB of combined mail and file storage, contact&#x2F;calendar&#x2F;note syncing, simple static web hosting that&#x27;s good in a pinch, a very nice web front end, and superb customer support. Not affiliated with them just a happy customer.<p>It&#x27;s still putting all your eggs in one basket in a sense, but being a paid service there&#x27;s a sense of privacy, security, and permanence that Gmail and the other free providers don&#x27;t offer. I do own my own domain as well, and I have mail accounts tied to it that I use for certain services and communications, mostly medical and local businesses, but I&#x27;m still at the mercy of my hosting provider for that domain. With that said, my provider (Tiger Technologies) has been astoundingly awesome and has never let me down in 12+ years of service.')
