The vaccine manufacturers literally had one chance to guess what the right application schedule was, and had one chance to do clinical trials on them.<p>Because they NEEDED the vaccine to work, they chose very conservative numbers.  Multiple doses, high loads, super cold temperatures, etc.  Those trials have produced a lot of strong corollary evidence that partial vaccinations work, but it will take a very long time to do a full set of clinical trials on those doses.<p>And in the interim, a lot of people will die, who probably would have lived had we proceeded with 1-shot vaccinations.  There&#x27;s a lot of risk here either way, and choosing and never modifying the original dose schedule is not &quot;safer&quot; -- it&#x27;s just a bias towards inaction.')
