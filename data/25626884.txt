First, figure out your goals (6 months, 12 months, 24 months) for life and business.  If 6, 12 and 24 all pretty much look the same to you, then you donâ€™t need an investor.  If 24 is supposed to be 4x where you are now with the business and the revenue, then you probably need the investor.  PS: Advisors are always good, with or without their money.')
