Suffering with an end date attached is way more tolerable than sudden, unplanned suffering. This is why people endure hard studies(PhD, STEM&#x2F;Medical School) internship, infant rearing, you name it. I would also claim that physical suffering mentioned is somewhat easier to suppress than mental suffering, in fight-or-flight response context because we have a way clearer consensus of what is not-ok when it comes to physical pain, making the detection of it easier. (The author mention his pain not being back&#x2F;knee&#x2F;not serious made him keep going)<p>But for most of us suffering is not planned&#x2F;predictable; it comes suddenly, unplanned and often is cyclic&#x2F;wave-like pattern. For the case of cyclic pattern, telling oneself &quot;suffering will eventually end&quot; doesn&#x27;t help that much because around the corner when it ends, looms the next batch of suffering again.<p>This is why &quot;suffering will eventually end&quot; sounds like a nice comforting advice to new parents&#x2F;student&#x2F;employee but is a terrible advice to someone that is going in-and-out of depression, in a life crisis, etc.')
