Most of the time it took to develop the vaccines was government red tape (only some of which is reasonable at all). You won&#x27;t find very many people that want to have that conversation however, they just stick their head in the sand and hide from it. It&#x27;s morally revolting and evil that the US didn&#x27;t utilize a challenge trial and move far faster on the vaccines.<p>They talk about how fast this vaccine was delivered. We could have done it a lot faster. An incredible number of lives and livelihoods could have been saved.<p>Take 1,000 diverse volunteers from the US military, start an isolated challenge trial (if something very unexpected happens, they&#x27;re contained). Then expand it after those first thousand show success. Done in half the time that this took. We&#x27;ll send those soldiers to die in pointless foreign wars, and then we won&#x27;t do something so obvious as this to <i>actually</i> save American lives. The US would have had as many volunteers as you could handle for a challenge trial, hundreds of thousands of volunteers would have been trivial to get.')
