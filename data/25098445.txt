I was USAF, combat communications. 1 deployment to Afghanistan, 2 to Iraq. I enjoyed my time in, and I wouldn&#x27;t change anything, but I desperately wanted out when I found myself building pallets for the invasion of Iraq.<p>&gt; Iâ€™m glad the GWOT era is coming to an end and hope we can learn from all the mistakes we made along the way.<p>Agreed.')
