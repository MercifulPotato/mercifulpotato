Are HOAs opted in by homeowners in existing communities because of their benefits, or do builders create them force them upon new communities because it benefits them somehow?<p>I am asking because while I do not have any knowledge of HOAs, I have been following the saga of rental water heaters&#x2F;furnaces&#x2F;ACs in Ontario for a while. Long story short, construction companies sign a long-term contract with an appliance company instead of buying and installing necessary appliances like furnaces for new houses. They get a nice kickback for this. If you want to buy a new house, odds are you will be bound by a long-term contact. If you want to terminate it early, you end up paying 30k for an appliance that is worth 10k new and installed. If you keep your contact, you will pay the same over many years.<p>It is a deal that is very much to the benefits of the builder and very much against the interest of the homeowners. But they have been exploding in <i>popularity</i>. There are relatively more and more homes with rented water heaters and fewer and fewer homes with owned water heaters every year. It would still be wrong to conclude that <i>&quot;water heater rental is beneficial. See, the market has spoken.&quot;</i>')
