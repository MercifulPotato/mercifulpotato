There are a number of accounts created in the last 30 minutes commenting on this thread, including yours. Did you just happen across HN? If so, welcome!<p>2. If you read my other comments, you&#x27;ll see I&#x27;m very much in favour of reforming non-violent drug law sentencing. I&#x27;m even in favour of clemency for the vast majority of non-violent offenders. I also think you&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to find <i>anyone</i> in this thread who thinks in the way your strawman&#x2F;caricature does. The whole point is that draconian prison sentences are a shame and do little do address the core problem (whether it&#x27;s drug abuse or violent crime).<p>I also think using phrases like &quot;your average racist white&quot; is unnecessarily provocative, and the phrase itself is inaccurate.')
