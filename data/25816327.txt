By multiple copies of a piece of data existing, whichever piece of data is closest to the read head can be read.  Rotational delays on a 7200 RPM risk are about 10 milliseconds, so if you can halve that by picking a closer copy of the data, you&#x27;ll get your data back quicker!<p>All this depends on the filesystem issuing reads for <i>all</i> the copies, the drive firmware correctly deciding which to read first, and then the OS being able to cancel the reads of the other copies.<p>I kinda doubt all the above logic is implemented and bug free...    Which is sad :-(')
