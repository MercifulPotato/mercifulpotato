And most of the canonical descriptions of them assume that you have a garbage collector and that memory allocation is a bounded operation. Neither of which is really true when you&#x27;re working in constrained situations.<p>On top of that, locking is faster than most lock-free strategies unless you deal with high contention or deterimistic guarantees (90% of the latter is solved with bounded fifos).')
