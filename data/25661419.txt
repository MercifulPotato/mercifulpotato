The interactive tools I wrote all had functions that acted as a zero-effort entry point anyway, so the conversion to standalone tool just consisted of building an image that called that function.<p>Additionally, my development environment (SLIME) talked with my application over a network socket, so there&#x27;s no linkage between it and the application - at least, any more so than the usual problem of &quot;Common Lisp binaries are hard to make small&quot; but that&#x27;s not specific to REPL-driven development.<p>The simplicity of my &quot;solution&quot; makes me think that we might be talking at different levels here, but I can&#x27;t think of what the disconnect might be.')
