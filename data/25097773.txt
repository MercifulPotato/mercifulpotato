I didn’t have hope. I thought the way I was was the way I would always be. I thought most of the people in my life would better off freed from the burden of me. But I found relief that I thought I’d never feel. I don’t know if you will find relief, but I have hope for you. I didn’t have anyone to talk to and that was the hardest part; feeling alone, so I want you to know I’d love to talk. Please reach out. We can text, email, phone, zoom–if there is anything you are comfortable with know that I am here and I WANT to talk with you. You don’t have to, but you can.')
