What&#x27;s considered ad fraud is not fraud, but labeling it as such lets advertisers point to individuals running bots and scripts as malicious internet abusers. If I used the term fraud like the ad industry uses ad fraud, I&#x27;d probably lose my law license or just get buried under unfavourable costs orders in court.<p>So why are they deploying the term? Because it&#x27;s a great way to deflect thinking about a core failing of their business logic. We&#x27;ve known since the day of banner ads that &#x27;views&#x27; are a tremendously flawed metric, so blaming online agents for WHY they&#x27;re flawed lets them deflect blame.<p>The fact that we&#x27;re in this thread trying to parse semantics when consumers don&#x27;t even have a seat at the table when deciding where we should fall on the  tracking&#x2F;privacy spectrum should tell you all you need to know about how the industry operates.')
