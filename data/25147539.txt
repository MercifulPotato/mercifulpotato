All the different hacks in Xorg have never worked completely.<p>The other one that people value a lot is HiDPI scaling done &quot;well&quot;. Mixed fractional scaling in Xorg doesn&#x27;t really work and it&#x27;s finally possible to do it. Although there I actually think it&#x27;s still a half step and Wayland made the wrong choice in how to implement it. It should have been done client side for more performance and less fuzzyness. There&#x27;s a chance that will also be fixed in the future.<p>Other than these it&#x27;s a bunch of small things that are more technical than user-visible. Security is much improved for example. Some performance gains can be had from avoiding copying buffers. Etc.')
