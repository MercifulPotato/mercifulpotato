Perhaps the <i>next</i> claims of a stolen election will <i>also</i> be dismissed by the media and courts as &quot;not credible&quot;, censored as &quot;malicious lies&quot; and dangerous &quot;misinformation&quot;.  How can y&#x27;all be so sure that you, or the public at large, will be enabled to tell the difference, when any and all debate about the claim of a stolen election will have been banned at the outset by an overt policy aimed at protecting &quot;the public faith in our democracy&quot;?')
