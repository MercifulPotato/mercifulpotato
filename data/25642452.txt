Item(by='exikyut', descendants=None, kids=[25642877], score=None, time=1609824458, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25614270, text='Wow, <i>nice</i> :) I can imagine color being incredibly helpful... and not needing powder certainly makes the process more user friendly and less intrusive.<p>Also, a very small extra thought, scanning extremely simple objects like cubes and flat planes may make the analysis process slightly easier because the data in the file will be easier to pars--wait. Okay I have more ideas.<p>Can you convert&#x2F;import arbitrary 3D data into the proprietary dxd format? If there is any way to do this, there is nothing else that will move the analysis process as far forward as quickly, and offer the best chances of producing the most complete result. This is because a) the data files will have 99% less complexity due to being synthetic and not containing noise associated with real-world data, b) they&#x27;ll be full of reference points from known 3d models, and c) entirely controllable input data gives the highest chance of figuring out all values&#x2F;fields in the model files.<p>If this is possible, chances are most imports would be user requests based on the analysis process (&quot;does changing this value alter this byte?&quot;). Initial ideas I can think of would be the 3D Teapot, a single pixel :D, and simple cubes, triangles and planes.<p>Lastly, coordinating a backup installation of the scanning software onto a dedicated machine, or moving the main install onto such a machine, that enterprising reverse-engineers could connect to remotely (ideally at any time of day, and obviously after privately negotiating credentials) and install debugging tools (read: IDA&#x2F;Ghidra&#x2F;etc) onto, would likely be extremely helpful, and should provide the best &quot;how we reversed this&quot; narrative with regards to licensing. This would simplify the import request situation too.<p>If importing is not possible, IDA et al may end up being necessary to understand certain complex details or possibly even get started. Solving the &quot;generate interest&quot; problem would naturally be more complex in this scenario though. :&#x2F;<p>I think I&#x27;ve really exhausted my knowledge in this area now :), although I do remain interested in knowing how things go.')
