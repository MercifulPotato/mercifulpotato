What are the implications of this?<p>I always understood that for a telephoto lens you wanted the f-stop number to be higher, so that the image is clearer since the subject is at a greater distance.  My gut instinct is that the iphone XS&#x2F;XR lens might capture a sharper initial image, but maybe the final product won&#x27;t be as good as the newer lens do to all the processing being done by the phone? Perhaps a bigger diameter on the telephoto lens is better for night mode shooting, so more light is being captured? Hoping someone more knowledgeable than I can weigh in. :)')
