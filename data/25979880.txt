Are you making the argument that I won&#x27;t be able to find an example where doing some transform in a type-safe way is awkward in TypeScript, or just that this one example can be done in TypeScript?<p>By the way, my example was meant to be more like User -&gt; User where there are some string values and some other types of value. You want to do the transformation in a generic way, but still have the type-safe object come out the other end with all the expected keys.')
