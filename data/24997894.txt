Why can&#x27;t there be UI <i>APIs</i> that work across languages like there is with loads of other stuff?<p>We have this for networking, disk I&#x2F;O, common OS operations, and <i>even 3D graphics</i>, but for some reason 2D user interfaces just can&#x27;t be presented in this way. Why can&#x27;t there be an OpenGL-like thing for desktop-style and mobile-style UIs that presents the most universal design patterns via standard APIs and allows access to OS or UI-layer specific extensions? How hard is this?<p>There is one lone project by one developer that seems to have been trying to do this, but it seems dead. Probably far larger than one developer can tackle in their spare time, but the effort is admirable:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;andlabs&#x2F;libui" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;andlabs&#x2F;libui</a><p>This one person somehow gets it.<p>Back to the topic at hand. It&#x27;s not that Kotlin is a bad language. I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s quite nice. The problem is that it&#x27;s yet another language which means more cognitive load, more build complexity, and so on. If my project is in Go or C++ or Rust, I want my UI in Go or C++ or Rust.<p>All that being said, I use Jetbrains IDEs and am generally impressed. They make very high quality stuff, so this merits at least a look.')
