That ship sailed a long time ago. E.g. with cars can the average person now repair it at home and maintain the entire car themselves? It would be foolish to recommend that we &quot;fix&quot; cars because of our inability to personally understand the entire thing from inception to finish, yet some feel we can apply the same to software.<p>Just look at the Windows Internals books to understand the complexity of just the systems in the operating system. It isn&#x27;t something that needs to be &quot;fixed&quot; just because something is complex.<p>Everything is more complex than we think it is, and that&#x27;s not really a problem.')
