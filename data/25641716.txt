I always assumed the unspoken part was that the gamers were using some mild stimulants (at least large doses of caffeine), combined with long bouts of inactivity.<p>This became a somewhat related issue in Japan a few years back, sometimes tied to karoshi incidents, and led to very strict regulation of stimulants, including how energy drinks and caffeine pills can be packaged &#x2F; sold.<p>There are many other examples of cardiac arrest after several days of low activity and sleep deprivation though, so the medical reasoning may be simpler.')
