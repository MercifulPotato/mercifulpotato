And it&#x27;s extremely non-linear power scaling, such that at 4.2ghz it&#x27;s already down to half the power consumption at 10w&#x2F;core.<p>The 5950X&#x27;s uncore consumes a significant amount of power, but penalizing it for that seems more than a little unreasonable. The M1 is getting power wins from avoiding the need for externalized IO for GPU or DRAM, but those aren&#x27;t strictly speaking <i>advantages</i> either. I, for one, will <i>gladly</i> pay 20w of power to have expandable RAM &amp; PCI-E slots in a device the size of the Mac Mini much less anything larger. In a laptop of course that doesn&#x27;t make as much sense, but in a laptop the Ryzen&#x27;s uncore also isn&#x27;t 20w (see the also excellent power efficiency of the 4800U and 4900HS)')
