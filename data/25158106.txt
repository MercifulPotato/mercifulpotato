So far it&#x27;s hardly budged and is far below its peaks in 2017 and 2019. That indicates to me that this run up in price could be just beginning. I expect that if an all time high is reached then a wave of publicity will propel the price much higher, as it has several times in the past.<p>I don&#x27;t see a 10x price increase like 2017 though. I expect less extreme price movements now that bitcoin&#x27;s market cap is so much higher and more large investors are involved. I think it would take something huge to move the price that much, like a bitcoin ETF approved by the SEC.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trends.google.com&#x2F;trends&#x2F;explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=%2Fm%2F05p0rrx" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;trends.google.com&#x2F;trends&#x2F;explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=...</a>')
