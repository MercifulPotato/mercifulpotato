Like you said, the metric is very simple, it&#x27;s just an indication that is useful to understand bottlenecks, and to have some fun in a tight-knit startup team (that doesn&#x27;t work long hours) where people don&#x27;t like that much fixing bugs :)<p>Like others have said, I think the line between this being healthy and useful, and this becoming a nightmare is fine, and it gets probably harder the bigger the company is.<p>Thank you for your feedback anyway!')
