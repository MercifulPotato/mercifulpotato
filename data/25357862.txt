Just make your website fast.<p>Am currently consulting big ecommerce bussiness on how to improve page load. I made them this &#x27;fastest page in the world&#x27; demo: \n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;turboeshop.com&#x2F;fastestpageintheworld&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;turboeshop.com&#x2F;fastestpageintheworld&#x2F;</a> - kindly please check it out. And here is fastest page with Google Analytics:\n <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;turboeshop.com&#x2F;newstackonly&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;turboeshop.com&#x2F;newstackonly&#x2F;</a>. 325 ms for fully loaded time CSS + images + HTML + JS + GA loaded + Measurement Protocol hits sent.<p>This is what fast website is: a) inline purged css; b) everything loaded from one domain, 100% cached. c)inlined js(vanilla + web component if you need one); d) inlined images up to 4kb; e) larger images loaded from cache from same domain. f) gtag.js and analytics.js -&gt; from cache; g) Measurement protocol hits sent from async proxy on edge. h) 100% cloudflare cache hits; i) Cloudflare workers for dynamic bits; That&#x27;s all what it takes. Don&#x27;t read articles- just make it fast, it&#x27;s really that simple :)<p>And as svelte was mentioned - if you want to improve a website that is bigger than your personal blog, you don&#x27;t use svelte, react, gatsby or any other of that breed as it&#x27;s impossible to do serious marketing with a website that&#x27;s hydrated (svelte&#x27;s web components is a wonderful thing though and is totally nice addition to marketing stack). I mean no insult to anyone with my strong opinions and would be glad to have discussions in comments.<p>UPD: Added note on Cloudflare &amp; Cloudflare workers.')
