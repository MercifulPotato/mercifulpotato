At those lower levels anyone buying those laptops is going to have <i>much</i> more power than they need. Someone buying a Ryzen 5 4500U to do regular spreadsheets, email, documents, video conferencing, etc. will have ample horsepower. And a Ryzen 5 5500U is not much different. The clocks (base, all-core turbo) might even be lower, though the GPU is slightly better. However, for that kind of user, they might get better battery life, and if they fire up games, a better experience.<p>This isn&#x27;t ideal if you upgrade every generation - that wouldn&#x27;t be worth it. But in those $500-600 laptops, it probably doesn&#x27;t hurt. I suspect they have Zen 2 chiplet supply and buyers in that price range will be plenty happy. If they really need more CPU power from Zen 3, they could step up to Ryzen 5 5600U. So <i>you need to be better educated</i> on those little nuances, but only if you really need the CPU power.<p>Presumably anyone buying that doesn&#x27;t dig into these details reads reviews and looks at the benchmarks on those reviews based on programs they run that are CPU intensive. Otherwise, they probably won&#x27;t be affected greatly by the difference.<p>It&#x27;s not ideal but given supply chain issues, it might be a necessary evil.')
