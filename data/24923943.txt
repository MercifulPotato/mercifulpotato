FWIW, I think that what you guys are building at Catsup is a super valuable service and being profitable from week 2 is impressive!<p>From taking a quick look at your website (thanks for sharing it), it looks like you guys are focused on serving podcasters, which makes total sense.<p>So for us it&#x27;s a bit different: We set up our customers (who are not podcasters) with a professional interviewer to explore subjects in their lives and the lives of others who are important to them. And yep, like Catsup, we do edit those interviews, so in that way there is some crossover.<p>Ultimately, different services and different customer bases. But I&#x27;m really excited about what you&#x27;re building and it would be great to chat further if you&#x27;re up for it. Feel free to reach out at contact@heyartifact.com.<p>And to your point, VC is in no way a marker of success. Building a sustainable business that provides value is what it&#x27;s all about, and it sounds like you&#x27;re doing just that. Hats off!')
