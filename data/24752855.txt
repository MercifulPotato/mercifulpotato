Studying these topics will leave you with an academic knowledge, not a practical and deeply learned knowledge.<p>There is a reason trading firms and hedge funds prefer to recruit good poker players. It&#x27;s because it (i) teaches these concepts at a visceral, muscle-memory level, (ii) it teaches you to apply the concepts while under emotional strain (you may be surprised at the % of statistics professors will crumble totally when they have skin in the game), (iii) it teaches you to merge the concepts together (game theory, stats, etc) in a single cohesive decision-making framework. These are not skills that academic coursework can give you.<p>Consider an analogy: Is it better to learn programming through merely coursework&#x2F;textbooks, or by picking up a project where code is required to complete that project?<p>It&#x27;s also fun. It&#x27;s the only reason many people get exposed to these important concepts without ever wanting to study statistics etc formally.')
