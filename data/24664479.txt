Someone driving by stopped, started video recording me, my family, my neighbors, and the birds with their phone (I assume that&#x27;s what he was doing, that&#x27;s what it looked like) for a minute or two, then he drove off.  He didn&#x27;t say a word.  He didn&#x27;t respond when I waved.<p>By my standards of social behavior that dude is a <i>fucking creep</i> and (years ago) I would have tried to go over and confront him, and get his license plate, and maybe even call the cops on him.  I know it&#x27;s not illegal to photo&#x2F;film people in public, but (again, by my personal standards of social decency) this guy&#x27;s behavior is hella creepy.<p>Of course, the answer is: he&#x27;s a millennial and (to him) what he&#x27;s doing is perfectly normal.  <i>Everybody</i> is a tactless voyeur now, and all your photons&#x2F;base belong to us.  Anything worth looking at is already getting mobbed by the panopticon.<p>(My solution is to buy some land in the woods, cover it with surveillance gear and build large, intimidating robots to patrol the fence.  But that won&#x27;t scale.)<p>The problem is, our whole civilization is <i>that guy</i>: the advertisers, the NSA, the crooks and creeps, <i>all</i> of them are after your data and have a head start.<p>We can&#x27;t put the tech&#x2F;genie back in the bottle (I don&#x27;t believe we can.)  So that leaves us with creating a kinder, gentler dystopian hell.')
