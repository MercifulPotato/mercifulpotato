Quite mind-blowing, right? That&#x27;s possible because it knows exactly which components were rendered in which state, which no other tool can do.<p>See the footnote in the blogpost that explains this more in-depth. I&#x27;ll copy and paste it here:<p>&gt; CSS-in-JS automatically extracts the critical CSS for the requested page and inlines it into a &lt;style&gt; tag. That means the first-paint with CSS-in-JS will always be faster as it saves both an extra network request for the .css file as well as sending less CSS code to the client. While the Time To Interactive for small apps will be slightly slower (as the JavaScript bundle includes the CSS-in-JS library you use) once your app grows the network request for the larger CSS file can outweigh any CSS-in-JS library and can cause a slower Time To Interactive as well.')
