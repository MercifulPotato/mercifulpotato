The first, based on a simple superimposed code scheme first proposed by Bloom,9, 10 was supplied by D. M. Ritchie and succeeded in encoding a 25,000-word list into 50,000 bytes. A more elaborate method, in which values of a conventional hash func- tion are represented in a differential Huffman code, squeezed 30,000 words into 52,000 bytes. The stop list is handled by the same method in a different process.”<p>Doug McIlroy discussed the history of spell at Bell Labs here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.dartmouth.edu&#x2F;~doug&#x2F;spell.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.cs.dartmouth.edu&#x2F;~doug&#x2F;spell.pdf</a><p>I remember emailing Doug to ask him about this and he was great, very helpful to me.
