Proper nouns come up often in feedback too.<p>Adding proper nouns has a few issues though:<p>- Where would you get an accurate dictionary of proper nouns? This would need to include e.g. people names, places, brand names. If it wasn&#x27;t constantly kept up to date it could lead to more frustrations than just disallowing them.<p>- There&#x27;s so many proper nouns it would bloat the game download. The English dictionary used right now takes about 3MB, which is the limiting factoring getting the game download lower than 1MB zipped. I&#x27;m failing to find an estimate but if you include proper nouns, the dictionary would be an order or magnitude bigger. Maybe less of an issue for mobile app store downloads but I want the game to load fast when shared online. A web service to check the words won&#x27;t work for offline play either.<p>It&#x27;s feeling like a &quot;dictionary words only&quot; message somewhere is the only practical solution. I could adapt the (single!) tutorial message at the start of the game to be &quot;swipe in any direction to spell dictionary words&quot; but &quot;dictionary words&quot; would probably be overlooked. There&#x27;s no menu screen at the start because I know people are impatient. :)')
