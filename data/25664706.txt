Signal is popular among the HN users, because it was hyped for a long time by tech-journalists as a pinnacle of secure messaging, but as an app it&#x27;s even worse than WhatsApp. And not very popular outside of HN. Telegram is very popular in Russia&amp;neighbours and only mildly popular in Europe, even less so in USA. Arguably the best of 3 in terms of usability, HN users don&#x27;t like it because it has some non-standard e2e encryption, which is not enabled by default in private chats.<p>Also, FYI, Telegram is going to introduce some paid features soon, but it&#x27;s not completely clear what they&#x27;ll be. There just was some talking about that&#x27;s it about the time they are going to monetize it, but I&#x27;m not sure if they announced what exactly becomes paid and what doesn&#x27;t.')
