You need to only use &#x27;restrict&#x27; where you are 100% sure pointers can&#x27;t alias. Wherever you get this wrong you have introduced a subtle bug that a) only shows up in optimized code b) may or may not show up at all depending on compiler version and target architecture and c) only shows up when two pointers actually alias at runtime, which may be rare, and may be intermittent ... in other words these bugs will be <i>hell</i> to debug. So in fact in a large codebase it will be a lot of work to figure out where you can safely put &#x27;restrict&#x27; and you will probably introduce some very nasty bugs. Most people aren&#x27;t going to be willing to do this.')
