That server software came with Windows NT 4.0, which I got in a package of Microsoft software (pretty much everything developer-related that MS sold) I got for free when I went to the MS dev conference in Phoenix (late 90&#x27;s) because I thought it would be fun. I remember eating quail or some other small game bird at lunch and talking to the real developers who thought it was really cool that I was into computers and showed up at this fancy conference at 15. I don&#x27;t remember barely any of the presentations, but I do recall seeing one ASP.NET presentation at the time showing an interactive page with a database and everything (whoa! it blew my mind) and I thought that the internet was going to be really cool someday soon after that.<p>I never became the superman techie that a lot of the folks here became after getting into computers that young, but this article reminded me of those happy days programming with a free version of Visual J++ (why god?!), so thank you.<p>On another note, as I looked up Visual J++, I read that it was sued out of existence by Sun in 2001, but Microsoft supported the MSJVM for J++ for security updates until 2007! Then, they created J# in order to give those developers a way to transition to .NET technologies, like C#, which was then supported until <i>2017</i>. Can you imagine any other company supporting old, decrepit technologies like that other than Microsoft? I have a kinda newfound respect for them and their engineering culture of long-term support.')
