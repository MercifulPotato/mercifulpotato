That means nobody in the world views these claims of election fraud etc as legitimate.<p>Meanwhile you have trump crying out on Twitter &quot;I WON THIS ELECTION BY A LOT&quot; and nobody believes him.<p>Your recounts and certifications will find Biden has won. Given the current numbers, that is pretty definitive; a recount may slightly change them but that doesn&#x27;t matter much.<p>That is why it&#x27;s pretty safe to say, Biden is the next president, period. Kind of like it&#x27;s safe to say the sun will set today and rise tomorrow. Sure, it <i>might</i> not, but at this point if it doesn&#x27;t, we have bigger fish to fry than &quot;the media was wrong&quot;.')
