Do you think hermetically sealed things like Pacemaker [0] should be repairable?<p>I generally agree with you - I personally wish people weren&#x27;t so afraid of screws and other cosmetic artifacts that allow things to be repairable. There is a general distaste <i>from the public</i> to make things sexy, clean and minimal. So manufacturers comply. Just look up a 1950&#x27;s electric coffee grinder [1] - it will have visible screws without an apology. Or a Collins instrument in a airplane cockpit even today [2]. I blame the <i>public</i>, <i>designers</i> and the <i>bean counters</i>. Generally, engineers&#x27; job would be easy if things were repairable because assembly&#x2F;disassembly is part of the requirements from the get go and there is no Jony Ive breathing down their necks to hide screw holes. There is a whole area of study of snap-fit components to reduce BOM cost and this is where the bean counters come in.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=sNW3Xqtgkus" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=sNW3Xqtgkus</a><p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worthpoint.com&#x2F;worthopedia&#x2F;vintage-electric-coffee-grinder-411680866" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.worthpoint.com&#x2F;worthopedia&#x2F;vintage-electric-coff...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aeroexpo.online&#x2F;prod&#x2F;collins-aerospace-rockwell-collins&#x2F;product-170410-6862.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.aeroexpo.online&#x2F;prod&#x2F;collins-aerospace-rockwell-...</a>')
