So it&#x27;s not about predicting something from the resume, so much as making the matching process more flexible, given that most people doing the initial screening aren&#x27;t doing a good job.<p>In other words: make a very imperfect process slightly less bad today, so good candidates don&#x27;t get missed.<p>And of course, you still need to do the full set of interviews afterwards! We&#x27;re not saying this is any sort of silver bullet.')
