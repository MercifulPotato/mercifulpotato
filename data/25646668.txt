This is mostly from people at work who are associates. They aspire to become a software engineer simply for a higher paycheck.<p>I am reluctant to tell them to go read SICP or Knuth&#x27;s Art of Computer Programming.  I would like them to understand what they are getting into before they commit to it.<p>I would like to recommend a book that really explains some philosophy or touches on the mindset needed to become a programmer.<p>What would you recommend to someone who aspires to become a programmer, but who has no understanding of what is required?')
