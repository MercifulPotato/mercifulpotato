WASM-powered search caught my eye.<p>Looks like the search index is downloaded and used locally in the browser, so this is as fast as search can get. One trade-off though is that you&#x27;re limited to relatively small datasets. While this shouldn&#x27;t be an issue for small-medium static sites, an index that needs to be downloaded over the wire will affect your page performance for larger sites &#x2F; datasets.<p>In those cases, you&#x27;d want to use a dedicated search server like Algolia or its open source alternative Typesense [1]. Both of them store the index server-side and only return the relevant records that are searched for.<p>For eg: you&#x27;d probably not want to download 2M records over the wire to search through them locally [2]. You&#x27;d be better off storing the index server-side.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;typesense&#x2F;typesense" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;typesense&#x2F;typesense</a> (shameless plug)<p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;recipe-search.typesense.org&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;recipe-search.typesense.org&#x2F;</a>')
