For Nillium.<p>No news company that I am aware of has learned how to have both credible editorial oversight <i>and profit</i> in the digital age. It seems that every news source, even the legacy new organizations, have an inherent strong bias, either explicitly in the narrative they espouse, or implicitly in the stories they don&#x27;t report.<p>It&#x27;s maddening.<p>Nillium touts their editorial board. Who are they? What is their experience? What is their approach to ensuring the news they release is based in facts, with follow up and naming of sources, explores both sides of a discussion and respects the privacy of those in the story? Importantly, do they eschew partisan framing and narratives and truly seek to be unbiased?')
