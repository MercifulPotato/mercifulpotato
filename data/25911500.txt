The claim that Trump&#x27;s team made was that because some counties allowed voters to &quot;cure&quot; mail-in ballots if they were going to be thrown out and some didn&#x27;t, that was unlawful. Multiple courts up the chain kept saying &quot;no, this is not actually a thing.&quot; The Third Circuit&#x27;s 3-0 ruling against them said, in these words, &quot;The Campaign cannot win this lawsuit&quot; because they &quot;had to plead plausible facts, not just conclusory allegations&quot;. They went on to note that the number of mail-in ballots actually affected by the claims were &quot;far smaller&quot; than Biden&#x27;s margin of victory.<p>&gt; The problem is that once the election has been conducted in violation of the law, that has already happened. The total you have is inaccurate and you don&#x27;t actually know who won.<p>If votes are cast in good faith by citizens following the voting laws as they are communicated and there is no evidence either of material fraud or of a material number of voters being disenfranchised, then you very likely <i>do</i> have an accurate total, right? If the election is a violation of the law because it disenfranchised enough voters to make a material difference in the outcome, that would be a different matter, but that was never actually in question here. Even if all the mail-in votes that had been &quot;cured&quot; had been thrown out, Biden would have still won the state. This is why Trump&#x27;s team asked to have all mail-in votes thrown out: a more reasonable restitution wouldn&#x27;t have achieved the outcome they wanted, e.g., Trump being awarded the state&#x27;s electoral college votes regardless of the popular vote tally.<p>(And, AnimalMuppet is also right: every state that changed election laws in 2020 changed them, by definition, before the election. Raising objections to those laws <i>after</i> the election because your guy didn&#x27;t win -- and only in those states -- is, well, suspect.)')
