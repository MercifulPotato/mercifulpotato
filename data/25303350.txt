How do I know?<p>After reading said book, I read a few other books and some of them actually cited &#x27;Thinking, Fast and Slow&#x27; and applied some of the concepts in new contexts and sometimes I thought &#x27;Wow, I didn&#x27;t realize the implications when I read the original book&#x27;.<p>So I think it is actually a book that is well worth to be actively read, but currently I still find myself struggling to keep integrating the lessons from &#x27;How to make friends and influence people&#x27; into my everyday actions.')
