Yes, there is universal health care, obviously…but there is definitely not an abundance of easily available mental health care here, <i>especially</i> outside the major metro areas. And the health care in the most economically disadvantaged areas (First Nations reservations) certainly isn’t platinum care.<p>Really, the road deaths chart stands out to me. Canada is very car centric, and huge, and full of plenty of large animals to hit. I simply cannot hazard a guess as to why it’s that different.')
