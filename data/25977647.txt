However, the government did it in hurry by-passing rules and without consulting farmers<p>That is false. These reforms are decades in the making with just about everyone opposing these laws now had advocated for it. Case in point, take a look at this tweet from BKU (the union leading these protests) - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;BKU_KisanUnion&#x2F;status&#x2F;1101674010666913792" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;BKU_KisanUnion&#x2F;status&#x2F;110167401066691379...</a><p>In the above tweet, the farmers union is demanding that these vert farms laws should be implemented. Then after the government did that, they started protesting what they were demanding in the first place. And this is not the only incident.<p>Second case in point - here is what the Congress and AAP (the principle opposition parties leading the protests) promised to do if they were elected in the elections in 2019 - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiatoday.in&#x2F;news-analysis&#x2F;story&#x2F;a-tale-of-u-turns-on-the-three-farm-laws-1750146-2020-12-16" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.indiatoday.in&#x2F;news-analysis&#x2F;story&#x2F;a-tale-of-u-tu...</a><p>So how come everyone demanding these laws is now protesting against the same laws? Common sense would dictate that the protests are not due to these laws. They are political in nature, where these laws are used as a shield to help legitimise these protests')
