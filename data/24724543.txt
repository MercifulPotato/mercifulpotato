I love what I do, I&#x27;m proud of my achievements and would still like to stay in the technical career path for at least 10 more years. And yet, here I am again, in the job-seeking game. Multiple reasons and not related to the story.<p>There is only one thing that I cannot stand with passion and is this industry trend of requiring on-call rotations. Maybe this was common in the SysOps world but at this point, almost all Dev job posts are requiring it. Even product-based roles are asking for it.<p>I already had tried on-calls on different teams, with the expectations that things would be better. But I cannot stand the anxiety, the sleep deprivation, the high amounts of stress, and the expectations that after the incident, I still need to fulfill my development duties the next day as nothing has happened. I&#x27;m always too tired and is difficult to concentrate, study, or try to improve careerwise. This affects my social life and I can&#x27;t continue this way.<p>I had been thinking of doing a career shift to data science and&#x2F;or machine learning. So the question for those of you in the field is, does data science or AI&#x2F;ML require on-call rotations? What career advice do you suggest? I want to be sure that I&#x27;m choosing the right path before starting graduate studies.')
