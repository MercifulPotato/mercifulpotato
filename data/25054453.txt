By 89&#x2F;90 when the tech boom collapsed, never to return (or so people said), the magazines were full of articles about how people were fleeing California, that the new world of modems would make remote work possible, and that would be the end.<p>In other words, every decade the same article, over and over.  Yawn.<p>(Definitely there was a change in the late 90s when people came for the money rather than the sheer technical fun, but as that same impetus had produced SF in the first place (god rush of &#x27;49) it was hard to complain, even if it did change the culture for the worse.  Sadly those people didn&#x27;t all flee with the dot com crash nor the 2008 crisis.  Well, we can&#x27;t have everything.)')
