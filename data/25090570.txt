It&#x27;s only supposed to apply existing law to the facts of particular cases. That has to be done because no written statute can specify how it would apply to all possible combinations of facts. But there&#x27;s still a difference between applying a statute to particular facts, and making new law that goes beyond anything the statute says or implies. I am certainly not the only one to believe that many court decisions since the passage of landmark civil rights laws in the 1960s have done the latter, not the former.')
