In fact I had to carry a sample (just the cable and plug on the EV side, other end was open) a few meters and oh boy, I can still feel my shoulder and back just thinking about that. No idea how any regular everyday consumer is supposed to handle that. And that was even without any cooling liquid pumped inside which you&#x27;d probably have in the live application.')
