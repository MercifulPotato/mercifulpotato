He&#x27;s a biochemist, not a virologist. I don&#x27;t know how correct he is or isn&#x27;t. But his history suggests that he&#x27;s not someone who&#x27;s opinion on pharmaceuticals should be taken lightly. Wodarg has similarly suggested that the COVID pandemic is overhyped. Wodarg&#x27;s a politician with some medical education. I don&#x27;t know that he&#x27;s anywhere near authoritative.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;mike-yeadon-3818613&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.linkedin.com&#x2F;in&#x2F;mike-yeadon-3818613&#x2F;</a><p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;local&#x2F;kent&#x2F;hi&#x2F;people_and_places&#x2F;newsid_9411000&#x2F;9411891.stm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.bbc.co.uk&#x2F;local&#x2F;kent&#x2F;hi&#x2F;people_and_places&#x2F;newsid...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sfgate.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;article&#x2F;Pfizer-narrows-its-focus-to-5-research-areas-3407101.php" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sfgate.com&#x2F;business&#x2F;article&#x2F;Pfizer-narrows-its-f...</a><p>[3] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drug-dev.com&#x2F;ziarco-pharma-acquires-pfizer-drugs-secures-financing&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;drug-dev.com&#x2F;ziarco-pharma-acquires-pfizer-drugs-sec...</a><p>[4] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;johnlamattina&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;15&#x2F;turning-pfizer-discards-into-novartis-gold-the-story-of-ziarco&#x2F;?sh=402644907572" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;johnlamattina&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;15&#x2F;turnin...</a><p>[5] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dryburgh.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;Wodarg_Yeadon_EMA_Petition_Pfizer_Trial_FINAL_01DEC2020_signed_with_Exhibits_geschwarzt.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;dryburgh.com&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;Wodarg_Yeado...</a>')
