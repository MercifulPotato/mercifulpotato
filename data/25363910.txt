Item(by='filoleg', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607544268, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25354978, text='&gt;just had a successor (XM4) which has multiple device support.<p>As an owner of those same Sony headphones (XM3) their multi-device support is a joke compared to airpods. Not even kidding, night and day. I still like them, because when I am working at my desk in an office, I would prefer over-the-ears.  If Apple manages to match and&#x2F;or beat Sony&#x27;s sound+ANC quality, but bring all the connectivity and great multi-device pairing features of current Airpods to Airpods Max, I am sold.')
