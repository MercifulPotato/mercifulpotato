Reformer has taken books as a single input and not just in split batches. There are pretrained book-trained models on HuggingFace now. I&#x27;m not aware of book-length summarization models yet, but that&#x27;s not due to the input length issues of the previous generation of xformer models (maybe due to lack of an obvious training set?). So your SQL example should be a thing of the past before long.')
