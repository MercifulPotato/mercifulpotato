That&#x27;s 30k total, not per year. Accommodation is extra.<p>* Leicester isn&#x27;t a particularly good university. It&#x27;s ranked 77th out of 121. 50th out of 68 for maths [0].<p>* The department has been put on notice a few times that it needs more to up its income (get more students, get more research grants, get more other funding) or cut it&#x27;s expenses. It hasn&#x27;t done so.<p>* There are a whole bunch of wider issues for university funding at the moment. A rent strike is costing them money. Inability to take on foreign students (who they can charge more) is costing them money. A drop in overall intake as more students realise it likely isn&#x27;t worth the money to get a degree etc. Fewer students on campus means less sales from university bars, restaurants etc. Mix that with high fixed costs and someone has to be let go.<p>* They&#x27;re closing the pure maths departments but seem to be keeping the others (Including actuarial science) which is likely what students actually want. Ultimately UK degrees are mostly about getting a job these days, not the beauty of numbers. That&#x27;s sad but that&#x27;s the predictable consequence of 20 years of government policy in the area.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;education&#x2F;ng-interactive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;sep&#x2F;05&#x2F;the-best-uk-universities-2021-league-table" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theguardian.com&#x2F;education&#x2F;ng-interactive&#x2F;2020&#x2F;se...</a>')
