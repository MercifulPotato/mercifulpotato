Just having a price tag on unavailability will change most of the reasoning for his points.<p>I don&#x27;t think so. The gist of the reasoning is that it&#x27;s better to have more numerous small failures that are fixed quickly than rare but catastrophic failures. I think that&#x27;s true even when you have an SLA, which is probably why it&#x27;s broadly in line with the principles in Google&#x27;s Site Reliability Engineering book<p>Others have made the point though that this all goes out of the window when talking about safety-critical engineering (Therac-25, 737Max etc)')
