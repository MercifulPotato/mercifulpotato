Did they mean don&#x27;t put anything directly in &#x2F;usr (i.e. except &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local)? Or did they mean don&#x27;t put anything <i>anywhere</i> under &#x2F;usr? Both are consistent with my comment.<p>Personally, I stopped using even &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local (or &#x2F;opt) many years ago. If it&#x27;s not managed by the operating system then it goes in my home directory (except a few things in &#x2F;etc that have to go there).')
