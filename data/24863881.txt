If your personal opinions are that others don&#x27;t deserve the same basic rights that you have you should face the consequences of holding those beliefs.<p>I believe that who and how one loves is no one else&#x27;s business except that of the consenting adults involved.  Full stop.  No equivocation, no caveats.<p>Anyone else needs to mind their own fucking business.<p>However, trashing someone&#x27;s career because of their personal beliefs (with the caveat that those beliefs play no role in their professional position) is <i>wrong</i>.<p>Assuming Eich didn&#x27;t bring those beliefs into the office (whether that be by his speech or actions as an employee), it&#x27;s irrelevant to his job.<p>If we believe in liberty (such as the right of consenting adults to love how they need to do so),  then we have to accept that others have liberty too -- within the constraint that the exercise of one&#x27;s liberty doesn&#x27;t impinge on the liberty of others[0].<p>Want to hate on Eich because he&#x27;s a homophobe?  Go for it.  Want to call him out on his homophobia?  Get on wit&#x27; yo&#x27; bad self!<p>But none of that had <i>anything</i> to do with Eich&#x27;s qualifications or ability to run Mozilla.<p>What if you had a homophobic boss who hounded you out of your job because of <i>your</i> beliefs?  Is that right?<p>If you want to have a truly <i>free</i> society, you need to allow unpopular opinions to be held and expressed.  And unless and until those opinions&#x2F;beliefs actually impinge on the rights of others, we should tolerate (note I say &#x27;tolerate&#x27; not embrace, endorse or accept) them.<p>[0] As in &quot;Your right to swing your fist ends where my nose begins.&quot;')
