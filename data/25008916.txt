I used to somewhat immune to that kind of pandering until I got a dog myself and now I simply cannot watch some of the ads&#x2F;news&#x2F;videos that deal with various animal rescues.<p>I absolutely get how some people&#x27;s first reaction is to take the easy way and reach for a wallet. After all, the need is there and there seem to be people who seem to be helping.
