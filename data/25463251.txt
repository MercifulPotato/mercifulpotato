Item(by='daniel-cussen', descendants=1, kids=[25465696], score=3, time=1608259755, title='Stars are no substitute for regulation', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I just took an Uber in Santiago and while on, asked the driver turn the music down.  The driver responded by saying in Ubers you don&#x27;t have the right to ask they turn down the music, that I was aggressive and insisting I get off, and stopped in a neighborhood known for high crime at night.<p>I can&#x27;t force him to do his job, and after he insisted for the fourth time, despite my offer to wear earphones instead of him turning down the music and telling him &quot;estoy tratando de pactar contigo&quot; (I&#x27;m trying to make peace with you) it became clear I had no choice but get out of his car and walk.<p>As far as regulation, I am no legal expert in the matter but I do recall that the bus at least can play music as long as no passenger objects, according to a sign behind every driver.  I&#x27;ve spent enough time in Chile to know this might not be &quot;de facto&quot; but it&#x27;s still a law and if I&#x27;m the only passenger the driver is wrong to object to me asking he turn the music down.  It&#x27;s just a question, he&#x27;s providing a service, taxis oblige, radiotaxis oblige, and it&#x27;s just rude not to.<p>Which brings me to my point, that star systems are not enough.  To begin with Uber can simply make up a number between 1 and 5 totally arbitrarily without actually averaging any scores.  Giving this driver a 1 star rating and not paying him?  Who cares?  Complaining to Uber internally?  So what?<p>Star systems are not enough.')
