I simply have no idea whether they are authentic or not.  These documents originate with Rudy Giuliani who was just revealed to be the target of a Russian disinformation campaign regarding Hunter Biden.[1]  I will view anything that is coming from Giuliani with a healthy dose of skepticism until there is some outside confirmation.<p>However the authenticity of the documents isn&#x27;t even relevant to the overall point.  If they are fake, there is a crime of fraud.  If they are authentic, it is likely a crime to release this information.  There also doesn&#x27;t appear to be any evidence of a crime committed by either Hunter or Joe Biden.  Even if a meeting took place, which no one is able to confirm, that alone isn&#x27;t a crime.  That lack of crime would seemingly eliminate this as an example of whistleblowing.  The end result is that it appears that a crime was committed just to make Biden look bad and try to turn the election in Trumps favor.  I don&#x27;t know why Twitter or Facebook need to allow their platforms to be a pawn in that game.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;national-security&#x2F;giuliani-biden-ukraine-russian-disinformation&#x2F;2020&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;43158900-0ef5-11eb-b1e8-16b59b92b36d_story.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;national-security&#x2F;giuliani-bi...</a>')
