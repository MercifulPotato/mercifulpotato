Seems like all standard use cases work seamlessly, such as web browsing, streaming, videos, text editing, creating artwork, presentations, installing any random Linux binary, programming, ...etc ; only problems I&#x27;ve run into are by doing something stupid or doing something really really off the wall.<p>And even when I&#x27;ve created a problem or chosen to do something way outside of standard usage, there has been a WEALTH of documentation, stack overflow discussions, and live Linux community support. I&#x27;ve never run into a problem that hasn&#x27;t already been chewed over by the Linux community, solved, and the solution been posted in a clear, educational, and technically descriptive manner.<p>I&#x27;ve NEVER has that kind of support from Apple or Microsoft. From them, it&#x27;s always some half baked, high level &#x2F; middle management overview type of solution, usually outdated, that discusses why it&#x27;s a problem, why fixing it is dependent on the system (their system, that I&#x27;ve paid for), and how I should contact my system administrator, who&#x27;s going to go read through the same page, then spend the afternoon sipping Pepto and dreaming of having a more sane job. Using their OS&#x27;s is like wading through mud.')
