The original finding states that past a rather high threshold (~$75k), additional raise <i>alone</i> is an insufficient motivator. Below that threshold, money alone works just fine as a motivator. Above that threshold, pay hike still enhances other motivators.<p>In Bay Area, I agree that ethical concerns likely dwarf money. $120k&#x2F;year in Europe would let them scrape the creme de la creme, despite near universal dislike among tech-crowd.<p>(1) <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;early&#x2F;2010&#x2F;08&#x2F;27&#x2F;1011492107.abstract" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pnas.org&#x2F;content&#x2F;early&#x2F;2010&#x2F;08&#x2F;27&#x2F;1011492107.abs...</a>')
