Item(by='pessimizer', descendants=None, kids=[25612986], score=None, time=1609595587, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25612482, text='&gt; I suppose I could be reluctantly convinced to part with $5 or $10 for the latest predictable comic book CGI-fest.<p>You&#x27;d probably never get that chance if prices floated; those films go out to a market that bases their social life on consuming genre fiction and for whom seeing them is not optional. Prices would shoot up to $40 a ticket, and marketing would just be laser-targeted towards that audience, who would pay like putting money into the collection tray at church. Kickstarter has proved that 5-10% of that audience would be willing to pay multiples of that (2x to probably 50x) extra without anything in return but exclusive tokens that are evidence that they paid.<p>IMO, mostly middle-of-the-road, highly-competent directors like Fincher would be in trouble in that world, since they are both going for a general audience and relying on a general media narrative of genius and award potential to market their films. Genre movies withdrawing from general reviewers and general marketing (like awards shows) reduces the impact of those awards, and leaves them as a <i>de facto</i> genre themselves - like mainstream literary fiction. Maybe able to crank out one or two films that crack the top 10 every year and barely self-supporting on average; highly dependent on government and institutional support.<p>Talent graduates from mainstream non-genre awards-show films <i>to</i> comic book films, not vice-versa, which is why awards shows are desperately trying to get those films into every category, as a means to market those traditional blockbusters to genre fans.<p>&gt; mass-market lowest-common-denominator marvel or transformers nonsense<p>So, tl;dr, IMO Fincher is the mass-market lowest-common-denominator choice, and bombastic genre trash targets a small inelastic market that would still be sustainable at a far higher price point. The number who would pay a premium for Fincher wouldn&#x27;t be enough to support his budgets and marketing. Mainstream Fincher films would only survive given away for a token (or in order to market something else.) 20M people would pay $60 for The Avengers 8, but 400M might be willing to pay $3 for Mank or watch it for free if you put it on all of some brand&#x27;s devices as a promotion (like a U2 album, or Netflix.)<p>Of course Fincher would be (and probably is) highly desired in genre films, so in that world he&#x27;d probably be charging $100 per to 40M fans for <i>The Incredulous Spider-Man: Sapphire Empire&#x27;s Revenge Chapter II</i> or <i>The New Fast More Furious 19.</i>')
