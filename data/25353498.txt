As I type this I currently have it connected to both my iPhone and my Macbook Pro and it is definitely more seamless than my AirPods when switching between the two. The AirPods require me to manually switch which device it is connected to when I switch between music and a call (it&#x27;s only one single button press, so not that big of a deal, but still). The Jabra, OTOH, requires literally zero interaction for me. I listen to music on my phone and then when it&#x27;s time for a Zoom call on my laptop I simply launch Zoom and the Jabra automatically switch. I also use it with my iPad, an Android tablet, and two other macbooks and it works fine. The only quirkiness is that it doesn&#x27;t like being connected to a macbook and an ipad at the same time. When switching between the iPad and one of my MBPs I have to manually disconnect from the iPad first, but that&#x27;s only with the iPad for some reason.<p>I&#x27;ve never noticed a difference in the sound quality, and I have actually had coworkers remark that they can hear me better when I use the Jabras, FWIW.')
