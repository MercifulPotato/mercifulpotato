That there are people who appreciate the analogies are apparent in the discussion here where people do just that. That there are people who would prefer a focused article and find that the tangents detract from the underlying store is just the flip side of that discussion that the op decided to have.<p>I personally wish that long form journalist articles would have an outline at the beginning so that I know what I am about to read. Otherwise it often just feels like the author is rambling and going nowhere. Some stories actually have a lot of moving parts and require long form journalism to paint a realistic and balanced picture. Instead, a lot of &quot;long form&quot; journalism just adds filler analogies and tangential factoids that may be interesting but often don&#x27;t add anything to the underlying story or are unnecessary for understanding.')
