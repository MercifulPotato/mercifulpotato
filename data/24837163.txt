They&#x27;re not un-generous, but their generosity is only for the &quot;worthy&quot;, and they&#x27;re afraid that the un-worthy are benefitting.<p>There are examples in this thread, where the poster personally knows people who do not wish to work and are somehow living the high life off of their taxes. The implication is that it&#x27;s worth eliminating the program in order to avoid that; the abstraction of other deserving people who need it is less important. They wouldn&#x27;t necessarily mind a system that managed to remove all of the malingerers, but even a very tiny number of them invalidates a system.<p>As you say, we can easily afford it: the country produces over $60,000 per person each year. It&#x27;s more a matter of fairness than resources: people resent a system they perceive as unfair to them even more than they resent a system in which unfortunate people suffer.<p>That&#x27;s certainly not unique to Americans, but from what I&#x27;ve seen, it dominates the thinking here more than in many other parts of the world. When you describe, say the UK&#x27;s NHS or a UBI, the American mind seems to go first to &quot;How many people must be abusing that system?&quot;')
