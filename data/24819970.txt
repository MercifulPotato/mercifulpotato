So there’s definitely a market for this kind of stuff but it’s also quite a competitive market. To that end, I don’t think your landing page does a good enough job of selling your product. You sell your company name, introduce me to your team, all of which I’m sure is important to you, but all I’d be interested in is which games you’ve got, how much fun they are to play and how I can play them remotely with friends.<p>The latter point appears easy enough when looking at the join options. But none of this is addressed on the landing page. You don’t even appear to have any pictures of the games anywhere on your site (maybe you do once you’ve signed up? But how many people are going to sign up blind?)<p>I really do like your mission statement but bare in mind that sometimes “gaudy” designs are picked because they look more “fun”. The site design currently doesn’t project “fun” to me. It looks more like a business page. I’m not suggesting you need to make the site gimmicky but take a look at the way how other games are marketed. This might intentionally be trying to buck the trend but that will likely cost you more customers than it attracts.<p>Also the pricing is a little confusing. I think you might be better off with fewer price points but define them more clearly. A little bit of the confusion I had was also because without seeing what content you had on your portal (or even what the portal looks like) it’s hard to understand what you’re paying for.<p>I’ll definitely be keeping an eye on this and seeing how it progresses because, as I said, I do organise a lot of events so always on the look out for new ways to entertain groups.')
