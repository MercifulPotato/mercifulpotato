One day, one of the PhD students asked everyone which dotcom&#x27;s stock would they most like to have.  I said Google.  (It might not have been a company yet, but we kinda assumed.)<p>Google worked surprisingly well, obviously they were going to be hugely important (unless another player appeared and did a big next leap), and obviously they were smart.  (On the side, I also got warm-fuzzies that the search hits I got seemed to have a strong Linux bias.)<p>The grad student who asked, coincidentally, ended up deciding not to finish his PhD, and went to Google. :)')
