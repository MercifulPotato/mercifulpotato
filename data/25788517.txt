It has higher limits than WeTransfer and Zippyshare.<p>I support freedom of speech, you can share anything you like on pixeldrain as long as it&#x27;s legal. I have some fairly simple rules:<p><pre><code>  * No copyrighted content\n  * No child abuse\n  * No terrorism\n  * No malware\n  * No gore. Though I am debating whether this last rule is necessary. Gore is not strictly illegal. But I don&#x27;t want to turn my site into just another shock site.\n</code></pre>\nGrowing this site has been a challenge, especially since the amount of abuse it receives is always growing. But developing it has been a lot of fun. Lots of hard scaling problems to solve.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pixeldrain.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pixeldrain.com</a>')
