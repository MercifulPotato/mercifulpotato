The ends always justify the means now; no consistency of ideology is required.<p>A party that hates regulating business suddenly sees the light when powerful businesses start removing them from the public square.<p>A party that pretends to be for free speech and free journalism suddenly has a change of heart when it benefits them going into an election.<p>A party that purports to stand up to big business suddenly supports the largest megacorps in the history of man because their interests are temporarily aligned.<p>A party that thought Citizens United was terrible because it gave the rights of citizens to corporations suddenly cares very deeply about Twitter&#x2F;Facebook&#x2F;Google&#x2F;Apple&#x27;s freedom of expression when used to eliminate critical voices on their platforms.<p>A party gets rid of the filibuster for judge nominations and then gets mad that they can&#x27;t filibuster the other party&#x27;s judge nominations -- or a party deciding it&#x27;s suddenly ok to seat judges during an election.<p>Both parties are about power.  Neither party has any remaining principles.')
