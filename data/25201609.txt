Item(by='WorldMaker', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606243948, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25198007, text='GM indicates that they think the EV transition is happening sooner than people and has no plans for another PHEV, just a large slate of EVs between 2023-2030. The Volt is mentioned as a transition option no longer necessary, according to current GM plans. Relatedly, all of the German automakers currently expect to be entirely EV by 2030. (Asian automakers are interestingly split by how much they rely on US car sales versus Chinese car sales. Those selling to China are on a very fast ramp to all EV production and those with much more reliance on US sales are still hedging their bets.)<p>There&#x27;s an interesting feeling in the air that it could be a surprisingly fast switch in the next few years. I&#x27;ve loved my Volt and it was a great purchase in 2011, but in 2020 it does feel like a transition tech that I wouldn&#x27;t buy again (especially as commute changes and electric reliability have moved me more and more to the &quot;gas up once a year only because the Volt makes me&quot; group), I&#x27;d personally go for a proper EV next time. It will be interesting to watch the next few years because I think things are about to go &quot;weird&quot; quickly (in rapid shifts in gas prices and availability).')
