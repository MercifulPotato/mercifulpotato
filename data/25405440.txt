Item(by='Joeri', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607853191, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25401268, text='My experience is very different.<p>I have a standard install of chrome on big sur, as well as brave, and a bunch of electron apps. When I start up my mac none of these are running, there is no process with chrome or chromium in the name, and nothing in the process list that I can link back to chrome. When I launch some of the electron apps, chrome_crashpad_handler launches, which I assume is some kind of default electron behavior. When I close those apps, all chrome-related processes disappear from my process list. There is nothing untoward about chrome I can tell, nor is my system seeing any kind of recognizable slowdown, with or without chrome running. I also have chrome on very low-end macs, a 2009 mini with 8 GB ram and a 2014 air with 4 GB RAM, both running catalina. It runs fine on both, without seeming to cause particular performance issues. I just went through a reinstall of the 2009, and there was no performance difference before and after installing chrome.<p>I&#x27;m not saying yours or other people&#x27;s bad experiences with chrome are not real, but I do wonder how it&#x27;s possible that there are such very different experiences out there with what is ostensibly the same product. Maybe it&#x27;s not just one cause: bad extensions, broken profiles, old installs with broken updaters (I had a broken microsoft updater causing havoc for a while), badly configured enterprise deployments, etc...')
