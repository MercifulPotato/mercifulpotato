This article ignores another influential architecture that arose from Gordon Bell’s 18-bit PDP-1: the 36-bit PDP-6 that turned into the 36-bit “mini mainframe” PDP-10 and later -20 series that were the default research machines for major research universities corporate research labs, and in particular ARPANET development. In fact network byte order is big endian because these machines were.<p>The PDPD-10s were also the first “lisp machines”: two 18-bit addresses fit in a single machine word, and several lisp primitives were single instructions.  The instruction set was compact, regular, and fun to program in.')
