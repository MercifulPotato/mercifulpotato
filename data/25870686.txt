Amongst which is the radio. This will drain the battery. Slowly, but surely. If I don&#x27;t use the car in 14 days, it (probably) won&#x27;t start; but with this wiring it does, just fine.<p>Which is why I installed a [don&#x27;t know the english word]ยน, so that my battery is switched off entirely. Everything in the car is fine with that. Except for this &quot;modern radio&quot;.<p>Hiding that switch in a somewhat unexpected place also delays theft. 37 y&#x2F;o cars are easy to steal; this makes it slightly less so.<p>ยน here&#x27;s an image: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hsct.nl&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2014&#x2F;10&#x2F;IMG_8097-247x300.jpg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hsct.nl&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2014&#x2F;10&#x2F;IMG_8097-247x...</a>')
