They moved there because the job opportunities in tech were too hard to turn down.<p>I had some friends like this, they just never really liked the city. Now they&#x27;re all leaving because their job is not making them stay. That&#x27;s fine and I&#x27;m happy they have more choices now.<p>But there&#x27;s a flip side to that. One of my least favorite part of San Francisco was actually that group of people! I loved SF and I was always bothered by the constant complaining by tech workers who were there semi-involuntarily. They weren&#x27;t willing to give the city a chance and instead always wanted to change it to be more bland or more like somewhere else.<p>If a bunch of those people are now leaving and the rent is dropping a bit, all of a sudden I really want to come back. I also think the city will be easier to govern if more of the residents are there because it&#x27;s where they actually want to live.<p>(Note: I was in SF for 6 years, left just before the pandemic for a temporary assignment in London)')
