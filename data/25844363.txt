Eventually it will be as big enough to serve the entire market.<p>In a free market you can still have the government as a market participant of last resort. You don&#x27;t have to mess with the market itself. If only one company is needed to serve the entire market there is no reason for the government to not own a large share in it and steer it. The threat of government control should be a good incentive for companies to not grow too large relative to their competitors.')
