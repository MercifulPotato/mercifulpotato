Item(by='rightthing', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1609452534, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25594815, text='Amazing how the article keeps saying &quot;the vaccine is safe&quot;, &quot;we know the vaccine is safe&quot;, when the actual <i>experts</i>, medical professionals, are the ones with doubts. We keep being told to &quot;listen to the experts&quot;, but when the experts disagree with the politicians, suddenly it&#x27;s &quot;listen to the politicians&quot;.<p>Can someone who disagrees explain why I should suddenly <i>not</i> listen to the experts with skin in the game (hospital-based medical professionals) and instead listen to the same &quot;experts&quot; who said that we should not wear masks and should not close borders? And how many of those experts have publicly taken the vaccine, anyways? Seems almost like they&#x27;ve slotted themselves <i>after</i> the front-line workers.')
