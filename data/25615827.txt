What troubles with Google Maps in India is that every road is considered basically the same and the routes it calculate often tends to be on very bad roads whereas OsmAnd tries to pick the road based on quality&#x2F;main-roads first then side roads. This is very useful in India where many roads have potholes. Major roads (national, state, district highways) are better maintained than the rest. This distinction between roads are clearly mapped in OSM, at least in Kerala.<p>GMaps also tries to calculate the very shortest path possible, but this often is a bad idea in India cause the roads won&#x27;t be that great to go through.<p>Some of the things I like about OsmAnd: navigation-with-voice, speedbump warnings, sightseeing notifications, trip recording+stats, parking area finder, different profiles (walking, driving, browsing etc.) :- all this available offline :)')
