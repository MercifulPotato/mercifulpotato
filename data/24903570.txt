Partisan politics like to paint things as black and white but they&#x27;re a lot more grey than that.<p>Similarly R-side folks might believe that all D-folks are Trotskyists while that&#x27;s a rather rare stance to have - certainly the D-side is more towards interventionalism - but nobody with serious power on the D end of things (not even <i>bernie</i>) is advocating for a planned economy.<p>I feel very strongly about moving towards proportional representation for the house over FPTP slotting.  I think the extremism in the current political climate is largely fueled by this us vs. them choice - get us better representation so we can all see that Trotskyists pull one or two house reps nation-wide and slice off of the Dems at large... And watch the white-supremists and westboro baptist church folks get kicked out of the GOP at large and end up with a seat or two themselves.  These are fringe groups[1]...<p>Our current voting system allows negative campaign ads to be just as effective as positive ones - knocking your opponent down 3 pts is the same as raising yourself 3 pts... but it&#x27;s far easier to craft negative campaign ads so the electorate is constantly submerged in hateful vitriol.  We need election reform so we can stop viewing each other as the enemy.<p>1. Please note, the current administration has actually started embracing these groups more, but this is a new development and should be a clear signal that the country is in trouble.')
