The words &quot;white people&quot; or &quot;racism&quot; or &quot;Urdu&quot; or &quot;Pakistan&quot; aren&#x27;t referenced at all in the article and are personal opinions.<p>Don&#x27;t take it as an insult, take it as a suggestion that you&#x27;re not on topic. If you want to talk about how the world is out to get white people, that&#x27;s fine for a different venue (lots of places on Facebook for instance) but let&#x27;s stay on topic on Hacker News - and the article at hand.')
