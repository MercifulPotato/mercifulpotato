Thank you for detailing it so clearly.<p>I&#x27;ve never used Drafts and I&#x27;m curious about how do you keep your files organised after a session. You write a sort of recap of what you&#x27;ve learned, that&#x27;s clear. But how are the other 3 files grouped together? Only by date or timestamp? Do you ever go back to or search through your old files?<p>Also, another curiosity:instinctively I would keep my study material on the iPad and take notes on the laptop. What&#x27;s the advantage in doing it the other way around?<p>And thanks again!')
