History isn&#x27;t shaped by considerations such as &quot;x has some common traits with y and therefore x and y should be treated the same&quot; (leaving aside the whole discussion of what actually constitutes common traits).<p>Case in point, you had a question which you couldn&#x27;t answer through that method. I gave you an explanation that explains the need for another method (study of the historical events in their context); you came back insisting that history should bend to your will. You might be surprised to learn that doesn&#x27;t work like that, eventually.')
