After pulling out of F1, Honda has announced that they&#x27;re going to be an engine supplier for Indycar.  Technically, it&#x27;s a different division of Honda (Honda USA) but this greenwashing of why they left F1 leaves a bad taste in my mouth.<p>They&#x27;re leaving because they&#x27;re not successful and they&#x27;re dumping a bunch of money in the sport.<p>Edit: I made a mistake they&#x27;ve recommitted to supplying engines under the new hybrid rules that indycar is adopting in 2023.')
