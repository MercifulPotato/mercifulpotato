And probably running a pretty mainstream browser that was updated regularly.<p>If your only requirement is that you should be able to put your code on a website and your mom should be able to visit a link and run it, then the web is already significantly ahead of where Flash was.<p>Of course, the accessibility of <i>creation</i> is a problem, but if you send someone a link to a canvas-based animation, they are more likely to be able to play it today than they ever were in the days of Flash. They can even play it on mobile. Unless you&#x27;re doing something very experimental, they&#x27;ll likely be able to play it even if their computer&#x2F;browser is out of date.<p>I mean, if we&#x27;re simplifying this down to the common experience, the way people consume HTML games and Flash games is literally the same -- they visit a link. I have self-hosted remote playtests of the current game I&#x27;m working on by putting the game on a static page, and that is just as accessible to playtesters as anything that I was ever doing when I was building Flash games. <i>More</i> accessible, because now I don&#x27;t have to send people to a wiki to get the game playing on Linux.')
