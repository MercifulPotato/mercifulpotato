I am loving the Ads I get in youtube now that google doesn&#x27;t know what I am interested in they have noting to do with anything I care about. It&#x27;s wonderful. DDG still has a way to go for really technical queries. I just can&#x27;t get the same results about this error or that in Java. Until then I&#x27;m 100% DDG for personal and 100% google for work.')
