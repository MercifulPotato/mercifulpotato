I think this is a big deal, because it will mean that all the innovation on the bleeding edge will happen on other platforms then the MAC.<p>In WIN&#x2F;Linux land loads of people are innovating, on hardware for all these things, OS features, applications, peripherals (Like VR). On the Mac side almost nothing can happen unless one company makes it happen. A single company have limited resources and most of all attention span.<p>The problem with controlling everything and doing everything yourself, is that you have to be the best at everything. In the long run you will fail at something. My guess is that the GPU is where Apple will fall behind first, and where it will be most obvious. They simply dont have the muscle and inclination to go head to head with nVidia on GPUs.')
