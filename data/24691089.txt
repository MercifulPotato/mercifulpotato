Our wants and likes are (probably) physically implemented as a sequence of electrochemical reactions; almost certainly with nothing more than electromagnetism.<p>So which instantiations&#x2F;states of the electromagnetic field experience feelings and desires?  Are they held in the energy potential or in the energy transfer, or both?  Is it enough to have a sufficiently complex feedback loop simulating&#x2F;predicting itself?<p>The answer is likely to be both sort of simple but also profound. Eventually we&#x27;ll have an a-ha moment studying electrocardiographs or FMRI or individual neural networks and be able to replicate experience in other electromagnetic substrates, and knowing precisely what we are, in a sense, will be pretty neat.<p>Then what will we really know about experience?  Is it truly in the electromagnetic field or does it exist in the mathematical relationships that determine the evolution of the fields?  That might be a question we never definitely answer from an outside perspective, but is endlessly fascinating to me.')
