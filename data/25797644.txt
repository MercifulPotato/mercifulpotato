I wrote a long response at the time [0]. I find it interesting that that&#x27;s his title (&quot;Why numbering should start at zero&quot;) but it really only makes sense as an argument (that starting at 0 is best) <i>if</i> you accept that this is the proper notation for ranges:<p><pre><code>  a &lt;= x &lt; b\n</code></pre>\n<i>If</i> you accept that, then the rest of his argument follows. But if you use:<p><pre><code>  a &lt;= x &lt;= b\n</code></pre>\nThen 1-based (where a = 1) indexing actually makes a lot of sense as well, because the other reasons for selecting his preferred range notation fall away. 1-based is only &quot;weird&quot; <i>if you use his range notation</i> because then you describe ranges as:<p><pre><code>  1 &lt;=  x &lt; N+1\n</code></pre>\nWhere N is the length of the range. But, if you use the second form:<p><pre><code>  1 &lt;= x &lt;= N\n</code></pre>\nIt reads fairly well.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25723676" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25723676</a>')
