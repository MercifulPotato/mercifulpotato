I like using a REPL though.<p>For very interactive, experimental work I like having code in one pane and a REPL in another separate one - so that you can highlight and send snippets of a file to the REPL with a keystroke or two, and the code and results aren&#x27;t mixed together.<p>RStudio or Vim Slime[1] would be my favourite examples of this kind of approach.<p>For more &quot;static&quot; literate programming, I prefer the way RMarkdown and Sweave work to Jupyter Notebooks (though I don&#x27;t even use R anymore). Both have their strengths and weaknesses of course.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jpalardy&#x2F;vim-slime" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;jpalardy&#x2F;vim-slime</a>')
