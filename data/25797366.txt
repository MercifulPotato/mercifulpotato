Where for a wiki, a group needs to agree on a shared mental model and work together. For note taking, I don’t want to preemptively think in a common model so that I can easily share 1% of my thoughts.<p>This is actually exactly what we are going for with the notecard + multi-parent hierarchy system – a hybrid of the two. You structure your own cards however you want, and if someone shares a card with you then you can easily integrate it into your own structure. So you have shared <i>content</i>, but not shared necessarily <i>structure</i>, which is generally a requirement of other collaboration tools like Google Docs or Notion. But it is also very important to us that even if you are not collaborating &#x2F; sharing at all, Supernotes is still a great tool to use for PKM, it just really shines (we think!) when you also want to do granular collaboration.')
