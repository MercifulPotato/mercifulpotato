If your experimental apparatus can only measure a value with precision plus or minus one tenth, it&#x27;s inappropriate to report your results with digits out the thousandths. Doing so would make it seem more precise to the reader, but the additional precision is an illusion.<p>In much the same way, using software in 2020 to guess what things &quot;really looked like&quot; can give viewers a false impression of how much we actually know about what things really looked like.')
