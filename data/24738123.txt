In fact, if a name becomes a simple everyday word the trademark can actually be lost.<p>Thats the reason Google used to discourage people from saying Google it because they were worried they would lose the trademark to the name.<p>What one can do is apply for a trademark to a common word to be used in a specific well defined context where it’s clear it’s applying to your company.<p>And once you get a trademark you don’t automatically own it forever. You have to actively use it and defend its use.<p>Of course, much like anything else in the world, there will be edge cases where the situation is murky and other cases where the outcomes appear outright wrong to most impartial observers. But that’s an artifact of the inherent complexity in trying to balance the various needs as opposed to a problem intrinsic to trademarks themselves.')
