It keeps the poor people (denser housing) out. It keeps the transit stops away. It keeps the power station away.<p>&quot;Bad policy&quot; it may be, if your goal is &quot;the cheapest aggregate housing for everyone,&quot; but talking about getting rid of Prop 13 without all the other causes of NIMBYism will just get your expensive houses slowly replaced with expensive condo buildings and do next to nothing for the poor and homeless. We have exactly zero politicians or parties in this country who are telling us what &quot;good policy&quot; would look like on this issue.')
