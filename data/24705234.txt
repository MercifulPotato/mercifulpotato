A corporation is owned by people, when the corporation makes money, that money, one way or another, ends up in the hands of people who pay progressive tax on it. If you think that the government isn’t making enough money off of corporations, the answer is to raise capital gains taxes.<p>Progressive income taxes on corporations are bad policy for many of the same reasons that corporate income taxes are bad policy in the first place. Corporations are artificial constructs and they have a really easy time reorganizing to behave in artificial ways to shed tax burden. Institute a progressive corporate income tax and watch as every major corporations spontaneously transforms into hundreds of micro-corporations that own each other’s stock, and “contract” all of their responsibilities to each other without changing anything except to increase inefficiency and make internal job transfers more complex. Just tax people and be done with it, taxing corporations <i>is</i> taxing people, just with an added incentive for wasteful tax-avoidance.')
