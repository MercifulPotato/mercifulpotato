Export only symbols intended to be called from outside, with a prefix, problem solved.<p>From TFA:<p>&gt; This is a great opportunity to remind everyone: don’t use generic function names like this in your shared libraries, at least not in your exported symbols! You could easily run into a situation similar to this one. In my opinion, prefixes are definitely a good idea for your library’s exported symbols. In this case, both libusbmuxd and Samba were breaking that guideline.<p>&gt; (...) dynamic libraries on Linux export all symbols by default unless you specify otherwise.<p>&gt; libusbmuxd already fixed this on their end quite a while ago — they now only export functions intended to be public, which have a usbmuxd_ or libusbmuxd_ prefix')
