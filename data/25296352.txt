They&#x27;re doing a great job. They&#x27;re not perfect.<p>That may be so, but again that doesn&#x27;t really apply to the M1&#x27;s performance as <i>hardware</i>.  If the article was about Apple as an investment, or Apple as the designer of the next computer for me, I&#x27;d agree that taking into account their software would make sense.  But the whole point of the article is that equating Apple&#x27;s being Apple with the M1 being a badly designed chip is wrong.')
