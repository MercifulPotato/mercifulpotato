In my experience doing entity matching&#x2F;record linkage across all the different music APIs:<p>- Discogs seems to have the most <i>complete</i> release data.<p>- MusicBrainz has the best <i>organized</i> encyclopedic data. For example they have entities for specific instruments, relationships between artists, entries for supporting roles like recording engineer, etc.<p>- Wikipedia still has the best common-sense&#x2F;canonical info about singles. For example, Wikipedia will tell you in the first sentence (or infobox) &quot;song X was first released on album Y in year Z.&quot; Answering that can actually be quite challenging on other services.<p>- Spotify is the go-to for finding useful qualities of individual songs (due to their acquisition of Echo Nest). Things like popularity, danceability, energy, etc.<p>A long-term project of mine has been wrapping all these up in a more approachable API. So far that has only resulted in this big GraphQL schema project: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;exogen&#x2F;graphbrainz" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;exogen&#x2F;graphbrainz</a> â€“ but the idea is to build on that and make it even simpler.')
