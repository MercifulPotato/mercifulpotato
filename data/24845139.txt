IMHO that&#x27;s the best long-term solution.  Moves glacially slow, though, since there&#x27;s a large engineering cost that needs the coordination of each major browser vendor.<p>I was a big fan of Polymer&#x2F;WebComponents in 2014, but they kinda dropped the ball.  In hindsight I wish they&#x27;d just implemented the React API directly in the browser.  (Though depending on how Google vs. Oracle goes in the Supreme Court, maybe that&#x27;ll become illegal, sigh.)')
