There&#x27;s no way to predict how your app will behave on another system with another theme.<p>So personally I think the mess of overused dummy css classes in the GTK ecosystem is really a bad design. They could&#x27;ve gone with custom, namespaced, ui elements instead of that box.something.something shit.<p>They reinvented divitis. Quite literally.')
