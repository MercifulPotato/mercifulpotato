Should Zynga buy back those items at a lower price because they are used items?<p>2. What happens to cars (because we love car analogies) when the manufacturer stops building spare parts? In this case they are either collected from old cars or somebody else build those parts. Maybe should Zynga at least try to sell the game infrastructure with data? That would be like relying on third party spare parts but the car keeps going. Of course if nobody buys the game, maybe even for free, that&#x27;s it<p>3. Other ideas?<p>By the way, this isn&#x27;t the first time an online game shuts down and players lose everything, right?')
