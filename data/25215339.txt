But far from all of them. Think about all the arguments about which technology is best. Or the worship of people like Steve Jobs, famous for being unreasonable and uncompromising. Or the continual brushing aside of societal balance when it&#x27;s a shiny new technology or a company on the rise.<p>Even as a person big on incrementalism, I believe that there&#x27;s a lot of benefit in being uncompromising in long-term goals. Look at Toyota and their &quot;one piece flow&quot; concept, which they&#x27;ve been pursing for decades. I also think the people who seem unreasonable in the moment turn out to be right in the long term. Look at Google launching when people thought search was basically a solved problem. Or Dropbox. When they were getting going many saw them as entering a crowded market with a too-simple product.')
