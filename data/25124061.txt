I doubt a regular old 1Gbps business class connection will cut it there (I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d shut you off after a few days of uploading like that).<p>Despite another post that cited a large budget for NYPD, most agencies are cash-strapped. Telling them they need a $thousands&#x2F;month internet connection at every precinct isn&#x27;t going to go over well.<p>I&#x27;ve been to several PDs (think suburban city - probably like the majority of agencies) where their entire &quot;internet infrastructure&quot; consisted of a Comcast cable modem screwed to a sheet of plywood on a wall.
