This accounts for all of the multi-color e-ink readers on the market now.<p>AcEP is 4 pigments <i>per cell</i>, so you get full resolution and better saturation and contrast, but terrible refresh rates.  Last I saw for ACeP it was something like <i>15 seconds</i>.  Presumably this 2nd generation is much faster, but I haven&#x27;t seen anything that actually says how fast.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eink.com&#x2F;color-technology.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eink.com&#x2F;color-technology.html</a>')
