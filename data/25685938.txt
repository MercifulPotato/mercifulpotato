The talk shows are red for &quot;generally unreliable&quot;, politics and science are yellow for &quot;no consensus&quot;, and everything else is green for &quot;generally reliable&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that they didn&#x27;t do a similar split for CNN or MSNBC.  The summary for both networks says to consider talk shows as &quot;opinion pieces&quot;, which should not be &quot;considered reliable for [...] statements asserted as fact&quot;, but then why aren&#x27;t they split out as separate sources?')
