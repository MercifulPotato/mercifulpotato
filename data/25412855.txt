An optioned out Model X costs as much as a house. The type of person who can afford that couldn&#x27;t care less if gasoline were $10&#x2F;gallon. It&#x27;s a status symbol, on top of just being a great car. It wont be until they are competing in the sub $30k market that an EV purchase will ever be driven by economics.')
