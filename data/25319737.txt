Sometimes the programs to help people just don&#x27;t exist. I&#x27;ve been fortunate enough never to find myself in that situation, but I realize that is mostly circumstances that I had no control over. I grew up in a stable home, fell into a career that suited me and paid well, and didn&#x27;t develop any health issues that made it impossible for me to work. Consider yourself lucky it hasn&#x27;t happened to you either.')
