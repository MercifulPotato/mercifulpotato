Exams are essentially a giant distraction and stressor on the whole learning process, but they are also essential for the first objective. Deep, foundational course material is basically mandatory for the second objective, but the first objective prefers material closer to vocational training.<p>For the first objective, parents and students know that the best institution is the most prestigious one. For the second one, the best institution is the one with the best researchers and teachers.<p>For the first objective, it&#x27;s better (if you can afford it) if the course is incredibly expensive. The biggest predictor of success is the wealth of your parents, so when your peers all have wealthy parents, you are likely to be connected to a large number of successful people.<p>For the second objective, it&#x27;s best if school is free, so the truly interested and talented are not excluded.')
