Counterfeit, bait and switch, commingling inventory, all of that doesn&#x27;t matter because the transaction volume going out is still greater than the refunds and unhappy users.  Way past the point of return for that to hurt business.  I agree with you though, I only shop amazon for simple stupid things I cant find local, I don&#x27;t even buy name brand there anymore.')
