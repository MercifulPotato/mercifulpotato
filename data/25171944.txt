Not &quot;we need to be on call continuously, 24&#x2F;7, meaning we can&#x27;t ever be off the grid or unavailable&quot;. Many other industries have the idea of being on-call, and they are &quot;expected to give up our personal lives at a moment&#x27;s notice&quot; when they know they are on-call. (For example, my brother in law is a surgery tech; he&#x27;s had to take off during family outings more than once)<p>Also, if this happens often enough that it&#x27;s a serious problem, this says a lot about the quality of the code you own.')
