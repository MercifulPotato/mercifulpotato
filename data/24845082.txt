The newer features of JS are generally added <i>because</i> they are less complicated than the features they&#x27;re succeeding.<p>For instance, &quot;var&quot; may seem easier, but &quot;const&quot; is definitely less complicated. &quot;var&quot; has unintuitive edge cases with closures that &quot;const&quot; does not. `var` is also scoped to the nearest function rather than the nearest block, a &quot;feature&quot; that has tripped up many a new JS developer. `const` has none of these surprises.')
