I&#x27;ve got Crohn&#x27;s, and have had more colonoscopies than I can count since age 13.  About 75% of the time, I&#x27;m throwing up due to the prep.  The prep is the <i>WORST</i> part.<p>It has gotten better over the years.  If you go for one, do <i>NOT</i> let them give you the jug full of powder.  I&#x27;ve had much better luck with prep-o-pik.<p>The other PITA is they generally won&#x27;t let you go for the procedure by yourself, since you&#x27;re under anesthetic and don&#x27;t trust you to get home OK.  That means you have to find a friend who is willing to wait 2+ hours for you.')
