Item(by='analog31', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612027339, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25956128, text='I first learned BASIC in high school, learned Pascal shortly after that.<p>I think a great thing about Pascal was its origin as a teaching language. As a result, the textbooks placed a heavy emphasis on learning good programming techniques, and the language supported those techniques. I think maybe it&#x27;s no mere coincidence that good teaching tools also become good general tools for those of us who are not destined to become full time pro&#x27;s.<p>Learning BASIC and Pascal side by side was a great lesson in how to write good code, because you could make your Pascal programs so much more readable and organized. Even today, if any human has a faint hope of reading and using my code (in Python or C), it&#x27;s thanks to the skills I learned from Pascal.<p>When I got my first computer, a non-PC-compatible MS-DOS machine, I remember my dad asking me some vague questions about it. He had heard us talk about Pascal (my mom and brother both learned it), and the Wall Street Journal had a glowing article about it. He had no idea what it was, but got me it for my birthday. And it followed the &quot;rules&quot; of MS-DOS, so it ran on my weird computer! No graphics, but who cares, I was up and running with Pascal.<p>I found a magazine article on how to attach a serial port to my computer, wrote a terminal emulator in Pascal, and found an old 300 baud modem. I was able to complete my computer assignments from my dorm room. In FORTRAN.')
