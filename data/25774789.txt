Item(by='torginus', descendants=None, kids=[25776788], score=None, time=1610620820, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25774484, text='I&#x27;m not American, so I don&#x27;t really know about the SAT, but I&#x27;ve seen SAT scores matched up to IQ scores many, many times. I would think the SAT (or any entrance test) measures how well a given student mastered the high-school curriculum. For me this can mean 2 things:<p>- The SAT indeed measures studiousness + intelligence, in which case, deriving IQ scores directly from it is highly misleading.<p>- The SAT is a decent proxy for IQ, which would indicate that universities have a very dim view on secondary education, and basically your intellectually gifted slacker can walk into a SAT exam, and easily outdo their less gifted, but hardworking peers.')
