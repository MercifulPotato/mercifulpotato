Item(by='saiya-jin', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607498235, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25355623, text='For us etsy filled the need for a cheaper, scarce alternative to an item for our baby that wasn&#x27;t available where we live. Import fees and taxes would make price jump to ridiculous levels if sent from abroad.<p>Its kind of busy house made from wood, having tons of small trinkets to play with, ie switches, velcro, rubber bands, windows etc. All the stuff kids find in the house and spend so much time playing with compared to actual toys.<p>The stuff we found and ordered is hand-made in Lithuania, costs 50% of the &#x27;original&#x27; montessori one (not sure if that&#x27;s their idea though), looks much more solid since its made from much thicker actual wood.<p>Same for a ring I bought few years back for my wife - she found it, unique and appealing to her like no local could. Didn&#x27;t cost much. I guess what you describe - something unique, that someone skilled&#x27; time and effort went into, compared to machined mass production.<p>This has a lot of value, ie carpenters are very well paid where I come from. If they are business savvy, they easily trump some software consulting in income.')
