From now to 2050 we&#x27;re looking at a 0.5 C change in average temperature. You could also say change in sea level will be relatively small as well.<p>Averages are funny, and that&#x27;s a global average so it&#x27;s more pronounced at the higher latitudes. But still it&#x27;s half of what we&#x27;ve already done since 1900. And as a percentage change in temperature in a given region, it should be fairly small.<p>Just intuitively it doesn&#x27;t make sense that relatively small changes suddenly produce such disparate outcomes when they haven&#x27;t to date.<p>Looking into the numbers a bit from what was shared above, I&#x27;m not wrong. 1 billion is the upper end of an estimate, with 5 million at the lower end. That&#x27;s a very wide range.')
