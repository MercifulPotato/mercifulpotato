Plenty of people get ill without ever going to the doctors and brush it off as a normal flu, and even if they did, the doctor may just brush it off as a normal flu. The term &quot;you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know&quot; really holds true here, so being the first to detect an illness or publish it does not mean that it where it was originated. I mean the 2009 H1N1 flu was first detected in the US, but originated in Mexico, the 1918 swine flu originated from a US army base, but was first published by the Spanish, hence it has been wrongly labelled as the Spanish flu.<p>I also have no idea why people have this notion to reject that COVID-19 may not have originated from China, especially the fact that most of the spread of COVID-19 came from Europe, so much so that Gov. Cuomo actually called it the Europe virus. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scmp.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;united-states-canada&#x2F;article&#x2F;3097766&#x2F;new-york-governor-cuomo-calls-coronavirus-european" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scmp.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;world&#x2F;united-states-canada&#x2F;article...</a>')
