If AZ felt reasonably sure they would lose that dispute (i.e. that it were found that they were reneging on contracts), then they might as well decide to renege equally. Regardless, AZ is making a _choice_ to interpret this as not reneging and they might very well be legally found to be in the wrong. They could just as well make the choice to admit they are reneging and do the same on other contracts out of fairness and equality (as well as political expedience).<p>&gt; The hangups seems to be if &quot;Best Reasonable Effort&quot; means includes invalidating contracts with other countries.<p>Honestly I don&#x27;t understand how it possibly couldn&#x27;t. At least not unless EU negotiators screwed up the contract. Otherwise AZ could simply just over-promise and then leave the EU high and dry. I mean that&#x27;s basically what the EU is arguing is happening here. Of course the contract might not have been worded that way (e.g. in the case where it was determined that AZ were meeting its obligations), but I&#x27;m sure if this came up at any time during contract negotiations, then I&#x27;m sure the EU would have said that of course other contracts can&#x27;t be given precedence over theirs. Also given that the contract seemed to treat the UK production as part of the EU for this very reason, it really really seems the EU would have meant for this interpretation.')
