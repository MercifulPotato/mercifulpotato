So whilst the R number and how it is calculated may be down, I&#x27;ll not place my caution upon such `good` news.<p>After all this R of below 1 is based upon a reduction in those testing positive and 3 weeks of a country lock-down and you would expect that number to reduce, otherwise your whole reason for a lock down would be proven to of been futile.  So that&#x27;s good, lock downs do work - science shown that here(again).<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;guidance&#x2F;the-r-number-in-the-uk#other-key-statistics" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.gov.uk&#x2F;guidance&#x2F;the-r-number-in-the-uk#other-key...</a>')
