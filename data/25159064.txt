It seems to say that 300W is the energy needed on the rough terrain, <i>not</i> the energy consumed by the bumps: &quot;We measured the power required to pedal the bike at 32.2 km&#x2F;h (20 mph) using an SRM crank.&quot;<p>Then it goes on to measure the energy required on the smooth pavement and it&#x27;s around 230W. So around 70W of INPUT energy is needed because of the strips.<p>Now if speed is constant, it stands that a part of these 70W are converted to <i>vertical motion</i> (the rest lost to heat in many forms). This is where I don&#x27;t dare to understand thermodynamics enough to even make an (un)educated guess of how little of those 70W are converted to vertical motion.')
