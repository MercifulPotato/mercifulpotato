One of the things I’ve been mulling over is computers, as I’d like to build or buy a new computer at some point in the not-too-distant future to replace my current dying laptop. How much power does your Mini-ITX machine use when <i>idling</i>? And have you tried to optimise it down?<p>I’ve been thinking of things like the AMD Ryzen 9 5950X, shutting down most of the cores when I want to conserve power in addition to severely underclocking it a lot of the time, but so that at times when power is more readily available or if I’m compiling lots of stuff, I can go all out.<p>I see figures for the last few generations of desktop processors of the whole machine using something like 50W when idling.<p>Meanwhile, I see a laptop with a 49Wh battery and an AMD Ryzen 5 4500U advertising ten hour battery life for a web browsing workload—which means that it’s averaging 5W for the computer <i>and</i> screen, when doing even a little bit more than idling.<p>So then I think, these desktop computers can’t <i>actually</i> be idling at that much power, right? That’s over a kilowatt hour per day if left on full time! Or at least, there must be some way of instructing them to use far less power, like a laptop would? (It’s a long time since I’ve dealt with a desktop computer to the level of knowing about power consumption.)<p>I’d love the power of a top-end desktop processor and to pair it with a carefully chosen and placed screen, but if that means an extra 50W or more of drain while it’s on, I might need to go with a laptop to make it through the winter.<p>(Many DC–ATX power supplies wouldn’t deliver enough power, but I believe <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mini-box.com&#x2F;M4-ATX" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.mini-box.com&#x2F;M4-ATX</a>, rated at 250W (300W peak), should be just barely sufficient for a typical machine with any of AMD’s 105W CPUs, like the 5950X, and a 60–75W GPU like the AMD Radeon RX 560 (as powerful as you get before requiring an external power connector, which I haven’t spotted a DC power supply supporting, though I haven’t looked too hard), at full load. But slightly reducing the envelope of the CPU or GPU would probably be a good idea.)<p>Perhaps I should ask Metabox for details about <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metabox.com.au&#x2F;store&#x2F;Prime-Ai-Range" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;metabox.com.au&#x2F;store&#x2F;Prime-Ai-Range</a> (from the Clevo ODM) and what power it uses when idling. I’ve never seen a 230W AC adapter before!')
