The law currently says that a platform can moderate material that is &quot;obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.&quot; That &quot;otherwise objectionable&quot; has been interpreted as a catch-all that lets platforms moderate on any grounds at all.<p>The DoJ proposal removes the catch-all and add &quot;unlawful&quot; and &quot;promotes terrorism&quot; to the list.<p>So if you moderate for a reason on that list, you keep the protection. If you moderate for other reasons, you lose it. And yes, I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;d see plenty of litigation on what constitutes harassment, terrorism, etc.')
