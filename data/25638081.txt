That would make sense for them to operate in stealth mode. Tesla sells vehicles to the public (and let&#x27;s be real, Elon is a big PR department). Are these companies producing useful products currently? It seems that you&#x27;re implying that they are and that we (me) aren&#x27;t aware of them, so I&#x27;m curious if you could expand on this and enlighten us. I do know investors are dumping a ton of money into bio-tech, just not aware of products that are being sold.')
