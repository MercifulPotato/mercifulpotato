A missile needs to be able to be launched at a moment’s notice by a small group of airmen. They use storable propellants, or quick fueling technology to launch within minutes of getting the order in any weather conditions, from one of many secret or mobile locations. A Falcon 9 on the other hand requires a mini army of engineers, hundreds of millions of dollars of range equipment, and good weather to launch.')
