The idea is if anti-fascism can be associated with riots, protestors, and other scary negative fear based topics, the second anyone raises a concern about fascism, supporters will unconsciously turn a blind eye, because antifa has a negative anti-american sting in their unconscious now.  I&#x27;m surprised such word smithing like that works, and frankly I&#x27;m scared it does work.  I&#x27;m terrified that not only Trump but Fox and other groups would rally behind not only supporting fascist movements, but invent a boogyman as a way to make the topic of fascism partisan and questionable.  If that&#x27;s not unamerican I don&#x27;t know what is.')
