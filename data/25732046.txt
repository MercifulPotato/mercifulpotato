So if you co-located in a large ISP, you will still sign a contract which most of the time they put it very generic morality clause for types of content so they can pull your service at a moments notice.  So even assume you had enough money to get the infrastructure you need to plug into the net, and you usually do this via co-locating and buying net access.  Only way I can think of right now is you&#x27;d literally have to go the the length of setting up your own first tier ISP (like Google, Facebook etc do), which is doable but not cost effective.  Cause outside of that you are either running on someones cloud (AWS&#x2F;Azure&#x2F;GCP) or you are running under a contract of an ISP that has similar terms.  Maybe I am missing another avenue, though, always possible.')
