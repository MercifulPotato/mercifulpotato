Item(by='rossdavidh', descendants=None, kids=[25235456], score=None, time=1606532312, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25227651, text='While I agree that there are professions where thinking unconventional thoughts is especially important, there&#x27;s a flipside to this which is missed in this essay: they&#x27;re professions where being wrong is not catastrophic.  VC&#x27;s can invest in many startups, and a few successes can make up for a lot of failures.  It&#x27;s ok to be wrong a lot, if a few big successes (i.e you were right when everyone else was wrong) can make up for that.<p>But, most professions are not like that.  I don&#x27;t want my surgeon, car mechanic, plumber, or accountant to be the sort who is rarely in agreement with their peers.  If they are wrong half the time about things which everyone else knew the right answer to, but also half of the time they are right when everyone else is wrong, I&#x27;m still much worse off.  Being unconventional is only a good thing if the consequences of being wrong are much less bad, than the benefits of being correct when others are all wrong.')
