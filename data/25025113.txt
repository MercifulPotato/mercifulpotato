I disapprove of it, but I wouldn&#x27;t call them criminals.<p>You can justify doing that by being sufficiently pedantic about definitions, but I don&#x27;t think you gain anything in the public debate by lumping &quot;people who speed&quot; in the same category as burglars, murderers, etc. In most discussions, it&#x27;s not productive to view these people as belonging to the same group.')
