Video playback from Youtube on FF is plain terrible; 720p is barely acceptable in full screen for technical videos (forget movies) and 1080p stutters like a kangaroo with parkinson. The same videos play perfectly under LibreElec&#x2F;Kodi, but due to recent crazy restriction by Google, one is forced to sign up with them to watch videos on YT Kodi addons, while browsers are still ok (for now).\nAlso, Firefox (which I refuse to swap with anything) crashes like 1 in 3 times when I fast forward or backward the video. I keep the crash reporting on so FF devs are likely inundated by reports about the problem, which happens on a stock RPi4 with stock Raspbian and stock Firefox. All constantly updated.')
