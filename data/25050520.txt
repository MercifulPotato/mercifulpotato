You have, though, spent years of your life trying to stir up trouble on HN in an astonishing variety of frankly very creative ways. This misleading story is the latest in that long sequence.<p>Although we&#x27;ve banned you many times in many incarnations, we&#x27;ve always been generous with letting you back into the communityâ€”indeed, generous at a level that most people simply would not believe if they&#x27;d seen what you put us through. That generosity is conditional, however, on you keeping this meta&#x2F;drama fixation <i>out</i> of your posts here. So please stop, and please don&#x27;t restart, not along this line nor any other.')
