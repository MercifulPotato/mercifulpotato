Taking it through clinical trials, regulatory approval and manufacturing is a complex (and massively expensive) process that requires expertise typically only big pharma has (not to say smaller company don&#x27;t roll their own, they do, but they are often slower and sometimes stumble).<p>And this is to not downplay BioNTech&#x27;s role.  Proving that your idea works in biotech takes some massive cohones.  No doubt they took a ton of shit on their way to this point.')
