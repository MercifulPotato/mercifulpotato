Social solutions (convincing people to behave in a way that reduces their environmental footprint) only get you so far.  We need technical solutions (more efficiency in the entire economy) such that people can eat fish or beef and drive in cars (or have access to functionally equivalent or superior analogues) at lesser environmental cost.  The &quot;western lifestyle&quot; (moving target, I  know) needs to scale because even if the west manages to reduce consumption enough to have a good impact the masses in developing nations are certainly not going to settle for the status quo let alone a reduction in consumption.')
