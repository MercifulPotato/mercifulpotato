You said circuit board which gives some leeway to creative interpretations where PCB is just a subset of circuit board and thus there are non PCB types of circuit boards. However, since the amount of circuit board like components on every Raspberry Pi is zero you must be talking about a definition of circuit board that is extremely uncommon.<p>I tried to make this as painless as possible.<p>My actual conclusion is that you haven&#x27;t seen enough single board computers (SBCs) to know that SBC is a well defined category.<p>Intel NUC? Not an SBC because the memory is not soldered on the mainboard. Intel atom mainboards? Not an SBC because the memory is not soldered on the mainboard.<p>Raspberry PI? An SBC because everything is on the mainboard.<p>Smartphone? Possibly, although they are just advertised as smartphones so nobody buys them for their SBCness. The emphasis is that you usually buy the board itself when you want an SBC.')
