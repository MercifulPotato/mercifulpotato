It was horrible - mostly because I was teenager and didn’t have anything interesting to say. It also wasn’t easy and took forever to get anything done. (So just slap an in construction gif in it.)<p>Now I can build anything I want quickly.<p>Writing raw html is very inefficient. If you want a friendly to create content, use Markdown.<p>If you want to structure your content or have some standard components, use React.<p>Use a static site compiler like Gatsby - that combines it all and makes your site compete with any hand-written html and still contain lazy-loaded interactive elements.<p>My blog is a perfect example: I can write my blog posts in markdown, paste images in as needed, run a build script, and push the changes. It takes about 1 minute to build and deploy.<p>But, at the same time, I can hide an entire text adventure terminal simulator in the header bar (that lazy loads on click).<p>My site loads as fast as any static site, but it transforms into full interactive quickly.<p>Best of both worlds.<p>So I can produce well formatted content, cool components, or even multiplayer games - it’s perfect.<p>We have a paradise of tools - it’s a creator’s dream - (once you figure out the right combination)<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ricklove.me&#x2F;cool-stuff" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ricklove.me&#x2F;cool-stuff</a>')
