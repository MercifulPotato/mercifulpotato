If you went for <i>sequential</i> IDs instead (whether directly, from AAAAAAAAAAA to ___________; or permuted so that sequential numbers yield visually-random outputs), then yeah, 11 base64 characters nets you 2⁶⁶ possible IDs. Even 8 base64 characters would be ample for almost every purpose, 2⁴⁸ being around 281 trillion.')
