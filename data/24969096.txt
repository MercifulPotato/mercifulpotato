So there are a couple of possibilities:<p>* The mainstream media is unsuccessfully hiding something from you.<p>* You yourself are getting a biased version of this story, treating it as ground truth, and then treating any alternatives as suspicious.<p>I&#x27;m in no position to tell you which possibility holds.

Even if I happen to know personally, that makes me part of the mainstream.')
