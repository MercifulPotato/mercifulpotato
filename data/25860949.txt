The other is that in generally doing case-insensitive stuff for non-ASCII is language-dependent.<p>For example, in English &quot;i&quot; and &quot;I&quot; are case-insensitively equal but in Turkish they are not: &quot;i&quot; is case-insensitively equal to &quot;İ&quot; (U+0130) and &quot;I&quot; is case-insensitively equal to &quot;ı&quot; (U+0131).<p>So if you wanted to do full-unicode case-insensitive things you would need to decide what happens with &lt;DİV&gt; or &lt;dıv&gt; and whether it depends on the language of the page or what.  Doing ASCII-only case-insensitivity sidesteps all that, while admittedly privileging English over other languages.')
