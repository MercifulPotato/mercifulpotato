They are alleging  instead a violation of the anti-circumvention provision of DMCA which is not covered by takedown notice procedure. The letter is also missing several required elements of a takedown letter which makes sense because it’s not a takedown notice nor does it purport to be one.<p>It’s just a letter making demands that cites the DMCA. It carries no legal weight other than the implied threat of a lawsuit.')
