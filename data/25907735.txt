I then use Wagtail Bakery to publish the pages to S3. I then change the task count on the ECS service to 0. For a DB I use sqlite in EFS, so it&#x27;s persistent and backed up.<p>I was previously running on an EC2, and cut the cost from about $15 per month to ~$1-2 per month. All I&#x27;m paying for is &lt;1mb S3 storage, a single route 53 hosted zone, and one image in an ECR repo.<p>If I want to add content, I spin up the ECS task again and work away. Note that part of the reason for such a low cost is my website get VERY little traffic :)<p>Apart from the cost, I also have the advantage that it&#x27;s lightning quick most of the time, with caching provided by CloudFront.')
