Especially because I gave two real solutions that make a lot more sense and you dismissed them out of hand because they&#x27;re &quot;partisan&quot;, when they&#x27;re absolutely the opposite. both my solutions make a lot more sense from an objective standpoint, because they preserve the due representation and one of them also preserves the original intent in making DC independent.<p>It&#x27;s kinda mindblowing that you can&#x27;t identify your own hypocrisy right off the bat and actually posted this comment.')
