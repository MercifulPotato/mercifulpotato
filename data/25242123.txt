Schools needed a new revenue source when states cut funding and college enrollment skyrocketed. They turned to government loans to avoid raising taxes.<p>I&#x27;m not a history buff but this is how I interpret us reaching out current situation. Undischargeable loans is debt slavery and should be abolished. The very purpose of bankruptcy is to prevent situations like this.<p>The realistic outcomes are either government bailing itself out on discharged loans (after all, the school has already been paid). Or, probably a better decision, increasing state school funding to the dollars per student that existed in decades prior.
