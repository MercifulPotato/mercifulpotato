Sometimes it reminds me of cellular automata, at least the very high resolution ones that stabilize into cellular-looking blobs. Are these trained on some input data or is it parametrically produced somehow? It&#x27;s been a few years since I was reading about GANs so I can&#x27;t really put together how you&#x27;re getting the images and textures here.')
