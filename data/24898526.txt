Insofar as Amazon can fire you, they&#x27;re no different from any small business.<p>Well, not quite. If Amazon fires you in the first few years of working there they&#x27;ll demand part of the signing bonus back.  That may not be wage garnishment but I know firsthand that it feels coercive to people in that situation; a fine for quitting a job is awfully close to indentured servitude.  I quit as soon as that period had past but I would have quit a year earlier if not for that policy.<p>And speaking of indentured servitude, H1B workers have it even worse since quiting or getting fired might get them deported, not merely fined.')
