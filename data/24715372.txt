(coming from an aston martin db7 convertible).<p>it&#x27;s the quickest car i&#x27;ve ever driven, by far. instant acceleration.<p>it&#x27;s better than the day i bought it. my car has learned to do <i>a lot</i> of things through software updates. my aston had a nav system that was obsolete the day i bought it (new), and criminally dinosaur-land by the time i sold it.<p>hands-down best nav system of any car i&#x27;ve ever been in, and that&#x27;s something you use with every drive.<p>hands-down best infotainment system. i have tunein, podcasts, radio, bluetooth, all on a giant screen that makes it super easy to pick entertainment while driving.<p>autopilot rocks, especially on highways. driving from florida to boston and back within a week was really no big deal. no way i could have done that in any of my previous cars without being exhausted.<p>it&#x27;s surprisingly large for a car that&#x27;s so stupidly quick. it fits five adults, plus a giant trunk in the back <i>and</i> a small trunk in the front. 0-60 faster than you want or need.<p>convenience is off the charts. you get to the destination and you just leave the car. it takes car of turning itself off, turning off the lights, and locking the doors. every time i rent a car now i am reminded just how many &quot;things&quot; you have to do each time you enter&#x2F;exit. easier to not have to think about it.<p>it&#x27;s got remote control. i can set the climate, make the car move, or trigger my garage door to open all from my phone. i can also track it when i park it via valet.<p>speaking of valet, it has valet mode, so when i drop it off the car&#x27;s acceleration and top speed is limited, and the glovebox and frunk can&#x27;t be opened.<p>i never have to stop at a gas station because it charges at home. so i always have a full &quot;tank&quot;. it&#x27;s surprising how awesome this is.<p>the list goes on... it&#x27;s just a really phenomenal car.')
