When I quit Facebook, I first started disabling my account but that didn&#x27;t work, at all. It just brought me back. Every time. I realized it wasn&#x27;t a feature for deleting account, it was a pressure relieve valve for people who need a quick break because they felt the service had taken control of too large a portion of their lives. FB didn&#x27;t want people to quit and they didn&#x27;t offer such feature.<p>I started by unfollowing my friends. In the process I saw FB&#x27;s algorithms get more and more desperate in giving me dopamine spikes via the notifications earth symbol. &quot;Friend of a friend is attending an event&quot;. Really FB? I then deleted all of the chat histories, sent my phone number to peers and asked them to contact via Signal&#x2F;WA in the future. \nI then removed the friends and finally when I got enough of the few public groups I discussed in it was easy enough to let go.<p>I first changed the email to some 10minutemail account, and then changed the password to something I didn&#x27;t know. When I then hit &quot;disable account&quot;, it was hard for FB to guilt trip me with &quot;X Y and Z will miss you :((&quot; -- there were no friends to recommend. All this sounds like a lot of work, and especially deleting FB&#x27;s chats histories was, because the web client was buggy or &quot;buggy&quot;. The chats kept coming back. But that made me want to delete them even more.<p>Quitting FB made a huge difference in the quality of my life as it removed 99% of FOMO and envy wrt. my peers&#x27; lives.<p>2. Add the Leechblock extension to your browser. Set the tab to close every time you type the time wasting URL. It&#x27;s a nice instrumental conditioning.<p>3. Quit services cold turkey when you can. &quot;Use in moderation&quot; sets you up for failure. This is because the services learn about your habits every day and they become extremely good at guessing what content keeps you in. E.g. youtube has recently switched to a new search function that improves its search results based on your previous searches. It&#x27;s scarily accurate. Many of my peers said they noticed it too but didn&#x27;t think too much of it.<p>4. You are being actively manipulated. The companies deliberately design the applications as addicting as possible. See <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=11dYx_rW_Ks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=11dYx_rW_Ks</a><p>No wonder a smartphone -- that&#x27;s a collection of such apps -- is so addicting. Realizing this and the fact the dopamine spikes are artificial, helps you a long way.<p>This also applies to games. Every &quot;headshot +100 points&quot; is such a tiny dopamine spike. Games didn&#x27;t used to have those. Your AoE villagers didn&#x27;t announce &quot;+1 wood&quot; when their axes hit a tree. Consider such features in a game an attempt to manipulate you. If you can&#x27;t disable the them in game, think of it as the insult to your intelligence it is, and uninstall it. If necessary, once such features are disabled, it&#x27;s easier to see if the content of the game is a good way to relax and balance out the day&#x27;s hard work.<p>5. Disable notifications from every app on every device. Notifications are a massive distraction. &quot;I&#x27;ll be reachable when it&#x27;s convenient for me&quot; is a good way to think about it.<p>You&#x27;ll be surprised how much stuff you can get done when you don&#x27;t hang around in group chats, reading headlines, arguing to get Reddit internet points etc. for the entire day.<p>6. Catch up on the big news via Wikipedia&#x27;s &quot;In the news&quot; section, not via news sites littered with celebrity gossip, craving for your clicks. It&#x27;s dry for sure, but there&#x27;s no better source in catching up with e.g. the ongoing conflict in Tigray. It&#x27;s also easier to avoid trivial propaganda when majority of stuff is sourced, and people are keen in adding &quot;citation needed&quot; when there is no proper source.')
