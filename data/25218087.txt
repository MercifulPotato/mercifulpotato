The frequency, duration, and the trend towards unskippable ads has been extremely sharp, at least for me.  Their implementation is also fairly bad; in spots where my wifi is not great, I frequently have the video reset to an unwatchably low quality after an ad, and buffer for 10+ seconds, even though pre-ad, everything was working just fine.  Their paid offering is probably OK, but slightly overpriced IMHO (e.g. when compared with NetFlix), especially for a family - and I would be more inclined to go with it, if it wasn&#x27;t for their heavy-handed advertising of that, too.<p>With the lack of competitors, I suspect most people will stay; but there&#x27;s definitely something to this.')
