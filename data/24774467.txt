Companies pay a worker what is necessary for him to stay working for them.<p>Even a remote-first company is in competition with on-site companies when it comes to hire&#x2F;keep workers. So they need to pay the local market rate for each worker, otherwise he&#x27;ll go work for someone else in his area.<p>In the same way, they can afford to pay less to a worker moving to an area with a lower market rate, because he won&#x27;t find a better alternative without moving.')
