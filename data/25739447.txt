This is the tweet:<p>&quot;The whole point of protesting is to make ppl uncomfortable.<p>Activists take that discomfort w&#x2F; the status quo &amp; advocate for concrete policy changes. Popular support often starts small &amp; grows.<p>To folks who complain protest demands make others uncomfortable... thatâ€™s the point.&quot;<p>As others have noted, there&#x27;s nothing there about violence or riots.<p>However, the more important point is comparing what AOC and others have said with what Trump said at the rally on Tuesday:<p>&quot;Now it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy. And after this, we&#x27;re going to walk down and I&#x27;ll be there with you. We&#x27;re going to walk down--<p>We&#x27;re going to walk down. Anyone you want, but I think right here, we&#x27;re going to walk down to the Capitol--<p>And we&#x27;re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women and we&#x27;re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.<p>Because you&#x27;ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong.<p>We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated. Lawfully slated.<p>I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.&quot;<p>He said a lot more, but I don&#x27;t see anything there about riots or violence.<p>BUT THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE.  Trump and his enablers have been carefully and meticulously lying about this the election.<p>I&#x27;m not saying AOC and other progressive leaders haven&#x27;t lied about stuff.  I have little doubt that they have.<p>But there&#x27;s a fundamental difference in the magnitude and implication here.<p>While Trump no doubt choose his language very carefully to not cross a particular, bright line, the <i>net effect</i> of everything he and his enablers have done have crossed that bright line.')
