Their specification allows chip manufacturers to write their own extensions using the &quot;custom&quot; opcodes.<p>The Kendryte K210 is a RISC-V-compliant CPU. It has off-core components, such as what they&#x27;re calling a KPU The ML and GPU cores are controlled via I&#x2F;O, not by the CPU directly. These are called platform-level components. In general, this uses MMIO with a hard-wired memory address to control. You can see the KPU (their ML accelerator) here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;s3.cn-north-1.amazonaws.com.cn&#x2F;dl.kendryte.com&#x2F;documents&#x2F;kendryte_datasheet_20181011163248_en.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;s3.cn-north-1.amazonaws.com.cn&#x2F;dl.kendryte.com&#x2F;docum...</a><p>See section 3.2.<p>I think the extensions are meant to be modular. Right now, not many embedded devices allow for the H mode, and hypervisor-ing is still in development. Currently, I know of Machine mode, Supervisor mode, and User mode, but since the change from 2018 to 2019, they have really started to ramp up the virtualization ISA support.')
