I&#x27;ve had many about undergrad and grad school, though. It&#x27;s been more than a decade since I graduated from grad school.<p>However, I&#x27;ve also had plenty of nightmares about my first job. It&#x27;s never about my <i>performance</i> or my co-workers, mind you, but about my immigration status back then. Currently, in my (virtual) room of co-workers, many are also immigrants; I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised that they&#x27;ve had similar nightmares.')
