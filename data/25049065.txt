I&#x27;m currently working on a little side-project and I wanted to write (part of) it in Go. As a side-note, the last time I wrote Go was all the way back when I made a few small contributions to the http standard library, circa 2009. As soon as I set up my environment, my gears were already turning (coming from Python, TypeScript, Java, etc.): how should I <i>structure</i> things? Where should <i>this</i> live? <i>What</i> should be calling <i>what</i>, and where should things be passed <i>from</i> and <i>into</i>?<p>And, like a breath of fresh air, I started remembering how Go works: it&#x27;s a very simple, stupid language -- in the best possible way -- and it just <i>works</i>. You start writing code, and then you write more code. You write a function. And then you write another one. Slowly, your program gets bigger. Sometimes you need to split up functions.<p>And that&#x27;s it. No fiddling with project structure, with taxonomies, and with hierarchies. I forgot what it felt like to just sit down and <i>write some code</i>. I&#x27;ve gotten used to battling tooling, fighting with opinionated frameworks, and having a zillion ways of doing something -- stuck in an eternal analysis paralysis.<p>I missed Go.')
