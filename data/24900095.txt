In no reasonable way does the &quot;book publisher model&quot; resemble the &quot;social media model&quot;.<p>The &quot;social media model&quot; is far closer to discussions you would have in a coffee shop or at a dinner party. Starbucks doesn&#x27;t need to listen in on your conversations and kick you out if they&#x27;re not disturbing anyone else.')
