Item(by='awb', descendants=None, kids=[25741691], score=None, time=1610406061, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25736240, text='In both of the racial examples, people are attempting to correct past injustices. BIPOC people never received a court settlement for the injustices against them. Politicians left it up to citizens on how to repair the damage, so to do nothing seems far short of adequate, but it&#x27;s a fair debate about how far to go.<p>How many black people still alive today saw signs that said &quot;No blacks allowed&quot; back in the 60s? I guess your neighbor saw the Buy Nothing post as basically saying &quot;No whites allowed&quot;.<p>I could see the original poster&#x27;s intent being &quot;I&#x27;m sorry BIPOC that you haven&#x27;t been treated as fairly as I have, and I want to help&quot;. Calling that discriminatory is a bit harsh, but I&#x27;m sure that doesn&#x27;t feel good to a non-BIPOC person who&#x27;s struggling and could really benefit from the item.<p>I think there&#x27;s a concerted effort since George Floyd to understand the plight of BIPOC people and help them feel safe and respected in the community, where they at times have felt the need to be invisible to be safe.<p>It&#x27;s like doing a fund raiser for indigenous people, trying to acknowledge that a group has been wronged and trying to help that group feel respected again.<p>But it&#x27;s a fine line for sure. At the point it becomes an anti-white thing rather than a pro-BIPOC thing, the conditions change dramatically.')
