And, oc rouse, we have to be honest enough to admit that sometimes it <i>can</i> be a bad thing. We can all point to examples of toxic behaviour and nepotism as a result of people sucking up and playing politics.<p>However, humans are social creatures, and we get things done by cooperating with eachother, so I think it&#x27;s fair to argue that those social skills are also pretty important for building software.<p>Like any other social activity or grouping, that can work well, or it can be toxic, but the need for those social skills as a software engineer isn&#x27;t inherently evil. Likewise, the fact that people with &quot;better&quot; social skills often &quot;do better&quot; isn&#x27;t necessarily wrong either because those skills are incredibly important for any cooperative endeavour, and particularly for leadership.')
