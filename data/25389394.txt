In 2012, I was _impressed as hell_ when the SSD MacBook Air would fully boot OSX in 1 minute 30 seconds, being used to computers taking minutes to start and then spending even more minutes being unusable with the HDD thrashing like hell. These days my Linux desktop computer boots in around 10 seconds (much faster than either Windows or macOS on similar hardware, but at least on windows the boot time improvements have been incredible too). My desktop literally boots in less time than it takes for my DP monitor to power on from zero and start displaying frames.<p>This is the wrong year to complain about boot time.<p>I remember being on an airplane with no wifi and a brand new MacBook Air and spent most of the time idly turning it off and on, since I was really impressed :) . And today that &gt; 1 minute boot time I would consider crap.')
