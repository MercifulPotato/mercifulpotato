And, before one answers this hastily, think about it.<p>Your point is well taken.  Certainly there are issues and problems that gravely trouble people of integrity and good conscience.<p>However, while sometimes there are things we can do within our own lives to address those issues and problems, often there isn&#x27;t any way to have a measurable impact.<p>That&#x27;s not to say we should just give up.  On the contrary, I think it&#x27;s important to try to improve the lives of those around us within the scope of our focus, abilities and resources.<p>When I was a young man (in my twenties), I would often wonder if the work I was doing (tech) was really making the world a better place in a serious way.  That really bothered me for a while.<p>But I came to realize that while we can&#x27;t all have a measurable, <i>global</i> positive impact on the world, we most certainly can have a local positive impact on the people and world around us.<p>Do I create better working conditions for people in Bangladesh?  No.  Can I genetically engineer a more effective SARS-CoV2 vaccine?  No.<p>But I can treat those around me with respect, act with integrity and support my community.  I can do constructive work within my chosen profession.  And I can speak out when I see injustice, intolerance and hate.<p>Will that end the pandemic or halt the war in Syria or end world hunger and poverty?  No.<p>But if I can do my part to lift up those near me, act with honesty and integrity and create <i>constructive</i> solutions for the projects I contribute to, I can be satisfied that I&#x27;m having a positive impact on the world around me.<p>None of that requires that I be willing to <i>die</i> for that, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m not having a measurable, positive impact on the world.')
