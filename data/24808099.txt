Race is currently one of the strongest predictors for how long people wait in line to vote even when you control for poverty [1].<p>Sadly, I don&#x27;t see it happening without a change in our political landscape.  The Senate has been actively blocking legislation to restore the voting rights act for the past 315 days [2].  This is the legislation introduced in the 1960&#x27;s to prevent racial discrimination in elections at the height of the civil rights movement.  Unfortunately, enforcement has been stripped out over the past few decades making it completely toothless.  The tragedy, is that the legislation to restore its power isn&#x27;t even being blocked because of discussions and legislative differences that can be worked through.  It is being blocked by the majority leader just refusing to even hear or vote about it.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mavenroundtable.io&#x2F;theintellectualist&#x2F;news&#x2F;study-race-one-of-strongest-predictors-of-how-long-people-wait-in-line-to-vote-yNpTfGliv0KGkaITp4y2jg" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mavenroundtable.io&#x2F;theintellectualist&#x2F;news&#x2F;study-rac...</a><p>[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.axios.com&#x2F;john-lewis-voting-rights-senate-5fb8d35c-bac0-447c-a9ff-25603d96a901.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.axios.com&#x2F;john-lewis-voting-rights-senate-5fb8d3...</a>')
