Is the investor a friend of your cofounder or more neutral?<p>If they&#x27;re a neutral party, it might make sense to get them involved, or at least threaten to get them involved.  You and your investor could potentially vote out your other cofounder, and knowing that might make your cofounder change their tune.<p>On the flip side, if the investor is a friend of your cofounder, be aware that they have a lot of leverage here and could vote <i>you</i> out.')
