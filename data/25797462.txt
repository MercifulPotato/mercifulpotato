I think JSX is a horror show.<p>We&#x27;ve been trying to remove view from logic since the 90s, and move towards declarative views with data binding. Keep your nook and crannies away from the presentation layer.<p>But all the industry wants is shoving PHP in the browser.<p>I think it&#x27;s sad. We&#x27;re making the UI layer always more complicated.<p>Let&#x27;s say your UI changes, like a redesign... you can rewrite your component and probably need to change most of them.<p>If your UI was just dumb and declarative and the data was salt on top, changing the UI is trivial.<p>The UI should declare what the UI should look like, not describe how it should do it.<p>This is why, as an old timer, I much prefer the direction VueJS took.<p>Edit: great lib though, anything small is a win.')
