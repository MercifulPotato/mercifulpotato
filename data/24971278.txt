Cause that is often more expensive than the resources themselves.  Could just be &quot;because that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re familiar with&quot; (and that&#x27;s not illegitimate as cost savings), but could be actually better dashboard UIs, APIs, integrations, whatever.<p>[I am currently investigating heroku for our low-traffic tiny-team app, after we had our sysadmin&#x2F;devops position eliminated. The performance characteristics are surprising me negatively (I can&#x27;t figure out how anyone gets by with a `standard` instead of `performance` dyno, even for a small low-traffic app; currently writing up my findings for public consumption), but the value of the management they are doing so we don&#x27;t have to is meeting and exceeding my expectations. (We currently manage our own AWS resources directly, so I know what it is we can&#x27;t do sustainably anymore with the eliminated position, and the value we&#x27;re getting from not having to do it).]')
