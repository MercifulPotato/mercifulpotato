Also the graphs are old and don&#x27;t show the newer higher-speed charging.<p>Also, you could charge depending on the distance to the next stop, because overcharging could slow you down.  It slows you down by taking longer to charge to higher charge levels, and also by not draining the battery low enough so the next charge will start closer to zero where charging is fastest.<p>another unrelated but still interesting article is power consumption vs speed:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.abetterrouteplanner.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;entry&#x2F;22-tesla-model-3-performance-vs-rwd-consumption-real-driving-data-from-233-cars&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.abetterrouteplanner.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;entry&#x2F;22-tesla-m...</a><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.abetterrouteplanner.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;entry&#x2F;9-tesla-model-s-consumption-vs-speed&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;forum.abetterrouteplanner.com&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;entry&#x2F;9-tesla-mo...</a>')
