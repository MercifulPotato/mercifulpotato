Like if I want to find the regression fit is there a way to just pass in the data and have it trained,tested on all of the regression algorithms in SKLearn? My current workflow is to just pick a handful of algorithms that sound like they should be good for  the problem at hand and try each one of them manually. Igel seems like a step towards making this sort of thing possible if another tool doesn&#x27;t exist already.')
