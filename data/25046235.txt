There was a period of time where 2FA was synonymous with SMS, and a further period of time where using a hardware key or authenticator app required setting up SMS first.  I&#x27;m trying to clean it up, but it&#x27;s a mess out there.  Some accounts require a phone number and don&#x27;t have an option to disable SMS as a option.')
