They aren&#x27;t yet offering Apple Silicon on the 16&quot; because it isn&#x27;t clearly better than the current Intel version, and would have elicited comparisons that aren&#x27;t as glowing.<p>I&#x27;m thinking specifically games, CAD, and video editing. Even Final Cut Pro workloads (running natively) seem to be faster on a 16&quot; MacBook Pro than on an M1 13&quot; MacBook Pro based on the initial reviews on YouTube today. Sure, an M1 machine could do it consuming less power, but who cares? People buy a 16&quot; because they want speed.<p>I think they will need redesigned high-performance cores for the 16&quot; and the higher-end 13&quot; [or 14&quot;]. Simply using more of them probably won&#x27;t cut it.<p>And MacBooks are not just used in dev environments. They&#x27;re used in education, finance, media, government, and many other sectors - and some of them do want to be the last to switch. If the performance gains aren&#x27;t dazzling, they can&#x27;t be convinced to switch sooner. And if they stay on Intel, they can even be convinced to move back to Windows.')
