This does not include my equity package.\nI am a mid-level engineer and I don&#x27;t lead a team.\nI have seen a few offers in that range. In my experience they are for companies that have the HQ in SF (with offices in Berlin). These are often large companies (300+ people) with a product that has reached product market fit, have good funding, high growth rates, brand names, late stage&#x2F;pre-IPO startups, tech public companies, etc. Basically any company that is used to paying high salaries for engineers.\nThese are companies that deliberately aim to be in the top percentiles of compensation in any market. These aren&#x27;t companies that claim to pay &quot;competitive salaries&quot;.\nNaturally there aren&#x27;t many of such companies (that is why they are in the top percentile) but you can find them if you look around. They are always hiring. The recruiting processes may be a bit more challenging but they are not rocket science.')
