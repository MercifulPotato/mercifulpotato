It eliminates the possibility for dialogue, empathy and learning<p>You essentially block yourself of improving yourself by realising you might be wrong about something<p>It sounds to me like you think of a national economy as a household budget. Taxes are income and welfare is expenses, you take loans from banks, which have interest and needs to be paid back or you get punished<p>It&#x27;s a nice and simple explanation, which also happens to be 100% wrong<p>Government debt have no interest and there&#x27;s no creditor who needs to be paid back. Whenever the Swedish government prints 100 crowns, it goes 100 crowns more into debt<p>Whenever it gets 100 crowns in through taxes it resolves 100 crowns of debt<p>National debt is not the same as private debt. They&#x27;re two completely different things, that unfortunately have kind of similar names<p>National debt is simply the amount of the national currency in circulation. To be &quot;debt free&quot;, Sweden would have to remove every single crown from circulation, which obviously is not a good idea for the economy<p>Additionally - the government does not use taxes to fund spending. Swedish crowns are essentially worthless to the Swedish government, because they own the money printing press and could make infinite money if they wanted to<p>If parents setup a system for their kids, where they get small paper notes for doing chores, which can be traded in for the daily WiFi password, the notes have no value for the parents and the WiFi would work without the kids paying chore notes, but they&#x27;re still useful because they facilitate the &quot;doing of chores&quot; and have value to the kids because of the &quot;WiFi tax&quot;<p>In other words the purpose of taxes is to create demand for the currency to match the supply the government is creating by printing more money. By having a demand for the currency, the government can use it to pay people to do &quot;chores&quot; it wants done by simply turning on the money printer, then collecting taxes at a later date')
