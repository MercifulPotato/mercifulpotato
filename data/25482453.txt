In particular, Flurly charges no monthly fee &amp; only takes 1% of each transaction, which is 5x cheaper than competitors like Gumroad.<p>I hope this can be useful to online sellers in the hacker news community. I believe more money directly to creators is net good for the world. Some may wonder how I plan to make money on this. It&#x27;s a fair question. My current plan boils down to two key factors:<p>1) Cost efficiency. By utilizing technology platforms like Stripe&#x2F;Firebase&#x2F;Vercel&#x2F;Algolia&#x2F;Sendgrid, I can amortize the cost. Or in other words my costs grow with revenue&#x2F;usage. This way, I don&#x27;t need to buy physical hardware servers, or negotiate deals with banks or write my own database, or spend time on SRE. Also since it&#x27;s just me, I don&#x27;t need to pay for employee health insurance, benefits, etc.<p>2) Volume. Hopefully by lowering the cost of doing commerce, more people will buy and sell, increasing the overall volume of commerce. Since the commission is on the overall volume, hopefully I can recoup some revenue&#x2F;profits that way.<p>Please let me know if you run into any issues and I&#x27;ll look into it right away<p>Thanks!')
