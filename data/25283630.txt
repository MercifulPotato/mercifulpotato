Same with &quot;hey google, fuck this song&quot;.  I don&#x27;t know if it explicitly &quot;downvoted&quot; the song or not, but the song was immediately skipped and I hadn&#x27;t heard it any time soon after.<p>That said, I&#x27;ve refrained from using my google puck in recent months and it had been regressing pretty heavily when I did, so I can&#x27;t guarantee that still works.')
