Of course it will outperform Databricks and Snowflake shared-disk model as the data is colocated on the compute nodes so it doesn&#x27;t have to travel anywhere.<p>Good luck on your budget trying to scale up shared-nothing database and making it scale up and down based on workload without downtime.<p>You can achieve significant speedup resembling shared-nothing databases by pushing the data close to the query using caching. Snowflake does it out of the box as it maintains table metadata. Databricks can do it too, but you have to be careful and it sucks.')
