There is an explanation here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;feross&#x2F;safe-buffer#why-is-buffer-unsafe" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;feross&#x2F;safe-buffer#why-is-buffer-unsafe</a><p>I created `safe-buffer` as a demonstration of how the API could be fixed to be safe. Then, the ecosystem adopted `safe-buffer` as a polyfill to get that safety even before `Buffer.from()` and `Buffer.alloc()` were included in Node.js. And to this day it continues to be used to provide safety in older versions of Node.js which lack the newer APIs.<p>tldr; We fixed Node.js and made it safe for you. But, by all means, feel free to continue mocking me and the volunteer work I&#x27;ve done for the community :&#x2F;')
