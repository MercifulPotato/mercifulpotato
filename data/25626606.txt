You have try&#x2F;catch statements and side effects are often used.  It&#x27;s not a no-side-effect language.<p>- Parentheses are almost always managed with parinfer&#x2F;paredit and python-style indentation rules in production code I&#x27;ve seen.<p>You&#x27;re quite right that performance will be tied to the JVM or V8&#x2F;SpiderMonkey&#x2F;etc.')
