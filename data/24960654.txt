Drinking is forbidden, that&#x27;s agreed upon, as far as other drugs go its up if the person is following teachings of any religious scholar.<p>Smoking is therefore not considered forbidden (haram) in the same sense as alcohol. I am a little too sensitive to drugs and smoke and betel leaves (&#x27;paan&#x27;) make my head go south just as much.<p>So it correctly is issue of education I would say.')
