But each one of them is also part of the European Data Protection Board, which ensures the consistent application of data protection rules throughout the EU.<p>I can understand lawyers speaking with one of the regulators, and been told about the ePR &quot;ePrivacy Regulation&quot; proposal that looks to repeal the ePD &quot;ePrivacy Directive&quot;.<p>But we live in a sane world (at least here in the EU) where impactful regulations and directives don&#x27;t change overnight without any notice and implementation period. The ePR &quot;ePrivacy Regulation&quot; draft suggests a 24-month transition period, similar what happened with GDPR which was agreed in 2016 and went live in 2018. So the earliest ePR will take effect as of today is 2023.<p>Having some &quot;lawyers speak with the EU&quot; about some unannounced &quot;internal material&quot; that &quot;need to happen right away&quot; doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>So no, I don&#x27;t see how your or Facebook changes were influenced by ePD &quot;ePrivacy Directive&quot; from 2002&#x2F;2009.')
