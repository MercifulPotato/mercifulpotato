You should definitely work in the spin department of the hegemons.<p>I think it&#x27;s simply that free speech isn&#x27;t good for business. Partially because of tarring by association with &quot;outrageous&quot; opinions you didn&#x27;t snuff out on your totally-not-public-utility-nor-monopoly platform, but mostly because if you don&#x27;t have free speech, you have controlled speech, and you need $$$omebody to do the controlling, which means money and intimacy with regulators (powaaa)')
