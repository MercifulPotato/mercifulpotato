No, not even McDonalds or Pizza Hut. Doesn&#x27;t matter how fresh or clean the food or restaurant or bakery look.<p>I love meat and dairy - avoid these both things while in Pakistan (KFC is alright). Only drink canned cold drinks (Try to do as locals -- they prefer &#x27;white&#x27; &#x2F; transparent cold drinks over coca cola.  Only drink boiled water (or mineral water from some large supermarket&#x2F;pharmacy&#x2F;hotel). And avoid eating salad after sunset -- don&#x27;t know why, just don&#x27;t.<p>If you can, take dried instant oats&#x2F;ramen noodles&#x2F;etc. and chuck them into bowl of boiled water. Fruits and veges are good - just make sure you wash your fruits such as apples and grapes thoroughly with cooled boiled water &#x2F; mineral water before eating them.<p>Finally, if you do get diarrhea in Pakistan, DO visit the local clinic and get some medicine prescribed. It will help you feel better much faster then trying to &#x27;brave it out&#x27; or relying on some simple medications from back home.')
