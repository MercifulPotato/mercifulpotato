Item(by='mistermann', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604339615, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24970731, text='&gt; I&#x27;m much more concerned about the inverse, not people getting fooled by fake content, but believing that anything that doesn&#x27;t align with their views is fake. We can end up in a post truth society where someone like Trump, Duterte, Bolsonaro or Orban can claim that any footage that is not politically advantageous to them is fake and created by an evil opposition to hurt their cause.<p>I believe the optimum approach is to be concerned with all risks, and weigh the magnitude of each in a state of careful self-monitoring of one&#x27;s potential biases (and ideally, have your conclusions reviewed by others, preferably from a diversity of ideologies and perspectives in an attempt to minimize the well known affects of groupthink).  Noteworthy to me is that a significant number of people (if not the majority, depending on which community you are in) are easily able to see the epistemic errors in their outgroups thinking, but has more difficulty in doing the same within their ingroup.<p>For example, in your comment it seems that you have noticed shortcomings when it comes to politicians of one general ideology, but I wonder if you are of the belief that this phenomenon <i>does not</i> occur across all ideologies?')
