It&#x27;s not 10x better though. A single developer wrote most things back them for a single customer.<p>We had text with attributes, colors, images, all of that under Windows 3.1 and later. When you deployed a program, you knew it was going to run in Windows, on 640x480 or larger... maybe as big as 1024x768 if the user had thousands of dollars for a nice graphics card and a big Sony Trinitron Multisync.<p>We had multiuser databases, like Access, that allowed all of the users of a system to share data across their organizations.  Programs were shipped on disks, either floppy or CDs.  They then worked forever.<p>The Waterfall Programming model was meant as a joke. On the small scale, I did it once... the program took 2 months from start to finish... the customer was happy that we met the requirements, but then wanted more.  We negotiated a deal and I spent the next year doing rapid prototyping (agile?) on site, with lots of user testing. That application deployed with hardware in one site visit, and was usually run forever after that with only the occasional phone call, or field trip for faulty hardware.<p>Things are NOT better today than they were.  In Delphi, for example, every function had a working example included in the documentation. You didn&#x27;t need to search Stackoverflow every ten minutes... it just worked. The fact that the deployment platform was known, and you had control over the code all the way made things incredibly easy to ship to a customer and support over the phone.<p>Today, I can write applications in Lazarus&#x2F;Free pascal, and ship them in a single zip file. The customer&#x27;s screen looks exactly like mine does, there&#x27;s no need to worry about dependencies, internet connectivity issues, etc. Recently I reached back into my archives from 1994 for a string function I wanted... and it worked.<p>Things are mostly just different today, not mostly better.')
