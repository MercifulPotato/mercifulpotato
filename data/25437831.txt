Should Oracle throw out its docs for Java because it&#x27;s a large language that&#x27;s man-made and designed for easily writing softwareâ€”but lots of folks here think it&#x27;s not good?<p>&gt; start to concentrate on defining HTML+CSS subsets (such as for purely static docs, for light content apps, and so on), to distribute simple static text via alternate p2p protocols<p>And this will still require docs, and tutorials, and information about the P2P protocol, and how it&#x27;s kept secure and ~anonymous, and how to facilitate discovery, and how to avoid a network partition, and how to build non-static tools like search engines, and how to securely interact with those tools, and how to do archival work, and a million other things that make that system an ecosystem...it&#x27;s not easy to build a resilient distributed network that actually works.<p>The fact of the matter is that people use the web whether you think it&#x27;s good or not, and having decent docs for it is important. Nothing is stopping you or anyone else from building an alternate web, but so far there hasn&#x27;t been anything that people actually care to use.')
