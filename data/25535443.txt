Fortunately Logic has a great feature where you can &quot;Freeze&quot; a track to a &quot;bounced&quot;&#x2F;rendered audio file -- if you want to make edits to the effects, you can un-Freeze, make your changes and re-Freeze.   Only downside is, this takes up precious time when you&#x27;re trying to be creative&#x2F;productive.  :)<p>These days everyone expects to be able to just layer on 8 effects on every track but.. that&#x27;s a pretty recent luxury.  Back when computers weren&#x27;t really powerful enough out of the box to do stuff like that you could get dedicated DSP cards like Universal Audio&#x27;s &quot;UAD-1&quot; PCI card, which let you use really high quality effects on your tracks without overloading your CPU.  Now they have newer Thunderbolt&#x2F;USB-based outboard stuff to do the same thing.<p>Regardless, most people in audio know you never buy the brand new hardware (especially when it&#x27;s on a new processor architecture) and expect to be able to do everything as effectively before.  It takes a while for all the third-party software vendors to update their stuff and make it run smoothly, assuming the software team is still in business or still working on that product.  There&#x27;s a ton of great stuff we&#x27;ll never get new updates of.  This is why you&#x27;ll sometimes find pretty old computers in musicians&#x27; homes...  There&#x27;s still one cool granular synthesis app I can think of for Mac OS 8&#x2F;9 (th0nk) which was never updated for anything newer, for example.')
