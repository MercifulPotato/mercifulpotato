Item(by='valbaca', descendants=None, kids=[25972049], score=None, time=1612034345, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25970877, text='My pet peeve is the incorrect definition of the &quot;10x dev&quot;<p>The &quot;10xDev&quot; is one that&#x27;s 10 times more effective than the <i>least</i> effective developer; NOT 10x the average dev nor 10x the median dev.<p>The 10x is the absolute best versus the absolute worst.<p>It&#x27;s not the good vs the bad.<p>Honestly there&#x27;s no surprise here. What field doesn&#x27;t have such a major difference between the most talented vs the least talented? The discussion is overblown.<p>From Peopleware:<p>&quot;Count on the best people outperforming the worst by about 10:1&quot;<p>&quot;Count on the best performer being about 2.5 times better than the median performer&quot;<p>&quot;Count on the half that are better-than-median performers out-doing the other half by more than 2:1&quot;<p>Most &quot;10x dev&quot; articles should really be using &quot;2.5x&quot; if they&#x27;re comparing the best with the median. Again, a 2.5x difference between the good and the bad is again, not surprising.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that the study Peopleware uses is from 1985 and sampled about 600 devs. The amount of pixels spilled over this basically ancient software study is honestly hilarious.')
