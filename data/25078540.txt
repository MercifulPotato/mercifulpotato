Doesn&#x27;t the idea of having two separate houses come from British Westminster system?<p>The Westminster system is supposedly the basis for my country (Australia&#x27;s) parliament but I believe we also have taken influences from other systems and have incorporated some things that aren&#x27;t common anywhere else (like compulsory voting) our constitution comes from 1901.<p>I could be wrong, but I think the main difference Between US system and ours is how the leader is appointed. The US directly votes for president, where as here the winning party (Based on number of Lower House seats won) appoints the leader. Our Prime Minister is much more beholden to the party he belongs to where in US presidents gets to Veto stuff - I think.')
