Is a block contained in a single platter or does it spread across all platters and read&#x2F;writes from all heads at the same time?<p>Dual arms would be handy if the drive had a RAID-like checksumming scheme between platters. If a platter is corrupted but is still readable&#x2F;writable (it wasn&#x27;t a head malfunction), the drive could rebuild itself without the help of a computer.<p>Even if it is a head malfunction, the data could be redistributed between the other platters, reducing the drive capacity.')
