It is such an inexpensive difference in overall cost versus the benefits of having that headroom.<p>Plus I am sitting at ~26gb used memory right now. I tend to give my VM&#x27;s a nice big 8-12GB chunk of ram depending on what I am doing too, so it is almost like I have two machines in one.<p>The disks and data pipelines on these new machines are so fast though that I do wonder if the RAM&#x27;s responsibility has shifted towards being a giant CPU cache and the disk has likewise shifted into a point where it performs more like RAM.')
