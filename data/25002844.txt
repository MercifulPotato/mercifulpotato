How is that bad? I don&#x27;t want to be stuck on version 68 of Firefox&#x2F;Thunderbird just like I wouldn&#x27;t want to be using Chromium from 10 versions ago.<p>&gt;I won&#x27;t even argue about the harms&#x2F;disadvantages of Snaps and the forcing of them upon users by Canonical...<p>Canonical only forced one snap and that was chromium... Everything else is still maintained as an apt package if required. They put a pretty well explained reasoning as to why it was forced. Namely that it was impossible to maintain the chromium package for 14.04 and older releases because they couldn&#x27;t backport the compiler. Hence the option available to them was to remove the package or keep people supported using snap.<p>Not to mention that Chromium is still a Universe program and not officially supported at all. They didn&#x27;t want to fork over the additional maintenance overhead which I am not gonna complain about.')
