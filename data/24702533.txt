You mean that one terrible company that only exists due to Google&#x27;s pity? Or rather, Google&#x27;s strategic philanthropy so that they can show regulators that they aren&#x27;t a monopoly because Firefox exists.<p>The reason we don&#x27;t see other competitors in the space is because Google&#x27;s (and Apple&#x27;s on iOS) monopoly makes it extremely difficult to compete. I could totally see myself paying for a high quality, privacy-focused, cross-platform, ad-blocker-friendly web browser. I wouldn&#x27;t pay Mozilla, I wouldn&#x27;t pay Google, and I wouldn&#x27;t pay Microsoft, Amazon, or Apple. But I <i>would</i> pay a small software company who isn&#x27;t trying to exploit me at every turn in the pursuit of unsustainable growth (or LARPing in Mozilla&#x27;s case).<p>Maybe not everyone would agree with me, but I&#x27;m sure a lot of people would. Maybe enough to build a sustainable business. I feel like people are forgetting that a company doesn&#x27;t need to be a Google-scale behemoth or monopoly in order to be successful and <i></i>sustainable<i></i>.')
