As I said, it&#x27;s about human rights and there is no room for debate.<p>Sure Turkey and Poland and so on were countries before. And they will be without the EU, no doubt. Being a country does not imply having strong, independent economies. Both Poland and Turkey play their geopolitical role against the EU. They wouldn&#x27;t have to, if there was much else for them rely on, no? You think Poland would fare better than the UK? You think the EU would talk to Turkey, if Turkey wasn&#x27;t conveniently  dealing with those refugees? Have you talked to a person from Turkey recently? They aren&#x27;t exactly happy with what they got.')
