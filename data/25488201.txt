It seems like you think it carries a rhetorical punch to (I guess) suggest that in the cloud version we’d still be slow and make mistakes? The writing is so unclear it’s hard to tell. But if that is what you’re saying, I think you deeply missed the point.<p>Yes of course my team won’t solve bugs instantly just because of cloud tools and of course we will make mistakes implementing bad infra designs, especially early on as we are still gaining experience with efficient and cheap cloud patterns. Nobody said otherwise and my comment before has no connection to anything like that.<p>Rather, if we have control over our own infra, we can adaptively fix those issues for ourselves without getting delays and philosophical or gatekeeper arguments from central data center admins. We would have autonomy to change our own deployment system, provision more compute resources, generalize something to work with GPUs, test out different delivery and runtime frameworks, create our own ingress failure robustness patterns, all without blockages and mandated central infra bottle necks.<p>To create such a configurable and adaptable API-driven portal into bare metal or a data center yourself is way too slow and costly, only the largest companies can do it, and then they turned it around and made it into cloud vendor options.<p>When medium sized companies try to do it, the most common outcome is a ton of exceedingly arrogant SRE types will create piss poor tooling that barely works for maybe the top 2-3 use cases and then will whine and complain that they can’t support generalizing it for the long tail of other use cases, and because they have political power as the gorilla in the room sitting on top of the only interface to the data center, nobody can argue with them, and you get a burnout mill with constant turnover on all the other teams who have to do SRE’s job for them while listening to the arrogance about what a rip off cloud tools are.')
