If you&#x27;re looking for other similar sites, I&#x27;d also suggest taking a look at <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;engineeringblogs.xyz&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;engineeringblogs.xyz&#x2F;</a> too.<p>While the BFD trends site is focused on personal developer blogs &amp; trending posts, that one includes high-quality engineering team blogs too, like Cloudflare and Google Research. It&#x27;s a bit simpler, and focuses simply on the latest posts rather than trending content, but it&#x27;s worth a look.')
