I remember the PowerMac 6100 from 1994 had ethernet, although it required a dongle since 10baseT hadnâ€™t taken over the world yet. I think prior to the iMac, there were a couple models that you could buy without ethernet, on the budget end.<p>What I remember from this era was that networking was much easier to deal with on a Mac, until Windows XP (and 2000) addressed some of the issues.<p>The same was true of audio in the 1980s.')
