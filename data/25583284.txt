Some people think that Tesla&#x27;s autopilot is just great, better than a human driver much of the time.  As a Tesla owner, I am flabbergasted by that.  At best, AP drives like I do.  That is, perfectly straight and between the lines down a straight road.  With any curves, and sometimes just on straight roads, it drives like a high-functioning alcoholic.  I can&#x27;t imagine how some people drive normally where they think that qualifies as &#x27;good driving.&#x27;  Some of us are very attentive drivers -- I never look at my cell phone, I never drink and drive, I don&#x27;t drive when I&#x27;m tired, I avoid driving in inclement weather or at night unless strictly necessary, I am a very defensive driver.  I don&#x27;t get tickets, I don&#x27;t get in wrecks, and this is by design -- I take great pains to reduce my exposure to these risks.<p>Personally I think the old joke about how 90% of drivers think they&#x27;re better than average is both true, and also just a funny joke.  We see a lot of perfectly good drivers on the road, but we don&#x27;t notice them ... because they&#x27;re perfectly good.  There&#x27;s only a few lanes on any given road, though, so if 10% of drivers in near proximity are crappy drivers then it practically shuts down the road.  We notice that, and assume that most drivers are crap.  Wrong.')
