If you want to change your mouse sensitivity, you add a line to a particular file in &#x2F;etc. If you want to autojoin a particular WiFi network, you add the SSID and password to a particular file in &#x2F;etc. If you want to start a daemon on boot... you get the idea. No massive complex configuration systems with giant blobs of XML that nobody understands.<p>Unfortunately the flip side is that things move more slowly — they won’t support Bluetooth until someone writes code that meets the system’s bar for correctness, simplicity, reliability, documentation, etc. — which might be never. But the stuff that <i>does</i> work is fantastic.<p>If hardware&#x2F;software support requirements tie you to more mainstream OSs, I do agree with other posters that Arch is the closest thing to what you want, but it’s still far from perfect.')
