Just a recent example: Navalny posted a link to the video that says that crime rate in today&#x27;s Russia is comparable to the crime rate in Russia in 90s. It&#x27;s an obvious lie to everyone who lived in Russia in 90s.<p>Also, about a year ago Navalny published a video that said that education in US universities is free for everyone (if you don&#x27;t have money to pay, some rich businessman will pay for your education).<p>There&#x27;re tons of examples, usually ignored by the people watching his bullshit. They probably don&#x27;t even know that most of his lies were debunked because YouTube, Twitter, Facebook will never show them any contradictory articles for two reasons: information bubble and manual censorship.')
