She makes illustrations, logos, etc. digitally, using Photoshop and Illustrator. The website will be simple: a collection of images displayed with the works she have done and a contact form.<p>The requirements:<p>- She, as a non-tech person, must be able to \nupload new works (images) to the website (i.e. it must be user friendly, uploading an image to S3 through AWS console is not good enough)<p>- Must support a contact form<p>- The design must be customizable<p>- If it is self-hosted solution, I want to host it on AWS<p>I really have no experience with websites like these and I do not want to reinvent the wheel (i.e. develop something myself), I&#x27;m looking for something simple, I was thinking about using Wordpress, but it feels like an overkill for a website like this.<p>Do you know any tools&#x2F;website builders&#x2F;etc. built for such use cases?')
