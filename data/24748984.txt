If I search for a POI, it typically has no issue finding it and routing me there, but if I enter a street address, I get nothing. Enabling online search after failing to find an address once used to work perfectly (online search uses Nominatim instead of photon IIRC), but they seem to have removed online search entirely in the last update, so now I can only navigate by POI name or cross-street.<p>It might be better in other places, but it&#x27;s a long way from replacing google maps for me.')
