I know HN loves to talk about how much the PMs they&#x27;ve reported to suck, but having worked with many clients on dozens of projects, it&#x27;s rarely that simple.  While bad PMs are definitely way too common, so are bad development teams.  And remember that PMs are usually getting shit on from two directions at once (development teams and management teams) with often very little authority to actually fix things.  It&#x27;s usually bad management practices and attitudes that sink projects and make life hell for everyone, and the cause of that is usually lack of understanding and empathy for how software development works.<p>The greatest PM in the world can&#x27;t help a project if the executive sponsors keep changing scope and requirements or making ridiculous promises to clients to increase sales (and I&#x27;ve seen good PMs quit over this).  We don&#x27;t just need better project management training, we need better management training in general for anyone whose job is dependent on software.  Also, companies need to actually be willing to pay for good PMs instead of pulling the cheapest contractor they can find and acting surprised when regurgitating the PMI handbook doesn&#x27;t actually work.')
