But overall, global unemployment rates don&#x27;t seem to be affected by new inventions, instead new jobs are invented all the time.<p>I mean a shit job that nobody should pursue as a career now is gig economy stuff; underpaid taxi driver &#x2F; delivery person, there have to be millions doing these kinds of jobs now.<p>Anyway I do agree, not everyone can go for the high tech &#x2F; high paid jobs. But the country can accommodate for it; give everyone equal opportunities by funding education (instead of relying on meritocratic scholarships and &#x2F; or lifelong loans (the phrase indentured servitude comes to mind), do a state fund and set price limits on education). Make more jobs viable by raising the minimum wage, restricting the gig economy, setting work hours and day restrictions (e.g. 0 hour on-call contracts), basic worker protection laws and stuff. And finally, applying downward pressure on the cost of living so everyone can live comfortably regardless of job.<p>Everyone should be able to do a 40 hour work week if they choose to, no more than that unless they get paid 150%, and less if they choose to. And people working like that should be able to live in a reasonable distance from where they work.<p>The alternative is the &quot;working poor&quot;, homelessness, working multiple jobs, working 80 hour weeks just to meet bare necessities, etc. This is already the reality for a lot of people.')
