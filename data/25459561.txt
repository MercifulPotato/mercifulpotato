Most version control systems operate on snapshots, but there is at least one that doesn&#x27;t: Darcs. Written in Haskell, it bases it&#x27;s operation on an algebra of patches. Unfortunately, while usable (and neat!) for smaller projects, Darcs has serious performance problems (due to inherent algorithmic complexity) and gets slower with certain operations. Still, one can hope it will inspire a next generation of version control systems.')
