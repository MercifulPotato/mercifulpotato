Then you look for &quot;input&quot; in html which will open for you and change &quot;Value&quot; to the id of the person whose profile you want to write something on.<p>-User password has no character limit, someone pasted the entire content of Pan Tadeusz (Master Thaddeus) polish poem as a password<p>-Half the users are popes (its national meme for some reason)<p>-The other half are fake accounts of government party activists, Trump and other famous figures,<p>- Someone created an account called &quot;login&quot;, after clicking on his profile, we jsut log out<p>- Someone else called himself &quot;delete_account&quot;, after clicking on his profile, we delete our account (and currently it&#x27;s probably the only working method of deleting an account),<p>-A lot of pedophile content passed through the night<p>- barely some managed to receive an activation e-mail, the portal itself crashed after a few hours of operation<p>-Others do not have a problem with it, apparently someone has already set up 500k multi accounts (even after a ban, you can register from the same email)<p>-It seems possible to create an account without a name, without an email and without a password. In the source of the page, remove the required attribute from the input fields.<p>-Sakiewicz is proud of his portal popularity<p>And its all financed with public money.')
