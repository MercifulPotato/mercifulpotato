Item(by='garden_hermit', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604002775, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24934718, text='&gt; Hm, let&#x27;s do a comparison. Do you think trust in the media would have been better or worse if media outlets had received leaked emails from Hillary Clinton&#x27;s campaign during the summer (some indicating, for instance, that some members of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s campaign had conspired to acquire questions ahead of the Democratic debates), embargoed them until after the election, and then released them?<p>It depends! What is the source of the information? Does the source have incentive to fabricate or exaggerate their claims? Can others trustworthy sources confirm the information? Does the information hold up to critical scrutiny? Does the information matter?<p>If the answer to these questions are all yes, then I think the media acted in a trustworthy way. If not, then I don&#x27;t think so.<p>My argument is not that embarrassing information should be withheld because of an an election. Instead, my argument is that news media should not publish any and all information without the due process of journalism. If the claims hold up to scrutiny, then sure, publish it! If the claims don&#x27;t hold up, then don&#x27;t publish it.<p>&gt; &quot;bad-faith actors are afoot (which seems the case here)&quot; -&gt; I don&#x27;t see why the &#x27;faith&#x27; of the actors really has any relevance as to whether the information is in the public interest to know.<p>No, but bad faith actors have an incentive to inject noise into the news cycle, and in turn, have incentive to fabricate or exaggerate claims. Journalists and their editors, when they believe information is given in bad faith, should hold it to a higher level of scrutiny so that they avoid characterizing a story.')
