No, not even with the official tools - those will just sabotage you. The repository claimed to be &quot;FreeBSD src with pfSense changes&quot; does not contain the source code of the kernel shipped with pfSense®™ 2.4.x, and other changes done to FreeBSD code are also being selectively ommited from that repository.&quot; It&#x27;s from a few years ago so the situation may have changed.<p>It looks like there&#x27;s a RHEL&#x2F;CentOS sort of thing going on here where the code is (mostly?) open but the branding isn&#x27;t.')
