My take on privilege is &quot;currently being in a fortunate state&quot;. Doesn&#x27;t imply you didn&#x27;t earn it.<p>I consider myself privileged. Similar story with parents except I was raised by my aunt and uncle who were penniless immigrants to the US. They had their own kids to worry about so I was low priority. Half my clothes came from flea market bins. No tutoring, extracurriculars, etc. I was jealous of kids who could &#x27;afford&#x27; $1.25 school lunches.<p>I would even say that I was privileged at the time that I wasn&#x27;t raised by abusive alcoholics and that at least my adoptive family valued education. And I never had to worry about starving.<p>This led to the virtuous cycle where I have a lot of free time today.<p>I live in Romania now and when people say I&#x27;m privileged I agree.')
