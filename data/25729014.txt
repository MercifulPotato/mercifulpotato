Calls for political violence and extremism&#x2F;terrorism have and continue to be moderated on these platforms from both sides.<p>It is unfortunate that you don&#x27;t understand the distinction between inciting violence via either direct calls for such or indirectly by repeating the same unfounded lies of &quot;a stolen election&quot; VS political speech&#x2F;civil rights, which have not been abrogated (there are plenty of conservative commentators on Twitter, some of whom I follow).<p>As for my background, I am an immigrant from a post-communist Eastern European country, live in the US in the South and finished with political science and journalism degrees. Can assure you my appreciation of civil rights is intact.<p>As a general rule, even when situations like this occur, I lean on the side of caution, so I understand the slippery slope argument you&#x27;re making. There will continue to be a national discussion about what the limits are in the still-uncharted world of social media and the limits of expression vs. platform and publisher rights, but your alarmist view is, IMO, over the top.')
