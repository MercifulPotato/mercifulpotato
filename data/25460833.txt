It happens in games a lot; the community will complain that a certain character is broken and that they hate playing against it... but won&#x27;t actually go play the character themselves to exploit the brokenness for their own gain.  Seems silly to me.<p>(Buying reviews might actually be illegal though, so that&#x27;s a strong argument to not do it.)')
