A few things:<p>• In Chrome, the website log in system fails silently (and we get &quot;FB.login() called when user is already connected&quot; when retrying).<p>• The website is blank on Firefox.<p>• The principle is cool, but not Bayesian enough IMO. Points are expendable (especially when one can get them freely by creating a new account). Better use statistical priors estimating the likelihood that a given source outputs an accurate prediction. Give a bad prior to new accounts, to discourage creating new accounts to &quot;clean the slate&quot; of bad predictions.<p>• In the current state, this system, if it gets popular, can quickly have diplomatic, political and economic repercussions and consequent abuse that the website seems wholly unprepared for, based on my reading of the guidelines.')
