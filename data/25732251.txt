Sure there is collateral damage, but that&#x27;s not enough to endanger honey bees as a whole.<p>It&#x27;s also important to note that &#x27;wild&#x27; honey bees in America are not native. They were brought over by European settlers, and the ones who leave the hive or get left behind have formed the populations we now call &#x27;wild&#x27;.<p>Maybe this article is doesn&#x27;t apply since it pertains to the UK, and I&#x27;m not really familiar with the situation there. But my main point, is in regards to these articles you see all the time, that make it appear as if honey bees are on the verge of extinction.<p>In regards to the USA, if you write an article about honey been dying, and you purposefully don&#x27;t mention the history of how they arrived here in the first place, and purposefully  don&#x27;t explain the massive role commercial beekeepers play, it is not very helpful. It is clear they are serving their own agenda.')
