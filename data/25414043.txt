Now, with the latest Ubuntu, it often connects automatically, but then looses connection immediately, or fails to see that the device can play audio. After some fiddling and turning the device on an off it will work if i start playing audio right away. It will then work for a long time. The amount of fiddling and rebooting of headphones seems to grow with every new Ubuntu release. It may also be a user space error, but in any case, Bluetooth is far from &quot;just working&quot;, unfortunately.')
