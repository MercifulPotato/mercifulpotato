The primary sources clearly indicate that the first appearance was the Anglo-Saxon word &quot;wicing&quot;, meaning &quot;pirate.&quot; The Wikipedia references to the other names are from the Middle Ages, a time period that almost entirely post-dated the Viking era. It is unsurprising that the word Viking should originate from Anglo-Saxon, since the Anglo-Saxons are the source of the vast majority of written records about the vikings. The Norse did not keep written records of themselves unless you count runes, which wouldn&#x27;t have contained such a word. Indeed, the earliest written records of the Viking &quot;skalds&quot; (poems), in the Codex Regius, were written some time in the 1200&#x27;s.<p>The Vikings really do deserve their &quot;out sized&quot; influence, though. They were an incredible lot, ranging geographically further than any human civilization until the Portuguese discovered Australia. They could be found at various times in present day Canada, Turkey, Russia, and parts of Africa.')
