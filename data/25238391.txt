What if comments containing a link to “evidence” were more heavily weighted? The evidence could be inaccurate or biased but that would lead to better conversations than anecdotal information, no?<p>2. What if the upvote&#x2F;downvote were categorized?<p>Examples:<p>- “-1 Commenter appears to not have read post, irrelevant”.<p>- “-1 Commenter did not provide link to evidence or source material”.<p>- “+1 Commenter provided link to research&#x2F;evidence”.<p>There could be a second layer where people could vote on what they perceive as the quality of the evidence.<p>From this perspective, HN could maybe let more controversial and even inflammatory comments stay while letting commenters discuss the merits of the evidence that backs&#x2F;refutes them.<p>Just an idea but the current lack of innovation in HN moderation feels lazy and half-baked.')
