They are also exposed via pthread_mutex as a robust attribute.)<p>But no one really uses robust futexes. Why? I think the problem of distributed co-ordination is fundamentally complex, and people prefer to deal with complexity <i>they</i> create than trying to understand other complex solutions. (I&#x27;m not saying that this bias is wrong.)<p>So it&#x27;s a bit sad that you&#x27;re sad about the kernel not providing something that is does indeed provide!')
