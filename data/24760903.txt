But when the burst demand arrives and you&#x27;re not caught flat-footed (need a car now, need our online game&#x2F;app to handle surge now, etc etc), the peace of mind makes it seem worth it.  The entire wage economy exists to scratch this itch.  Various auto-scaling strategies may creep in. But as soon as you lose business or lose an opportunity due to its lag time or &quot;sensible&quot; upper bound (or whatever), it is very tempting (and often makes sense) to abandon them.<p>Another way of saying it: &quot;The point of life is not to min&#x2F;max everything.&quot;')
