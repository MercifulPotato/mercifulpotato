I know Coles and Woolworths do have what they call dark stores, which are set up to serve home deliveries and not open to the public, but most orders are picked at your closest store. I even order produce from the farmers market since you can get home delivery. Most places charge $10 for delivery, but offer free delivery if you spend over $100, $200.')
