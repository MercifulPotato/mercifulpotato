People are either splitting minorities between several districts in order to keep them from having a say, or packing them all into one district to keep surrounding districts from having Democratic majorities (and to attack people having a problem with the shape of the district as attackers of the only district representing that minority.)<p>&gt; Should people in DC maintain the right to vote? IMO they should, but itâ€™s become a political issue not a democracy issue.<p>Only in the 21st century do voting issues only become political when they can be looked at in terms of race.<p>&quot;Political&quot; means about the process of governance, not &quot;when minorities or women have a complaint.&quot;')
