When I was applying for jobs, all I wanted was feedback about why I wasn&#x27;t being hired.<p>Applying for jobs is a black box: you do a bunch of work, something happens, and you have no idea why, so you have no way to improve.<p>I wanted someone to say &quot;you misspelled something in your cover letter&quot;, or &quot;you were standoffish in the interview&quot;, or &quot;there were several qualified candidates, we hired the one with the most experience&quot;, or even &quot;we didn&#x27;t like your stupid face&quot;. If that&#x27;s too much work, send me a form letter: &quot;Rejected for reason 13B: poor personal hygiene or fashion sense&quot;. Literally anything. Anything.<p>I understand that companies feel that giving feedback opens them up to potential litigation or bad publicity, but I would happily have signed something to remove their liability. I would have sign an NDA to prevent me from publishing. I just want some data.')
