First it says &quot;thousands of public servants have been told to pick recruits who have had all mention of their gender and ethnic background stripped from their CVs.&quot; But then it says &quot;adding a woman&#x27;s name to a CV made the candidate 2.9 per cent more likely to get a foot in the door.&quot; I feel like I&#x27;m missing something.

Does that mean all of the real-world case studies should go to the bin because the organizations didn&#x27;t have randomized control trials at every step of their operations?')
