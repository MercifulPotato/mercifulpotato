Yet styling HTML with raw CSS is still programming, requiring knowledge of tree structures, a vast and ever-growing array of selectors and pseudo-classes and properties, recursion, priority ordering, an expression syntax not a million miles from S-expressions, the HTML DOM, four or five different box &amp; layout models, and typography, not to mention all the browser quirks; oh, and - in practice, let&#x27;s face it - Javascript; and yet 2 out of 3 major browsers still can&#x27;t consistently size &amp; center a top-level absolute block element, !important is the standard voodoo prayer for many, and fixing misbehaving CSS is basically debugging but in a language that lacks almost any first-class construct that might help.<p>So after all this further reflection, and notwithstanding that I&#x27;ve built up tons of valuable-in-practice crystallized experience in bending CSS to my will, I&#x27;m even more irked about the way things turned out.')
