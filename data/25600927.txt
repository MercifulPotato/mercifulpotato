Why do we need an additional layer of government?<p>I don&#x27;t know much about it, but I suppose if you want a free trade without a race to the bottom or a &quot;giant sucking sound,&quot; you&#x27;d need something like a government to set standards across the area.<p>Also, it seems like there&#x27;s some obvious benefits to a currency union (drawbacks too), and if you want to have that, then you need some kind of body to manage it.')
