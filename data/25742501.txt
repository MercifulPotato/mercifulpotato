I dont for a minute believe this prosperity gospel from the financial sector. here are a few sobering facts not mentioned in the article:<p>&gt;...what happens to that money once thereâ€™s widespread vaccination and the vacations, weddings, and mall trips that have been delayed are suddenly unshackled.<p>It goes to paying down rent thats been placed on credit cards and payment plans.  the article doesnt mention the fact that in most major cities in America, Americans arent being evicted.  Once things go back to normal, the landlord gets their cut, and the average american household goes back to being...average.  Banks have also allowed customers to stretch their credit until the pandemic ends, in some cases belaying interest by months.  These pipers will be paid first, not to mention the student loan collection thaw.<p>Its also worth noting that tens of thousands of pubs, clubs, bars and restaurants effectively no longer exist.  They have been entirely foreclosed due to rampant mismanagement of government lending programs and the mass exodus of service workers from major cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York.<p>&gt;Student debt is still rising, though at the slowest rate in over a decade.<p>Zoomers saw what happened to Millennials during the 2008 collapse. Even if they can afford college, few are excited to repeat the prospects of their predecessors given eerily similar &quot;once in a lifetime&quot; financial events.<p>&gt;Rising home prices have priced young buyers out because they require a growing and often insurmountable downpayment.<p>The articles bold prediction of a roaring twenties full of homeless zoomers and opulent boomers is...frankly disgusting.  Its the same garbage we&#x27;ve endured for the past ten years after the collapse of 08, so the author just flogs the sex appeal of untenably large mortgages which (surprise) landed us in the 2008 housing collapse.')
