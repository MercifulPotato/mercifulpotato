Allowing groups up to 50 isn&#x27;t anything like a lockdown as understood in many other countries. Also I think it was never practically feasible to isolate vulnerable people as you describe. As far as I know, no country has successfully kept society open in this way yet also protected vulnerable people and it was reckless and irresponsible to try to do so.')
