(Geologists typically <i>still</i> insist it must have been a series of smaller floods.)<p>Historians have not come to grips with the very oldest Egyptian artifacts being, by far, the most advanced -- in some cases, well beyond what we could reproduce today without first inventing new methods.<p>Publications and trials in Alzheimers research still overwhelmingly favor the amyloids hypothesis, despite its utter, abject failure in every trial.<p>People still imagine that excess saturated fat causes heart disease, so that work to understand how eating meat really causes it gets minimal attention.<p>In psychology, for decades every publication was obliged to cast all results in terms of behaviorism.<p>In physiology, it is still required to evaluate every electromagnetic effect on biological activity purely in terms of heating.<p>Endless examples are available, in any field, not excluding physics.<p>Promoters of science like to congratulate themselves over known cases where the facts did, finally, win out, but are happy to neglect the necessarily more numerous cases where advocates were driven from the field, and never got vindication, so falsehoods are still taught.<p>This phenomenon is in large degree a product of the professionalization of science, and the system of journal reviews and, moreso, grants, controlled by the old guard in each field.<p>It is easy find Wikipedia articles being defended against new evidence by emeritus professors with plenty of time on their hands.')
