There&#x27;s so much money in SF that tech people are actually small fry. Tech money buys surprisingly little political influence because the government, unions, construction are all very powerful. Your company got sold for $100 million? Big deal, you are a flea before the power that Rome Aloise (who you have never heard of) wields, let alone the real big fish.<p>You know that odd feeling of unfairness and powerlessness? That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s like to be an immigrant subject to capricious laws. Now that&#x27;s you because you are an insect before the San Francisco Political Machine.
