It doesn&#x27;t do what it promises. It requires a huge amount of bandwidth that isn&#x27;t realistic if you live anywhere else that doesn&#x27;t have google fibre. The service is kinda expensive and there isn&#x27;t many games for it.<p>In comparison I could get a PS4 or an XBox with a games pass for similar amount of money. Also no second hand games (I can go to the local CeX and get old games for next to nothing).<p>Everyone I know (I run a discord with about 100 gamers on there) think it is garbage and the last time I checked the sales numbers reflected that.')
