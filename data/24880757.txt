Try it with expensive services with few customers and your experiment quickly becomes statistically worthless and expensive.<p>Also, data-driven does <i>never</i> work for a product. If you sell a product, your customers do <i>not</i> want to be monitored. They also do <i>not</i> want to randomly get an inferior version of the very product they <i>paid for</i> just to satisfy your research goal. So your only realistic test case would be to offer a <i>second</i> product and see how it sells. Or to pay for expensive surveys.')
