From my findings, the grass is not greener.<p>Maybe check the <i>other</i> other side (Linux) - I found the grass is greener there - at least for Python (and programming tools in general). I&#x27;m very comfortable on the command-line, and moving from a pure Linux environment to OS X &amp; brew felt like a huge downgrade, followed by random annoyances that remind you you are using inferior, non-GNU utilities:<p><pre><code>  $ ls my_dir -l\n  ls: -l: No such directory\n</code></pre>\n<i>Really</i> - Mac OS? I know its minor, but that&#x27;s just user-hostile and it happens every few weeks; I can&#x27;t get over it.')
