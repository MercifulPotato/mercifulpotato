It&#x27;s horrible and really not that much of an issue as they want you to think it is when you really think about it as most encounters are brief and forgettable if you&#x27;re busy working.<p>It&#x27;s a legal thing (threats of lawsuits and the associated costs are again one of those things about America that determine many other things). It&#x27;s also spreading on campuses now, which weirdly have their own tribunals outside of the normal court system and reverse the assumption of innocence in rape accusations etc. Ties into how American college encompasses students lives to a huge extent, while in Europe things are more distributed, people do sports outside of college, regularly live outside of dorms etc. There&#x27;s no college police etc. Similarly, American workplaces also seem to provide more, e.g. custom healthcare plans, a bit in the direction of how Japanes companies sort of become your &quot;benevolent&quot; provider who will organize many aspects of your life.<p>Either way, I think it involves lots of layers of posturing. In the end, many people still hook up or even pair up at the workplace. I also know people who are very politically conscious and support all the MeToo etc stuff, but somehow hooked up and became partners at an academic conference. You just have to do it the right way (risky, but not too hard for the socially skilled who know when and how to do it). It&#x27;s still very much possible. People don&#x27;t act the way they talk.')
