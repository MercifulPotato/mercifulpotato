In my limited experience doing presentations, I&#x27;ve run across a mixture of HDMI, VGA, and even DisplayPort for some reason.<p>Once, even though I was using a Dell Precision with built in HDMI and VGA, I ended up using a usb-c dongle with combo HDMI+VGA+DP ports I keep in my bag. My coworker had to wait for someone to get a more specific passive converter for their laptop which didn&#x27;t have usb-c.<p>Obviously YMMV, but I&#x27;ve found the combo of usb-c plus a compact multi port adapter to be indispensable, even on a laptop with a crap-ton of ports.')
