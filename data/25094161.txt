There were turf wars</i><p>Ex-Intel engineer here that worked in R&amp;D- I saw the exact same situations during my time and was one of the reasons I left. The way that teams in the same org with the same goals couldn&#x27;t or wouldn&#x27;t work together was incredibly frustrating and such a massive waste of effort. At the time I thought it was a unique situation with our group, but it&#x27;s sad to see that it&#x27;s more of a systemic issue that still hasn&#x27;t been corrected.')
