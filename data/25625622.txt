Specific example:\nUber works with vendors A, B, C. Marketing team is incentivized to reach a cost per sign-up of $X (Let&#x27;s say $50 for the sake of this example). Vendor A, running fraud, delivers sign-ups @ 45$ each. Vendor B, clean, delivers them at $55 each. Vendor C @ $65 each. The new baseline from an exec standpoint is $45 each, and every vendor that doesn&#x27;t deliver at that level is cut. Repeat with multiple vendors.<p>The solution to this problem is incrementality measurement at the channel level. Every time you <i>scale</i> with a recently onboarded vendor, measure baseline of ALL conversions happening on your app. If this baseline doesn&#x27;t move, cut the vendor. I say <i>scale</i> and not <i>launch</i> because upon launh, there won&#x27;t be a visible impact on the global conversions. To be able to spot this spike from baseline, pick a small market than &quot;worldwide&quot;. For ex, pick &quot;California&quot;, let the new vendor scale in California, and measure spike in California.')
