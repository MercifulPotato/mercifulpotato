There is Lumen, an OS initiative to bring the BEAM to the browser (WASM).<p>Does Pony have such ambitions (I mean, the Pony team)?<p>My UC is an actor system in the browser and the ability to create a DSL created using the same language used in programming the actor system.<p>Pony is not dynamic but statically typed?
