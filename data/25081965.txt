The primary one I can think of is for governments of the world to give long term contracts to N95 mask makers so they can fully spin up their factories. It&#x27;s been 9 months for $diety&#x27;s sake.<p>Non-fit homemade and non-rated masks help prevent others from getting sick. But if everyone had access to cheap N95 that actually prevented <i>them</i> from getting sick we&#x27;d be a lot better off. The kids would still be getting it and getting everyone sick at home&#x2F;school because they wouldn&#x27;t wear them consistently right, but people without kids at home wouldn&#x27;t be getting sick at nearly the rate. Every bit counts.')
