I really feel like this is a big step in the right direction.<p>A personal wish however would be that we got a more modern look to more desktop environments. Both Gnome, Plasma and Pantheon (default in Elementary OS) are talked about as the best looking desktop environments, but I&#x27;d be lying if I said that any of them looked awesome. There&#x27;s just something about them that make them feel weird. Sometimes it&#x27;s just margins and whitespace, sometimes the font scale that seems inconsistent and sometimes it&#x27;s the default icon packs that look a bit dated. I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m not a designer, but it is definitely worse than both win10 and macOS 10.15.6<p>I think that if we want to grow the unix user base there&#x27;s a bit of progress to be made in this department. Customisability is where we win today - but the defaults need to get better to attract more non tech oriented people.')
