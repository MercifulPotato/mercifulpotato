HN got me into it in the first place, and I now need your help.<p>I&#x27;ve been storing content for years, and need to read through much of it. It runs the gamut of online courses, books, news articles, guides, and neat possible tools. As of right now ported to a text document, it&#x27;s ~15K lines of text.<p>While I love reading through all of it, do any of you have a good system for working through your future learning?<p>I&#x27;m not so much concerned about motivation. I know EXACTLY why I want to learn, and the internet already has TONS of articles on how to find that inner purpose (Sad to say I&#x27;ve contributed to that deluge).<p>I&#x27;m more looking at the nuts-and-bolts of what you use to handle a wall of links, articles, books, and videos. Right now I use TreeSheets (i.e., spreadsheet-ception) and throw any supporting info (videos, PDFs) into a conventional file system.')
