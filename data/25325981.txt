They also fail to give any kind of parameters for what this kind of RF would look like, as well as fail to make specific, falsifiable, claims on what it is.<p>While plenty of bad claims have been validate by peer review, it doesn&#x27;t mean that peer review doesn&#x27;t massively reduce the number of outrageously incorrect claims.<p>In any case, as it stands, the NAS article wouldn&#x27;t pass peer review, because it makes borderline unphysical claims without providing enough evidence, even though doing so is quite easy. As for stellar credentials or the imprimatur of a large institution, one of the authors is fairly kooky and the institute itself has a <i>massive</i> conflict of interest.<p>There&#x27;s a reason even the <i>State Department</i> is distancing itself from this thesis.')
