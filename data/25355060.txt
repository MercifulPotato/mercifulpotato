I just enjoy learning new things, so I try to read widely across a variety of interests, and read between pop books on a topic and academic works (sadly, I&#x27;ve found I can&#x27;t read much fiction anymore). It&#x27;s not so I can teach someone else, or even synthesize it all together for some grand research project (though maybe if I started taking notes...), but simply because I enjoy learning and broadening my interests, and it gives me more stuff to talk about with different people.<p>But, if I was independently wealthy, I&#x27;d just stay at university the rest of my life too, pursuing various majors&#x2F;classes&#x2F;masters as my fancy takes me. To me, that&#x27;s the dream life, and reading is a way to sort of mimic that without having to pay.')
