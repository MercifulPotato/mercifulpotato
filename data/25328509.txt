Item(by='lilactown', descendants=None, kids=[25340058], score=None, time=1607304726, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25328356, text='&gt; The actual thrust of the argument seems so broad (i.e. reliance on intuition), this could be used to label almost anybody outside pol-sci academic circles a &quot;profoundly unserious public intellectual&quot; for commenting on politics<p>That seems like a fair assessment IMHO. Most of us are not &quot;serious public intellectuals,&quot; especially w.r.t. politics. This isn&#x27;t a moral failing; politics is hard.<p>I don&#x27;t think the thrust of the author&#x27;s point necessitates him to rigorously define what a &quot;serious public intellectual&quot; is, although perhaps he&#x27;d be a better &quot;serious public intellectual&quot; by doing so. Rather, it&#x27;s building on the already numerous critiques of PG&#x27;s political essays, and saying, &quot;He&#x27;s been like this all along. It&#x27;s not that he got worse; he&#x27;s always been like this.&quot;<p>PG&#x27;s brand relies on us taking him seriously, and this essay&#x27;s main thesis is that PG - despite his monetary success - has not earned that right, whether through his essays about programming language design or politics.<p>&gt; I&#x27;m not convinced that role of intuition is exactly similar in something as subjective as political commentary as in designing a programming language.<p>I don&#x27;t know if one is more or less subjective, but I also don&#x27;t think that clarifies to me how much success in one or the other has to do with intuition. The essay uses chicken sexing as an example, which is pretty damn objective; yet success is only obtained through trained intuition.')
