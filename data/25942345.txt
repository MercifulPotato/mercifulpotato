However, the fight here isnt about that. This is a fight between the public mixed with low level capitalist (sub 8 digit yearly earnings) and the billionaire well... oligarchy of hedge funds. The hedge funds are putting pressure on gov and media to stop allowing the general public from doing something. This was originally a fight to screw over a hedge fund that was picking on Gamestop to bankrupt them through predatory short selling. Its blown up to now the hedge funds trying to manipulate public discourse, media discourse and the public&#x27;s ability to participate in the market. Originally, capitalism is about anyone has the ability to participate in business and the market equally, regardless of their family lineage or social class. Obviously reality is messier than theory, but you no longer need to have a royal family name to own land or start a business. Hedge funds, banks and others are trying to accomplish the same old, &quot;kiss my ring&quot;, just with slightly different tactics.<p>It&#x27;s a fun show regardless.')
