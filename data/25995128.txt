If it decides to use the index, and there <i>are</i> values above 7, then it will misbehave (the query will miss those results). Now of course the database could then scan the rows for values above 7 it missed but at that point there&#x27;s no point in using the index and you might as well have row scanned for the original query.<p>As a result, the database has to be 100% sure that there are no values _at all_ above 7 to safely and efficiently use the index, ex. when there&#x27;s a constraint.')
