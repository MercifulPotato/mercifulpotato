Sometimes that means that junk and fraud[2] gets through; that&#x27;s the cost of doing business in <i>every</i> field.<p>These kinds of embarrassing mistakes should be read as an indictment of academic culture and the failures of the peer review system <i>as a whole</i>, not a &quot;gotcha&quot; against a field that you or I aren&#x27;t qualified to evaluate. Which, again, is why nobody asked for my opinion or yours about which things to fund.<p>[1]: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;reproducibility.cs.arizona.edu&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;reproducibility.cs.arizona.edu&#x2F;</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@tnvijayk&#x2F;potential-organized-fraud-in-acm-ieee-computer-architecture-conferences-ccd61169370d" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@tnvijayk&#x2F;potential-organized-fraud-in-ac...</a>')
