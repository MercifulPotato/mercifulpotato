It&#x27;s a random walk. It takes 6 hours for your small protein molecule to move 1cm ... at 250kph.<p>So while these molecules offering themselves up &quot;automatically&quot; works, it only works at very short ranges and it&#x27;s a stochastic range. At 1nm they meet 100k times per second. At 1cm once per 6 hours. At 3cm once per month.<p>So there is in fact a lot of bookkeeping, keeping things tethered where they need to be and dragging things around to be done inside the cell where everything magically happens. People in this thread aren&#x27;t correct that it&#x27;s not necessary to do that. You don&#x27;t need to get positions exactly right, as in you don&#x27;t have to get the amino acids in every ribosome, but you DO have to get them &quot;more or less&quot; where they need to be. If for example if the amino acid concentrations near ribosomes ever get low, that&#x27;s the end of you in about 2h (there&#x27;s a fungus that causes that).')
