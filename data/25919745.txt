Yes, you can get them 3rd party... but its another thing to set up.<p>In the end, picture the 50-100 employee shop where the sysadmin is weighing in on &quot;get GitLab Premium vs GitLab ultimate&quot; and the reduction of additional installs and licenses that need to be managed.<p>Yea, it it adds $80&#x2F;user&#x2F;month, but if it saves an hour or two per user per month in productivity gains - that can make a difference.<p>In the organization I currently work for, we were considering the options of (GitLab Ultimate) vs (GitLab Premium + Jira + other tools) and ultimately went with the premium and other for a number of reasons... but GitLab Ultimate made a strong showing.')
