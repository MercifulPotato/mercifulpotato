Within minutes of booting I was searching for answers to questions that one should never have to ask (specifically, it was something to do with sound - it wasn&#x27;t outputting or it was going over HDMI instead of the plugged in Aux Jack.) Linux may have gotten better, but it feels just as unfinished and confusing to me as it did 20 years ago when I first booted knoppix.')
