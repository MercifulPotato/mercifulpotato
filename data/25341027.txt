If you don&#x27;t, you stagnate as the society rots.<p>The reality today is that in some democracies the balance of power has shifted from the people to the corporates. And that&#x27;s unacceptable. Thinking that this is what&#x27;s the best achievable in your democracy is just nihilistic and pessimistic attitude. Sitting silent is not an option. Regulation is one of the tools through which the government restores the balance between the corporates and the people. And it is possible to strike the right balance between the greed of the corporates and the need of the people.')
