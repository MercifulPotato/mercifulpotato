To use old tech as an example.  The press itself is wildly expensive.  So I will have to divide that price across all things I sell using that press.  However once the press is paid off my marginal costs are little more than cost of paper, shipping it around, and paying someone to run&#x2F;fix the press.  Computer chips are made of silicon one of the cheaper materials to buy out there.  The up front costs of setting up a foundry is akin to buying a printing press.  An older tech foundry can still make marginal money as the big cost is already been paid for.  Everything after is marginal.')
