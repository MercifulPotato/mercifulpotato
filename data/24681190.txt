Cities exist because it is in the interest of the country to develop areas with high industrial or services growth. The investments in infrastructure are a shared concern that benefits the whole country, not just the cities. This TFA theory is just another facet of neoliberal ideology that tries to compartmentalize profits and evade public investments in a large scale.')
