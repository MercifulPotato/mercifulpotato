More of a rebate.<p>So the economics of it are that the bank collects $0.018 in interchange for every dollar spent on a card, converts that to a point that costs them $0.007 to deliver, which the airline services for $0.006 by disposing of inventory that would otherwise go unsold.<p>The airline wins again because they&#x27;ve created a secondary market for unsold inventory that they can sell to leisure travelers without undercutting the amount they can sell the same inventory for to business travelers.<p>It&#x27;s a very nuanced and successful way of motivating people who have a choice to make the choice you want them to make.<p>On the other hand, $0.01 in cash back costs the bank $0.01, and then if you redeem for travel the airline gets paid $0.01, and you get $0.01 in value.')
