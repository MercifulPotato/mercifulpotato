For me, it comes down to developer trust and permissions.  If someone I trust wrote a small, feature-targeted extension, I would probably be comfortable installing it.  Similarly, if the permissions an extension has are tightly scoped to its use case, I&#x27;m more comfortable installing it.<p>Now that I write that, I&#x27;m not sure how permissions and upgrades go together.  If an extension that had tight permissions relaxes them I&#x27;d get notified before they took effect, right?')
