The worst one is that they force you, the app developer, to change your platform, whatever it is, to accommodate ever-changing arbitrary Apple policies. Real-life example: apps getting rejected with the reason that while reviewing, they typed &quot;porn&quot; into the search bar and <i>gasp</i> naked people came up! Your own rules allow it, but Apple won&#x27;t let you have it. Even if you rate your app 18+. Same goes for all the copyright stuff.<p>Also funny how Apple keeps trying to spin its insane rules as a universally good thing. Not everyone is a US corporation. Sexuality is a very important part of a person&#x27;s life. Get over it.')
