Item(by='1-more', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605295696, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25083668, text='I strongly encourage everyone who uses these apps to try delivering for them for a night or two. Just get a feel for what it&#x27;s like. I do it as a hobby kind of and they&#x27;re all bad for their various reasons. Uber Eats tells you what you stand to make up front but that depends on tip, which isn&#x27;t guaranteed. Postmates is the only one that tells you what&#x27;s in the order before you accept it (I can&#x27;t carry a pizza and prefer to avoid fountain drinks). But you just don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like to deliver for the apps until you try it.')
