At a minimum, you&#x27;d need 31 IP addresses allocated to a single box in order to have 2,000,000 active connections on that box. Unless you&#x27;re arguing that the chat clients would be opening dozens of connections...but that&#x27;s ridiculous. Whatsapp was built for actual usage, not research projects, and more than 1-2 connections per client is overkill.')
