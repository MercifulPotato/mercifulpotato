As an Asian, I hate that I have to work harder just to get the same opportunities.<p>Affirmative action is simply racism against minorities that “don’t matter” to the public narrative in favor of minorities that “do matter.”<p>Imagine telling an Asian child that they have to work way harder because of their  race. While their friends get to go out and play, they have to sit down and study because of a condition they were born with. It’s abhorrent.<p>Now this same racism is carrying into the job market. No thanks.')
