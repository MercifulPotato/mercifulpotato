Item(by='tptacek', descendants=None, kids=[25404286], score=None, time=1607824768, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25403484, text='&quot;Entropy provider&quot; is not a thing, nor is &quot;good sources and throughput&quot;. I&#x27;ve been cagey about writing about this but this thread is now old so I&#x27;ll just be direct (and boring): there is a misconception that running cryptography primitives somehow burns through entropy as if it were fuel. But that&#x27;s not how it works at all. You need enough entropy to <i>seed</i> your CSPRNG, and enough to periodically <i>re-seed</i> it to have some safety margin against compromises, but in the interval in between, you have effectively limitless &quot;entropy&quot; to spend.<p>The lava lamps aren&#x27;t doing anything for Cloudflare&#x27;s security. They&#x27;re a marketing gimmick. A very good one! They got articles like this written! I&#x27;m not begrudging them the win! But this is not in fact how you engineer cryptography.')
