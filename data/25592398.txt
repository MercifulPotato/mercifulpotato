Furthermore, people are running Nim on ESP32, Nintendo Switch, JS (Browser, Node), iOS, Android and more; From that alone its clear that the C library can&#x27;t be a significant dependency.<p>(And ... just about any C compiler around, including GCC, LLVM, TCC, MS C, Intel C, Zig C are supported when using C as a backend).')
