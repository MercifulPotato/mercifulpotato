There are people who choose a partner for other reasons beyond strict love or money. For example, you might want a partner who is at home and supports you and your work (traditional household model). In order for this relationship to actually support you, like ioseph said, a matching level of emotional investment is important. Otherwise you&#x27;re too dependent on your partner and that won&#x27;t work out in your favor. I hope I could clarify my train of thought a little.')
