They built the best products and it seems like it would ultimately be anti-consumer to do anything about it.<p>It&#x27;s different if a company like Google establishes its dominance via one great product (search) and then wields that power to artificially protect its other lines of business through e.g. contracts, the same way Microsoft did with OEMs.<p>Sure, nothing &quot;illegal&quot; about it, but ultimately, it fits the de facto understanding of antitrust being about &quot;consumer welfare.&quot; A company leveraging its dominance in one business to exert control over others =&#x2F;= a company having success because it built the best products.')
