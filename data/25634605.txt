But everything you mention was present in the very first release of Clojure (function names are just function names). The changes since then have been tiny (some reader stuff which you could easily ignore). My point is once you know how to read and navigate Clojure code you&#x27;re never going to have to worry about new primitive stuff being added, because the syntax is enough for life. I like that, and dislike languages like C# where every release and every new language feature introduces new keywords. That&#x27;s an entirely personal thing, I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s better, but I do think it&#x27;s to Clojure&#x27;s credit that it doesn&#x27;t have to add new syntax to get new things done.')
