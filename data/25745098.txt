Most OSes will dynamically change their IPs for privacy reasons.<p>My servers are on &#x2F;56 + ::0 + :100,101,102, etc. I generally pick these suffixes to match with the IPv4 addresses, but you can allocate one per service, and get rid of reverse proxies (easier migration, you can just move the service to a new machine).<p>So, to take a specific example, 2a01:cb14:d6e:2000&#x2F;56 is my ISP prefix, which can be thought of as the external IP, and 2a01:cb14:d6e:2000::11 is my server. 2a01:cb14:d6e:2001::&#x2F;64 could be computers. I don&#x27;t always follow the above scheme, IPv6 is big enough to get away with a lot of things, but it helps having something to default to.<p>My point is: you don&#x27;t have to remember the prefix anyway, since every computer in the network will share it. Now, if you need static, easy to remember IPs instead of SLAAC, use static IPs or DHCPv6, or even better, mDNS to resolve .local addresses to IPs.<p>Looking at the above, this assumes a certain level of trust on the local network, which is fine at home or within a network dedicated to servers, but might not be at a company? mDNS can lie, someone else might advertise the same IP. These problems are not exclusive to IPv6, but they are a product of the era. Nowadays, I wish we just used crypto key routing (like yggdrasil does, and maybe TOR) on a planetwide mesh network, but we&#x27;ll need IPv6 in the meantime :)')
