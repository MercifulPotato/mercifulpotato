Unless it completely explodes, which I find very doubtful considering Googles position, and also considering Apples deep pockets, I don&#x27;t think Apple will be in a big hurry to shut the gates. Additionally I can totally see Apple doing heavy integration with it&#x27;s systems and actually using this potential search engine to upsell people into their ecosystem.')
