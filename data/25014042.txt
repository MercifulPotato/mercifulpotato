I read about them nearly a decade ago and we still don&#x27;t have any on the market if I&#x27;m not mistaken. How come Intel didn&#x27;t invest heavily in those?<p>And why is it only AMD that has a GPU baked into a CPU? Vega graphics are simply amazing and beat Intel&#x27;s integrated graphics hands down. It&#x27;s so nice to have only a single chip without buying an extra graphics card.<p>Unfortunately, AMD isn&#x27;t very present. I see Intel sponsoring every eSports event out there and handing out i9s as prizes. I&#x27;m not tunes into the gamers but I still have the impression they believe Intel reigns supreme...<p>With RISC-V about to enter the market and AMD beating Intel on benchmarks, Intel better pull a rabbit out of their behind to stay competitive. But that&#x27;s just a layman&#x27;s view on the subject.')
