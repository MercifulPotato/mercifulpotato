It is so useful for mucking about with API responses. I used it to write a bash script that acts as a NAGIOS plugin for spotting changes in our Digital Ocean server and DNS configs - curl to pull from the API, jq to strip out the bits we don&#x27;t care for, and sed to put actual newlines in instead of \\n.\nWe had Cisco as a customer, and infrastructure change-monitoring was one of their infosec team&#x27;s requirements... that was part of our solution.')
