Her claim is that any solution for the BHIP cannot be falsified, and that strikes me as too pessimistic for two reasons. First, look at the results of pushing the theory harder with respect to <i>spinning</i> black holes. Many predictions of Kerr&#x27;s theory have been observed, even if the ring singularity at the center hasn&#x27;t. Second, we&#x27;re observing new black hole phenomena every day, and if black holes really do explode at the end of evaporation, then maybe that is also observable. Sure, Hawking radiation is normally too small to be directly observed, but the theory can be driven into a place where it can make a testable prediction.')
