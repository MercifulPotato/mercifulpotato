Similar to when we built Vault, we feel like the solution-space for identity-based security is too commercialized. We want to provide access to this type of security to a broader set of people because we feel it&#x27;s the right way to think about access control. Note: of course as as a company we plan on commercializing Boundary at some point, but we&#x27;ll do this similarly to Vault, the major featureset of Boundary will remain free and open source forever.<p>I hate this corporate speak.  You&#x27;re breaking into the space by giving away (basic, as you will commercialize any advanced) features under the guise of open source altruism. The products HashiCorp sells are open core, and you should be more honest about it (GitLab is!).  I wish you operated more like other, real, open source companies that use subscriptions or managed service offerings and don&#x27;t lock features behind various obscure pricing tiers.  This is Shareware 2.0.<p>The difference between what HashiCorp does and what a real open source company like Rancher does is stark: HashiCorp has products, Rancher builds communities.  Contributors to HashiCorps stuff have to play in a very specific sandbox, lest they implement lucrative features.  Contributors to Rancher help the community at large and have full visibility into the codebase, empowering them to fix or add functionality without restrictions.')
