This this exactly the issue worrying me about my own son. These &quot;Masculine&quot; traits you talk about are toxic as heck. Getting into bar fights promotes an unhealthy mentality that spreads into other parts of your life. For example, if your okay with hitting other people at a bar, you might be more prone to abusing your children by using corporal punishment.<p>I don&#x27;t believe in toxic masculinity, but I do believe that there is a heck of a lot of toxic things men take into their identity. If you assimilate something into your identity, you no longer have the power to change that thing within yourself.')
