You aren&#x27;t grasping them correctly.<p>This, I think, is the source of the problem. DNS servers have their own terminology that pre-dates HTTP. The servers that take&#x2F;do lookup requests and cache them are known as recursive servers. Yes, they act similarly to HTTP caching proxies, but that&#x27;s not how they are referred to. These make up the vast majority of DNS servers.<p>The other type is authoritative, which is called that as it is the &#x27;athoritative&#x27;source of truth for some domain&#x27;s DNS data. Where the root servers look it up to feed into the system. These would be akin to your basic HTTP servers, but again the terminology is different.')
