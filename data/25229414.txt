Item(by='RickHull', descendants=None, kids=[25231877, 25233137, 25229828, 25231351, 25230647], score=None, time=1606491083, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25227651, text='For those railing against this essay, who feel that PG is fluffing himself up and patting himself on the back like a nerdy middleschooler -- you&#x27;ve missed the big point, badly.  PG writes unapologetically, directly, and simply, and this may pattern match to a naive middleschooler, but you are letting your base instincts cover up the fact that PG is wise, has earned his stripes, and is sharing his wisdom, unapologetically, directly, and simply.<p>He knows exactly the kind of backlash he will receive and is prompting you for it intentionally.  He&#x27;s not writing for you or to you, and he cares not a whit what you think.<p>He&#x27;s writing to and for people like him, trying to help them put words and clear thought to vague understandings and apprehensions they&#x27;ve been wrestling with.<p>He&#x27;s not self-aggrandizing but student-aggrandizing, as the headmaster of a school of thought that he values deeply.  If you hate the headmaster or his style or the school of thought, that&#x27;s wonderful, but it&#x27;s not at all relevant to his aims.  I hope this sheds some light on the bigger picture for those unaware.')
