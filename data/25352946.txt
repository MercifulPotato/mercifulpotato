The hardware is massively better. I had a side-project last year that I tried to do in Python, because I had used it a bit in the past, and figured things <i>just had to be better</i> because it was decades since the last time I wrote something big from scratch.<p>It was a horrible experience, except for GIT replacing ZIP files to allow un-do. WXBuilder only generates python, it doesn&#x27;t allow you to edit the results and go backward... a significantly less useful paradigm than Delphi in Windows, or Visual Basic 6, for that matter.<p>Eventually after much frustration, I managed to write layers to completely decouple the GUI from the actual working code, which was ok... but then I needed to change one of the controls from a list to a combo box... everything broke... 2 lost weekends of work... and got it working again.  Any GUI change took 20+ minutes.<p>Eventually I gave up, pulled out Lazarus&#x2F;Free Pascal, and re-implemented everything in about a week of spare time.<p>After that, GUI changes took seconds, builds took seconds. It just works.<p>I greatly appreciate the power of the hardware, and persistent internet instead of 56k dialup... but the GUI tools have gone downhill.<p>I tried Visual C++, but it generates a forest of code and parameters that you really shouldn&#x27;t have to deal with.<p>Maybe I haven&#x27;t found the right set of tools, but as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it was actually better programming in the 90s, except for the hardware, and GIT.')
