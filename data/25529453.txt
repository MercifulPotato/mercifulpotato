Good tea is that simple!<p>It isn&#x27;t though. Water temperature is just as important. Black and herbal teas typically do well with boiling water, but green and white teas need a lower temperature, between 140-175 depending on the tea.<p>Also, while 3 minutes is a fine general rule for green tea, I&#x27;ve found that some green and white teas taste best steeped for longer at lower temperatures.')
