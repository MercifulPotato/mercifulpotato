Is it just inflation that we are worried about when we “pump” too much money into the economy?<p>In fact why does imf and world bank matter&#x2F;exist when countries can print their own money? May be it’s not about the money but selling developed worlds “expertise” to build things in developing countries under the guise of a “loan”. Are these banks basically saying here is xxx million or billion to build a power plant and you can only use this money to pay companies from “my” country that will build your power plants ??')
