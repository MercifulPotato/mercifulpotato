Metaprogramming has become increasingly maintainable, as making it a first-class capability of the language is a core focus of the people designing it. The learning curve is finally low enough that it is practical. I think it is fair to say that C++17 is the first version where that is true.<p>You can’t write a comparable database engine in Go, fundamentally. The language lacks features required for competitive performance. The code difference will be much more than 50% trying to get the most out of what Go is capable of in this domain.<p>The point of writing code this way isn’t to be clever or for a “thrill”, it objectively produces superior performance, reliability, and maintainability. Defects scale with the number of lines of code regardless of language. Type safe code gen is a powerful tool.')
