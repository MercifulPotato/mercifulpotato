Their &quot;right&quot; to their territory is only as strong as their personal ability to protect it. No one else will help them.<p>Unless that&#x27;s what your advocating for when you talk about property rights, then rights absolutely do come from the state. Most of us think property rights mean what&#x27;s mine is mine no matter who wants it, not that I lose it as soon as someone takes it from me or hires someone to do so.')
