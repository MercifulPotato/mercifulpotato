Maybe 15 years ago, I had one box reboot itself and come back up with only ~ 16 MB out of an expected 1 GB or so; it was pretty overprovisioned and was able to sort of keep up working from swap but was sending alarms on a system that was always quiet (near idle cpu normally, important but low throughput system). More recently, I&#x27;ve had a couple systems with so high a rate of correctable ECC errors that machine check processing ate nearly all the cpu; but it still had enough to pass healthchecks, but not handle requests in a timely fashion, but didn&#x27;t manage to get an uncorrectable error that would have paniced the machine so failover could work.')
