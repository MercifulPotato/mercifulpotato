However, in CP2077 they are outright broken. If you look at an NPC, turn 180 degrees and then look back, the NPC is either gone or replaced with another NPC entirely. There are stuff like that, not related to &quot;stupidity&quot;, that breaks the immersion for me.<p>PS. I&#x27;m also enjoying the game a lot, but soft locks and brokenness is starting to take it&#x27;s toll.')
