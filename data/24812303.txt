Item(by='EpicEng', descendants=None, kids=[24813341], score=None, time=1602961458, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24810184, text='&gt;It&#x27;s worth remembering this article seems to come from a rather clich√©d and narrow frame of reference - overly driven by money and perceived status - one which seems to drive a lot of very similar advisory posts.<p>That was exactly my reaction. I was a lead for three years and recently decided to go back to a purely technical role. I just didn&#x27;t like the work, and the prospect of spending the rest of my career in middle management was not appealing.<p>I currently received an offer from a FAANG(M) company. This was a real offer from someone I had worked with in the past which would have required a very thin interview process. I declined because I very much enjoy the work I&#x27;m doing today.<p>It may turn out to be a bad idea down the road if all I consider is money and that nice company name on my resume. I decided I don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;d rather be a big fish in a small pond and work on truly interesting tech than be another cog in the wheel. I&#x27;m well past the &quot;live to work&quot; phase of my life, I just want to be happy, and I can&#x27;t complain at all about my salary and benefits.')
