I&#x27;m pretty sure that people <i>care</i> at least a little in most cases, but the tradeoffs are far more complex than you can grasp easily so I&#x27;m not sure &quot;privacy&quot; is fundamentally a thing that can be provided while allowing anything except almost uselessly restricted extensions.<p>So: <i>mostly</i> no, nor do I expect it to improve with manifest v3.
