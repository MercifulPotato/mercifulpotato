I honestly wonder if it&#x27;s true.<p>If it&#x27;s actually true--and if poor quality of work and reputation mean nothing, just leetcode--it seems like that is just a side effect of extremely rapid expansion and&#x2F;or churn.<p>Because no employer would willingly hire people like that. That&#x27;d be absurd. So the only reason that would be possible if the hiring manager never got wind of someone&#x27;s work ethic or quality. And it seems like that&#x27;s only possible with enough disjointedness in the people network, combined with hiring practices that don&#x27;t care about it.')
