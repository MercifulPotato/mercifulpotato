Be it maths, physics or software development<p>A standard math textbook will usually show the x-axis pointing toward the reader, the y-axis pointing right, and the z-axis pointing up. Something like this:<p><pre><code>    z\n    |_\n    &#x2F;  y\n   x\n</code></pre>\nSimilarly, if you&#x27;re defining a cone or a spiral or what have you, you&#x27;ll usually do it in terms of an r&#x2F;Î¸&#x2F;z coordinate system, where z is height. So the convention exists.<p>But obviously where the x and y axes are defined, the z axis will be perpendicular to the x-y plane.')
