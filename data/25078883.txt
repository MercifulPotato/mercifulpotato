Instead of thinking &quot;What is the ideal software engineer&quot;, think &quot;what is the ideal feminine software engineer&quot; and &quot;what is the ideal masculine software engineer&quot;. The picture in your head will be very different. If you are a woman you will be compared to the ideal feminine engineer while as a man you get compared to the ideal male one.<p>The prime example is the term &quot;bossy&quot;, women get called this since they are expected to be much more cooperative than men. I think a very big issue right now is that we use men as a standard and say &quot;when women use male strategies they get pushback for being too masculine&quot;, instead to gain individual success they should try to be like successful women. In an ideal society this wouldn&#x27;t be the case, but as is these biases exists and so you have to work with them.<p>And as a personal anecdote, when I looked for jobs as a new grad when I used more cooperative and less personal excellence I didn&#x27;t get any callbacks. I got lots of callbacks when I focused on personal excellence though. Its as if companies assumed I was less competent just because I talk about teamwork, because their ideal masculine software engineer wouldn&#x27;t talk like that. You can see here how it works:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbr.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;how-men-get-penalized-for-straying-from-masculine-norms" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbr.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;10&#x2F;how-men-get-penalized-for-straying-f...</a><p>Edit: The moral of the story is that when we tell men to be more feminine and women to be more masculine we just hurt them. Men and women aren&#x27;t evaluated by the same metrics. People told me &quot;Companies expects you to be a teamplayer, try to highlight that!&quot;, but it was clearly wrong and didn&#x27;t help me at all.')
