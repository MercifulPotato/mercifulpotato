Just use the word Latinos, which is already gender neutral, if you happen to care about it.<p>Or, since Latinx is an adjective (not a noun), use “Latin” which American English, at least, already did before adopting the Spanish Latino&#x2F;Latina. If we&#x27;re dropping it for a non-Spanish gender-neutral English adjective with the same meaning, why not revert to the one we were using before that was only dropped to respect the language of the described population?')
