(It seems you&#x27;ve added SCIM to some software? About how long did it take? Was there any &quot;gotchas&quot;)<p>&gt; the main thing you&#x27;d be missing is &quot;just-in-time&quot; user provisioning<p>Hmm could that depend on the organization using the software I&#x27;m developing? — Possibly they&#x27;ll synchronize user accounts and groups, upon installation of the software, and whenever anything changes — and then all user accounts will be ready already, when someone wants to log in.<p>But if they syncronize only, say, once a day, then, with SAML, one could still log in, and the account would get created and added to the correct groups, also if the sync that would create one&#x27;s account, hadn&#x27;t happened yet? (OIDC could help a bit, but it doesn&#x27;t understand user groups and permissions, only SAML and SCIM does, right.)')
