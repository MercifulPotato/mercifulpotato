They pack up the evidence, rush out the door to talk to their editor. A slick, self-driving car pulls up as they exit the building, they enter and pull away.<p>It is a rainy night, and the car zips along the city roads along thousands of others; just another regular evening. Cars passing each other at break-neck speeds with safety margins that are only really safe with positronic brains at the wheel.<p>We see the street, as seen by the computer. Bounding boxes and labels hovering over multiple viewpoint video feeds, all drawn in slick black &amp; blue cyber aesthetic. Suddenly something changes at the left of the image, alerts go off.<p>Cut to the exterior, super slow motion shot of the care from back right angle, with a big billboard visible on the left side of the road. It shows cryptic patterns that seem to depict running children, but never the whole child, just portions of them, in changing shapes and positions, with neural network adversarial noise covering the rest of the image.<p>Cut back to the board computer&#x27;s view, still slow motion. Red bounding boxes surrounding the billboard, and then a big red warning flashes in the center of the screen:<p>COLLISION IMMINENT.<p>All kinds of meters at the bottom of the dashboard start going wild as the car tries to find a safe exit state, and with the slow-motion slowly approaching realtime again. It swerves to the right. The image gets rocked as it gets hit by another passing car. Another hit. The world on screen turns as the car goes flying.<p>Static noise fills the screen.<p>Next scene:<p>A news broadcast announces that there was a high casualty in accident on Suchandsuch Road last night. Investigators find that it was most probably caused by a repair shop installing a faulty aftermarket AI module into a car.')
