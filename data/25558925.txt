You could assume that our current trend of declining population would reverse and we&#x27;d begin breeding like rabbits once we start living in space habitats but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s very likely. I think there&#x27;s a good chance it would take us thousands of years to fully saturate a star system. We&#x27;d have to master living in space as well as building generational world ships&#x2F;habitats that could traverse interstellar space on multi-generational journeys. Personally, I think the most likely state of affairs (if you assume a hard boundary of the speed of light) is that civilizations colonize a small group of local stars and then begin in-filling the space between them once they know how to build fully self sufficient habitats. This is similar to how we currently exploit the most resource rich areas on our planet and then develop out along transportation networks when we need more space. Outer space is three dimensional though so this process likely takes a much, much longer time. All that assumes no major breakthroughs that allow FTL or radical different modes of being though.')
