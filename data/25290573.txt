So chipping APUs to them is necessary, on the other-hand shipping it to end users is not necessary and in context of limited production capabilities it&#x27;s a bad idea to ship an additional product to a marked where (in difference to OEMs) it&#x27;s hard to judge how many will be sold beforehand and where selling them can negatively affect selling other AMD products.')
