Item(by='dragonwriter', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602703039, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24779816, text='&gt; Politically-motivated violence waged in violation of the law&#x27; (excluding situations of organized war) is the most likely the least controversial definition of terrorism.<p>It is not, nor is it even <i>compatible with</i> the protoypical example from which the term terrorist derives, since the original Terror and the Terrorists who executed it operated entirely within and through the power of the State. Non-state terrorism is a more recent extension of the definition. Nor does it even capture the mechanism of intended effect which defines terrorism (the whole part that motivates the reference to &quot;terror&quot;.)<p>Britannica and, somewhat surprisingly, WordNet have probably the best general definitions I can quickly locate, &quot;calculated use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective&quot; and &quot;the calculated use of violence (or the threat of violence) against civilians in order to attain goals that are political or religious or ideological in nature; this is done through intimidation or coercion or instilling fear&quot;.')
