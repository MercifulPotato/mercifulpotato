For reporting a user or business, the relevant messages are &quot;most recent messages&quot; <i>from</i> the user&#x2F;business. For reporting a group, the relevant messages are &quot;most recent messages&quot; <i>in</i> the group.<p>This feature does not change the privacy story for WhatsApp in any way. You already trust users you are chatting with to not copy or screenshot private messages and share them. You already trust the app to not forward or store your messages without your consent.<p>[1] See bullet point &quot;Your Messages&quot; under section &quot;Information We Collect&quot; on <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whatsapp.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;privacy-policy" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whatsapp.com&#x2F;legal&#x2F;privacy-policy</a>.')
