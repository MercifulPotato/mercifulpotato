So he ended up running all ops and then became CEO, and I am a large passive shareholder.<p>Over the last several years I co-created many other companies – all either venture backed or about to be – from biotech to SaaS to mobile apps to fintech. In all these places there is a team I trust to run them already in place, or being created.<p>The reason other people want to do this with me is that (a) people like being CEOs and having responsibility (b) i have certain superpowers, especially around identifying opportunities, crafting stories, pulling together talent and capital, coaching people, and – thanks to plenty of MDMA&#x2F;LSD use – quickly build deep relationships with a lot of trust (c) most people find it quite difficult to take the first step when nothing at all exists, and I find it very easy and exciting because I instantly imagine how things could work (d) I have been a VC-backed founder for a decade and have gone through a lot of stresses of firing people, dealing with complicated situations, motivating teams at times of hardship etc. (e) i am completely unwilling to do things i do not like doing and as soon as these arise i start looking for someone to delegate them to<p>I love this because I love creating things, building relationships, empowering other people. It feels extremely high-impact, and creates both very significant financial assets and ability to decide my own cash income. More importantly, it constantly builds more relationships and skills and knowledge of how to continue doing this. The flywheel spins up.<p>The work is quite intense and i rarely take holidays but i can do so whenever i want to, because i am constantly delegating and am rarely in the position when something cannot function without me. i don&#x27;t take holidays because i don&#x27;t enjoy them that much. i relax by spending time with interesting people, and that also happens to be a core part of my job since it builds relationships and ideas for the future.<p>Now. i get that this is not a standard &quot;job&quot; by any measure. however, it is a job i have created for myself because i understand myself well. and i think the answer to loving what you do (thus not being stressed) and getting paid a lot is to build your own job. to refuse to be constrained by existing ways of doing things, and to just not be afraid of doing things differently. there are many people out there doing this across many domains and in very different ways.<p>at core the reason i am able to do this is a lot of meditation, psychotherapy, psychedelics, coaching, and a lot of close friends i love. you have to deeply understand what you want, not compromise despite difficulties along the way, and build support systems for yourself. stress management is a skill.<p>good luck figuring this out, this is a very cool and interesting question to consider!')
