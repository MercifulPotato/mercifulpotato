Bitcoin mining drives up the cost of those &quot;waste&quot; energy forms.<p>Excess hydro capacity can be used for electrolysis to hydrogen, hydrogen can also be produced from flared gas. Which can then be used to produce low-carbon-emission steel with hydrogen as a reduction agent.<p>Bitcoin mining makes all that more expensive, less likely and risky, because setting up a few miners is quick and easy. Running a steel mill or electrolysis plant is expensive and longterm. Too risky if bitcoin miners might buy all the cheap intermittent power you planned with.')
