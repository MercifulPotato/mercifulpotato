The &quot;Compression&quot; mentioned in the article is actually an extremely deep, and old and pervasive system common to all animals.  There are too many such filtering and sorting functions at everything from the neuron-neuron level up to different central nervous system nodes and sub-organs filtering and directing the attention of various sensors.  E.g., there is a center completely away from the visual cortex that independently controls the attention and direction of the eyes on a millisecond basis.  It still functions in people who are corticaly blind (damaged visual cortex), and creates interesting phenomena.<p>It does seem that the author is talking more about abstraction, and never really makes the connection trumpeted in the headline, so a bit disappointing.')
