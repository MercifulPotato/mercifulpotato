Another doctor said Trump had been on a certain treatment for 48 hours, which would have been Thursday morning.<p>They issued a statement hours later correcting the timeline, but the statement was unsigned and riddled with errors.<p>Since Trump did a bunch of fundraising and meeting with people (not to mention attending the debate!) this week it’s pretty important to be sure about the timeline. It’s sounding like the original timeline is correct based on stuff the press has discovered but it’s such a mess.<p>It also seems like the only reason we know ANY of this is because someone leaked to the press that Hope Hicks, Trump&#x27;s top aide, had COVID. The White House STILL hasn&#x27;t even taken the simple measure of emailing its employees, or people working on the campaign- Chris Christie, who was just diagnosed, learned that he needed to get tested from the news.')
