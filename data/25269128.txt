I enjoy my job a lot, it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve had in the past decade. I also have a toddler. After I finish work promptly at 5 (sometimes before, and I work from home), it&#x27;s a non-stop series of &quot;work&quot; bathing for the kid, either playing with the kid (while my spouse cooks) or I cook (and she plays with the kid, so either way it&#x27;s busy work for both of us). For anyone with a 2-year old, you know that dinner time is not relaxation. It&#x27;s trying to stuff food into your mouth as quickly as possible while being busy either feeding her, picking up her toys, or calming her down. Then it&#x27;s dishes, maybe a little bit more toddler play time, then it&#x27;s the whole routine of diapers, brushing for her, changing into pajamas, and trying to put her to sleep which takes another 2 hours.<p>I love both my work and my family (and my kid). But the fact is, I have no personal free time until about 11pm. If my spouse has household matters to discuss with me, that takes us to maybe 11:45pm if I&#x27;m lucky. And if I don&#x27;t go to bed before 12am, I pretty much automatically get a migraine the next day. You know what? I still stay up late anyway. Sometimes it&#x27;s hobby side projects, sometimes it&#x27;s doing absolutely nothing but useless internet surfing. I can&#x27;t even help it.')
