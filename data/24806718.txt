Also Stroustrup does _not_ take pride in how big the language is, the exact opposite is true. E.g. you will never ever hear Stroustrup speaking about template meta programming or similar weird stuff. He always tries to teach the practical side of C++. His C++ book is not big because the language is complex, but because it is a genral introduction into programming with C++. In fact, if you want to learn the esoteric features of C++, you have to buy other books.\nImplicit type conversions are inherited from C, the language you called &quot;awesome&quot;. Many arcane features of C are nowadays considered as anachronisms and no modern designed language would repeat them.')
