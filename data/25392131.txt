Item(by='redelbee', descendants=None, kids=[25392343, 25394390], score=None, time=1607725091, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25391384, text='&gt;I love biking&#x2F;walking around the Oracle campus area because they made a bike path and the area is safer than it was before.<p>That general area of the Town Lake trail was always my starting point for runs. My favorite “section” was definitely the trail on either side of the dam. I would park in the lot across the lake from the now Oracle campus and start most of my runs there. I ran thousands of miles with that as my starting point (I was training for ultramarathons) and never felt unsafe. That started in 2010 so I can’t speak to safety before then.<p>I liked the character of those neighborhoods and everything they had to offer. The JuiceLand on Cesar Chavez always brought out the most interesting characters in various states of mind on Saturday and Sunday mornings. There was always a pickup basketball game going at the Metz Neighborhood Park, and sometimes I would take a break  there to refuel and watch for a few baskets. The Oracle campus is on the other side of the lake from there but I think it still had an influence on the neighborhood even that far removed. I won’t say it was a completely negative influence, but it definitely made things less interesting to me. The east side in general was trending in that direction though, so I’m sure it wasn’t all at the feet of Oracle.<p>I don’t live in Austin now. It was nice to reminisce about long runs on Town Lake so thanks for that!')
