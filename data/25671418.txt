In contrast, I&#x27;ve seen 5in USB floppy drives, but they&#x27;re not common. For example, this is a USB controller for $50 - you have to hook up your own drive and provide a housing.<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.deviceside.com&#x2F;fc5025.html<p>It&#x27;s unsurprising there&#x27;s less demand for them than 3.5in drives, but it seems like the difference in demand alone can&#x27;t explain this gap. Is there some technical issue that makes manufacturing drives like this difficult? Or am I missing some other part of the picture?')
