We may say what we like, killing and injuring severely 150K people in indiscriminate nuclear bombing is a war crime. They knew it was. Otherwise they would have bombed Tokyo. Im aware that The targets were were active military bases, but civilians lived there. better yet, they could have bombed Germany too but thats another story.<p>2. You misunderstand the subtlety of modern conquest. Much of SE Asia, JPN, SKOR are countries under pretty much protectorates of US government and it&#x27;s lauaghable to call them sovereign nations. They are in name only.<p>&gt; Regarding the South American anti-communist actions, that is what it took to prevent it taking root.<p>This is a can of worms I&#x27;m sure the US Gov makes sure is fuzzy as hell. No idea why an economic system of another country is of such personal significance to US citizens that they will readily send their sons to die for it. I&#x27;m willing to bet a hairy unicorn that a majority of people in the US have no idea why their country spends so much energy fighting and starting wars in the last few decades other than some basic platitude of &quot;Terrorism&quot; and &quot;communism&quot;. Ever heard of the Panama Canal? The term &quot;Banana republic&quot;? Read a book by the author John Hopkins, an American author.<p>&gt; You can see what the alternative is in Venezuela.<p>Perhaps Maduro&#x27;s mustache rubs Washington the wrong way. They&#x27;ve spent a lot of money and lives fighting mustached enemies the last few decades. He looks like a dictator who abuses his people to no end. A flash replica of Saddam giving the older politicians nightmares. I can only postulate.<p>The real reason Venezuela is failing is because it does not have money (Resource curse schurse.). UAE and Venezuela differ only in one aspect. UAE isn&#x27;t a bastion of Democracy but is filthy rich. The difference is sanctions. And who do you suppose imposes those sanctions at the UN NA? \nWhy? Why do they care?\nHas Caracas ever declared war on Washington?\nDoes the American taxpayer even know where Caracas is?<p>So many questions. So many simple answers. Not easy answers but simple.')
