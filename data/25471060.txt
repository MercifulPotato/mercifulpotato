When you account for the yearly or faster hardware refresh cycles for PCs and other devices like iPads, PS4 and Xbox One are both ancient and at the end of their hardware life cycle. This is exacerbated by Cyberpunk devs being primarily PC developers.  ie. It&#x27;s hard developing a complex open world game. It&#x27;s harder doing it on old gen consoles.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s impossible, but to date, I can only think of Rockstar as the only ones who have done this successfully from the start')
