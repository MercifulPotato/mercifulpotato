If you do, it will drive you absolutely nuts to hear almost any music (since it will almost never be perfectly tuned).<p>Imagine for a moment that you could see all decimal numbers to 100 places, and it turned out that almost never was any number used by anyone else exactly x.0.  Suddenly your world becomes full of &quot;insignificant&quot; but very distracting&#x2F;annoying .9999887424151515 garbage.  That, at least for me, is what absolute perfect pitch is like.  (And thankfully, it can fade away as an ability just as it can arrive as one.)<p>Relative perfect pitch, which simply means you can accurately perceive relative distances between pitches, is very useful.
