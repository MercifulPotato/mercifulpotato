Item(by='LilBytes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607413830, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25342879, text='Yes, but placing Solitaire and Alien Isolation into the same category that &quot;playable&quot; means it can be launched and interacted with at 7-12 FPS is absolutely disingenuous. It wholly matters what type of game we&#x27;re referring to.<p>Yes, Solitaire at low FPS is playable. I mean, it doesn&#x27;t matter. At all. Playable for Solitaire is almost Boolean.<p>A suspenseful, atmospheric horror shooter? How it plays is absolutely important and why has that context been disregarded?')
