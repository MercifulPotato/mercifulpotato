The Usenet killfile model was awful and was a big part of why huge swaths of it were an unnavigable mess for most users--because unless you wanted to expend the effort to build one you didn&#x27;t have one and got the whole sewer pipe spraying straight into your face. And, oh boy, client-side moderation happens on Twitter, it works so well? Then why do female friends whose posts get some attention have a bunch of dudes in their mentions saying how they want to have sex with (consensually or not) and&#x2F;or kill them no matter how many they block? Could it be because it&#x27;s an abject failure of a model due to the low stakes of spinning up a new account--so low that Twitter stopped using egg avatars because they destroyed interaction rates with new users because most of them were troglodytes?&quot;</i><p>Re client side moderation, it&#x27;s possible that <i>users can be educated</i> about effective approaches. Just like they started warming the non-geeks about email with hollywood films (<i>You&#x27;ve Got Mail</i>, 1998), and I&#x27;m sure there must have been similar sort of concerted media efforts for older technology. Automobiles, for example. I -bet- we can dig up content (old films) that basically were teaching the American public how to use cars using movies.<p>Given the inherently democratic aspect of client-side filterings, and serious <i>inherent</i> political concerns with centralized moderation, it seems wrong to give up on the idea simply because the avant garde generation on internet (using mostly antique kludgy UI&#x2F;UX, btw) had problems with it.<p>We can fix client side moderation with education. It is a transitory issue, only.<p>Centralized moderation is inherently problematic for <i>public</i> platforms. (I have no issues with private, members only, platforms opting for centralized moderation.)')
