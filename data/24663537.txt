Many applications expect to have this access. This is what it means to have user space applications. Flatpak is not about fixing or changing this.<p>I as an user could at least expect a sandbox that protects a rogue application from modifying or even reading <i>critical</i> files without user consent: .config of other applications, .ssh&#x2F;<i>, shell configs (</i>profile, <i>rc). A web browser may require create-write access to ~&#x2F;Downloads but not arbitrary read or write access anywhere else with the exception of save-as&#x2F;upload </i>explicitly requested by the user*, and that could be done by the OS file selection dialog giving back the filename + a token. And so on.<p>Perhaps it could even be abstracted to a common &quot;profile&quot; for application classes, and go even further than that and have stuff like raw USB&#x2F;Bluetooth not authorized by the browser but by the OS&#x2F;sandbox layer (to prevent attackers exploiting a browser bug).')
