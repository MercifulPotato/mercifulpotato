Nobody actually knows how it works or what is or isn&#x27;t best. Some people have tried some stuff out and formed different theories around their anecdotal experiences. Some of those theories sometimes translate to other cases; some of them are completely bonkers. There&#x27;s no real way to tell one from the other, because there&#x27;s no concrete shared reality. So instead people argue a lot and the best rhetorician usually wins.')
