There are probably materials in abundance on&#x2F;in Mars that people get paid to live there to extract, process, and send back to earth. Only then does it make sense to say “well we could really use a dentist up here, and a little deli, and maybe a store for home goods. And we can’t keep the team members away from each other, what do we do with all these children that have popped up, perhaps an elementary school?” Like many colonies, the first large foray of onto another planet may involve slave or political exile labor.<p>I’m not much of a sci fi person, but there are real economic reasons to set up shop on Mars beyond a mere achievement for mankind.')
