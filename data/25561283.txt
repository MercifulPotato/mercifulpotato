Item(by='marcan_42', descendants=None, kids=[25561718], score=None, time=1609177762, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25558727, text='Assuming you want to cancel frequencies up to 1kHz, you&#x27;re going to need mics every 30cm at <i>least</i> for a useful sound field. For a 787 fuselage, that&#x27;s about 60 around by 190, let&#x27;s round that down to <i>10000</i> microphones. But of course, then you need electronics for them, and a way to carry the signals back to somewhere for processing. That&#x27;s about 10 Gbps of data, fine, doable, but then you need to <i>process</i> it. Since you need to cancel separately per passenger, that&#x27;s 2.4 million filters (10k mics * 242 passengers) to process. Nevermind that since this is a plane, there is a huge amount of overhead due to safety requirements.<p>This is all assuming this whole idea works, which it probably won&#x27;t, because it&#x27;s not just about the microphones on the fuselage but also how sound is transmitted inside the plane and other noise sources.')
