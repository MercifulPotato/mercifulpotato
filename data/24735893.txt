For the second  time, you claim that my claims are invalid, without actually specifying what&#x27;s invalid and why.<p>You claim to have explained why my criticisms are wrong, but you&#x27;ve done no such thing. In the more recent thread, you insist we have experience manipulating hydrogen at great scale. But I point out we actually have 2,000 times <i>less</i> hydrogen infrastructure. And I point out that 6% of natural gas production used for hydrogen production isn&#x27;t all that impressive because most of it is used for heating, only a fraction of it is actually used in the steam reformation process. Explaining that our hydrogen infrastructure is orders of magnitude smaller than our natural gas infrastructure, you go silent. This hardly looks like a refutation.<p>If you want to actually refute any of my claims please do so. But you&#x27;re just insisting I&#x27;m wrong without even bothering to specific what I&#x27;m wrong about.')
