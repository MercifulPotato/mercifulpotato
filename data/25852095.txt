I&#x27;ve really enjoyed them. However, I like my AirPods Max much better, mostly because of their better UX around pairing&#x2F;multiple devices and better onboard controls (digital crown vs. touch gestures).<p>I also own older Sony Bluetooth headphones, Sennheiser HD-650s, a pair of Bose QC-20i, and several other headphones ranging from cheap to mid-range. I&#x27;m confident I can judge what I personally prefer.')
