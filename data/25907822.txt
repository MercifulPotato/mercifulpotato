I frequently find that audio degrades into a kind of stuttering or static that doesn&#x27;t go away until a reboot.  I&#x27;ve experienced this with multiple DACs (Aune, Centrance, O2, and Presonus) on multiple machines (iMac 5K, 16&quot; MacBook Pro, and hackintosh).  I feel like it&#x27;s worse in recent versions of macOS (say, High Sierra and later), but it&#x27;s intermittent, so it&#x27;s hard to say.')
