In the example each code block run in a fiber blocks at Net::HTTP.get and only continues after it returns a value.<p>Looking at the API for Fiber.. It looks like &quot;resume&quot; returns the yield(generator) or fiber return value? So Fibers can be treated as a sort of Promise? As soon as you start returning fibers from methods you have the coloring problem..')
