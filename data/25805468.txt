So, if that&#x27;s the metric, then they&#x27;ll be profit-driven. Of course, profitability can be optimized for over different time horizons--even if speculatively. For public companies, time horizons tend to be relatively short, or at least quarter-to-quarter profitability is important.<p>A private company, however structured, can define out-competing however its owners want to so long as it can pay its bills and employees.')
