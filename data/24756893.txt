The past decade there has been an increasing ability to find people who are impacted by this propaganda much more successfully than in the past. Everyone points to Hitler - yes, he also was in the right time that his version of BS and motivation impacted people. Today those who want to can utilize these propagandistic methods much more than they can before.<p>In the past if there was one person more capable of organizing hatred they&#x27;d have a smaller impact. Before newspapers it was just in a town. Then you had newspapers (like those in the south accusing blacks of rape and pushing lynching). Then later it was radio and Father Coughlin. Then TV and now the internet.<p>Still the challenge remains how does anyone decide what&#x27;s beyond the acceptable. I&#x27;m terrified that after Trump there will be a series of more successful destructive manipulators.  I don&#x27;t see why that wouldn&#x27;t happen.<p>The reason why this matters even more is the us system where a single vote in a state pushes all those electoral votes together, making it much much more powerful to focus energy on the small misleading stuff. The US has a structural electoral system that makes it matter so much more. Otherwise it would be for a smaller election. I think with time the majority of people will build up &#x27;intellectual armor&#x27; against accepting lies. But it&#x27;s impactful enough now that it&#x27;s the potential end of america.')
