I started as an undergrad at the U of R in &#x27;88 and eventually completed a MSc in Computer Science there. While I was never directly a student of Dr. P, he left behind a nice lab with a few Silicon Graphics Personal IRIS machines.<p>I&#x27;m 51 now and have had, what I feel, is a pretty successful career.  I&#x27;ve worked on animated films, visual effects for films and video games in Los Angeles, New Zealand and in Bellevue, WA.<p>The allure of those SGI machines in the late &#x27;80s is what got me interested in computer graphics.  I was never interested specifically in L-Systems, but I have to thank Dr. P as his work led me to where I am.  I also must thank my advisor Dr. Xue Dong Yang.<p>It was a great place to be.  A fellow student from that era at the U of R just did an AMA on Reddit.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;IAmA&#x2F;comments&#x2F;kfpjhg&#x2F;i_am_dave_plummer_author_of_windows_task_manager&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;IAmA&#x2F;comments&#x2F;kfpjhg&#x2F;i_am_dave_plum...</a>')
