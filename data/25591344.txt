Whilst they &quot;collaborate&quot; on &quot;common&quot; web standards (they being many, btw), iOS and Android (note: only 2) have very well defined apis for how to create awesome native UX. The problem of creating a unifying native abstraction (like react native or flutter) that is actually effective from the User&#x27;s POV, is far more attainable, than that of trying to create a consistently awesome PWA with such inconsistent browser support, across a far greater multitude of platforms than the iOS &#x2F; Android bifurcation in native-land. My $.02.<p>PWAs have always seemed like one of those beautifully idealistic yet totally doomed to fail ideas (at least for several years relative to native-based-approaches). Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think the web will ultimately evolve into the new JVM (read: via WASM), and the beatific promise that was foretold by PWA will finally reach the masses.<p>Reality Check: We&#x27;re not quite there yet. Firefox deleting a legacy, buggy, and dev-time-sink attempt at this, makes total sense to me so they can focus on the other awesome stuff they&#x27;re doing that actually creates real value for the masses <i>today</i>.<p>To be fair - perhaps they could&#x27;ve handled the ticket on this a bit more gracefully...? But then again - they know their stuff, so I don&#x27;t blame them entirely :)')
