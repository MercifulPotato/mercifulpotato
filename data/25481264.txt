For example, recently I&#x27;ve been learning ancient Hebrew and one of the things I learned early on was that it (like Arabic) has a &quot;dual number&quot; which is in a similar grammatical category to English singular and plural, but implies the things usually come in pairs, like hands and eyes. It uses this construct to refer to &quot;the heavens&quot; in Genesis, which immediately raises the question of why ancient Hebrew cosmology identified &quot;the heavens&quot; as dual in number.<p>There&#x27;s something I didn&#x27;t even know I didn&#x27;t know until I started into the field.')
