I already have an Oculus account, and I add &quot;Oculus friends&quot; there, so I assume Facebook can get all my data from there, anyway (including my real name, as I added my credit card to be able to buy games).<p>But I find I mind having to befriend my gaming friends on Facebook, as I may share different content there.<p>In fact, if Facebook wants to become the ultimate social network, shouldn&#x27;t they somehow offer better tools to manage different social circles? (Work, Family, Gaming, Sports, Politics...).<p>I don&#x27;t think their play is to get my Oculus data to make better targeted ads. They already have that data.<p>What I could imagine is that the future of social networking will be in VR worlds, and since they want to dominate social networking, that&#x27;s their power grab (they also work on a virtual world for that, Horizons).<p>But it seems to me their &quot;friendship management tools&quot; are not up to the task yet. I&#x27;ve never digged deeply into their controls, but it shouldn&#x27;t be complicated.<p>It&#x27;s not a new concept, either - weren&#x27;t there &quot;circles&quot; in some network (Google+?). But it didn&#x27;t work out. So instead of forcing this VR merge, perhaps they should focus on solving the circles problem first?')
