I mentioned somewhere else that their Press Release was crap.  If they&#x27;d explained like people reading were adults, (maybe they did and I didn&#x27;t see it) then people would have been a lot less mad.<p>It&#x27;s just context for the conversation I was missing, it doesn&#x27;t mean they are completely blameless, and I support a class action lawsuit.  I just appreciate a fuller context for myself and figured others might as well.')
