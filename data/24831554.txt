There&#x27;s nothing (other than the difficulty of the hack itself) that prevents a compromise of one phone from being replicated across the entire production line, which impacts the security reputation of the entire line.<p>Also, it is hard to imagine the use case for identifying and revoking the attestation for a single user&#x27;s devices that isn&#x27;t troubling.')
