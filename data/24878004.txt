The employee gives away life itself, measured in hours, in exchange for money. Do not trivialize this exchange. All of the value of the company comes from the bottom. The money that the shareholders put in is just a bet. SOMETHING has to back up that money, and that&#x27;s what the employees are for: to help the investors win that bet.<p>Don&#x27;t say &quot;I&#x27;m taking all the risk over here&quot; because it creates an adversarial dynamic with your team. There is no need for you to separate yourself from the rest of the company in that way. You&#x27;re all on the same side and the language should focus attention on cooperation and the benefits which cooperation will bring. Writing a check takes seconds. Real work takes hours, days, months, years off of a person&#x27;s finite life. Try to stay grounded in the real world.')
