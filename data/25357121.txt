Lets say you wanted to search&#x2F;replace a file with sed and sponge, then this does not work:<p><pre><code>   cat file.txt | sed &quot;s&#x2F;a&#x2F;b&#x2F;g&quot; | sponge &gt; file.txt\n</code></pre>\nBecause bash opens file.txt for writing and truncates it \nimmediately, so &quot;cat file.txt&quot; wont output anything. You have to do this for it to work:<p><pre><code>   cat file.txt | sed &quot;s&#x2F;a&#x2F;b&#x2F;g&quot; | sponge file.txt\n</code></pre>\nsponge wont open the file for writing until it&#x27;s sponged everything up. If you remember this, sponge is an awesome tool in the UNIX toolbox.')
