The bigger scarcity is often traffic in any case. Some roads have higher costs than others. etc.<p>Maybe we want to lower transport costs by charging trucks less. Maybe we want to encourage electric car viability by charging them less. I mean, tax policies have outcomes. Doesn&#x27;t it make sense to target outcomes we want?<p>Obviously the road needs to be paid for and fuel taxes won&#x27;t work if people don&#x27;t buy fuel. That said, I think it&#x27;s inevitable that whatever comes next is a policy... encourage some stuff, discourage other stuff, benefit certain people&#x2F;sectors and such. ATM, encouraging electric vehicle adoption with a fuel tax exemption doesn&#x27;t seem crazy.<p>It <i>does</i> create a regressive dynamic, where new electrics are subsidized by legacy ICE. By the time that represents more than a rounding error the fuel tax deficit will be big enough that the tax system will be changing anyway.<p>A better approach is probably a time-of-purchase tax. =')
