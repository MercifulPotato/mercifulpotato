Item(by='mlthoughts2018', descendants=None, kids=[25765607], score=None, time=1610549088, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25758844, text='&gt; “ If you think the maintainer isn&#x27;t doing a good job working on the right issues or maintaining the project, that&#x27;s not the maintainer&#x27;s problem. That&#x27;s your problem.”<p>This is backwards. The maintainer is expecting attention and users. By alerting the maintainer to issues, I would be <i>helping them</i> (using my own extra effort, eg bug reports, feature requests).<p>The nuclear option for a user is to just throw their hands up, not even try to lobby the maintainer to make better choices, and quit using the project. The nuclear option for a maintainer is to completely ignore the user base whose attention they need and whose efforts on bug reports or whose frustrations give them free labor to understand their projects fault points and fix them, and instead say, “you’re not paying me with money, only with attention, time and effort, so I owe you nothing” (as if <i>owing</i> was any part of any of it) and ignore their feedback.<p>Either side <i>can</i> go for the nuclear option. But wouldn’t we hope the social contract in FOSS has a higher standard and people try to both give and receive reasonable feedback, and people try, at least, to consider users’ needs after users have invested attention, word of mouth review, effort on bug reports, etc. before “going nuclear” and gainsaying everything with “you don’t pay me in the form of currency so I owe you nothing.”')
