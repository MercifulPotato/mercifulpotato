These are legally inherited territorial claims recognized postwar but conveniently omitted in all the garbage propaganda reporting for current geopolitics. It in terms of legitimacy, no one in the region has stronger claims than the PRC, period. And incidentally, since these are _inherited_ claims, i.e., none are manufactured by CCP for expansionism, CCP actions in SCS should logically be interpreted as defensive. One of the fundamental job of the state is to protect territorial integrity.<p>The entire historic claims non sense is for the purpose of rebuking PCA ruling, since UNCLOS member states can opt out of compulsory UNCLOS arbitration as part of ratification Which China did because China only acceded to UNCLOS based on condition that territorial claims would be settled bilaterally. Another point conveniently omitted for current geopolitics. The point is, Chinese claims are as legitimate, as are _other_ claimants, but China more so, at least according to customary law. At the end of the day, none of it matters, because possessions is 9&#x2F;10th of the law, and China possesses her claims.')
