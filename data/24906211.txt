Because they installed a faulty service worker of some kind that would break most of the requests. (Both on desktop and android)<p>And on Android, every time I follow a link to Twitter in an app that opens in a web view, it gives me a faulty page that I have to refresh a few times before I&#x27;m able to view it. It loads the page fine, but some rest call or whatever to fetch the tweet crashes.<p>Edit: Not heard many others complain about this before, so mainly thought it was something about my setup. But the huge amount of upvotes this got suggests some Twitter engineers better look into this..')
