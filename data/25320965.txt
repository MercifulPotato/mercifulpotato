What for? I have enough. I&#x27;m done. I just find it sad so many bright people are still led to take the wrong decisions.<p>Someone else said, if god had wanted to help the geeks, it couldn&#x27;t have been done better - anyone could mine, at the cost of $0 on a CPU back then.<p>I was bitten by the HN naysayers and didn&#x27;t.
