Sun believed everyone who said it mattered. It maybe it did for a while. But the world moved on. I still have no firm opinions on how I&#x27;d make an app reskinnable. (I should probably look to see what Qt&#x27;s doing these days.)<p>Well, if they didn&#x27;t bake LookAndFeel in from the start, all of the work would fall on the application developer to manage these things. Having had to look into doing this the way they chose <i>is</i> the best way, what most people have a problem with is the UI didn&#x27;t look fully native on most platforms for a long time.')
