It is transient in the sense that all civilizations have an arc or cycle that involves greatness and then decadence.<p>However, what I&#x27;m talking about is not a perfect set of selfless angels in the ruling class but rather a sense of virtue to counteract the natural tendency of wielding power in a self serving nature. I really see very little of that virtue at all right now. As a very crass but serious example of that, when I was growing up no one in a place of authority was trying to convince me that I (a male) was a girl whereas children growing up now are having to deal with that.')
