They could have made version to run on x86, but they basically conceded to the low end to Linux. They were too busy making money from selling super-expensive RISC-based machines.<p>Solaris had a good version, which I used for a time, while I was running a data center full of Sparc equipment. All the user space stuff was happening in Linux-land. Solaris x86 had a nice repo for various packages, but there was always something you wanted that wasn&#x27;t there. It got really close, though.<p>If one of the bigs would have gotten serious about packaging up, say, Debian&#x27;s userland stuff, they could have put a serious dent in Red Hat, and maybe things would have played out differently.')
