A lot of stuff that passes off as information is actually entertainment.<p>For example, news about some new nutrition study typically don&#x27;t involve any of the hard scientific line of inquiry that actual science work entails (e.g. critically thinking about potential methology flaws, for example.)<p>Reading about some politician slipping out a gaffe says nothing about what is happening in terms of law making (and nuances are often lost in translation when an article does talk about new laws). Etc.<p>A lot of articles are filled with rethoric and&#x2F;or &quot;real life&quot; stories that don&#x27;t really have a direct impact on the reader other than to elicit some form of emotional response. Contrast to actual educational material that is denser and drier, and can make a real impact in the reader&#x27;s future when studied properly.')
