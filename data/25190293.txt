The parent didn&#x27;t say anything negative about South Africa, rather he plainly wondered about the labor market for these skills and why it was necessary to bring talent from another country. <i>It is an interesting and valid question</i> that seems to imply a lack of homegrown US skills.<p>Personally I wondered if the make of tractor was South African and thus the likely source of trained technicians, but that&#x27;s not the case here.
