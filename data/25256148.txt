They are saying vaccines do not work well in immunosuppressed people, the vaccine will not necessarily provide protection.<p>Vaccines work by triggering the immune system in the first place. If your immune system is not functioning normally, the vaccine may work differently or not work.<p>I think it&#x27;s more complicated than just as a blanket &quot;won&#x27;t work&quot;.  But, yeah, more complicated means more complicated -- different vaccines may be infffective, or require a higher dose, or even be harmful to immunosuppressed people. As far as the study, it would probably require a separate study focused on immunocompromised people? The fact that these are new mRNA-style vaccines is possibly relevant, maybe we know even less?  Obviously we&#x27;re in a rush here, there&#x27;s lots of studies that would be really good to do that haven&#x27;t been done yet, all that&#x27;s been done is like a basic &quot;normal people everyone&quot; study. From which immunocompromised people were excluded because they are likely to respond to the vaccine differently, so need a different study design etc.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au&#x2F;vaccination-for-special-risk-groups&#x2F;vaccination-for-people-who-are-immunocompromised" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;immunisationhandbook.health.gov.au&#x2F;vaccination-for-s...</a><p>(And btw, THIS is what &quot;herd immunity&#x27; is about. If enough people are immune (say from a vaccine), then there aren&#x27;t enough carriers to pass it around the population, so those who AREN&#x27;T immune (possibly because they are immunocompromised and the vaccine wouldn&#x27;t work on them or would be dangerous) still have much reduced chance of getting infected. Because, yeah there are people who can&#x27;t take vaccines because they would be dangerous or ineffective, but may still be at high risk for complications from the virus)')
