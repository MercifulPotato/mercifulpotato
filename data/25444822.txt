It had sentences in it like:<p>“ Using a plain text editor without any runtime connection to your Lisp implementation just because you think you prefer its keybindings is stupid and self-defeating.”<p>And<p>“Follow these directions or risk our wrath, or at least unsympathetic attitudes!”<p>The document, mercifully, doesn’t appear to exist any more. Maybe when I called them on it at the time they realized that maybe there’s a better way and changed it. But it definitely made a poor first impression.')
