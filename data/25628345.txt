The author did some introspective work here and you feel the need to berate her organization because you can imagine the scenario that she would die in one year? Yeah, if I had cancer maybe I would stop working too.<p>I feel like you didn&#x27;t even read the post, since the work the author describes includes things like language learning; the fact that you take from this post the goal of making money for other people seems like projection. No where does the post mention even having a job.<p>This is a particular irk I have with HN commenters. They read the title and then respond to what they think the post would be.')
