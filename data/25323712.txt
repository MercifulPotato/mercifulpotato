And I was complaining of a sprain depriving me of long walks for a few weeks.<p>I started walking at a rhythm of 5 hours a week minimum three years ago. And I must say, without exaggeration, that I am a different man now. I haven&#x27;t been sick for 2.5 years; I feel that my immune system is stronger now. Before that, I used to get sick, angina or whatever, twice a year. Also, my legs have become more muscular and my face has become thinner, which makes me look more attractive. I&#x27;m 18 again ;-)')
