And any system which cannot be transparently explained should be shut down.<p>But what would even count as an explanation, and what does a &quot;public&quot; algorithm reveal?<p>There is no line of code that says &quot;if (video.content == extreme) { show_to(EVERYONE) }&quot;.<p>A lot of the dangers are possible from a simple algorithm which merely performs A&#x2F;B testing on whether a certain (randomly chosen, at first) video increases the amount of time a user spends on a site.<p>You could pass a law against A&#x2F;B testing, or require companies to provide deliberately bad suggestions to make their users frustrated, but I&#x27;m not sure if that is a proportionate legislative response.')
