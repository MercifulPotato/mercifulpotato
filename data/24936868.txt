You can still install previously signed drivers. You can even turn on unsigned driver installation and install unsigned drivers.<p>Nothing is really changing on the user&#x27;s side. They might not get new drivers going forward if the company doesn&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t pass HKL, but Windows 7 is out of support at this point. Windows 8 is still supported, to be fair, but I don&#x27;t know of many people who actually run it; it&#x27;s either 7 or 10.')
