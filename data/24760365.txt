Well, if you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re putting friction in front of anybody not authorised to spend to develop &#x2F; test &#x2F; prototype something. Yes, you can give everyone a cloud account and let them use that. But even then you&#x27;ll have people cautiously limiting their usage to avoid accidentally overspending. By contrast, when that server is sitting their idle half the time, I actually feel guilty for NOT trying out some whacky idea on it. Of course, it can work exactly the opposite way - if you DO give all your developers complete freedom to run stuff in the cloud then they have even more liberty than if you give them a fixed server to work with. But I suspect few organisations would tolerate the potential cost risk from that.<p>It&#x27;s a subtle mental difference but I think it can play into outcomes in a significant way.')
