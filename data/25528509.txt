I get some anti-cyclist vitriol, honking, or aggressive passing almost every time I ride.  And I am fast enough to keep up with the speed of traffic!  Some drivers just see bikes and think &quot;I should be in front.&quot;<p>I really don&#x27;t mind the short jaunt to the Fremont bridge, but it does add some extra travel time.  Never ride on the Ballard bridge; it just doesn&#x27;t have anywhere for bikes to be.  The sidewalks are too narrow and unprotected from traffic, and the primary traffic lanes are going 40+ mph.  That whole thing needs to be replaced for the 21st century, although there may be some resistance as it&#x27;s a nationally registered &quot;historic place.&quot;')
