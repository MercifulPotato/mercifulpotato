The biggest age category in gaming is 18-34 by far. They generally also slant strongly to people with both more than average disposable income and higher likelihood to spend that same on gaming and related electronic toys. This makes gaming a 100 billion dollar market atm which is still growing rapidly.<p>&gt; Both of which are market segments with terrible margins.<p>Not even close to accurate. Gaming related hardware is generally quite high margin. There&#x27;s a reason ASUS et all use their gaming imprints as the place to introduce new high end parts. It&#x27;s also a highly concentrated and networked market, making it very efficient to advertise to.')
