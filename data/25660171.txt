The local FB group has been invaluable in finding local resources, getting to know neighbors, and alerting neighbors of local conditions.  The alternatives are basically Nextdoor and craigslist which suffer from network effects among other things.<p>Of course people use the group as a soap-box or meme&#x2F;clickbait sprayer at times, but the mods do a pretty good job such that there are very few wortwhile &quot;forked&quot; groups.<p>Similar applies for a few other interest groups I&#x27;m in. Groups.io is starting to eat their lunch on that, and reddit is gaining steam in the mainstream, but again network effects are strong.<p>When using an app container and limiting engagement with clickbait content, there is still some human value in participating on facebook in these very limited ways.')
