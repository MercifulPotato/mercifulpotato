Water got to be hilariously high, he&#x27;d mentioned that before he rented the place his ground level bedroom adjacent to the garage had been remodeled because of a flood. So like, 8 inches high. Anyways, we had thousands of dollars of lithium batteries on the garage floor... shit got dangerously close, and all it took was clearing some leaves out of the drain to fix. If nobody would&#x27;ve happened to be there though, would&#x27;ve been quite the bad situation.<p>That&#x27;s a bit not answering your question tho - with regards to alarms tripping, know somebody with a warehouse in Sacramento - owner hadn&#x27;t been at the shop for a few days, employee had. One night a security alarm trips, he makes the 20 min drive to the shop, turns out the security alarm circuit had shorted from water 4&quot; high water level caused by a paper towel clogging a sink that was left on. Fortunately he had mostly everything on raised shelving.<p>If you you have a reason to have some alarms, and they go off when you&#x27;re away, you&#x27;ll likely be able to say whether or not it&#x27;s worth it to call emergency services and say literally break my windows and go inside to see what happened. In the case of a burst water pipe or something, they&#x27;d be able to shut off your water mains saving you from further damage. That&#x27;s the jist or so.')
