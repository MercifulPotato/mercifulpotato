Item(by='floatingatoll', descendants=None, kids=[24686487], score=None, time=1601794729, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24670174, text='&quot;Anyone&quot; does not scale infinitely: it only specifies who might participate, not how many can. Each project will collapse — lose work for one day or more — under a certain sheer quantity burden of pull requests. When people say &quot;anyone can&quot;, they don&#x27;t always mean &quot;everyone do so all at the same time&quot;, as happened here. The term &quot;anyone&quot; makes no statement about the frequency of pull requests, and everyone is generally upset about the frequency of pull requests associated with a third party action (Hacktober). Rightfully so: their time is being wasted and their expectations of reasonable behavior are being violated.')
