Every release of BeOS that was marked as a &quot;full release&quot; (as opposed to a developer preview or a &quot;preview release&quot;) could run on Intel hardware, and the BeBox itself was discontinued long before then.<p>This is a tangent, but I don&#x27;t understand people who think BeOS was the heir-apparent to consumer&#x2F;home&#x2F;personal OSes. It had super half baked networking support and absolutely no concept of multi-user or privilege separation. Similar home OSes didn&#x27;t <i>enforce</i> privilege separation or multiple users, but at least had the framework -- BeOS essentially just runs everything as root.<p>It had some neat tricks, but was a pretty underdeveloped OS in some key areas. The fact it never took off isn&#x27;t that surprising to me, and it&#x27;s not <i>just</i> because Be was a small company or that it&#x27;s hard for an underdog to get market share in a crowded space (both of which are also true). It just wasn&#x27;t really well suited for &quot;general purpose computing&quot; in the same way that e.g. Linux, WinNT, or Darwin are.')
