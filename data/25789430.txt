Deep bass, like e.g. 30Hz, has a wavelength of 8.6 metres. If you end up putting two metres of absorbent material on every wall, you don&#x27;t have room for your studio anymore!<p>This is why acoustic panels only work for mid-range frequencies and higher. Alternatively, you can also use bass traps with a membrane tuned to a specific frequency, which can attenuate said frequency without taking up ridiculous amounts of space.')
