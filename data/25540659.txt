Hiring in tech is broken to the extent that tech management is bad. I think because there&#x27;s not the same level of people skills in order to manage teams in tech (maybe because the industry skews toward that as a whole, by deemphasizing people skills at the top of the funnel, and sometimes substituting for specialized &quot;culture fit&quot; as an inaccurate proxy because they don&#x27;t know better). Due to this, i think they are scared to hire anything outside the mythological 20-something &quot;sir, yes, sir, rightaway, sir&quot; , no-brainer-to-manage report. At the consequences, of missing out on lots of great human resource. Vicious cycle.<p>Some small tech teams compensate with elaborate &quot;cultures&quot;, that are really like cults, as a substitute to having management skill. Everyone will behave inline with the haute cult-ure, which may be toxic, simply because, i believe, they don&#x27;t understand people and know how to manage. The cult keeps people inline, so management doesn&#x27;t really have to exist. And they don&#x27;t know how to deal with disagreements, or to manage to get the best from people, so their only responses are: isolate or fire. Because they only have these measures, they need either people who require no skill to manage, or they use a proxy of culture-fit, to pre-screen some sort of conformity.<p>I think the solution is people who are better interpersonal communicators, and better managers. Right now i don&#x27;t see tech jobs valuing this. But i believe it must be out there, somewhere... The maybe in this industry it&#x27;s very rare.<p>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s pockets of awesome in many tech companies that rival or exceed the best teams in other industries, but i do think the brokenness is a real thing.<p>Also, the signal that some companies use, that they need to offer elaborate treats to entice people, while on the surface looks great, i think could also be an acknowledge that they know they don&#x27;t have that much to offer people in terms of great teams otherwise. Catered lunch as compensation for nonsensical management.')
