Good luck finding a spacial file manager today though.<p>&gt; Your home directory is your profile&#x2F;account (what&#x27;s the difference on a single computer?).<p>The difference is that there is no OS concept of an &quot;account&quot;. Right now, you can&#x27;t take your home directory between systems and have it just work because the OS needs you to have a user account. If your user ID on the new system is different from the old one then your file permissions will be broken.<p>The idea is, that the OS doesn&#x27;t really care about protecting the machine from the user in a personal computing scenario. It does, however, care about protecting the system and the user&#x27;s data from malicious applications, so that&#x27;s where the permissions should be.')
