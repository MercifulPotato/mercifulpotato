They were claiming $50-250 per hour with as little as 10 hours a week.  You want to save money?  Have a stable day job and work at Gumroad for 10 hours a week.  With such a short work week I can&#x27;t imagine you&#x27;d be doing much more than simple bug fixes.  I can swing 2 hours of that a day.<p>&gt; retire with a bit over a million in the bank at 40.<p>You might have to set your sights a little higher.  That&#x27;s not gonna carry you to potentially 85 years old.')
