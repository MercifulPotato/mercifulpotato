It&#x27;s not a fetish, I just don&#x27;t want to view porn of women who could very well be girls still. On top of that, exploitation of younger women is much more common. Tags like barely legal, teen, just18, etc all likely have illegal content.<p>It&#x27;s not about the legal status, I just don&#x27;t want to see young girls exploited. Even 18-20 year olds are too young and are often naive and exploited. Look at Mia Khalifa as an example. Young and impressionable, she did a few porn shoots at a young age over some months and now it&#x27;s the defining point of her life and something she&#x27;d love to leave behind.')
