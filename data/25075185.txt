The proportionality factor does indeed change over time, but very slowly. Unfortunately, we have a plentiful of data internationally, as many countries handled the epedimic differently. But the fundamental data looks very similar between countries. \nIn Germany, there is about a factor of 4 between positive&#x2F;death in April and in November. The number of people in intense care has reached April levels. But on shorter time scales the variation is much smaller. And if the number of positive tests doubles within a week and nothing fundmental had happened in testing, then this is extremely relevant. Especially if the trend follows an exponential curve closely.')
