My experience is the opposite. Modern cars are engineering marvels.<p>&gt; the UX is horrid<p>My car&#x27;s UX is absolutely delightful. I have well defined controls (steering wheel, brake pedal, clutch pedal, accelerator pedal, gear shift, light buttons) that are close to 100% reliable and easy to operate. The car works every time just as I expect it to. No surprises, no bs.<p>&gt; the software never gets updated<p>Why would I ever want to update my car&#x27;s software?? It works perfectly. It is almost 13 years old and I don&#x27;t recall ever encountering a software bug. I&#x27;m sure I will continue to use this car as long as my local RTO continues to renew the license.<p>&gt; look and feel of a good middle class car is just trash.<p>Now this is subjective, so I&#x27;ll let you have this one.<p>I&#x27;m sure your Tesla is way better to drive than my $10k car, but that&#x27;s not to say modern cars are &quot;terrible&quot;. They are absolutely amazing.')
