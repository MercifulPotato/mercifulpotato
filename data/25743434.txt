But I have to say it seems to me a bit like whataboutism - let the poor guys go, they aren&#x27;t so bad and we should all now strive for peace. In Europe if you riot at a football (soccer) game you&#x27;ll get charges, on a no fly list, on a watchlist, possibly banned from certain cities during contentious games for the coming decade. I don&#x27;t know how the US handles similar cases, but would you not want a response to those guys? I can storm the house of government and then travel home because it might radicalise my social circle if I face consequences? Sorry but that&#x27;s just absurd and if you think this logic through I can&#x27;t see how anyone can come to this conclusion: radicals of any colour should not face consequences for being part of violent acts because it might radicalise them further.<p>What seems quite obvious from an outside perspective is that these folks just aren&#x27;t used to seeing consequences. They cheer on when &#x27;the other side&#x27; faces them, say protestors at a BLM protest get brutalised by police, even if <i>the individual ones that get beaten&#x2F;arrested&#x2F;...</i> did nothing wrong. But they have never experienced what it&#x27;s like if the state objects to what <i>they</i> are doing. Now they see some rather measured responses and immediately cry foul. And I&#x27;d stress measured response as - again looking from the outside with no stake in this fight - the images are so strikingly different. For instance I haven&#x27;t seen any images of police violence from the capitol attack - total difference to BLM protests where the most vivid images were usually an army of policemen in riot gear and batons <i>advancing</i> towards the protestors. At the capitol it seems the only time police was violent was to prevent entry to the building, which the protestors were trying&#x2F;ultimately succeeded to enter.')
