While I would certainly worry about the  perverse incentives that such a feature would create (such as reducing checkout times to maximize the chance someone starts but doesn&#x27;t finish a book), it seems like a win-win-win: publishers can get sales via libraries, libraries can get a cut of any revenue or lower costs, and users can keep reading the book with page location and metadata intact.')
