Obviously, eugenicist or ableist beliefs could motivate an abortion after a prenatal diagnosis, but choosing to have an abortion is primarily a decision about you and your family.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you&#x27;re referring to with the transgender referenceâ€”any medical interventions trans people have are initiated by the trans person, making it completely unlike eugenics.<p>Edit: I should probably add that eugenics was widely popular less than a century ago in the U.S. and hasn&#x27;t gone away completely. I think these examples are poor, however.')
