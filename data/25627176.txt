Or maybe give some web links? I am pretty familiar with that chip, so hearing this surprises me.<p>For the output side, I guess I you can tri-state the output, but this will by default keep the previous voltage, you will need some resistors to actually emit a voltage outer than &quot;low&quot; or &quot;high&quot;. And Z80 cannot even control this on per-pin basis, since it has no integrated GPIOs.<p>For the input side, I have no idea how would Z80 get more than two states. All the peripherals I know of (like 82C55 GPIO chips) also only provide two input levels as well.<p>The only way to get 3-state input into a system I can think of are:<p>- ADC input followed by software thresholding (this will be pretty slow, and works with hundreds of states, not just 3)<p>- Use external voltage comparators to split a single input wire into multiple input pins. This no long is &quot;single pin&quot; though.<p>- Some FPGA&#x2F;CPLDs have multiple banks with changeable input thresholds. This lets you avoid external comparators. You&#x27;d still need multiple pins for each input wire.')
