Item(by='zepearl', descendants=None, kids=[24812860], score=None, time=1602964691, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24812469, text='I did buy a Volvo V60 hybrid (which is now called &quot;recharge&quot;, which used to be called &quot;twin engine&quot;) in July :)<p>Maybe they aren&#x27;t having a lot of problems selling cars as I&#x27;m still waiting for it to be delivered - the current ETA is December :P<p>I had a wagon during the last 14 years and it was nice - I hope that the Volvo will be a good successor (first time I buy a Volvo). I never felt the need for more height (SUV) but the extra length of a wagon has been often useful , of course especially when carrying around long stuff (e.g. mattress, furniture, ...).<p>The on-demand AWD of the Volvo hybrid without having the maintenance costs for the mechanical transmission to the rear axle was one of the things that made me focus on that car.')
