Item(by='thaumasiotes', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610671046, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25776788, text='&gt; The first interpretation is mistaken. The SAT very explicitly does <i>not</i> test knowledge of high school curriculum.<p>This is correct, but it&#x27;s not really relevant. The SAT subject tests (SAT IIs) explicitly <i>do</i> test knowledge of the high school curriculum, but they are psychometrically equivalent to the SAT I. That is to say, someone&#x27;s SAT II scores <i>do</i> contain the same information that their SAT I scores do, and <i>don&#x27;t</i> contain additional information (such as studiousness).<p>The reason that SAT II scores don&#x27;t get confounded by studiousness is that taking SAT IIs is opt-in -- if someone takes the test at all, then they&#x27;ve been educated in the subject, and the residual is an IQ test just like the SAT. (Counterfactually, if everyone had to take the SAT II Latin, then stupid people with Latin training would often outscore smart people with no Latin training. But that&#x27;s not the system we have; smart people with no Latin training, in reality, don&#x27;t take the SAT II Latin.)')
