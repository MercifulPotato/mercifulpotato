The hard part of the turing test isn&#x27;t &quot;intelligence&quot; but &quot;human&quot; -- imitating a human&#x27;s irrational quirks. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to call that a &quot;level&quot;, because computers are far better at imitating humans than humans are at imitating computers. In other words, humans can&#x27;t even pass a symmetric Turing Test.')
