I mean, we use sight, hearing, touch to detect 3-D space, for example (not forgetting taste and smell too).<p>If time is the fourth dimension, maybe these cells are our evolutionary attempt to sense&#x2F;detect and operate within that dimension.<p>Which explains how the experience of time travel could be possible in at least one way - if we can change&#x2F;affect our sense&#x2F;perception of time (um.. navigating time?), it can seem to us like time travel.  I&#x27;m not saying we would be affecting the timeline itself in this case, I mean more like messing with the sense of time that causes us to &quot;experience&quot; time travel.<p>Ok sorry, that does too sound like too much armchair pseudoscience, but this article and some of the other comments just got me thinking.')
