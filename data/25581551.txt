With comparison functions you can implement a constant time comparison that takes the same amount of time. In this case it isn’t really a crypto problem, so anything where we are confident about things taking the same amount of time is fine. Basically in some parent method&#x2F;func make sure we always spend 2000ms or whatever time is that is always greater than the max runtime of the slowest path. Secondary &#x2F; defense in depth mitigations would be rate limiting this page and making it purposefully slow on response, just to make it that much harder to collect samples &#x2F; abuse it without being noticed. The captcha is a nice touch, but it didn’t seem particularly strong (a good captcha solver could break it). Still, captcha will chase off a lot of script kiddies. You don’t have to be faster than the bear, just faster than the slowest person ;)')
