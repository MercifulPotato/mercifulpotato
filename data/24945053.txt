Item(by='outworlder', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604080800, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24944499, text='&gt; Many consumers will stop using a service if they have to pay any money for it with little regard to how useful the service is to them<p>I don&#x27;t agree.<p>If the service is free, you can just use it. The moment you have to pull your wallet, you start doing cost benefit analysis. &quot;Do I <i>really</i> need to use this?&quot; The answer is often no, even though some benefit could be potentially worth more than $2. Potentially. Often, it is difficult to calculate a monetary value.<p>Not only that, but this is a case of &quot;I have altered the deal, pray I don&#x27;t alter it further&quot;. Had they started with some limitations in place, and then charged to <i>expand</i> them, this probably wouldn&#x27;t have caused such backlash. People don&#x27;t really like things taken away from them, even if they originally paid nothing. They tend to prefer deriving some sort of &quot;benefit&quot; out of a deal.<p>As for developers... I&#x27;m another one who ditched IFFT. Not just because they want to charge me, but because they started charging manufacturers a lot too, which caused many of them to drop IFFT integrations (even though these same manufacturers kept many others, like Alexa). Having things stop working, specially if it&#x27;s related to home automation, can be a bigger hassle than setting them up &quot;properly&quot; in the first place.<p>So now I have Home Assistant and Node Red. With Hass.io, all you have to do is download the image, put on a SD card, stick it into a Raspberry Pi and you have Home Assistant. A couple of clicks and it installs Node Red already integrated and ready to go.<p>Does it cost more than $2? Certainly. In both labor and parts. In return, I can integrate almost all my devices (I&#x27;m missing a couple that don&#x27;t have APIs at all, but they didn&#x27;t work with IFFT anyway). I can do things that IFFT can&#x27;t even dream of. I don&#x27;t have to worry about price increases, EULA changes, keeping payment information up to date, cloud or internet outages. If the Pi goes up in smoke, I can throw it away and move the SD card over (or restore a snapshot).<p>Yes, it did cost a couple of hours of work. But since I had to do <i>something</i> about it anyway, might as well bit the bullet and trade off the time I&#x27;d be watching a movie to do this instead. I&#x27;d argue that the resulting system is worth way more than $2 a month.')
