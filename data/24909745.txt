Thus FB should go after the real violators - their users. I wonder why FB didn&#x27;t do it ...<p>I mean i can write any stupid EULA, yet until you agree to it my C&amp;D based on that EULA is just my personal hallucinations, and even if you agree to it, your communication&#x2F;business&#x2F;etc. partners don&#x27;t magically become bound by it too.')
