And yes, California has a huge problem with building homes &amp; infrastructure, but even so, it&#x27;s been growing at around 8.5% for a while. At the same time people have been leaving all along and it&#x27;s inevitable that changes like this will happen. I honestly think that Oracle doesn&#x27;t even benefit from being in the SF area anymore anyway, they sell maintenance contracts to fortune 500 companies, you can do that from anywhere. And no one is being forced to relocate, so anyone with school-age kids or an employed spouse is likely to stay anyway.')
