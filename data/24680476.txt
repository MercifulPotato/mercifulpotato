Google can serve 1&#x2F;3 of traffic for all routes, AWS could do the same.<p>I don&#x27;t think folks realize how SMALL the root dns traffic is. Youtube &#x2F; netflix &#x2F; amazon prime video are just orders and orders of magnitude more demanding in terms of bandwidth - every second they are pumping MULTIPLE HD streams to millions of folks. They measure bandwidth terrabits per second. Even at 30 frames per second, we are talking incredible bandwidth.<p>DNS responses should be 1K or less (often .5K). About 40 netflix viewers at their top quality use the same bandwidth? Netflix has far more than 40 users.')
