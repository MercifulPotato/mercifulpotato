C# IEnumerables already have more overhead than iterators in C++&#x2F;Rust due to historical reasons that can&#x27;t easily be unwound now, and F# Seq adds a bit more on top, it isn&#x27;t horrible it is just too bad.<p>The ergonomics of LinkedLists really aren&#x27;t any different than could be achieved with an array backed List, it just isn&#x27;t done. I realize part of that is because it facilities immutable data structures, but they are often used when that isn&#x27;t happening.')
