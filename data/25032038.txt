I can&#x27;t find the story&#x2F;interview right now, but GIMP is literally just something like 3 or 4 guys working on it in their spare time.<p>For a lot of folks, GIMP is a fine photoshop alternative, even for more advanced uses. Is it perfect? Obviously not. But remember, it&#x27;s just a bunch of devs in their spare time. Don&#x27;t like it? Then don&#x27;t use it, these people really don&#x27;t owe anyone anything. How many devs are working on photoshop full-time? It&#x27;s fine to point out &quot;unfortunately GIMP isn&#x27;t quite there as a 1-to-1 photoshop alternative, because [...]&quot;, but IMO it&#x27;s important to do this in a way that doesn&#x27;t crap all over the dev&#x27;s best efforts.<p>I worked on a few projects where people felt they had the desire to come in and say that I &quot;must&quot; implement feature X or Y because &quot;commercial product Y has it&quot;. Like, mate, I&#x27;m just this random guy with a day job and hobbies outside of software that occasionally works on this. Glad it&#x27;s useful to you, but you don&#x27;t tell me what to do. It&#x27;s probably not your intention, but these kind of comments come off as really shitty.')
