Whereas it&#x27;s very very common for people to try micro optimizing their code as they write it. Generally speaking it&#x27;s much easier to profile and refactor well written but potentially slow code then it is to try to understand and untangle a mess of &quot;optimizations&quot; that are also a performance nightmare.<p>Admittedly this may depend on the domain you&#x27;re working in. And of course some people may take the advice to an extreme in the other direction but this is (IMHO) rarer and much easier to correct.')
