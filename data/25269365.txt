We&#x27;ve been growing like crazy over the past year, we&#x27;re in over 300 hospitals with hundreds of thousands of doctors performing millions of price transparency transactions per month.<p>This is a particularly hard problem in the US Health system and we have great momentum. If you like solving difficult problems that translate to a material improvement in someone&#x27;s quality of life, e.g. access to a medication they wouldn&#x27;t otherwise be able to afford, then we should probably talk.<p>We&#x27;re cloud centric and use ruby on rails and more recently kotlin for transactional services, and python for data pipeline and other data intense systems. We&#x27;ve been fully distributed since the pandemic struck, most of us were based in the Denver area, but as we&#x27;ve grown in the past half-year we&#x27;re now open to candidates anywhere inside the USA.<p>Please check out our careers page as we have many roles currently open! <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rxrevu.com&#x2F;join-us&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;rxrevu.com&#x2F;join-us&#x2F;</a>')
