The interesting &#x2F; challenging part was actually understanding the problem domain and how we could actually leverage data, the technical and algorithmical challenges were, for the most part, pretty easy. It was mostly data wrangling and importing some classifier or regressor from scikit-learn.<p>Of course, there are also super interesting and technically challenging jobs in ML out there.')
