That means the CCP maintains control of the religious narrative, so that members don&#x27;t have a religiously-derived moral center.<p>Thus the final arbiter of right and wrong is the CCP. You can see where this leads.<p>The Soviet Union tried asking for compromise from the Vatican, but the Pope consisently told them no. (There&#x27;s a famous article about John Paul II doing that. It was a very short conversation, being a one word answer, &quot;No.&quot;) Unfortunately, the Vatican compromised on this going  back to 1950 with the CCP.<p>Regarding lawyers, the CCP has warned HK lawyers to not represent anybody against the state. They have also created parallel social media profiles and sent impostors to client meetings, then revealed the meeting notes to discredit the real lawyers. So clients aren&#x27;t sure if a lawyer is real or not anymore.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ucanews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;vatican-cardinal-accused-of-manipulating-pope-over-china&#x2F;87347#" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ucanews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;vatican-cardinal-accused-of-man...</a>')
