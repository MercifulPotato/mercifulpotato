That will come later on. What we offer right now is search on StackOverflow and public GitHub code.<p>Later on, we want to add many other integrations and offer a single input to let you search in all of them. We want to let you search in your infrastructure and actions you can do with them (we built Sidekick for this - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getsidekick.app" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getsidekick.app</a>), docs, your local code, your team wikis, other 3rd party dev tools like Sentry, etc.<p>Also, we want to add &quot;context&quot;. With this feature Devbook will understand what you&#x27;re currently working on in your code editor&#x2F;IDE and will offer you suggestions based on that. For example, you might get errors in terminal, Devbook will parse them and automatically search for answers. This way you will have answers for you problem without even having to search for anything.')
