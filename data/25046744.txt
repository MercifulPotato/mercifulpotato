Grocery store products rely far more on branding, and slotting fees are often used for market research.<p>Stores <i>cannot</i> reproduce the branding, therefore their own-brand products don&#x27;t have the same competitive appeal.<p>Amazon actually hides prominent branding. A few big brands have their own mini-stores, but most of the time you can&#x27;t tell if you&#x27;re getting a product from Amazon, from the original manufacturer, or from a retailer.<p>So when Amazon uses market analytics to decide which products to make and sell, it has a huge advantage - and it can and does wipe out existing sellers. Which is something grocery stores don&#x27;t do.')
