Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t sell the tips separately, but I did find a list of Pilot pens which are said to have compatible tips: Plumix, Pluminix, Prera, Penmanship, 78G, Kakuna.\nIt looks the Plumix is $10, which seems steep for the tip, but I guess it&#x27;s better than paying another $20-ish for a second Metropolitan.<p>On another note, I came across the Platinum Curidas pen. It&#x27;s a clicky fountain pen! I&#x27;m very tempted to buy one, but I&#x27;ve never spent anywhere near $80 on a pen before.')
