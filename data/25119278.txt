Not only is national demand nowhere near enough to use up the Shanghai production, but they&#x27;re having to export MIC vehicles <i>and</i> adding Model Y production.  All of this with strong government backing of Tesla (as Musk said &quot;the same as any Chinese company&quot;) and Chinese banks being told to accept any loan for a Tesla vehicle.  Despite that they&#x27;ve had more price cuts than quarters and demand does not show any signs of improvement.<p>This also on the back of the ticking time bomb that is their Shanghai contract.  We should probably wait until the end of 2023 to see if Tesla &quot;succeeds&quot; in China.')
