This kind of overcomplicated representation usually happens because people put too much effort into designing their representations up front. If you follow story-oriented development and only implement the parts they actually need to get the current task done, you never end up with these wasteful extra states because you never actually needed them. But people think that planning before coding is somehow virtuous, and then they&#x27;re tied to following those plans.')
