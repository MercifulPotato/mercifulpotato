The following script is on my current problematic one as &#x2F;usr&#x2F;lib&#x2F;systemd&#x2F;system-sleep&#x2F;wakefix.pl<p>#!&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;perl\nopen(FILE,&quot;&#x2F;proc&#x2F;acpi&#x2F;wakeup&quot;);\nwhile(&lt;FILE&gt;) {\n   chomp;\n   if(&#x2F;enabled&#x2F;) {\n      ($a,$b) = split &#x2F; &#x2F;;\n      system(&quot;echo $a &gt;&#x2F;proc&#x2F;acpi&#x2F;wakeup&quot;);\n   }\n}<p>[Sorry about the mangled formatting]<p>It just turns off everything that is enabled to wake the machine up.  As this list happens not to include the power button - the only thing I want to be able to wake the laptop up - this works fine.<p>I&#x27;ve never experimented with auto-suspend on lid close and auto-resume on open; maybe that&#x27;s what&#x27;s more troublesome.<p>Another thing that&#x27;s not suspend-resume, but nonetheless annoying - if the machine is running an SDL fullscreen thing (Tuxpaint) or if the MATE desktop has a pop-up menu open, the power button won&#x27;t suspend the computer, because something intercepts the button press.<p>My experience with suspend&#x2F;resume on <i>Desktop</i> machines has been 100% bad, on the other hand.  Usually they suspend just fine, but don&#x27;t resume to a usable state.')
