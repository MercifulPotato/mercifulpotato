The fact things have gotten worse in some aspects of our lives doesn&#x27;t mean we need to regress the things that are actually working so well you <i>didn&#x27;t even know it was an issue</i>. If anything this is an argument for the opposite of what you&#x27;re suggesting.<p>What I don&#x27;t get is why you&#x27;re advocating for your own freedoms to be taken away. Don&#x27;t carry water for the car companies, if they want more freedoms they can use their money and lobby for it. You don&#x27;t need to do their job pro bono, leave that up to Citizens United.')
