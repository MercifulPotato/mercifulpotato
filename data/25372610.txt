Tax the wealth of the dead rather than the earnings of the living.<p>If we could slash income tax in half but implement an inheritance tax of, for example, 50% above a certain threshold, it would be a win-win for everyone. The rich would still leave lots of money to their kids and the average person would get to keep more of their earned money. It&#x27;s more meritocratic on every level.<p>Sadly, so many of our leaders now are very wealthy themselves, so this isn&#x27;t a proposition they&#x27;re likely to be enthusiastic about.')
