Item(by='abeppu', descendants=None, kids=[25962411], score=None, time=1611953478, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25961420, text='This specific case, and the norm of interviewing without access to references is not that interesting.<p>But it is kinda like a specialized version of a fun party question, &quot;With what you know now, if you were sent back in time, how far could you go and usefully employ your knowledge of the future?&quot; (E.g. I know chemical fertilizer is a big deal, but I definitely do not know how to make it. I studied heat engines in a physics class, but could not spark the industrial revolution a century earlier.)<p>Maybe the midway point between these is something like, &quot;if you were sent back to an earlier era in computing, how far back could you go while usefully applying your current knowledge?&quot; E.g. I work with the jvm constantly and I know that it was a big deal for a popular language to have an actually described memory model, but I couldn&#x27;t build it myself in the 80s. Maybe I could build MapReduce or Spark in the 90s?<p>It&#x27;s _hard_ working without the informational resources you&#x27;re used to, but there are so many more fun ways to explore that gradient than web apps.')
