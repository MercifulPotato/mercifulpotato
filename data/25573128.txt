My 5k 27&quot; iMac (2015) is getting a bit long in the tooth, and I have a 2nd 27&quot; 4k display next to it for more real estate. The M1 Air is a revelation. The current Mac Pro is just WAY too expensive.<p>Whatever Apple releases as the &quot;awesome&quot; desktop machine, whether &quot;M2&quot; Mini Pro, a true Mac Pro that&#x27;s not $5000, it&#x27;ll be on my desk with an ultrawide.<p>And yeah, I never had a sunflower iMac, but THAT was cool.')
