But it doesn&#x27;t seem likely to me.<p>Games are real-time. And frame rate expectations are getting higher (60, 90, and even 120Hz) which means frame times are getting shorter (16ms, 11ms, 8ms). Rasterization is likely to always be faster than raytracing so the tradeoff will always be there.<p>Pixar movies look better and better ever year. The more compute they can throw at the problem the better pixels they can render. Their offline rendering only gets more complex and higher quality every year. It&#x27;s so complex and expensive I&#x27;m genuinely afraid that small animation studios simply won&#x27;t be able to compete soon.<p>Maybe raytracing will be &quot;fast enough&quot; that most gamedevs can use the default Unity&#x2F;Unreal raytracer and call it a day. But imho the author is spot on that AAA will continue to deeply invest in highly complex, bespoke solutions to squeeze every last drop and provide competitive advantage.')
