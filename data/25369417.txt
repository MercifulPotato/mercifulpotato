They seek it out because it&#x27;s safer to trade with --- retail investors, unlike hedge funds, tend not to follow up their 100-share orders with huge numbers of subsequent hundred-share orders. Safer means cheaper. Market makers chop up the cost savings with brokerages, which is where the payment comes from.<p>What rings true to me --- for whatever that&#x27;s worth to you --- is that Robinhood influences its user behavior in ways that are bad for its users and generally good for the firms who execute its trades. Of course, that&#x27;s true of anything that gets users trading more, which, of course, is something users should not be doing.<p>Robinhood is bad! It&#x27;s just not bad due the conspiracy theory Taibbi invokes. What&#x27;s frustrating is that he&#x27;s been saying this for awhile, and he&#x27;s had plenty of time to investigate and build some understanding of how the market is structured. Matt Levine can explain it, entertainingly, to a lay person in just a paragraph or two. Taibbi simply doesn&#x27;t care, and counts on you not caring either.')
