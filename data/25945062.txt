Item(by='throwaway0a5e', descendants=None, kids=[25945522], score=None, time=1611854046, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25944443, text='&gt;Go to the third world and you&#x27;ll see that reliability and longevity give Toyota a huge cachet that is basically unrivaled.<p>&gt;That effect is amplified in countries that have import tariffs on automobiles, because the secondary market is large.<p>This is the exact same naive logic people use to justify Tesla&#x27;s valuating.<p>On one hand you have yuppie fanboys bindly harping on about Tesla&#x27;s magical engineering in the face of an Impala interior topped with a big tablet and panel gaps from the 80s.<p>On the other hand there is another yuppie fanboy harping about &quot;muh hilix&quot; despite the fact that Toyota has lied through its teeth about rust in North America for ~30yr, the Hilux&#x2F;LC aren&#x27;t outstandingly (in the literal sense) popular in Asia and people in Africa&#x2F;ME will bolt a machine gun to anything that runs regardless of brand.<p>Camrys and Priuses are popular in the 3rd world because they are popular among moneyed people (i.e. the people who trade in 10yo cars instead of selling private party) in the first world and because of how the used car export market works (basically vaccuming up &quot;nice&quot; trade-ins that are too old for first world lenders to finance) they wind up popular in the 3rd world.  People act like this is special about Toyota but it&#x27;s not.  The 3rd world is chock full of examples of other cars those same demographics buy.  Chile practically runs on the 2nd-4th Gen Honda CRV and the GMT900 Chevy Suburban may as well be the official vehicle of Mexico (these are but two examples).<p>My point is both brands have the same moat of moneyed first world delusion surrounding their stock.  Toyota just isn&#x27;t a meme-stock popular with retail investors.')
