But as I started typing more notes, I realised that just the act of typing out my thoughts and putting them into prose goes a long way to understanding something [0].<p>Nowadays, if I don&#x27;t understand something, I head to the keyboard and start explaing it in text and it pretty much always works. I rarely revisit notes, mostly to link them together and very seldomly to revise them. If I have the time to organize the notes, that&#x27;s great, if not, that&#x27;s fine too.<p>I don&#x27;t know know if this will work for you though. Learning is highly personal and imo just trying to find new ways to learn things can help a lot too.<p>[0] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Generation_effect" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Generation_effect</a>')
