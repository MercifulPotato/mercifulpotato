Your CFM calculation will also inform duct size and make up air requirements. Lots of sites do this but here&#x27;s one.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prolinerangehoods.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;cfm-need-range-hood&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.prolinerangehoods.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;cfm-need-range-hood&#x2F;</a><p>You can vent both the gas oven and the stove separately.  You have to buy high end appliances for that.  I&#x27;ve seen them but can&#x27;t remember.. maybe a Viking stove or something prosumer-commercial.  Make up air can be a cracked window or a separate intake duct that opens up when the vent is turned on.  Your local building code will have specific requirements.<p>You can duct a hood out of an external wall or even better out of the roof. If you go with a roof vent you can install the extractor fans in the duct in the attic which helps reduce noise if that&#x27;s a concern.  What you can do will depend on your specific kitchen.<p>I have found that the stove top is worse than the oven for emissions.  The reason is that my exhaust hood is under-powered and it&#x27;s a microwave&#x2F;exhaust combination that doesn&#x27;t extend over the entire cooking surface.  So I would advise a hood larger than the stove top itself, install a larger duct and I would overestimate the CFMs required.  If you get a multi-speed range hood then you can adjust it as necessary.<p>I actually think electric ovens are better combined with a gas stove top.  Electric ovens though do have a tendency to fail at inopportune times (e.g. the holidays!)')
