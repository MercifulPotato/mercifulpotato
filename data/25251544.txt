You hardly need 1080p 30pfs at a high bitrate to aim through crosshairs. You can totally split the feed to a low-resolution wide field of view (FOV) feed, then crop your feed to a low FOV once the target is acquired to enhanced apparent resolution. Common thermal scope are generally 320Ã—240[0], and that&#x27;s plenty to hunt at night. Reduce the frame rate to 15fps, and that&#x27;s 54x less raw bandwidth, without accounting to whatever gains you can gain with H.264. I&#x27;d probably implement some sort of variable bitrate, aim to the general target direction with the high FOV low-resolution low-bitrate feed, then zoom to the crosshair section (low FOV, high resolution, even though the &quot;effective&quot; resolution is the same) and higher bitrate.<p>[0: btw, I&#x27;m not not implying a thermal scope was used here, but simply drawing a parallel for comparison with off the shelf  commonly used hunting equipment. If 320x240 is enough to kill a coyote at night at 100 yards, it&#x27;s plenty to target a human. Not to mention full-auto fire will cause recoil and whack your aim, so you&#x27;re not looking to repeat a 5-shot group within dime either, just shoot in the rough vicinity and spray the target with projectiles.]<p>Also, the US army (not implying US involvement here) is piloting drone from the other side of the planet, so getting a signal out of a country is not very difficult.')
