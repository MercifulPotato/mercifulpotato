One is a appservice. You got a bot user that relays everything and you get messages that are basically &quot;BotUser: &lt;Alice&gt; Hello world&quot; using the official API. This is currently allowed, but doesn&#x27;t allow access to 1:1 chats. The other is &quot;puppeting&quot;, the bot logs in as Alice by Alice providing her credentials and hitting endpoints the actual Web app uses. This results in a less obvious, nicer experience for people on he discord side but is the one that is banned')
