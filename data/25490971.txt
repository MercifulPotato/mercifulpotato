You can think of evolution and genetic mutation a kind of &quot;play&quot;, and it&#x27;s not all that surprising that this mechanism is built into every creature. We have to act somewhat randomly or erratically in order to overcome whatever obstacle we&#x27;re facing (which sometimes we aren&#x27;t even aware). I also become keenly aware of this when I play with ML because we design this kind of randomness into the system on purpose. I think that it&#x27;s universally acknowledged truth that every creative&#x2F;intelligent being has to have a right mixture of randomness and focus.')
