When using `::set-output name=spam::eggs`, you seem to have to refer to it via `steps.foo.outputs.spam`. So if you keep steps that set outputs very simple, and&#x2F;or the set-output echo is the last command of the step, then it should mitigate that?<p>Is the general consensus that `$GITHUB_ENV` offers less attack surface, despite not being scoped to a step?<p>Some guidance on this would be great from Github&#x27;s side. Also appreciated: a way of turning off magic stdout strings in the YAML, and a way to set outputs via a more robust mechanism, and&#x2F;or to scope which steps can modify which environmental variables. I get not wanting to break existing CI runs, but giving the people who want it an option to harden the CI proactively would be great. I don&#x27;t really care if this would break some existing actions, either - seems fine to do for opt-in?')
