We&#x27;ve got a good team culture, no boxing gloves or overly-zealous standards on code reviews. We maintain a low friction to push changes to production, but we still pay careful attention to quality. Though I&#x27;m not doing front-line customer support, I do get to interact with customers to gather ideas about upcoming feature or tell them when bug fixes &#x2F; features are released, which I find to be really fulfilling. We&#x27;re not constantly building concrete deadlines just for the sake of deadlines - it&#x27;s really about &quot;what would be best for the customer?&quot;. We enjoy shiny technology when it makes sense, or if it would make the dev team legitimately happier, but we try to keep our tech&#x2F;design choices pragmatic. I think we&#x27;ve done a good job of embracing and enjoying the fully remote culture (fun on slack, off-topic video calls to catch up, that kind of thing).')
