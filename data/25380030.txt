It would mean a catastrophic interruption to the customers application exactly when its the most popular&#x2F;active. And theres no practical way to determine whether the customer is “trying it out” or running a key part of their business on any particular resource.<p>On the other hand retroactively forgiving the cost of unexpected&#x2F;unintentional usage <i>doesnt</i> impact the customers users. And with billing alerts the customer is able to make the choice of whether the cost is worth it as it happens.<p>Note: Principal at AWS.
