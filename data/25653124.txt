If memory serves that&#x27;s considerably more than halfway through the first book. I am generally bored by &quot;young person who&#x27;s clearly destined for greatness goes through various adventures around their school&#x2F;apprenticeship&#x2F;home town&quot; and so once that part of the book was over I liked it a lot more. By the end I was loving it.')
