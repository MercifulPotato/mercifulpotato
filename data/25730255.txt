Does it work?<p>You even provided a &quot;quote&quot; of something I never said.  Good on you.<p>You made a statement &quot;Oath Keepers in particular seem to have had a large and heavily militarized detachment&quot;.  I asked for source video, which you now can&#x27;t find and instead offer a video that doesn&#x27;t corroborate your statement.  So, who is moving goal posts?<p>What I am saying is the people causing the violence (including in the video you provided) are crazy larpers and MAGA fanatics, not oath keepers.  Oath keepers are typically former military, open carry weapons, and don&#x27;t look like they just broke out of mom&#x27;s basement.<p>I am also saying I haven&#x27;t seen a video of anyone who looks militarized in either organization, coordinated assault tactics, or armament.  Can you cite a source video that demonstrates your statement is even close to true?')
