What they can do more of is invest in more R&amp;D for moonshot energy products. Or invest into existing green energy areas. I believe there are just better short term returns on PR (deceiving the public as much as possible), buying help &amp; protection from regulators, and the status quo generally. I also believe the powers that be in that industry, like many others, are old, uninspired, and unreasonably resistant to change. Like Zuckerberg, they&#x27;re more afraid of lost profit than destroying the world, whether by a lot or a little.')
