Item(by='mannykannot', descendants=None, kids=[25419110], score=None, time=1607961140, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25418627, text='&gt; Modern philosophy focuses on arguments from Axiom where a statement is taken to be true as a starting point for an argument.<p>What this means is that philosophy ultimately becomes an extended argument over which propositions to take as axiomatic. One commonly-used technique in this is the thought experiment, and some well-known, much-debated examples, such as Frank Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Mary&#x27;s Room&quot;, are <i>not even</i> anecdotal evidence.<p>While, I suppose, analytical philosophy could always be presented in the form an analysis of what follows from a given set of axioms, what almost invariably happens in practice is that individual philosophers act as advocates for the particular axioms that they believe actually hold.<p>There also seems to be a pervasive shared assumption in current analytical philosophy that analysis of the use of language can be the ultimate arbiter on questions of how the world actually is - a questionable belief that is not questioned as much as it should be, or so it seems from my very limited perspective.')
