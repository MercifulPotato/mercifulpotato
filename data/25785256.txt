Item(by='01100011', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610670812, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25779585, text='Yeah, just picked up a Fitbit Sense since it&#x27;s on sale at Costco.  It&#x27;s almost great, but has some serious flaws.  The capacitive button is dumb.  Not allowing me to upload music is dumb.  The processor is slightly underpowered or the software needs optimizations because occasionally it has serious lag when swiping on the watch face.  Having the watch accidentally turn on with full brightness while I&#x27;m trying to sleep just sucks.<p>Other than that, it&#x27;s a pretty nice device.  Unfortunately it requires a subscription to get the most out of it.')
