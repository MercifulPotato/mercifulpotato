The universes we&#x27;re talking about are the spaces of possibilities that arise from sets of rules.  Examples include number systems and physics models built on them.  Newtonian physics, built on Euclidean space; Einsteinian physics, built on space distorted by mass; quantum circuits, where modular arithmetic can show up.')
