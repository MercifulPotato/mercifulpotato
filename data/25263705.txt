Creating the image is O(number of dots) work; displaying the image is O(number of pixels) work and GPU-accelerated and peanuts.<p>I think this because in the end, after all the axis settings and such have been determined (and drawing the axes <i>themselves</i> is surely not the bottleneck), all that remains is just drawing the dots in the rectangular area set out for it. My benchmark does only that part, and as I said, I&#x27;m about 50x faster than matplotlib. (C++ and not Python, so I&#x27;m not picking on matplotlib, just observing.)<p>But anyway, if this issue is to be solved it is to be done by contributing to Octave&#x2F;matplotlib etc, not by throwing around proof-of-concepts on HN. :)')
