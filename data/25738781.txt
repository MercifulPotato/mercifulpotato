Item(by='MartinCron', descendants=None, kids=[25740682], score=None, time=1610405223, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25737725, text='A lot of people conflate &quot;NPR&quot; with &quot;public radio&quot; in general. So your local public radio station may air some things that are &quot;clearly aligned with the Democrats&quot; but as an actual news organization, NPR News is as good as any out there.  They take fact checking seriously, they issue corrections when they get things wrong.  They take time to put things into historical context and they don&#x27;t bend over backwards to give &quot;both sides&quot; to debates that clearly don&#x27;t have two reasonable sides.<p>If it&#x27;s so clear, find me a single example of NPR news being aligned with the Democrats in a way that is divergent from objective reality.')
