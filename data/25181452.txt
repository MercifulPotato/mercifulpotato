Item(by='cameroncooper', descendants=None, kids=[25181927, 25181554], score=None, time=1606082003, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25181402, text='I dunno. For me this watch is nearly perfect. It&#x27;s incredibly thin, lightweight, waterproof. It shows the time, day and date. The battery will last for 7-10 years. I can wear it day and night and never have to take it off or do anything for it.<p>I have a collection of other watches including Apple watches and Swiss mechanical watches. None of them are as practical and hassle-free as this watch.')
