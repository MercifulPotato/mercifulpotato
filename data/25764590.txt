Merely by exposing your project to be acquirable by end users, you have invited criticism. And if you go further and promote the project, give talks about it, recommend it, seek sponsorship, seek contributors, then you’ve invited criticism even more so.<p>Of course you can ignore that criticism - that was never in doubt. But users are fully justified to make the criticism and it would be rude and wildly unreasonable to reply by saying, “if you don’t like it, leave.”')
