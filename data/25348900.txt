There&#x27;s an obvious need for a 1:1 RHEL clone, and due to the license of all software that RHEL builds on, there&#x27;s no way IBM or Red Hat can stop people from actually building their own &quot;new CentOS&quot; and many companies and communities have done so in the past.<p>All we have now is Red Hat taking the CentOS branding and running with it. And even that point I don&#x27;t get - they could have done this with plain RHEL or Fedora branding too.<p>I get why Red Hat or IBM doesn&#x27;t like CentOS&#x27; existence, but I am fully expecting this won&#x27;t kill &quot;CentOS the concept&quot;.
