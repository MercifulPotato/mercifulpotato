We considered that the time limits placed on Facebook ads were of a sufficient length that the advertiser was able to feature content that was reflective of the overall games. Because the ads were not representative of the games they were purported to feature, we concluded that they were misleading.<p>IMO ASA have got their work cut out for them if they&#x27;re going to regulate ads for games in app-stores.')
