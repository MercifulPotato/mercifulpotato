If this wasn&#x27;t &quot;Mario&quot; it wouldn&#x27;t likely get attention which arguably means all the attention is piggybacking off if Nintendo&#x27;s famous ip and not anything having to do with putting it in VIM. If making a platformer in VIM was the interesting part then it should be interested with or without Mario.<p>I see this same or similar issues with almost all copied IP. The author could have and arguably should have made something original. I find it so sad to see a fan spend 10,50,100,1000 hours making something with IP that doesn&#x27;t belong to them so it can be taken away&#x2F;banned&#x2F;taken down when instead they could have made their own characters and it would be 100% theirs. It just seems like such a waste and a tragedy. The only exception would be if the work was a commentary or parody of the original IP but 99% of the time that&#x27;s not the case.')
