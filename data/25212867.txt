The regex is mostly hard to read because they formatted it poorly and put in a bunch of unnecessary non-capturing groups. I find this to be just as easy (if not easier) to read as their first example:<p><pre><code>    String pattern = (\n        &quot;(\\d+)\\t&quot;+\n        &quot;(\\d+)\\t&quot;+\n        &quot;([0-1])\\t&quot;+\n        &quot;(http:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost:20\\d{3})\\t&quot;+\n        &quot;([0-1])\\t&quot;+\n        &quot;(\\d+)\\t&quot;+\n        &quot;([0-1])\\t&quot;+\n        &quot;(\\d+)\\t&quot;+\n        &quot;(\\d+)\\t&quot;+\n        &quot;([0-1])\\t&quot;+\n        &quot;(\\d+)\\t&quot;+\n        &quot;(STR[0-2])&quot;\n     );\n</code></pre>\nAnd this is just as easy to read as their second example:<p><pre><code>    String num = &quot;(\\d+)\\t&quot;;\n    String bool = &quot;([0-1])\\t&quot;;\n    String url = &quot;(http:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost:20\\d{3})\\t&quot;;\n    String str = &quot;(STR[0-2])&quot;;\n    String pattern = num+num+bool+url+bool+num+bool+num+num+bool+num+str;\n</code></pre>\nAnd yes, I do frequently split up my regexes like that to make them more readable.<p>The only improvement I see is that you don&#x27;t have messy escaping in the url. That is genuinely nice. It motivates me to start using an regEsc() function instead of doing it by hand. However, I find &quot;capt().endCapture()&quot;, and other verboseness to be a step backwards.<p>Edit: Actually, from what I can tell, all the escaping was unnecessary in this case as well. Updated examples without unneeded escape characters.')
