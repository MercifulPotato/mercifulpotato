If you still get crashes in that type of scenario something&#x27;s very broken.<p>I can look into this, too. And I&#x27;ll provide virt-viewer logs but they haven&#x27;t been helpful. I&#x27;ll see what the other virt-related logs are saying.<p>&gt; It I were serious about fixing this my first step would be building everything from source, one component at a time, verifying the issue is still present at each step; then, if everything&#x27;s still crashing, pulling out good ol&#x27; printf<p>This was the advice given to me before from someone involved in the virt stack, and I started to do this but it turned into a lot of work just familiarizing myself with some things and I got sidetracked and eventually shelved it and just hoped it would eventually piss someone else off enough.')
