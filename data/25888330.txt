This model has very accurate predictions for the experimental results. And all the models that we have tried that assume that electrons are distinguishable make some predictions that are wrong, so we have to send them to the trash can.)<p>(And there are some extensions that are useful for high energy experiments, but in these extensions the electrons are even more indistinguishable.)<p>The main discussion here is that in spite the nuclei of Sodium and Chloride are also undistinguishable quantum objects, I say that in these conditions the can be perfectly approximated as distinguishable and with a classic movement.<p>This is a good approximation, except in some specific weird experiments that measure the diffraction pattern when a crystal is used as a mirror for a beam of neutrons or helium or even bigger atoms.')
