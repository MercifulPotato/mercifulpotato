Don&#x27;t mess up. Don&#x27;t loose. You&#x27;ll be fine.<p>Get too good at finance, and start taking business away from the right people, no matter what you do you&#x27;ll get it and get it bad. They&#x27;ll let you know. Then it&#x27;s time to walk away.<p>Whatever you do, don&#x27;t tell power:<p>&quot;I&#x27;m going to report you to the SEC !!!&quot;<p>They go: &quot;... ... ??? ... ok ...&quot; and at your big SEC meeting, they walk out and turns out, they&#x27;re the SEC.<p>Do you want to deal with African warlords or Jihadists or marxists or the drug cartel or power mad international corporations loyal to no one but themselves? Then back off. Power doesn&#x27;t want the next great idea, or talk, or the superstar worker. It&#x27;s all too small. They want things already built given to their efforts and you either helping or getting the hell out of the way.')
