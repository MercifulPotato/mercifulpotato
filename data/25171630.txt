It’s an HR metaphor used to describe the skills of candidates. So if you think of your skills as plotted on a graph, you’ll notice you’ve got different levels in each. And if you unite those levels, you’d want them to create a T-shape instead of anything else.<p>I&#x27;ve always been a fan of &#x27;pi&#x27; shaped skillset where you&#x27;re deep in 2-ish+ areas rather than one core skill. It also means that you don&#x27;t become known for just one singular thing. This becomes even better when the your deep areas complement each other and you&#x27;ll find the sum greater than the parts.')
