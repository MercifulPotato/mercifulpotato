The fourth amendment gives people the absolute right against &quot;unreasonable search and seizure&quot;. This means the police may be granted access to <i>search</i> someone&#x27;s property by a judge, if they are suspected of a crime. It does not give the government the right to find anything, only to search. Furthermore, the fifth amendment grants people the <i>absolute</i> right to not incriminate themselves. So if you know something (information about where the bodies are buried, passwords for decryption of encryption keys, etc.), you have the <i>absolute</i> right to not divulge that knowledge. So the people here have more rights than the government when a crime is being investigated.')
