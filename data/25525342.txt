Got rid of a ton of wires and the ugly hub on my desk. I no longer deal with random glitches that require restarting my computer to fix. It&#x27;s just one seamless screen that makes my desk look clean and uncluttered. With one cable it charges my laptop while docked, provides audio and video, and carries USB signal from any USB devices plugged into the monitor (just a dongle for my keyboard&#x2F;mouse). I&#x27;m in love with it.')
