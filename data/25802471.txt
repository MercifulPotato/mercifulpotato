There are certainly many MOOC courses I would struggle with. But, discussion boards are mostly a tire fire (in part, because of the M part as you suggest), problem sets&#x2F;assignments are limited even if they&#x27;re not behind a paywall, there are no recitation sessions, etc. So even if someone is motivated, which can be hard in the absence of meaningful certifications, they&#x27;re just more limited than taking an actual university course.')
