I want to have a family but the majority of gay men never have a long term partner and the ones that do hardly ever have children because the process is so difficult and expensive. Ideally, I&#x27;ll be able to find a woman who is willing to co-parent with me without any expectation of romance or sexual attraction. It&#x27;s nice to see that this kind of thing might be normalized some day.')
