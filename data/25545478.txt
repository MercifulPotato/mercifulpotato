Just like our non-technology laws are not equivalent to ethics. Laws exist for many reasons, and change over time as societies ideals and requirements change.<p>For example, just because we have laws against burglary, it doesn&#x27;t mean that you can leave your door unlocked. Being &quot;compliant&quot; in no way means you are being secure. This is highly dangerous thinking that many many many organizations are guilty of.<p>As for the regulators, yes, they care about you being compliant not secure. Just like lawyers care about things being legal, not &quot;right.&quot; It&#x27;s their job to make sure you comply with the law, it&#x27;s not their job to make sure the law is correct, or that you are doing things in your best interest outside of what the laws say.<p>Also, just like every law, security compliance regulations do become outdated, in some cases even being actively harmful. For instance, look at how password compliance has been overhauled in the last several years. Previous to this, many people knew based on technical data and research that old password compliance rules were not best practice, or even outright harmful. The auditors didn&#x27;t care, it wasn&#x27;t their job to evaluate whether the existing compliance rules were right. Eventually standards bodies caught up, but even today you have some compliance people who won&#x27;t let go of the old ways.<p>So in my opinion, the author has a very good and correct point, compliance <i>isn&#x27;t</i> about being secure. It&#x27;s necessary to have, like many of our laws and regulations, but it&#x27;s not the same as security. We should strive that our laws always match outcomes and current understanding of best practices, but there is never a 1:1 equivalence.')
