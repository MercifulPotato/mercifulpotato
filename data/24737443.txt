I know I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised at this point, but Apple using their power as the distributor of Telegram&#x27;s app to censor <i>legal</i> user-generated content on the platform is just outrageous.<p>Add this incident to the rapidly growing body of evidence proving every privacy advocate&#x27;s arguments against centralized systems. Some time soon I hope the tech community finds its way back to federated&#x2F;p2p modes of distribution and communication so we can make this kind of censorship -- and the companies which enforce it -- a thing of the past.')
