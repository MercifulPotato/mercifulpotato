Some of the best issues on GitHub are closed issues where people have come in months or years after the fact and left useful additional information.<p>Locking an issue leads to tons of duplication, annoying UX, and an overall hostile experience. In the 10,000+ issues I&#x27;ve managed on my own repos over the years, I&#x27;ve locked a grand total of ONE issues and that was just due to some borderline harassment (though unintended) that was going on long after useful discourse was over.')
