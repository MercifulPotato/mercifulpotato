You may have a bug which you could fix in say 2 hours but refactoring the code as a whole take 5 days. Is it always the &quot;grownup&quot; way to tell the customer that they can&#x27;t use the system the next 3 days? I think it sometimes makes more sense to fix the code as is and then schedule a refactoring.')
