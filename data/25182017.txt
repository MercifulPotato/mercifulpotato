There&#x27;s nothing in Terraform that couldn&#x27;t just be YAML with some semantics (like Ansible which I find much more approachable), and while a custom language can absolutely do better than that, it really needs to justify itself, and I&#x27;m not sure Terraform does yet.<p>There&#x27;s some hints of why it should be a custom language, but I honestly think it needs an overhaul focusing on consistency and clarity. These things really make a difference, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s one of the main reasons Go took off in such a big way for example.')
