I yearn desperately and dearly for google fiber (or a similarly interests-aligned ISP) to come to my new city.<p>Unfortunately I moved out of a city metro area and am now in a smaller town that acts like a suburb of the major city I live near (~20-30 mins from the center of downtown). So my hopes for having google pay attention to us is ~0, at least over the next decade or two.<p>Spectrum offers 940mbps down &#x2F; 40 up and it&#x27;s... fine. I watch my bill like a hawk because of the history of all these actors and I really wish I had more upload bandwidth (for linux iso torrents - and I&#x27;m actually not being euphemistic here. I host a lot of stuff locally that I wish had a bigger upload pipe - passion project stuff in addition to seeding linux-related content.)')
