The bottom 4 subdivisions look identical.  Like level 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00 are all the same brightness, only 1.25+ starts to get brighter.<p>The lowest level is still too bright at night.  That&#x27;s unfortunate.<p>However it <i>does</i> reduce the dimmest level of the keyboard illumination!<p>That&#x27;s great.  I always found the keyboard too bright at its lowest level at night, but some illumination at night would be helpful for obvious reasons.  Now I can enjoy 3 subdivisions lower - thank you :-)')
