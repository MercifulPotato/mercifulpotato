From the below project you can probably tell why;<p>I’ve recently dropped out of school and have been working on making the government acquisition process better.<p>There is a mountain of regulation, registrations and little tid bits required and takes an inordinatant amount of time to learn how to properly do business with the federal government vs. the commercial market. I was a contracting specialist for the Air Force for an enlistment and did a year and a half &#x27;Internship&#x27; on the Supply Chain, CapEx team at Tesla. The differences in acquisition strategies and time it takes to get shit done are palpable. My link is below [0] but the website and content doesn&#x27;t tell the story at all.<p>I faced a problem, How do you go about fixing the Government acquisition system? What I’ve come up with is that the problem is unsolvable. You can’t fix the mountain of regulation but you can automate it. I’m a two man shop but looking at the linkedin pages of my competitors it seems like there isn’t a programmer among them outside of web dev&#x27;s. Paul graham once told me that that&#x27;s a competitive advantage. (I think he was discussing lisp but I digress) However, to be fair I have zero background in programming at first look of my linkedin but I’ve been coding since I was young and is a reason why I thrived at Tesla on an inherently business and engineering team.<p>GSAContractpros.com (Just launched the site on Monday, would love any feedback)')
