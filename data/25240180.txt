This is a growing trend that people who are in those generations are starting to believe we need MORE suppression of speech. MORE suppression of ideas THEY deem dangerous to the state. The number of people who really believe and promote privacy is shrinking. The amount of people who feel this is normal is outpacing those trying to fight for their privacy.<p>The old analogy of the frog in the boiling water is apt here. So many kids have grown up not expecting privacy so why care now? To them it doesn&#x27;t matter. To other&#x27;s its already too late.')
