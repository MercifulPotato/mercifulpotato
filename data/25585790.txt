The current incentives are poorly designed to properly incentivize switchover<p>8) VW appears to be the only credible competitor at scale, and they still lack vertically integrated battery supply.<p>The Bear:<p>1) solid state battery breakthroughs could undermine their supremacy<p>2) titanic valuation isn&#x27;t sustainable in medium term, may cause financial volatility<p>3) Supercharger advantage (a major major advantage in purchase decisions) will steadily dwindle<p>4) Grid storage probably will find a cheaper &#x2F; better tech that lithium ion<p>5) Solar is unpredictable<p>6) chinese car makers may undercut worldwide &#x2F; europe<p>7) quality concerns&#x2F;reputation')
