Item(by='teekert', descendants=None, kids=[25185385, 25185240], score=None, time=1606126102, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25184763, text='Love HA, my Sonoff basic (Tasmote reflashed) controls the fan on the toilet, based on a Philips Hue motion sensor. I have bought Sonoff ZigBee temp&#x2F;hum sensors to automate fan switching in the bathroom based on humidity. The fan will be controlled using a TP link smart wifi plug, which I have lying around. It&#x27;s all no problem and I see everything nicely grouped per space, completely unaware of underlying manufacturer, because of HA.<p>Also, HA presents the status of my Samsung&#x2F;HP crappy printer Toner, without any configuration! Try finding that value in any of the 3 or 4 Samsung&#x2F;HP applications I now run to interact with the printer.<p>Moreover, HA on my Pi4 makes installing and using stuff like AdGuard a breeze. It&#x27;s my fav project (together with NextCloud).')
