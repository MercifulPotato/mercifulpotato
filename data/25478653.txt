The algorithm was said to have prioritized those health care workers at highest risk for COVID infections, along with factors like age and the location or unit where they work in the hospital. Residents apparently did not have an assigned location, and along with their typically young age, they were dropped low on the priority list.<p>So, basically, whoever coded up the algorithm for personal COVID-risk forgot to take care of null-states for the location input.<p>So much for all the outrage over selfish intent.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s possible that the admins purposefully created this glitch so as to have a reasonable fallback story in the case they got caught, but per Occam&#x27;s Razor, I think it&#x27;s much more likely it was a dumb, honest mistake.')
