There is no such thing. Indo-european languages vary widely. Just because these languages shares a few primitive words doesn&#x27;t mean it is easy for an english speaker to learn spanish or german or russian.<p>&gt; The grammar is logical, there are a few exceptions per case, it&#x27;s just very different from Indo-European languages.<p>There is no such thing as an indo-european grammar. Once again, you are making things up.<p>&gt; a good party trick.<p>If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re after, take a few minutes and pick up a card trick, rather than wasting years learning swedish.<p>Is swedish really that obscure?
