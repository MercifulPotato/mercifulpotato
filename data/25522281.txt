Perhaps take an online African-American Studies course and go from there?<p>Just from what I&#x27;ve read, I&#x27;d again recommend Loewen&#x27;s Sundown Towns. He covers the post-Reconstruction past in the early chapters; latter chapters bring it to the present day. The combination of historical data with historical testimony was very convincing to me. The Atlantic has had a number of good articles on this over the last decade. E.g.: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?channel=fs&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;q=atlantic+redlining" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.google.com&#x2F;search?channel=fs&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;q=atl...</a><p>There&#x27;s a lot in the employment world. A study that was really eye-opening for me was this one: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nber.org&#x2F;papers&#x2F;w9873" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nber.org&#x2F;papers&#x2F;w9873</a><p>I also found some manager-focused classes on implicit bias very helpful in seeing how subtle the problem gets. An online course might help you as well. And the Project Implicit tests from Harvard helped me see some of my own implicit biases, which were notably different than my conscious beliefs.<p>And lastly, I strongly recommend breaking one&#x27;s personal filter bubble: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@bjmay&#x2F;how-26-tweets-broke-my-filter-bubble-88c1527517f3" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@bjmay&#x2F;how-26-tweets-broke-my-filter-bubb...</a><p>That was especially valuable for me in turning academic knowledge of the past into conviction about the present. When I listen to the daily lived experience of other people, it eventually became obvious to me that the same forces were at work. Racism has been diminished, and most racists know they can&#x27;t speak openly [1]. But the problems have never gone away. As Faulkner said, &quot;The past is never dead. It&#x27;s not even past.&quot;<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Southern_strategy#Evolution_(1970s_and_1980s)" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Southern_strategy#Evolution_(1...</a>')
