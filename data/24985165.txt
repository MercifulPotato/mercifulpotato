The plan was to have America be the first fiber optic country -- and each phone company went to their state commissions and legislatures and got tax breaks and rate increases to fund these &#x27;utility&#x27; network upgrades that were supposed to replace the existing copper wires with fiber optics -- starting in 1992. And it was all a con. As a former senior telecom analyst (and the telcos my clients) i realized that they had submitted fraudulent cost models, and fabricated the deployment plans. The first book, 1998, laid out some of the history &quot;The Unauthorized Bio&quot; with foreword by Dr. Bob Metcalfe (co-inventor of Ethernet networking). I then released &quot;$200 Billion Broadband Scandal&quot; in 2005, which gave the details as by then more than 1&#x2F;2 of America should have been completed -- but wasn&#x27;t. And the mergers to make the companies larger were also supposed to bring broadband-- but didn&#x27;t. I updated the book in 2015 &quot;The Book of Broken Promises $400 Billion broadband Scandal and Free the Net&quot;, but realized that there were other scams along side this -- like manipulating the accounting.&quot;')
