Item(by='nicoburns', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610360904, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25726666, text='&gt; How can you do maths if you can&#x27;t multiply single-digit numbers? Doesn&#x27;t knowing long multiplication help with learning algebra?<p>I eventually learnt my times tables, but I was always able to multiply in my head quick enough that I didn&#x27;t really need to. In any case I think the issue is taken with an over-focus on this. The OP is not suggesting that times tables shouldn&#x27;t be taught at all.')
