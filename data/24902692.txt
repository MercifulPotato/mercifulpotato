Someone who is gay can just as easily be a fiscal conservative (for example) as someone who is straight.<p>But what I can&#x27;t understand is how someone -- even if they agree with most of their chosen party&#x27;s platform -- could vote for a party whose leadership largely wants to erase them.  I just don&#x27;t understand someone who is gay voting for people who believe that their sexual orientation is a &quot;choice&quot;, many also believing that it&#x27;s a &quot;sin&quot; that should be forcibly &quot;re-educated&quot; out.<p>Certainly calling them &quot;nuts&quot; is dismissive, disrespectful, and doesn&#x27;t help us understand what&#x27;s going on, but... really, I do not at all understand what&#x27;s going on.')
