So do thousands of other physicists.<p>We don&#x27;t all understand it in the same way.  The atomic scale is removed from the human scale by an order of magnitude of orders of magnitude, they do things differently there, so humans can&#x27;t appeal to their experience to say that one self-consistent description of atomic phenomena is real and another isn&#x27;t.  But the way I understand quantum mechanics is self-consistent, so is the way any the next physicist understands it, and we&#x27;ll all agree what result it predicts for any experiment you can imagine.  If you want more than that, science can&#x27;t help you.')
