The biggest that comes to mind is project manager, but I&#x27;m curous if there are other roles like that that pay better than an IC role at an average corporation and what you need (education, skills, something else?) to break into them. I&#x27;m about convinced I wont be able to drive my career as an IC in a direction I want in any useful amount of time and have begun wondering if I should judt suck it up and try to move into a decent paying business roles after <i>X</i> more years of my current job. I probably have a good amount of time before I make any transition like that, however. I dont have any formal education though, so I&#x27;m worried about my limits here.')
