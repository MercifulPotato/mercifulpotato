That represents a possible upper bound on IFR based on data so far. Even in a worst case scenario it is impossible for 100% of Americans to be infected. Your simplistic estimate is missing critical variables.<p>I never claimed that any number of deaths is &quot;okay&quot; so stop arguing in bad faith and putting words in my mouth. Panicking is irrational and never helpful. We need rational, science-based policies now more than ever.<p>Certainly we should save as many lives as possible, but we can&#x27;t get tunnel vision and focus on COVID-19 to the exclusion of all else. The lockdowns also kill people. They die slowly from lack of medical care, depression, substance abuse, and suicide but in the end they&#x27;re dead all the same. It&#x27;s like trying to run a business by focusing entirely on revenue and ignoring costs.')
