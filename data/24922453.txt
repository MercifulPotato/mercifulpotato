Sure, the executive branch <i>has</i> ordered killings, but the branch is so large, lumping it all together makes no sense. The NSA, FCC, FTC, EPA, etc. don’t kill.<p>Now, you should resist, yes, but <i>most people don’t.</i> It takes a <i>very</i> brave soul to resist and hope the Supreme Court will side with you. Civil disobedience generally also requires vast public support who would rally behind you. Practically everyone knows Rosa Parks, but polls have shown only about 60% of Americans have even <i>heard</i> of Snowden. Public support is a fraction of that.<p>Cisco’s executives would also end up being involved in some <i>massive</i> lawsuits if they shut down the company to take a stand. Lavabit, OTOH, was <i>multiple</i> orders of magnitude smaller than Cisco is, and they could afford the backlash. It also didn’t help that Lavabit catered to tech people who would understand why they shut down. Cisco, OTOH, is used by virtually every large business; many of the employees of which would not understand <i>why</i> they shut down.')
