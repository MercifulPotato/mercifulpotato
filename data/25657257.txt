The problem is that we as a society has accepted EULAs, the first time a private customer encountered this, there should have been a backlash strong enough that no-one ever dared try it again. If a legally binding agreement is required, we should expect a formal meeting with the parties involved, lawyers from both sides discussing and clarifying the terms in the contract, before solemnly signing it. For all cases where this is overkill, it&#x27;s overkill, and so is any EULA.')
