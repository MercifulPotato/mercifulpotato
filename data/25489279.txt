More attractive people, taller men etc. get hired, promoted and trusted more. Not just in porn, not just in regular modeling or acting or singing, but also in any job. They get better options in the dating market.<p>Genetically more intelligent people have higher chances at high earning jobs.<p>The pattern on cashing on genetics is extremely widespread and it&#x27;s also not entirely clear it can be abolished without screwing up society. We do need the right people for the right jobs. You don&#x27;t want to watch ugly people&#x27;s porn (except if that&#x27;s your thing, no kink shaming implied!), or marry stupid people etc. etc. You may try to console yourself that individual hard work can override all that, and it can to a degree, but we like to kindle ourselves in the fairytale of the &quot;just world fallacy&quot;. Reality is harsher.')
