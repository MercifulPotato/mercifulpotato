What an awful situation to find yourself in. With the law enforcement demanding an exchange. You have to gamble one way or the other. Either you report the bribery attempt to the DA&#x27;s office, and suffer the retaliation that ensues from snitching on the DA&#x27;s friends; or you go along with the bribe and suffer the prosecution from the DA.<p>How do you know which one to choose? Are you sure the DA will side with you if you blow the whistle? Will you or your employer suffer retaliation from the county law enforcement you just outed? Maybe you&#x27;re blacklisted from future security gigs by being known as someone who rats on cops.<p>Whenever government officials solicit bribes from private citizens, the enormous power asymmetry there should lead us to prosecuting just the government official(s).<p>Of course it&#x27;s not always this simple. Sometimes the private citizen wields more power than the civil servant they&#x27;re bribing. In other words, the Mafia or other organized crime. But I&#x27;m not ready to put Apple in that column yet.')
