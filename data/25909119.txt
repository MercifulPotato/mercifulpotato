Why would they care about money?<p>Yes of course you can tell the tale how it&#x27;s not ever enough, how money equals power and people want power, but I don&#x27;t really buy that. These are highly intelligent and creative individuals. They probably also know that power is responsibility and have enough of that.<p>Additional millions&#x2F;billions have zero impact on their life and I really doubt many of them playing a game between themselves about who has the biggest number. Popular media probably care more about that.<p>If you want to scream at the rich, I think you won&#x27;t find names of those most interesting in any rankings and not much in tech. They have they patents, oil wells, gov contracts,  connections, HFTs and wealth well hidden from the public eye.<p>Most of companies you list offered something that people wanted and that&#x27;s why they got a lot of money*. That&#x27;s how the money is supposed to work. Compare it to trading companies that got money from banks which got money from Fed which was created out of thin air. Those at the top of banks and big funds effectively get money from everyone else, without providing them any value, without their consent. Even innocent real estate investment seem to involve more evil and greed than making a and running a huge company without pretty much any realistic vacation.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that your point is completely without merit, there is a lot of greed especially in the startup world. I just think that&#x27;s a huge oversimplification.<p>* more realistically they won at something new that was growing fast')
