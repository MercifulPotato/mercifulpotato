My mother in turn beat the sh</i>t out of me &amp; my siblings.\nI had trouble in elementary school. Had to repeat classes, graduated from high school late in life.\nWorked mostly in temporary low-paying jobs, then went to school for 3 years doing basically nothing. Dropped out, then worked again somewhere, then went to school again pursuing a computer science degree (60% complete).<p>My life is just a big f*cking maze (too many trial and errors, esp. unnecessary ones: &quot;doing the same thing over and over, and expecting different results&quot;-kind of mistakes).<p>Now in my early 30s going to school with Gen-Z (feeling as the only Yoomer stuck in there), still having financial troubles (hard for me to make ends meet), wondering if this grind will ever come to a halt?\nEspecially when 3 decades have passed, and you never really worked in a &quot;real job&quot; being &quot;socially awkward&quot; and lonely for most of your life.<p>How can I make up for my lost years? I can&#x27;t this is the realization. Time can&#x27;t be brought back. So this is out of the equation. All I can do now, is look into typical recommendations&#x2F;life advice&#x2F;studies&#x2F;findings and optimize as much as I am comfortable with:<p>- water fasting (mostly following Valter Longo)\n- cold showers (b&#x2F;c it helps against depression and ease my Reynolds syndrome)\n- socializing (not easy for me, but I must try it at least b&#x2F;c: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.harvard.edu&#x2F;gazette&#x2F;story&#x2F;2017&#x2F;04&#x2F;over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life&#x2F;)\n- omega-3 and other supplements (good for easing depression caused by trauma&#x2F;loneliness)<p>I am no expert, I don&#x27;t understand these studies fully, but they at least give me some sense of direction to &quot;steer&quot; my remaining life out of this misery. (At least I hope so.)<p>1 year until I prospectively graduate. Let&#x27;s see how this life of mine unfolds.')
