I live in an apartment with masonry walls and floors, and I basically cannot hear anything from my neighbours. The most I hear is tap tap tap when someone above is walking with heels on.<p>Now if you have any ideas for noise outside I&#x27;m open :-) A hipster bar opened opposite last year (when we moved in there was a commercial unit that had been empty for a few years, turns out it was a restaurant with alcohol license before), and we regularly have drunk people speaking loudly&#x2F;shouting outside in the evenings from Thursday - Saturday. We can obviously close the window (triple glazed), but it&#x27;s nice to have a breeze coming in.')
