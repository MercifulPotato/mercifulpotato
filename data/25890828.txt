I don&#x27;t know why there&#x27;s no BM25 (or at least SOME TF-IDF implementation) in Postgres FTS, but if you decide you need it (and more languages support and highlighting and lower response time) ping us at contact@manticoresearch.com and we&#x27;ll help you with integrating your postgres dataset with Manticore Search. 60M docs shouldn&#x27;t be a problem at all (should take about an hour to make an index) and you&#x27;ll get proper ranking and nice highlighting with just few lines of new code.
