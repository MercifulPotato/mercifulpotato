Waymo says that perception is the easy part and most of the work is elsewhere. So in the absolute worst case scenario, they would have to develop the perception part from scratch. At Tesla, this took 2 years.<p>BTW, all companies that can, use lidars. Even MobileEye says that their L4 system will use lidars and they&#x27;ve been working on a camera based system for 2 decades. Tesla doesn&#x27;t use lidars because they can&#x27;t.')
