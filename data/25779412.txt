Beyond that, I can easily think of a few reasons...<p>First, this doesn&#x27;t affect the parts of the car necessary to actually drive it. (Remember, the dashboard on the Model S is a separate component.) The actual &quot;car&quot; part of the car still works just fine, and you can even reboot this part while driving without causing problems.<p>Second, most people who actually own these cars tend to be somewhat protective of the company&#x27;s image. Therefore, while you&#x27;ll see plenty of ranting on Tesla-specific forums, it rarely leaks out into the greater conversation.<p>Third, and most importantly, all of the reporters who write articles covering Tesla are doing so from the perspective of an outsider looking in. They jump all over the great features and new easter eggs, but are completely and utterly oblivious to all the &quot;quality of life&quot; issues you&#x27;ll only ever notice if you actually own the damn car and drive it every day.')
