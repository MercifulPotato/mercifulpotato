I&#x27;ve switched phones a few times over the years and just got a new number rather than keeping my old one and i got locked out of my accounts because i didn&#x27;t have access to the old number anymore. Stuff like Authy and Google Authenticator exist, I think it&#x27;s time companies started using them.')
