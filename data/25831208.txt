Item(by='input_sh', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611045368, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25827479, text='&gt;  How would you go about storing notes from a book&#x2F;course so that they fit in this system?<p>Overall, they don&#x27;t. Zettelkasten is just one of the folders within my note-taking app (Obsidian), and notes from books go into a separate folder. If there are some titbits that I see being useful outside of the book, I duplicate it into a zettelkasten note.<p>&gt; Group them together somehow?<p>I have an &quot;also see&quot; section in my template where I link every other short note that&#x27;s somehow connected. That&#x27;s what I meant by &quot;linking them as much as possible&quot;. The end goal is to be able to follow the links between similar notes instead of having to search for them. My library isn&#x27;t big enough at the moment, but once it becomes, I should be able to click on a random note, follow a few links, and have an entire article with sources to back it up with little to no effort, using thoughts I had months or years ago.<p>&gt; Have an &quot;index&quot; note with just hyperlinks to the rest?<p>Yeah I also do this. I have a note titled &quot;00 zk&quot; that&#x27;s an index note for all the zettelkasten notes. I don&#x27;t fill it out automatically at the moment, but I have a plugin that can do &quot;link all notes within this folder&quot;, and I trigger it with a hotkey from time to time. That index note helps me to see similar notes and interlink them, because I never view that folder with a file explorer.')
