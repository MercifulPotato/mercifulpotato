(At least twice?)  The first time AWS emailed me within an hour.  The second time about 20,000 French language spam emails were sent out and I only realized the issue when AWS suspended the credentials because of the bounce rate on the emails.  Thankfully only ended up costing me a couple of bucks, but scared the hell out of me.')
