When I say politics here I&#x27;m talking about USA cantered partisan politics.<p>HN is a great place for tech discussion AND it&#x27;s also an opportunity to talk directly to founders, or important people and technologists in IT, in a better format than Twitter. I&#x27;d like for HN to stay in that niche.')
