Couldn&#x27;t boot, startup repair did nothing, and then the worst thing occurred was no restore points were available. Even if system restore is ON it will periodically remove&#x2F;clean them up which I never knew. Since reading about this issue I was trying to recall my steps of recovery frustration, but I think ended from the startup repair opening up the command prompt and issuing a chkdsk and rebooting a few times initiating  automatic repair and finally came back to life.')
