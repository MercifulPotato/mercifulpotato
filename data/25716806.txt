As far as I know, multiple competing&#x2F;overlapping XEPs were not an uncommon situation.<p>Compared to this, the Matrix standard(s) have thus far been able to maintain a certain kind of coherence (IMO), allowing for at least a vision of what a complete implementation of a server or client should look like. The standard is versioned so that you can aim for support of a particular version instead of a pick-and-choose subset of functionality. Also, part of the Matrix&#x27;s coherence story probably lies in the fact that there is an &quot;official&quot; set of clients in the form of the Element clients.<p>Ultimately, you cannot prevent others from writing incomplete servers or clients. But you can show what the goal looks like and have other implementations approach it asymptotically.')
