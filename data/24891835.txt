The traditional PC was computing for the elite&#x2F; computer experts.<p>This romanticism of 80s computing as the golden age completely mystifies me. The 80s&#x2F; 90s were a phenomenally fun  time for geeks like me&#x2F; us. For everyone else, a PC was a thing you had to learn a bunch of esoteric bullshit to use.<p>&quot;For the masses&quot;, the iPhone, Android, and the iPad are far more interesting and useful.<p>Even if you look at more specific <i>PC</i> style computing, most people don&#x27;t care about whether their bios is locked or not.')
