Say there is a Label that should show some text and a crazy designer asks me to have the text rotating and jumping and also be super light gray and ahrd to read, the component could still report back to accessibility framework the actual text and you could have a better experience then a regular user.<p>Custom rendering is not most of the time painting on a canvas. A simple example , you have a Dropdown,  each item is rendered with a simple component that is something like<p>&lt;text&gt;item.text&lt;&#x2F;text&gt;<p>and you might want to change the render function to be<p>&lt;icon&gt;item.icon&lt;&#x2F;icon&gt;&lt;text&gt;item.text&lt;&#x2F;text&gt;<p>I think ATM you still can&#x27;t use the HTML select to have a dropdown with the countries and the flags or a dropdown with the fonts  and each font it is painted with it&#x27;s own font family, or customize the numeric spinner arrows or scroll bars colors.<p>Again , I prefer using native widgets, but I am forced to implement designs and I have to replace a native component with a pile of netsted divs,js and css.')
