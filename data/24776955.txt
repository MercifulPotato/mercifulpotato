We hackers should remember that the stuff we write, be it code, docs, proposals, business plans, security incident postmortems, whatever, needs to be VALUABLE to the readers -- the people -- we intend to reach.  If it isn&#x27;t valuable, they won&#x27;t read or use it. If they don&#x27;t read or use it, we&#x27;ve just wasted a lot of our time, and a little bit of theirs. Ouch.<p>We&#x27;re not trying to show people what WE think about anything. We&#x27;re trying to influence how THEY think.<p>This is tricky with code, because many members of our audience are future developers with less experience than us. Our brilliance is worthless to them. What&#x27;s valuable to them is the ability to modify or built on what we did to solve their problems, problems we didn&#x27;t forsee.<p>Ask: what do our readers &#x2F; users need to know &#x2F; do?  How can we convince them we CAN help them? Only THEN do we get to try to help them.')
