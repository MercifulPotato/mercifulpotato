They&#x27;re about it&#x27;s performance on non-X Xbox One and non-Pro PS4s.  Which aren&#x27;t just last-gen consoles, they&#x27;re the lowest tier of last gen consoles.  I don&#x27;t think CDPR should have released the games on those platforms if they don&#x27;t have their performance scaling right.  I&#x27;m not defending their actions, but I think most people just have their expectations out of whack.<p>CP77 is the first AAA game released in a long time that was built for PC first and ported to consoles, instead of the other way around.  Instead of PCs getting crappy ports hard-limited to 60fps no matter how much GPU you throw at it, and crappy control schemes, the dregs of last-gen consoles got really poor performance and visuals compared to people on PS4 Pros, Xbox One X, and the latest 2020 gen consoles.  It&#x27;s not acceptable, but it&#x27;s also hard to imagine how you could have made people happy when they&#x27;re that far underpowered from a hardware department for a game like CP77.')
