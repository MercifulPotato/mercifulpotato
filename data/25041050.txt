I’m pretty sure the Constitution says so.</i><p>Not exactly. Anything created by the government and it&#x27;s employees is automatically public domain (so, no copyright), but the government can and does get copyrights assigned to it[0] all the time for things created by vendors and contractors (this is negotiated in advance).<p>So, the government can own copyrights, if it acquires them.<p>[0] sometimes the US government just gets a perpetual, worldwide, yadda, yadda license instead. Typically not sublicensable, though. This can be a really sweet deal for the vendor, and really annoying for the public, particularly when it comes to data sets created with public funds.')
