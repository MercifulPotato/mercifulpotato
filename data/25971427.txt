Divorce must be a painful, punishing process if society is to continue to take marriage seriously. (It must nevertheless be possible for either party in the marriage to initiate a divorce to completion. That&#x27;s non-negotiable.)<p>Just my view on this subject. And I accept that others with different experiences than mine may have different views.')
