For instance Appway AG in Zurich (I&#x27;m not related to them).<p>The challenges seem to be always sort of:<p>- You have the business domain modelled in a relational (or document, or graph) database. You bind and synchronize the data between database and form.<p>- You have a rule engine, which uses e.g. RETE-OO, which fires the rules when some object types and some of their object attributes defined in the rule input match changes objects in the form. The rule action changes other fields of the form.<p>- You have a form editor where you can map form fields to entity attributes of the business model. Besides form components (text fields, selects, checkboxes, radio button groups) you can add headings and paragraphs. You can split forms into multiple pages and add (breadcrumb) navigation. You can add summary pages with an overview of the form data.<p>- You have a vanilla UI design for the forms but can customize the forms completely. Starting from custom CSS to different CSS frameworks. Tailwind CSS and Headless UI (unstyled UI components) seem to go into the right direction (not only for fancy write-once web-agency marketing websites, but also enterprise web applications). You want to implement the form fields&#x2F;components and consider labels, error states, disable and hide styles, and accessibility.')
