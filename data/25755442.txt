It’s really hard work, difficult to get right and I need to make more decisions, which is taxing. It also never stops. Still learning and planning to learn as long as I can.<p>There are upsides though: I learn at my own pace, I can dive more deeply into a topic for a while, I can choose topics pragmatically, and I choose how to learn and test.<p>Now this curriculum: I have a different approach. I like watching videos&#x2F;lectures, but more as a supporting tool, when I’m tired. I much prefer books, papers and experimentation. Also I feel like the curriculum is all over the place. I agree with the math part mostly but the rest seems a bit like a hodgepodge.')
