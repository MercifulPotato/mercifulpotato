Most of them are functionally independent, so having them as separate functions makes sense (when we do need to coordinate, that&#x27;s done through Step Functions).<p>Note: I still don&#x27;t think that they are a great fit for production services (and more fits one-off and cron usage patterns)<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.serverless.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.serverless.com&#x2F;</a>')
