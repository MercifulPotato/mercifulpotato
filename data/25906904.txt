We cannot take our dev tier off of the internet because we have to be able to test integrations with third-party systems that send inbound webhooks, etc. Instead, we made sure that access can only be gained with access keys obtained by employees and that features such as impersonation only allow de-escalationâ€”i.e. it only allows lower or equal privilege users to the currently authenticated user. We also removed functionality that allowed viewing emails, in particular account recovery emails.')
