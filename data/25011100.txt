Nowadays, I generally wouldn&#x27;t sell an inkjet printer to my worst enemy (I own a very small one that fits into a suitcase for travel).<p>But I&#x27;m surprised that laser printers have not become victims to that phenomenon nearly to the same degree. Maybe it&#x27;s because I like somewhat pricy ones (Duplex all-in-one color lasers), but apart from undersized &quot;Starter Tones&quot; sets, they seem to offer a reasonable value, and I even own a HP.')
