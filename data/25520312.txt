Run it locally and have it configured to use a public name server as its source (if you run Windows&#x2F;other there are not doubt native options that&#x27;ll work this way too). Even if the network you connect to redirects requests to public DNS resolvers you&#x27;ll still be going through your local filter. Though you&#x27;ll need to set your machine to ignore DNS config via DHCP, and you&#x27;ll have to point it at the local resolvers if the network simply blocks public DNS servers.<p>2. Run it in a VM or container, this would mean you can run PiHole specifically even if you are running Windows, and configure as above. Memory requirements are pretty low so unless you are using very low spec device it should fit.<p>3. If you have a hosted server (you can get a VPS big enough for PiHole for a few $&#x2F;year) or a publicly addressable address at home, you can run a VPN and access it that way (assuming the network you are on does not block your VPN of choice of course). You don&#x27;t have to run a VPN, but I&#x27;d not recommend running a publicly addressable DNS server. This will even work on phones depending on the OS there and the chosen VPN.<p>Of course these are not viable options for a lesser techie user.')
