Letting prisoners attend colleges for free is a remarkably good government investment.<p>The same thing is true about the homeless. Homeless services are expensive. It&#x27;s cheaper to get them apartments, even if you still offer them all of the support services you were offering before.<p>But whenever you propose these things, social conservatives seem to come out of the woodwork and argue that it&#x27;s not fair for prisoners or homeless people to get expensive stuff for free. Why should you get something good for doing a bad thing? Why should the homeless guy get an apartment that you&#x27;d paying $1000 a month for? Why should your taxes be buying drugs for that junkie? Even if you have to spend more taxes by not giving them these things, your sense of justice demands it be so.')
