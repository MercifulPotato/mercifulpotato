It&#x27;s just frustrating to hear people recommend HA to complete home automation noobs with little or no linux experience.<p>Related to that, I keep the HA configs routinely backed up.  I should probably switch to nightly backups because HA now manipulates those config files when setting changes are done through the UI. Every once in a while, I shutdown the system and completely clone the Pi SD Card image to save elsewhere.  I (thankfully) haven&#x27;t had to restore from this in a while, but before switching to a durable SD card, I had to do it with every power failure.<p>Backsups, cloning, industrial cards.  Again, I have no clue how a non-linux user could even begin to use HA.<p>I&#x27;ll checkout the TP-Link switches.  Thank you!')
