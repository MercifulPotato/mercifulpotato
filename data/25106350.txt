They are basically solid state devices. &quot;Losing power&quot; is simply not much of an error state outside of complete battery failure. And if you still want to be safe from motor failures (or from propeller failures), octocopters exist. I share the &quot;multicopters are boring&quot; attitude, but they are boring for a reason.')
