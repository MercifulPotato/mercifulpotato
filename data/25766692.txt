We know next to nothing about dark matter(haven&#x27;t found any yet), also in terms of energy production we have not achieved  - room temperature superconducting and fusion reactors. We can barely get rockets outside of earths orbits, let alone to our closest celestial neighbor the moon. That being said, I think given our current technological shortcomings we are in no position to rule out 100% possibility of life from another world being here.')
