It’s a few cents with online advertising, FB makes billions because there’s a lot of users.<p>You’re also forgetting that such ads are about telling you about products you didn’t even consider you need. So yeah, you’re not going to die out of hunger due to lack of ads, but you may not learn of more luxurious items that you may want.<p>(Disclaimer, I work at FB, not on ads, and don’t know anything an outsider wouldn’t know)')
