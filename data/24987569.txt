For instance, GitLab already provides its own container registry, and thus it makes sense to simply source images from them than from tertiary sources like Docker Hub.<p>Another impact that this has is that I&#x27;m looking into the need to operate a custom container registry for each Kubernetes cluster. It wouldn&#x27;t be nice if an application running on Kubernetes or Docket Swarm risked downtime just because you happened to hit one of Docker Hub&#x27;s rate limits.')
