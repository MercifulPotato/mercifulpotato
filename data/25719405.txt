Item(by='mech422', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610310938, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25718508, text='&gt;&gt;Are licensed cabs not serving those areas because it&#x27;s not profitable, or are they not serving those areas because other areas are more profitable and the licensing regime&#x27;s medallion limits mean the more profitable areas won&#x27;t be saturated with (licensed) taxis.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d vote for &#x27;not profitable&#x27;.  Not every place that lacks decent cab service is limited by medallions.  I&#x27;d personally guess that most places lacking service are small towns and suburbs. In those cases, I don&#x27;t think lack of medallions is an issue.<p>Also, personal anecdata - I take Lyft about 5-10 times a month with the same stops each time.  I have never gotten the same driver twice.  This just makes it feel like a big ponzi scheme to me, with fresh drivers coming in as old drivers wise up and move on...<p>TBF - I use doordash quite a lot also, and have the same experience with &#x27;dashers&#x27; - never the same one twice.')
