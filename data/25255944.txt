It shouldn&#x27;t come as a surprise that a certain tech stack neither works for everybody nor nobody, be it Linux- or Windows-land.<p>&gt; I didn&#x27;t say &quot;Windows always works for me&quot;, but rather that these imagined conversations about issues like these aren&#x27;t a regular fixture among Windows users<p>Might have misread that then.<p>Likewise yes Linux definitely isn&#x27;t a flawless experience compared to OSX or Windows, but I do however think that Windows is getting worse in that regard since a few years now (less internal QA because of telemetry?), there were a few pretty severe issues with updates, while at the same time Linux is making progress. Which brings me back to<p>&gt; It&#x27;s not a joke as much as it&#x27;s just something that is and something that naturally happens in an ecosystem where nothing is made to work with anything else.<p>That is the root cause indeed with Linux, the user space really. It&#x27;s not coordinated by a central authority, so you don&#x27;t get a smooth experience combining arbitrary components in arbitrary versions. This is where distros come into play. They go through the pain to pick a combination of components at a certain version and make them work together with a sledgehammer. If you only ever use the package manager to install software, you will have an experience on par with windows or osx, but it&#x27;s love it or leave it. Need anything that&#x27;s not offered there and you have a good chance of messing things up.<p>Regarding your last point: My bet is on the web, eventually casual users only need a browser, which even linux can manage to offer you without blowing up, but then a Chromebook is probably what people go with.')
