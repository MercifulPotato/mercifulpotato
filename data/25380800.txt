It&#x27;s actually a negative for the VR offering. At best one can say, would another social network have a chance to compete with Facebook on Oculus when the user is already linked via their Facebook account? Probably its harder but quantitatively very hard to prove.<p>In reality the competition concerns are secondary to what is really a consumer rights issue: people are buying a good that can be rendered functionality inoperable at any time in the future by completely unrelated actions pertaining to their Facebook account. This doesn&#x27;t just apply to the headset but possibly hundreds of dollars of apps they have bought.<p>I don&#x27;t know how this gets resolved at the moment when the only regulatory mechanism to enforce it is competition law where the concerns are minor (at least for now).')
