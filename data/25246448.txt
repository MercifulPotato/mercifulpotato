Reading the documentation makes it sound like something akin to an symbolic link but perhaps not in the actual filesystem; I still can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s implemented in the kernel&#x2F;FS or just the shell (or to what extent the two are integrated). If it&#x27;s just the shell then this seems to be a shining example of where the POSIX interface is holding us back. In Linux, they&#x27;ve tried to implement union mounts a number of times (as UnionFS, aufs, and OverlayFS) because it&#x27;s almost too complicated to get right for Unix-style filesystems and you need a bunch of kernel-level code. Do you happen to know if it was possible to create the ASSIGNs programmatically? Does deleting&#x2F;renaming files in the ASSIGN work like you&#x27;d hope?')
