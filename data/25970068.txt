Yes, you can get pretty decent &quot;savings&quot; (vs running in AWS&#x2F;DO) but I can guarantee you, you will end up in the basement replugging ethernet cables trying to figure out which one is the bad one while your family and relatives are waiting upstairs, fairly bemused, for you to fix &quot;the internet&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s possible, but as a person with a life, unless it&#x27;s your passion, I&#x27;d recommend just not. Do the financial equivalent of paying DigitalOcean 5 dollars a month: buy sp500 etfs and sit on them.')
