Item(by='welkie', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607801252, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25379846, text='&gt; Based on this experience, we decided to lower the default value of &quot;max instances&quot; to 100 for future deployments. We believe 100 is a better trade off between allowing customers to scale out and preventing big billing surprises.<p>This is good to hear. I use Cloud Run a lot for personal projects and I always set concurrency to 80, max instances to 1, memory to 128Mi (unless it&#x27;s something beefy that needs the memory), and CPU to 1. If I need to scale it up, or I decide to open it up to actual usage, I&#x27;ll do it when I recognize the need.')
