We are just dealing with<p>f̱( v1 ∧ v2 ∧ ··· ∧ vn ) &#x2F; ( v1 ∧ v2 ∧ ··· ∧ vn ) = d<p>= ( f(v1) ∧ f(v2) ∧ ··· ∧ f(vn) ) &#x2F; ( v1 ∧ v2 ∧ ··· ∧ vn )<p>instead of ( v1 ∧ v2 ∧ ··· ∧ vn ) &#x2F; ( e1 ∧ e2 ∧ ··· ∧ en ) = d<p>And now we are talking about a property of a linear transformation instead of a property of a collection of n vectors.<p>In many practical situations, an oriented quantity like v1 ∧ v2 ∧ ··· ∧ vn is more useful than a scalar ratio d though.')
