Item(by='xpe', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1606241616, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25200678, text='&gt; who is doing manual labor of any kind and having a good time of it<p>I take your point.<p>That said, many (or even most?) people enjoy doing some amount of physical work. However, Taylorism and the industrial revolution tended to make physical work so repetitive that it become unsatisfying.<p>For example, in my experience, UPS drivers often like a job where they get to be outside and active. I don&#x27;t have surveys at hand, but I would guess that skilled laborers like the work itself. Their bosses, sick time, injuries, probably not so much.<p>I would ask everyone to think about future scenarios where work can have more physical aspects  -- there are advantages to long term happiness and productivity that I think get overlooked.')
