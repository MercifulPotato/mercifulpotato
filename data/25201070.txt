They didn&#x27;t even bother to remove the lyrics or change the track. Just played the track. Then he drunkenly stumbled around the stage, incoherently mumbling some of his own rap words against the already mostly incoherent rap lyrics on his own track.<p>Crowd goes wild.<p>I went to a &#x27;Brazil&#x2F;France&#x2F;USA&#x27; rap-fusion thing in Montreal, I was very excited, the track started, the &#x27;hype man&#x27; with &#x27;big hair came out&#x27; and said &#x27;heyo&#x27; , then &#x27;yo yo yo&#x27;, then &#x27;ayeee&#x27; about ever 10-15 seconds, getting the crowd going.<p>But he wasn&#x27;t the hype man - that was the act.<p>That was his &#x27;performance&#x27;. Just saying &#x27;yo yo yo&#x27; a few times now and again over some track. And people paid for that.<p>Modern pop acts are no longer musicians, they are &#x27;creative famous people&#x27;. Music is just one &#x27;angle&#x27; on being famous, it blends in with TikTok&#x2F;YouTube&#x2F;Instagram as one big smear of &#x27;trying to be popular&#x27;.<p>So there&#x27;s a lot of good serious music, but it&#x27;s a side-show like it never was before, so there probably needs to be some conscientious efforts to support it.<p>We spend some money supporting &#x27;Orchestral&#x27; music partly out of a benevolent view, we&#x27;re likely going to have to do the same for &#x27;live music&#x27;.')
