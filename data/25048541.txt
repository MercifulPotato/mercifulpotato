Sure, $800K isn&#x27;t huge money for a fund, but it still seems... odd... to be so nonchalant about it?<p>Then I checked General Catalyst, they manage multiple funds in the $500M - $1B range[1].  In that context the $800K really is a rounding error, around 0.1% of a single fund&#x27;s size.<p>It never ceases to amaze me how money stops being money past a certain amount (which would be life-changing for most people), and just becomes numbers to move around.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crunchbase.com&#x2F;organization&#x2F;general-catalyst-partners&#x2F;investor_financials" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.crunchbase.com&#x2F;organization&#x2F;general-catalyst-par...</a>')
