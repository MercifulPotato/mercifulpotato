Super stressed, and not sure what happened, I clicked around, trying to figure out what was happening. I also started thinking of what may have happened, and how we could “possibly” pay the $5K bill.<p>&gt; The problem was, every minute the bill kept going up.<p>&gt; After 5 minutes, the bill read $15,000, in 20 mins, it said $25,000. I wasn’t sure where it would stop. Perhaps it won’t stop?<p>&gt; After two hours, it settled at a little short of $72,000.<p>&gt; By this time, my team and I were on a call, I was in a state of complete shock and had absolutely no clue about what we would do next. We disabled billing, closed all services.<p>1) Why wouldn&#x27;t you shut off the service as soon as you saw the $5000 bill? Really doesn&#x27;t sound like a &quot;hop on a call with the team for a few hours&quot; kind of decision.<p>2) Why was the person taking a nap the only person who could get a usage limit alert? One of the great benefits of a team is that you can have multiple eyes looking out for problems. Someone could have raised a flag as soon as the first unexpected alert came in.<p>3) If going over the free tier limit was your chief concern, why not check the usage after a quick run before letting it go overnight and unsupervised?<p>That the problem could get this bad is a UX failure, but the problem itself is easily seeable and avoidable.')
