Did she encourage them to commit violence? Did she or any of her close affiliates say to hang other members of government? Did they say there should be trial by combat?<p>She said the protests would not let up, and to &quot;beware&quot;.  It was not an explicit call for violence, but often politicians tread the line and this case was no different.  You may say that she did not actually call for violence, and condemned the violence afterward.  So did Trump.<p>&gt; Did Kamala tell the rioters that they&#x27;re special and she loves them after they stormed a government building with pipe bombs and zip ties?<p>He said that in a message for them to go home.  Do you think that maybe telling people who are motivated to extreme actions (including violence) might be calmed by being told that they are loved?  I think it might have that effect.')
