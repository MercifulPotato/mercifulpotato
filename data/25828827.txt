We&#x27;re talking about a bunch of delusional LARPers. If some foreign intelligence unit tries and fails to overthrow your country&#x27;s government, that&#x27;s insurrection. If it&#x27;s the doofus who stole the podium or the guy with face paint and a horned fur hat, not so much.<p>Note that the factual crimes are already plenty bad--<i>they don&#x27;t need to be exaggerated</i>.<p>&gt; Some members of the mob were actively looking to kill the people who were 2nd and 3rd in line for the presidency<p>There were murderers and arsonists at BLM riots as well; that doesn&#x27;t impugn the legitimate protesters. Similarly, these few <i>actual insurrectionists</i> don&#x27;t make the MAGA trespassers, rioters, <i>even murderers</i> into insurrectionists.<p>&gt;  Let&#x27;s not pretend that there was zero danger to democracy.<p>There <i>is</i> a danger to our democracy in that a sitting president undermining democracy by spreading lies about election fraud. More generally, the media and tech companies are deliberately cultivating division and mistrust among the American people. These are real, credible dangers to democracy. The MAGA LARPers were not a credible threat to our democracy.')
