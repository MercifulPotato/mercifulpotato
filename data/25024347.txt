For instance, I&#x27;m  dismayed at some of the schadenfreude reactions on Twitter by anti-Trump people right now. (In particular the &quot;I love to see Trump supporters cry&quot; meme that really needs to die, as it&#x27;s extremely antagonistic and unhelpful.) However the difference is, on the Republican side, it comes right from the top.  Just read Trump&#x27;s twitter feed: it&#x27;s an endless stream of ad-hominem attacks and lies.  Regular politicians will attack their opponents&#x27; positions, and they&#x27;ll spin or stretch the truth sometimes, but I&#x27;ve never seen another American politician, much less a president, stoop to the level that Trump regularly inhabits in his everyday discourse.  I mean, just listen to Biden&#x27;s victory speech and compare it to Trump&#x27;s.  Or compare their twitter feeds.  To say the Republican party stands for civil discourse... I honestly don&#x27;t know how you could have watched the President for the past four years and come away with that impression.')
