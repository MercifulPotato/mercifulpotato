Item(by='xnx', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610085060, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25678689, text='I live in a pretty large city Chicago and I&#x27;m not concerned about additional traffic from autonomous vehicles (though I don&#x27;t count myself as average either). Widespread usage of autonomous vehicles will have so many large and wide-ranging effects, that it will not simply be &quot;more traffic in cities&quot;. Another possibility is a large portion of city dwellers will get weekend homes hours away since driving that distance will be trivial when you can watch Netflix or play videos games on the way. Tourism may also increase as people from smaller towns will come into the city for nightlife since their cars can drive them home drunk. Even with twice the cars on the road trips may be much faster without cars blocking traffic by making late turns on red. Electric cars are interesting, but super-human autonomous drivers will be revolutionary.')
