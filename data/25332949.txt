The largest burner on it is 20kBTU&#x2F;hr, and the regular size burners are 11kBTU&#x2F;hr.  Converted to Watts, that&#x27;s 5.9 kW and 3.2 kW respectively.  And keep in mind, those figures are per burner, and it&#x27;s common for me to be using at least two of them at once (though not necessarily all at max power).  I think I&#x27;d want a total power allowance of roughly 10 kW just for the stovetop burners, which works out to something like 40 amps at 240V.  And it&#x27;s gonna be more to support the oven, which is part of the same integrated units (the microwave, refrigerator, and countertop outlets for electric kettles, slow cookers, and such will also all need substantial power, but that&#x27;s separate circuits).  Apparently it&#x27;s common these days in new construction to run a dedicated 50 amp 240V  circuit just for the combo stove&#x2F;range.  That&#x27;s something like 10 kW of continuous power @ an 80% safety margin!<p>Anyway, electrical kitchen appliances sure as hell do use a lot of power.  Good thing you&#x27;re not using them most of the day, and that even when you are using them, you&#x27;re often not running them close to full power.  But it does seem possible to achieve as much heating with electrical as with gas, which is nice.  Hell, if you have some induction burners on that stovetop, and I tend to cook in cast iron so pretty much all of my most frequently used pots and pans would already work fine with induction anyway, then you wouldn&#x27;t need anything close to 5.9 kW on the biggest burner to achieve the same heating.  That&#x27;s because one of the downsides of gas is that a lot of heat gets lost to the air, which isn&#x27;t nearly as much of a problem on an electrical range where the cookware is sitting in direct contact with the heating element.  Electrical thus achieves a higher overall heat transfer efficiency for the same power, especially with induction where the cookware itself becomes the heating element.<p>That&#x27;s a bit of a digression but apparently you can achieve high power outputs with electrical stoves, it&#x27;s just that a lot of the electrical stoves a lot of us have experience with are shitty ones from decades past that legitimately did not heat well.')
