Apple has been a hands-off&#x2F;benevolent steward of the podcast ecosystem for the really the entire lifetime of podcasts. If they make a play for &quot;Apple Podcasts+&quot; or similar I worry about the independence&#x2F;distributed future of podcasts.<p>Personally I refuse to listen to podcasts on any &quot;podcast platforms&quot; (Note this is very different from a &quot;podcast network&quot;) because they are all attempting to be &quot;The Netflix of Podcasts&quot; which I have no interest in, I want to use my own podcast player (Overcast).<p>I&#x27;m open to paying for podcasts (I spend about $20-25 or so a month on podcasts currently) but I don&#x27;t like being locked into client (as in I don&#x27;t like &quot;Oh this I listen to on Spotify, this I listen to on Stitcher, etc&quot;).')
