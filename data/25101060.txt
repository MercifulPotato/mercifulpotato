Xenophobic content, for example, is &quot;unchecked&quot; on any U.S. owned platform, so is some racism, but not racism against black people specifically. At the same time in most other countries in the world racism, and especially racism against black people, isn&#x27;t even a thing, but xenophobia is. So it&#x27;s very unlikely for someone to truly sincerely be both against racist content and xenophobic content at the same time and even more unlikely to also sincerely be against censorship, then it&#x27;s getting into very dystopian views territory, you can&#x27;t hold such views without being exposed to massive amounts of propaganda.')
