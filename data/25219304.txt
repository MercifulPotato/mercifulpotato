If we&#x27;re trading a low latency edge in SP500 E-Minis, then not only is C++ better but it might be the only option to successfully capture that edge.<p>On the other hand it we have some niche edge in a smaller market that&#x27;s less speed competitive, Java might very well be the better choice given that we might be able to capture that edge with 8us tick to trade latency.<p>So the answer totally depends on what edge you&#x27;re trying to capture. There are still a large number of edges where Java is good enough. GC is not really a problem, either using a commercial JVM or coding without much garbage and large memory.')
