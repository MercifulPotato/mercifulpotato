They were already antiquated back then but still really useful - I had email and IRC running on separate terminals and kept the main graphical display for browsing. It was all fun and games until one day I came back from lunch to see everyone in the whole building standing outside with the fire department. One of the capacitors on the motherboard of an old VT320 blew and set off the smoke alarm. After that I wasn&#x27;t allowed to bring my own hardware to work anymore.')
