The nationality of the person sought shall be the nationality of the person at the time the offense was committed.</i><p><i>Article 3(2) requires a State that refuses an extradition request solely on the basis of the nationality of the person sought to submit the case to its authorities for prosecution, if so requested by the Requesting State.</i><p>It appears that you are entirely correct!')
