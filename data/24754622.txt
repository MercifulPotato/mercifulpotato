They&#x27;re using the history API to manage the modals. So if you click that link directly, then click the X or simply click out of it, you end up back here.<p>EDIT: I literally can&#x27;t even click on the site&#x27;s logo to go to their front page without being kicked out of their site entirely.<p>EDIT2: Oh you made that site. Don&#x27;t use the history API to go backwards (: it&#x27;s a UX nightmare.')
