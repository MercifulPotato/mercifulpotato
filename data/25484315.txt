Item(by='underslung', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608445230, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25482456, text='&gt;Calling work non-voluntary reveals more about the author than it does about the system they describe: that they feel that they have no choice. They have a choice, but the choice is unpleasant. That is not the same as no choice. Declaring that you have no choice is a result of the inability to confront the weakness to acknowledge the unpleasant decision.<p>The author is using the term non-voluntary in a different sense. If all your material needs are met, e.g. housing, food and hygiene — then working to acquire capital <i>is</i> voluntary. The pre-requisites mentioned are the foundation of an abundant society. Obviously someone in India is going to have a far greater need to acquire capital to sustain themselves&#x27; than your average metropolitan Australian; such is the wealth disparity that currently exists globally.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong — I believe work is an important component of our lives&#x27;. Indeed it can give us meaning and joy amongst other things (perhaps routine as a fundamental). But what I think this author is trying to illustrate is that our current society as a structure leaves zero room for the disciplines that are either a) unexplored, or b) are creative in nature. If it&#x27;s the latter then it is a mere pittance of what a full-time employee earns. That is the trade-off.')
