What it is is that the NES console, along with each cart, has a chip called a CIC that was only available from Nintendo, and only if you were a paid licensee.  The CIC in the console resets the console constantly unless it handshakes with the CIC on the cartridge.<p>There were ways to disable the chip; some things I&#x27;ve read say having something on the cart send a voltage spike would disable it.  I think Tengen reverse engineered it and developed a compatible chip, they got sued.<p>As far as the Sega Genesis, I do know a later revision of the Genesis motherboard had a boot ROM and also required the cart to write ASCII &#x27;SEGA&#x27; to some I&#x2F;O ports, otherwise the video chip would not work.  The idea was that copying this without authorization was a trademark infringement, but I think a later lawsuit made that tactic legally worthless.<p>Arcade boards of the 80&#x27;s and early 90&#x27;s have some interesting schemes.  A number of Capcom games have decryption keys in a RAM that&#x27;s powered by a &#x27;suicide battery&#x27; and if the battery ever dies or is tampered with, the keys are gone and the board stops working.')
