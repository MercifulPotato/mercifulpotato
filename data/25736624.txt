The table is defective. You didn&#x27;t describe the cost or the defect, but unless we&#x27;re talking about a $5,000 dining table with a buffable scratch, there&#x27;s likely little profit in hauling it back and refurbishing it.<p>That leaves them open to a certain amount of fraud, and that&#x27;s a cost they&#x27;ll have to eat. But as with self-checkout lanes becoming popular, I think a lot of places are discovering that most people aren&#x27;t out to commit widespread fraud, at least not at a scale that costs more than they save from more onerous means.<p>They just have to root out the serial offenders -- and I suspect that if you have a second return with Wayfair, it will be more scrutinized.')
