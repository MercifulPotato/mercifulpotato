Hacker News alone gets a ton of traffic and it&#x27;s hardly mainstream. What will happen is that the web will adapt as it always has.<p>It&#x27;s not as big a problem as you make it out to be. Don&#x27;t confuse the size of these sites&#x27; userbases with proportional degree of control over anything outside of their domain.<p>&gt;Ok, now what is almost all of the major platforms do it, and there are no serious competitors?<p>&gt;Let&#x27;s expand this out even further.

But your scenario in which every social media site (including those hosted in other countries,) and every businesses and government utilities and services conspire to control all forms of communication and deprive people of basic services as a means of oppression is so far removed from any conceivable reality that I have to question whether you&#x27;re commenting in good faith. Because you&#x27;re doing a good job of making my point for me.')
