One example - I found that there wasn&#x27;t a &#x27;point person&#x27; who could quickly get us answers. We&#x27;re used to having a go-to person who will nag internal team-members and make sure the customer is taken care of. We were shuffled across different teams for no apparent reason which slowed things down. There just seemed to be more internal inflexibility&#x2F;bureaucracy than we&#x27;re used to here in the US. We did end up buying equipment from the company in the end, so I might travel there sometime soon and experience the business culture first-hand.')
