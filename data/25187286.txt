While the article is clearly biased, it would be foolish to believe that Apple is a company that doesn&#x27;t change course, going as far as total U-turns on public statements, as long as it&#x27;s in their interests to do so.<p>&gt; They are what makes the mac popular with developers<p>Developers believe that they&#x27;re Apple&#x27;s priority when it comes to hardware, especially the Mac, in large part due to the perfect intersect that was the MBP for many years. That tide already turned in 2016 with the new keyboard, followed by the touch bar. Like the joke that the &#x27;S&#x27; in IoT stands for security (the joke being there is no S, and there is no security), there is no &#x27;D&#x27; for developer in MBP. Apple have been consistently clear that &#x27;professional developers&#x27; are not the primary target of their &#x27;Pro&#x27; lineup across the board.<p>Someone else made a comment on this forum that got my attention recently, that we&#x27;re all so used to being courted as customers by (mostly free) services that we&#x27;ve forgotten that we&#x27;re not always the target customer. Similarly, developers are only welcome in Apple&#x27;s ecosystem if they play by Apple&#x27;s rules. Like we&#x27;ve seen with the App Store, Apple will frequently alter the terms of the deal. All you can do is pray they do not alter them any further.<p>None of this should diminish the extraordinary results that can be delivered by the M1. That is amazing.')
