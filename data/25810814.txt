Today, I&#x27;d be astonished if one lost their devices and loses any data along with it.<p>Personally, all my devices are endpoints or tools. For instance, if I lost my phone, it will take me a few hours or a day&#x2F;two at best to get back to where I was. The same goes for my other devices (desktops, laptops).<p>In the most critical situation, say, I lost my phone while traveling, but lucky my wife&#x27;s phone is in-tact, I can pick up hers and go through my contacts (we sync our contacts two ways). I can then login to anything anywhere by getting to her Password Manager, which fortunately has a copy of mine. I might need to ask her to authenticate it for me.<p>I strongly feel that one should have a pattern and system of redundancies and be independent of the devices one uses. I&#x27;m still discovering and learning a lot; not yet the best, but I&#x27;m happy I started quite a while back.')
