Item(by='shripadk', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602346267, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24738633, text='&gt; you&#x27;re living in a fantasy world, an absolute fantasy world, if you think Obama was more divisive than Trump.<p>You want to know how divisive Obama is? He literally put immigrant kids in cages and split them from their parents. And he even admitted to that [1]. But hey guess what, your fake news media showed it as Trump doing it and even attributed an image of kids being put in cages during Obama&#x27;s tenure as that of being done in Trump&#x27;s tenure. Obama literally effing said: &quot;That is our direct message to the families in Central America. Do not send your children to the borders. If they do make it they&#x27;ll get sent back. More importantly they may not make it&quot;. This is Obama for you. Ah but no one will make a fuss about it because he is the Nobel Peace Prize winner! How can he ever say anything that is wrong? He just can&#x27;t. Only Trump can. Cos &quot;Orange man bad&quot;.<p>&gt; That &quot;evidence&quot; up there is from a class of argumentation designed not to change anyone&#x27;s mind, but to give supporters an excuse to put concerns of racism out of their head and stay with him. That&#x27;s why you find it so convincing. you want to like him. Most of politics is like this.<p>That is far fetched and ridiculous assertion. He had friends from all races before he ran for Presidency. People loved him. The press loved him. Everyone wanted to share a limelight with him. No one had any problems until he ran for Presidency. So either he was a racist or he isn&#x27;t. You can&#x27;t have it both ways. You are trying really hard to paint him as a racist. And then trying to diplomatically say that you did not mean that he is a racist. Nice try!<p>&gt; For example, the only numbers cited compare two values that are very similar (within 10%) but compare two period separated by 8 years, with the former during an bad economy that Obama inherited from Bush (and fixed) and the later during a good economy that Trump inherited from Obama (and destroyed)<p>Are you kidding me? Trump had the best economy ever until Corona came knocking on the doors sent as a gift by China. And don&#x27;t you dare try to paint it on Trump. The epicenter was in New York, run by a Democrat Governor who pushed this stupid policy of getting infected covid patients admitted to nursing homes and intermingle them with non-covid patients instead of making them go through a home quarantine. The majority of the Covid cases are from Democrat controlled states&#x2F;districts with California contributing the most. How do I say that majority of the Covid cases are from Democrat controlled districts? Here is the research to back it up [2]<p>&gt; Also, as I&#x27;m sure you know, executive orders don&#x27;t increase funding for anything. Congress does that. What Trump did is what he always does. Some purely-performative stunt that does no actual good and is just designed to grab headlines. Moving an advisory board into the White House is a death sentence, not a benefit.<p>I stopped reading after this. The CARES Act was approved by Congress you absolute doofus. [3]<p>&quot;The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was passed by Congress with overwhelming, bipartisan support and signed into law by President Trump on March 27th, 2020.  This over $2 trillion economic relief package delivers on the Trump Administrationâ€™s commitment to protecting the American people from the public health and economic impacts of COVID-19.&quot;<p>&gt; But of course none of this matters. Your tribe is your tribe, until death do you part. What you might want to consider is that your tribe will only survive if you cut out the cancer.<p>No. My tribe bothers about fact checking the media lies and find out the truth for ourselves. We don&#x27;t just believe whatever the media says as gospel truth. Maybe you should start doing that. You can start that by learning about the CARES Act. It was passed by Congress. And yes, Trump&#x27;s increase of 1.4 Billion $ in funding for HBCU is in the Act itself. It is called the HEER Fund. You can read about it here: [4]<p>&gt; I won&#x27;t be responding further. Have a nice day, and try not to catch the &#x27;rona.<p>I see what you did there. Just so you know I am an Indian who takes active interest in US politics. But yeah you just confirmed my feelings of Democrats being the worst of the lot. You have to be some special kind of evil to say &quot;try not to catch the &#x27;rona&quot;. You think I am actively going to go looking for and catch Coronavirus? Are you kidding me? I would never say that even to my worst enemy. But hey when Democrats can found the KKK, they can stoop to any level. You just cemented that feeling I have for Democrat supporters. Thanks for that!<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=sjxay-XeSks" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=sjxay-XeSks</a><p>[2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;26&#x2F;coronavirus-death-toll-is-heavily-concentrated-in-democratic-congressional-districts&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.pewresearch.org&#x2F;fact-tank&#x2F;2020&#x2F;05&#x2F;26&#x2F;coronavirus...</a><p>[3]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;home.treasury.gov&#x2F;policy-issues&#x2F;cares#:~:text=The%20Coronavirus%20Aid%2C%20Relief%2C%20and,Trump%20on%20March%2027th%2C%202020" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;home.treasury.gov&#x2F;policy-issues&#x2F;cares#:~:text=The%20...</a>.<p>[4]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.ed.gov&#x2F;about&#x2F;offices&#x2F;list&#x2F;ope&#x2F;caresact.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www2.ed.gov&#x2F;about&#x2F;offices&#x2F;list&#x2F;ope&#x2F;caresact.html</a>')
