Averages are very misleading when the majority of people in cities connected to various fiber end points keep getting crazier and crazier speeds while 50% of the US is stuck on ADSL, with a theoretical max of 20Mbit down - add geographical limitations and that&#x27;s often far lower due to line noise. Where I live in the UK it&#x27;s also just a matter of luck, I live in the middle of a major city and yet in the 5 places I&#x27;ve lived over the last 10 years the only option was ADSL, and never &gt;6Mbit.<p>I haven&#x27;t even started the argument about other countries with poorer internet infrastructure.<p>When you assume being able to download at 1MiB&#x2F;s is basic, you make the internet suck for a huge chunk of the population, they are not the majority - but <i>barely</i>.')
