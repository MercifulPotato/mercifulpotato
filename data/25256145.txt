In the CS situation you define an energy function (in this case representing the physical behavior of the protein in water) and find a heuristic to approximate the coordinates of the lowest energy configuration; done, problem solved.<p>in reality, that&#x27;s not how it works at all.  The energy functions we have are crappy and require too much sampling before we can find the lowest energy configuration.  And more importantly, it doesn&#x27;t look like proteins typically fold to their lowest energy configuration (with the exception of some small fast two state folders), but rather explore a kinetically accessible region around there (or even somewhere else entirely, if the energy cost to transition is too high).<p>Methods like AF depend heavily on large amount of information correlation from evolutionary data, which has historically been of the highest value for making decisions about protein structure.')
