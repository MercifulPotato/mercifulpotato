I worked in Clojure for several years, and very seldom hit the REPL. I spent most of my exploration time in tests. In TypeScript, I split most of my exploration time between types and tests. Occasionally I hit the Node REPL, or the Chrome console. But doing speculative work in an editor, with all its features, has always felt a lot more productive to me. Maybe that’s why I ended up drifting away from Clojure anyway.')
