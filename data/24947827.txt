What are their credentials and achievements?<p>Okay, they sponsor existing projects and then take credit for them, calling them &quot;our open source tools&quot; which are used by everyone &quot;from Netflix to NASA&quot; to &quot;solve the most challenging problems&quot;.<p>Where is the money coming from?<p>Their site makes deceptive claims:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;numfocus.org&#x2F;case-studies" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;numfocus.org&#x2F;case-studies</a><p>Here, there is a representation made that there is &quot;NumFOCUS stack&quot; that is being used in various industries to solve problems.<p>&quot;First Photograph of a Black Hole -- Made with the NumFOCUS Python Stack&quot;<p>This strongly suggests that there is some actual software component by the name of NumFOCUS Python Stack. But when you read the case study in detail, it comes to light that this refers to some tools that have supposedly received support from NumFOCUS:<p>&quot;Although the HOPS pipeline Dr. Chan helped develop is mainly written in the C programming language, [watch how we&#x27;re going to take credit for it anyway, as follows:] EHT scientists also developed a lot of Python code around it to drive the analysis. Dr. Chan explained that there is a huge advantage in using Python.&quot;<p>Right ... , we would not have Python without NumFOCUS, the purveyor of Python! Never mind that Guido guy and what he had been up to since, oh, 1988.<p>&quot;Dr. Chan pointed to NumFOCUS-supported open source tools — Numpy, SciPy, pandas, Astropy, Jupyter, and Matplotlib — as crucial to this iterative scientific thinking process.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t see any references to NumFOCUS in the NumPy Wikipedia page. The NumPy homepage makes absolutely no reference to NumFOCUS at all.<p>The other &quot;case studies&quot; are like his also.<p>ScumFOCUS is more like it!<p>They look like a bunch of status-seeking parasites, from where I&#x27;m sitting.<p>Non-profit organization, right? Sure, after salaries and expenses are paid out.')
