Given that precautions weren&#x27;t being taken to stop the spread of it, that % has to be similar to the <i>real world</i> herd immunity threshold. It&#x27;s also a % similar to what seasonal flu infects every year, and we don&#x27;t take any real precautions to stop that from spreading. In the end it turned out that the 2009 swine flu was much less deadly than originally thought, leading to significant controversy in the medical community, with it even being called a fake pandemic: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemag.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2010&#x2F;01&#x2F;facing-inquiry-who-strikes-back-fake-pandemic-swine-flu-criticism" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sciencemag.org&#x2F;news&#x2F;2010&#x2F;01&#x2F;facing-inquiry-who-s...</a><p>Note how the wiki page for the 2009 swine flu pandemic lists multiple uncontrolled pandemics with estimated %&#x27;s infected in the double digits: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2009_swine_flu_pandemic" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;2009_swine_flu_pandemic</a><p>Keep in mind that human societies aren&#x27;t the uniform mixing vat that the theoretical herd immunity equations assume: the exposure graph of society isn&#x27;t unform at all. So outside special cases with very high degrees of mixing and exposure, it&#x27;s no surprise that these pandemics lose steam long before the theoretical maximums. Conversely, herd immunity isn&#x27;t a magic barrier: infections can go beyond herd immunity thresholds in situations where the rate at which infections are happening is high.')
