I want to just be able to have a sudo-like command to run elevated from an otherwise non-elevated shell. Instead I have to launch a new instance of the shell host that&#x27;s elevated. ConEmu makes this feel more seamless by doing some window manipulation hacks to bring elevated and non-elevated into tabs of the same window, but Windows Terminal doesn&#x27;t want to do anything so hacky which means having a second Windows Terminal window when running elevated.<p>I wonder if improving this is possible within the current design of Windows or if it would be a fundamental change in how it handles user privileges.')
