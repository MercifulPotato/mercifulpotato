Read summary&#x2F;abstract.<p>2. Then skim intro.<p>3. Then read discussion&#x2F;conclusion.<p>4. Then methodology.<p>5. Then read front to back.<p>6. Then read front to back again: but now we&#x27;re being extra skeptical: we&#x27;re questioning everything, looking for common bad practices, checking doubtful references to see whether they&#x27;re true (the number of references that I follow where I don&#x27;t agree with the author that the reference says what they claim is too damn high).<p>7. on loop: read from front, hit and study topic&#x2F;part you don&#x27;t understand, focus on and study that part,  upon understanding continue read through to see whether understanding elucidates any other parts you didn&#x27;t understand.<p>8. repeat step 7 loop until you understand everything.<p>Now running concurrently with most of these steps,  there&#x27;s two escape&#x2F;break decisions to be made at almost every point:<p>a) do I understand paper sufficiently,  if yes, then stop reading.<p>b) is paper actually worth continued reading: if no,  then stop reading.<p>overall, I&#x27;d say the vast majority of papers aren&#x27;t worth reading.<p>Some are easy and only require ~one read.<p>A very very very very small amount are both worth reading, and take a substantial amount of time. multiple reads, several weeks&#x2F; months to grok.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m being hyperbolic when I say the number that justify that probably are less than 10 in your entire lifetime.')
