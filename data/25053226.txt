Lots of theories going around about how Trump uniquely screws up polling. Not a ton of evidence, but it is really surprising both 2016 and 2020 were off in the same direction. It could happen due to random chance of course. Too bad we probably will never see Trump on the ballot again to get any more data on this phenomenon.')
