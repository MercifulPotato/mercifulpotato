I&#x27;ve seen plenty of real people complaining about the references in that game, mostly on Weibo.<p>Regarding Taiwan, CCP does put pressure on companies but this feeling&#x2F;motivation is (almost unanimously) shared by the people in China.<p>My point is, simply brushing off the &quot;real&quot; voices coming from ordinary people in China and claiming they don&#x27;t exist are not very substantive and won&#x27;t help understand them. For example there is one question I asked myself during the protest against that game: Why do my fellow countryperson take a meme directly at Xi an insult to them?')
