The continued spread of Covid poses a rather high risk to me, both because of mortality and because of potential long-lasting aftereffects (&quot;Long Covid&quot;). Even if the vaccine turns out to have longterm side effects, I find it very unlikely that those will be more significant than Long Covid. Therefore the risk tradeoff makes any vaccine a complete no-brainer to me.')
