The first cop who throws a punch at them is clearly abusing his power.<p>2. A 2nd cop realizes what&#x27;s going on, pulls the 1st cop off the news crew, and provides a place for the news reporters to run away. (This isn&#x27;t clear from the Australian news camera. But some people filmed this incident from a 2nd or 3rd angle. The news crew was defended by one of the cops)<p>The officers who wish to intimidate the media exist. But there are also officers who realize this is a very, very bad idea.<p>-----------------------<p>The right-wing media (which a large number of cops do follow) have been describing &quot;the mainstream media&quot; as the enemy of the people for years. Its not surprising that those particular cops who listen to that message are now beginning to throw punches at media crew.<p>We&#x27;re now seeing the results of that indoctrination. If the media is the enemy, then it is &quot;fair&quot; to arrest, punch, and otherwise intimidate them.')
