That it will drive kids away from productive stuff like studying because the joy of achieving something like academic or athletic success can&#x27;t keep up with the bliss that drugs provide.<p>Why else? Perhaps you mean that drugs physically harm you, like you will become a methhead or crackhead with your teeth falling out etc? But that requires really sliding down the deep end...<p>Perhaps I was raised differently. As a kid, my parents told me upfront that drugs are awesome and people do them because they are really enjoyable not because junkies are evil mutant monsters who like to destroy their lives, and that the awesomeness is the danger in them, that they are empty enjoyment without deeper achievements etc.<p>This was in contrast to school finger wagging lectures, which just said that drugs are baaad and you must learn to say NO or you will destroy your health and life and drugs are poison and terrible and will eat your flesh (slides showing the effects of krokodil, and shady people in alleyways). Which just confused me because why such a big deal about poison that destroys your life? Why would anyone do this if it&#x27;s so straightforwardly bad?')
