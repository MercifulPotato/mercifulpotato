At that point, the individually rational action is to leave the union, keep the dues, but benefit from the union&#x27;s negotiation.  As everybody does this, the union declines.<p>&quot;At-will employment&quot; laws mean that the burden of proof for the cause of firing is on the employee, rather than the employer.  This gives free rein to employer&#x27;s to fire workers considering unionizing, so long as there is the barest pretext of another cause.  As forming a union becomes economically risky, unions decline, or fail to form in new industries.<p>Unions have been attacked in the US, through explicit policies meant to defund unions, and to prevent unions from forming.')
