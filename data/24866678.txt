Democrats will fund education traditionally, and that hasn&#x27;t changed. They are the ones pushing to give federal funding support to keep state and local governments operating and reduce potential massive cuts. The republican senate is strongly against this direction; the president wants to give unemployment boosts but doesn&#x27;t want to help &#x27;blue states&#x27;. He&#x27;s not too keen on education either.<p>I agree the situation is terrible and private colleges should be dying off rapidly.')
