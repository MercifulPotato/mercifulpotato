I seem to be very momentum based, as in it costs time to get into a state where i can put in effective work (also takes time to get back into a relaxed state). With that being the case i construct scenarios in my head where i put lots of tasks together so i can do them when i got the ball rolling and there is  a synergistic effect of not duplicating effort. Plus there is a strict divide between stress and relaxing.<p>But through that all these tasks form a big daunting mountain of stress and effort together and then i keep putting them off and procrastinate.')
