Another example is that I really don&#x27;t understand how anyone reads web pages without an adblocker and yet I see it all the time.<p>Accept cookies, sign up for newsletter, half pages being covered by &quot;you have 2 articles left this month&quot;, banner ads that take over the page etc. It would drive me mad.<p>I remember once when I went home and was watching TV with my mother and the ads came on (with a big increase in volume) and automatically clicked the mute button. After several times doing this, she said &quot;What are you doing? am I supposed to sit here in silence waiting for the show to come back&quot;.<p>So you might be right... <i>sigh</i>')
