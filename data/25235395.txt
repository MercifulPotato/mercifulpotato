We clearly have different understandings of openness. I also wrote a savage driver for mplayer in the early 2000s but just because it was possible to write a driver for it, that doesn&#x27;t mean the hardware was open in any reasonable sense of the word. Again, just because they decided to allow you to disable secure boot on those devices, probably mainly to drive adoption of their arch, doesn&#x27;t mean it is any more open than a lock you can pick with your own lockpicking set.<p>The irony is that the jailbreaking crowd has spend so much time trying to break into apple devices that in comparison this now seems open.<p>EDIT: Also can we stop pretending that english isn&#x27;t english and the opposite of locked isn&#x27;t unlocked&#x2F;open?')
