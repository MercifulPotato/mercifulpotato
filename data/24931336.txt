If a substantial portion of people are ordering takeout from intermediaries, it&#x27;s reasonable that when one of those customers checks the reviews, they contain relevant info from others who&#x27;ve ordered the same way and shared their thoughts.  Getting in a huff because of that is akin to trying to silence people talking about you because you don&#x27;t like what those people are saying and&#x2F;or how other people are responding to it.<p>If review sites are unfairly mixing irrelevant info (presenting takeout experience using intermediaries to customers who are looking exclusively to dine in), then the ire should be aimed at those sites and, ultimately, the dine-in customers who let irrelevant info dissuade them from going through with their order.')
