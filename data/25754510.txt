I&#x27;m sure we think it&#x27;s deserved in a relative sense.<p>But it is most definitely a windfall to the rest of the world (even the rest of the country), who work equally hard, under worse conditions, for their entire lives and cannot even hope to earn say 1&#x2F;5 the wealth that a tech worker can accumulate after his&#x2F;her first job.<p>To have a payday of millions of $ fall out of the sky, for toiling the same as others trying to make a living, yet also being lucky to be in the right place and the right time to have it rewarded.')
