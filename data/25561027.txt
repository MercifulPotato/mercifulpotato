With a Veblen good the price paid is <i>part</i> of the demand: you want that Rolls Royce or Lamborghini or diamond ring because its expense signifies your social status.  The demand curve then slopes upward: at higher price points consumers demand them more.  You can still analyze them by supply &amp; demand, but you just have to take into account the upward-sloping demand curve (which is not unlimited, BTW: Veblen goods still reach an equilibrium price point where supply reaches buyer&#x27;s ability to pay, it&#x27;s just higher).')
