Item(by='pierrebai', descendants=None, kids=[24872232, 24871481], score=None, time=1603470690, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24869624, text='If I&#x27;d rate my current collection of best SF I&#x27;ve read:<p>- Deepness in the Sky: super mustache twirling, one of the worst.<p>- Fire upon the Deep: I consider the blight to be twirling. Why treat lower civ that way? AFAIK, for mustache twirling.<p>- Iain M Banks: lotsa mustache twirling. Surface details and Player of Games in particular. My view of the culture AI is that they are constantly sarcastically toying with humans, and are thus secretly twirling.<p>- Fifth Season (Jemisin): no twirling. One of the most balanced novel on that front, every faction has believable reason to act the way they do.<p>- Book of the New Sun: no twirling, but OMG, stop what you&#x27;re doing a good read these books! The tone and story was just perfect for me. Sure, it looks like a weird cross of SF and fantasy, but there is no fantasy at all in the novel in reality. Book of New Urth is, in comparison, just merely very good.<p>- Ancillary Justice (Lecki): some small twirling, but justified since it&#x27;s an empire: absolute power corrupt. The twirling is commensurate with having a empress as head of state. She even becomes mostly sympathetic later.<p>- Left hand of Darkness: not only no twirling, but the power struggle is extremely believable. Great illustration of an interesting alien civilisation. Great for both world-building and character building. Another of those stop everything and just read it now novel.<p>- Roadside Picnic: no twirling. The conflicts and abuse of power are all believable.<p>- Collapsing Empire (Scalzi): lot of mustache twirling. Not DotS level, but not that far off. Plus, there is a plot point in the first novel that made me quit reading for a week. Incomprehensible because it was all of unbelievable (given the multiple characters behaviour before), idiotic <i>and</i> had zero impact on the rest of the book... so why write it.
