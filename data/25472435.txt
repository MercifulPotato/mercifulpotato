An app can access tonnes of &#x27;free&#x27; information provided by the OS (model, make, package list), as well as logging each and every tap&#x2F;interaction and accessing personal information (contacts lists, location data, device identifiers you can trace across datasets)<p>You can see which offers people engage with most, how often they open your app, well timed push notifications and a reliance on that app. They can also purchase data from that smartphone and have huge data silos to perform studies on. An App provides access to a human being constantly, whereas a discount card is a stateless entity in a wallet that never gets used; it&#x27;s unlikely someone loses their smartphone, it&#x27;s a prized possession.<p>Quite honestly, discount cards are probably quite worthless vs smartphone data and the richness of what you can get. I am surprised they are even still used&#x2F;offered these days (I know of supermarkets that just have apps now).')
