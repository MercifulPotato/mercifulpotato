I&#x27;ve worked on multi-million line codebases on top of a SQL database where nobody dared change the schema of some (very non-optimal) tables because too much code directly depended on the structure of those tables. Having a clean and DRY data access layer is necessary regardless of the underlying database.<p>As soon as multiple independent codebases share the same database I would argue you need to put an API on top of that database and turn it into a microservice that owns its database. Otherwise the internal details of how the tables are structured will wrap itself into the codebases and make it very hard to evolve the database&#x27;s schema.')
