Streaks can pick up health data to keep my on track for my weekly sleep and exercise goals. And Iâ€™ve set up Shortcuts so it increments a counter in Streaks to keep track of when I open Instagram or Twitter. That stops me from mindlessly checking social media but allows me a couple of visits in a day without it breaking the streak.')
