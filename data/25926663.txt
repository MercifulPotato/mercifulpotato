It&#x27;s so dense that you can drive screws to anywhere on it. It behaves like drywall.<p>&gt; And if water gets in and doesn&#x27;t get removed immediately you&#x27;re in for a world of excitement.<p>On higher end IKEA furniture there&#x27;s no hex structure inside. It&#x27;s filled. Solid. There&#x27;s no <i>inside</i>.<p>My kitchen is 8 years old and it has a solid wood counter. I re-oil it occasionally but, there&#x27;s no degradation whatsoever. It&#x27;s guaranteed for 25 years so, it&#x27;s not something flimsy. Again panels and cabinets are not hollow. There&#x27;s no inside of these cabinets.')
