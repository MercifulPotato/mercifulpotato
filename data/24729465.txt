Firstly, health care in the US is extremely expensive. There are long articles written about this but IMO a main reason is market failure. The US, especially republicans, place a lot of value on free markets but people are willing to pay almost anything not to die.<p>The second part of the story is that the US is richer than Europe. I moved to the US from Western Europe. Before I moved here I didn&#x27;t expect how much more everything is more expensive here, but at the same time salaries are also higher. The US&#x27;s GDP per capita is $62k, Germany&#x27;s is $47k. But that doesn&#x27;t tell full story. In the US there is a big difference between low paying and high paying jobs, rural and urban areas.')
