What I don&#x27;t know is whether she is in a position to give me an answer <i>right now</i>, which is what I need for it to do me any good.<p>So I usually open with &quot;Ping...&quot; which everyone I deal with knows means, &quot;Are you in the mood to be bothered with a quick question that needs an immediate answer?&quot;  And I only do this with people I know prefer chat over email all else being equal because they will initiate chats with me.  Otherwise I go straight to email.')
