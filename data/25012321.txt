This leads to chargebacks, loss of reputation by the donatee in the eyes of the card processor, and a whole bunch of wasted time.  One of the &quot;services&quot; that organizations like Patreon actually perform is to take on this risk on behalf of their clients.<p>I guess bitcoin&#x2F;etc payments are still OK, but except in some small niche subject areas, aren&#x27;t generally accepted enough to make the direct donation setup worthwhile.')
