You would think youtube Google had better AI to detect this kind of stuff. Makes think many of the videos being wrongly censored&#x2F;demonetized on youtube may really be because of faulty AI detection of the content. I do enjoy the fact that I can get all those live video music available on Youtube and not on any other platform.')
