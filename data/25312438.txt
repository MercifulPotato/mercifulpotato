Private fencing lessons cost about 95 dollars. You want around 2 a week plus 2-3 group classes which cost 45 dollars. That&#x27;s already 280-325 dollars a week. Add on flying to both domestic and international tournaments, which is easily a thousand just for flights and hotels, not to mention strip coaching fees and other random costs (airline lost your baggage? Guess you gotta buy a whole new set of fencing gear!). Oh and the club membership costs a thousand a year and there&#x27;s fencing camp in the summer for $1500.<p>Gear may seem expensive but it&#x27;s really not in comparison. Blades will cost you about 100-120 a pop, they break every 6 months, a year if you&#x27;re careful. Full international grade gear you could do for under 1000 dollars.<p>Granted this is the insane top of the top. But I do know quite a few parents who pay for this.')
