One time is spelled backwards (ECIDARAP). Probably he did this because how his first cipher was cracked withing hours&#x2F;days.<p>It was cracked by the wife of this high-school teacher. She thought the cipher would start with the word &quot;I&quot; and it would also contain words like &quot;KILL&quot;. She found these words within the message so with the help of his husband, they guessed the key and the whole message.<p>I think Zodiac learned from his mistakes and decide to make it more complicated spelling it backwards, so the same symbols won&#x27;t appear twice. He probably thought code-breakers would also be looking for important words he included on his earlier messages, such as &quot;paradice&quot; or &quot;slave&#x2F;s&quot;. Having a long sequence of symbols that appears twice and transposing them to his most known words could have led to break the code really fast.')
