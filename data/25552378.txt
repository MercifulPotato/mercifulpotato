It doesn&#x27;t solve the purported problem and it&#x27;s impossible to please the crowd, as you can see in the rest of the comments on this thread.<p>Here&#x27;s what I wrote about the boycott four months ago on HN:<p>&quot;I&#x27;m also a FB advertiser. Here my thoughts on it:<p>1) Facebook&#x27;s reach is unique. If you want to share a message that&#x27;s important to you with groups of people you care about reaching in the world, there&#x27;s no better way to reach them at scale.<p>2) Facebook has had a number of negative sounding news cycles in the past few years (Cambridge Analytica, etc.), and data shows that the average American hasn&#x27;t changed their behavior based on them. 70% of all Americans and Canadians use Facebook or Instagram at least once a month, and 55% of all Americans and Canadians use it at least once per day. Facebook&#x27;s monthly and daily user counts have only grown, including this last quarter.<p>3) Very few advertisers ended up cutting spend during the boycott. Many who did so wanted to cut ad spend in a COVID environment anyway. For instance, Unilever and Coca-Cola also paused Twitter ads, which has nothing to do with the boycott.<p>4) I myself believe that, at least in comparison to other companies like Google, Facebook does try to police hate speech, and it&#x27;s a hard job.&quot;')
