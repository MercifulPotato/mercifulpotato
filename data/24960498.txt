The incentives don&#x27;t align perfectly. They can also just hike the price of the insurance policy and pass along the cost to the consumer. Much less trouble than taking on the mob. If the problem truly is systemic, then your competitors are just as affected as you are, and it&#x27;s a wash. If you solve the problem, then you also solve it for your competitor.')
