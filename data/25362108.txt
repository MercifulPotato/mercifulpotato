Growth is not success; profit is, growth is simply the mechanism by which you&#x27;re supposed to reach profitability.<p>If we define success as cashing out, sure, success. It <i>feels</i> like the delta in journey between building a sustainable, profitable business that handsomely rewards you at your exit and &quot;congrats on your lottery ticket&quot; is growing by the day. Let&#x27;s not kid ourselves, investor dollars chasing after your equity when you go public and with no evidence profitability is possible is a rare lottery ticket that has paid out (or maybe not so rare! See: Adam Neumann&#x2F;WeWork).<p>EDIT: I want to really stress that this isn&#x27;t &quot;sour grapes&quot; but more echo chamber fatigue. If you are founders at a startup, who grow it into a unicorn, are delivering value, your employees and customers are happy and delighted, and you&#x27;re profitable, those are the folks who deserve to be congratulated when they IPO and become billionaires and are who you can learn the most from on your own startup journey.')
