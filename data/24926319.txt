I&#x27;m not trying to take Krebs down a peg; I&#x27;m a fan. If he&#x27;s an advisor to a company, he should disclose that relationship --- like any other relationship! --- in his stories. That he&#x27;s not paid doesn&#x27;t change much; personal relationships are also disclosable. I mentioned the payment thing only because the optics probably weren&#x27;t the optics Krebs wanted, not because I dispute what he&#x27;s saying.')
