In a world after Witcher 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2, audiences expect more. Moreover, expectations were sky high for Cyberpunk after Witcher 3 managed to move the entire medium forward in the sort of storytelling and characterization and pathos one could achieve in games; and of course, CD Projekt Red fueled the fire of hype with all their glitzy demo reels before the game. I was excited to play the next game from the creators of Witcher 3, but I&#x27;m disappointed since, by all accounts, it&#x27;s not as good. If they had announced it as a simple FPS&#x2F;arcade game, no one would have expected any of this.')
