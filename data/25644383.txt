They can propose and push just about any regulation. They can start whitelisting&#x2F;kyc Bitcoin wallets, trace transactions and whatnot, but almost all valuable protocols for p2p transacting are open sourced and we can always run a new blockchain network under the radar. The ability to own a locally generated key pair in such a network and, under the assumption that one already owns some assets tied to that specific network, one can freely transact and interact with other parties safely - is something that can never be regulated. While I&#x27;m transacting within boundaries of such a p2p network (i.e. not exiting to fiat) I should be safe. Needless to say that I&#x27;m expecting even more of the blockchain development going in these directions to make network resistant to government&#x27;s regulatory attacks.')
