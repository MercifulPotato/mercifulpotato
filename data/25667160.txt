The person doing the &#x27;healing&#x27; has met your personal standard for a &#x27;healer&#x27; - in this case foreign experience. Without licensing, I could, with no experience whatsoever, just cut you open and go to town. You would die, and then what? Who&#x27;s liable? What if I get half way through and then realize that Milton Bradley&#x27;s Operation is not a replacement for Grey&#x27;s Anatomy and you are rushed to a real hospital?<p>2. You assume the &#x27;healing&#x27; is successful. Does it become butchering if I fail to do so?<p>So, to that end, while I may not agree with all aspects of licensing physicians (for instance, I&#x27;m with you on the foreign degree and experience limitations) I believe that on the whole it does more good than harm.<p>I will therefore be explicit and say, yes, I do &quot;agree with the criminalization of healing people without permission [of competent authorities],&quot; even if I do not today agree with all of their requirements, however I reject your framing.')
