And it doesn&#x27;t mean &#x27;free speech you agree with&#x27;.<p>And yet, Wikipedia was allowed to ban them when they started to wreak havoc on the site in 2009. And I don&#x27;t believe it was very controversial, but my memory may be a bit foggy from the years. (Also, being caught up as part of the Anon-mob at the time probably warps my understanding of the events).<p>&gt; I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s good for the country to derail to this level of totalitarian censorship, even temporary, no matter what yours or mine political beliefs are.<p>As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is not much different from Hay&#x27;s Code: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Motion_Picture_Production_Code" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Motion_Picture_Production_Code</a><p>Hollywood in the 1930s conspired to censor movies that didn&#x27;t follow the code. Today, we&#x27;re seeing that websites that don&#x27;t follow a code (ie: don&#x27;t insight violent rhetoric) are open to censorship.<p>Now I love myself a good pre-code Hollywood flick, and even may find myself oogling at a bit of pornography every now and then. And obviously, the rule against interracial marriage was not very kosher. So I&#x27;m certainly happy to be living today rather than in the code-days. But I think you&#x27;re over-exaggerating for how bad things will be if we go down this path.<p>--------<p>Up till now, we lived in the glorious &quot;pre code&quot; days of the Internet. Alas, as we move forward, we understand the power that this new medium holds. And like Hay&#x27;s of the 1927, we&#x27;re realizing that we must hold websites accountable.')
