We built the service so you can work offline for as long as you want and then resync when you&#x27;re online again. We always felt this was the most important aspect of collaboration - you don&#x27;t want to just update a common live view like google sheets, you want to go away make mistakes, fix them and merge when ready. We are also in-memory, so we put a lot of effort into compression, which worked out great as we can use your regular machine for the compute. Download the analytic engine, link to the hub and you can share data free and easy. Obviously talking my book, but a great backend for lots of this sort of collaborative local-first software (we&#x27;re a DBMS at the end of the day). Will be rolling out p2p soon I hope - so going from GitHub for data to napster for data! #LivingTheDream\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;terminusdb.com&#x2F;hub&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;terminusdb.com&#x2F;hub&#x2F;</a>')
