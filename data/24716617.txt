It&#x27;s almost normal to have a scene with quiet talking, then scene with really loud music, then quiet talking.<p>So I guess for people who don&#x27;t adjust the volume throughout, either the music is way too loud or the dialogue is often inaudible. I don&#x27;t get why music in movies is so often so relatively loud. Not sure if it&#x27;s just US movies or not.<p>But mostly I watch movies&#x2F;series with subtitles, in other languages than English - as a side benefit, don&#x27;t even have to turn it up when planes go over!')
