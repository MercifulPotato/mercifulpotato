It&#x27;s interesting for a handful or iconic works, and it&#x27;d be interesting if copyright terms were significantly shorter, but right now, as a culture, we&#x27;ve mostly lost interest in things entering the public domain. We still got a Great Gatsby movie, but it was already a $2 paperback, and I assume people aren&#x27;t that eager to publish fan fiction for it.<p>&gt; I imagine companies like Disney would lobby pretty hard against shortening copyright.<p>That, and in a world with shortening copyright, they wouldn&#x27;t have pushed so hard on promoting Mickey Mouse, and with Star Wars coming up on 50 years old, maybe they wouldn&#x27;t have invested in the Star Wars universe when randos could make their own movies and theme park lands.<p>Some of this IP is more recognized and loved <i>because</i> of long copyright terms.')
