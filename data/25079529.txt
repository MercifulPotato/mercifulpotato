Just a Ruby company that&#x27;s doing well. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s more of them. It&#x27;s not as if the idea of a rewrite was never thrown, but honestly why would they? It would take years, all the while your old dev team needs to pick up a new language and your new hires need to pick up both Ruby and the rewrite language. If the whole architecture was service oriented that may be not too bad but many Ruby companies are running a few big monoliths.\nBesides, this whole idea of lack of Ruby jobs seems weird to me especially if you&#x27;re from North America. Mainland Europe is a different beast though.')
