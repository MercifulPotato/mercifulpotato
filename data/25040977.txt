Scoffing at $50K on $1M means the investor doesn&#x27;t truly get early stage basics like payroll &amp; compounding. Demanding lazy lawyer fees is explicitly asking to be a &quot;partner&quot; that eats the seed corn, and starts doing it even before anything is signed.<p>The investor ultimately doesn&#x27;t care because they win when 9 portfolio co&#x27;s fail and only the 10th nails it. In contrast,  founders only have one company, and it can only burn $10-50K on stupid contracts so many times before payroll breaks, and each time is at the expense of compounding effects.')
