People always talk about shit on the streets, but I only really see it as an issue in like downtown(SOMA,Tenderloin,etc) and tourist areas. I&#x27;ve lived in the residential areas (usually within a block of a major street with shops and restaurants) for 6+ years and it has never been an issue.<p>And the areas I&#x27;ve lived in definitely have massively more &quot;SF culture&quot; than downtown.')
