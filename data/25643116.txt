We&#x27;re evolving our programs to build a new way to access the world&#x27;s best teachers for parents needing help tutoring and homeschooling their children.  We are launching these classes for K-12 very soon.  We&#x27;ve grown to over $400K ARR in 4 months and expect to crest $1M ARR by Q2&#x27;21, given the huge waitlist we&#x27;ve built.<p>We are building software to make our teachers more effective and help our classes operate smoothly.  I will love to discuss the role further if you are interested in changing education.<p>Email: phil@ (domain above)')
