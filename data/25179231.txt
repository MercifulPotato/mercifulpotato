This is especially true for NIH funding, where the competition is cut-throat (~10% of grants funded) and the experiments are relatively expensive.<p>At an early stage, a million dollars of foundation money (or even a lot less) can launch a research program that would otherwise not get off the ground. In a more established program, this would still open up “riskier” directions that would not be feasible otherwise.<p>You might be thinking of actual drug development and clinical trials. There, a\nmillion bucks still wouldn’t be anything to sneeze at, but isn’t enough to run a complete Phase III trial, which usually cost in the tens of millions.')
