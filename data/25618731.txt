I&#x27;ve worked on multiple apps that were denied during an update renewal for something that wasn&#x27;t part of the update and was already approved.  If a specific app gets approved or denied often has a lot to do with which reviewer picks it up.<p>While it seems like bad press has changed the review outcome it is plausible to me that the stance would be reversed regardless because it&#x27;s such a grey area in the rules.')
