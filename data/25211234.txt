We could have also had subresource integrity (SRI), and included our Javascripts in pieces from anywhere based on their hash, rather than using Webpack. But instead we got the mess that is cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), which became such a frustration that we don&#x27;t even blink at 10 MB app.js files.<p>We want a web that is declarative, data-driven and functional wherever possible. Which means that we should be moving away from asynchronous nondeterministic Javascript, not towards it. So ya, the article gets it almost completely backwards.')
