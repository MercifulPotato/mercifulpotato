If I solve it by writing some open source code, and do it well, I&#x27;ll never have to solve it again in the future.<p>I compare that to my previous decade+ of engineering where I would frequently find myself solving a problem that I&#x27;d already solved a couple of years earlier, but in closed-source code that I couldn&#x27;t easily reuse.')
