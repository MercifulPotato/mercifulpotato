GMT is identical to UTC to the nearest second. GMT is <i>not</i> defined as &quot;the current time in Greenwich&quot;, and I suspect your confusion is because you think it&#x27;s &quot;Greenwich Meridian Time&quot;. It&#x27;s actually &quot;Greenwich <i>Mean</i> Time&quot;.<p>The maritime museum at Greenwich is pretty cool though, as is the old observatory. You can see Harrison&#x27;s clocks there.')
