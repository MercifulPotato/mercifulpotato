This is shown in some court documents (where there are warrants).<p>So the ACLU asked the FBI, hey, are you breaking into phones, as these court documents say? (probably so they can ask the follow up, &quot;show us the warrants&quot;).<p>The FBI then responded. I&#x27;m not saying a damn thing! not gonna even confirm whether we&#x27;ve broken into anything. NOPE.<p>At which point, how can the ACLU ask to see warrants. The fbi need to say that they are breaking into phones (as court documents state) which they won&#x27;t even do, so the ACLU are suing to say &quot;hey that&#x27;s not fair, you definitely are doing that, don&#x27;t deny it.&quot;')
