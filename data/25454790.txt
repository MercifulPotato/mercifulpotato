If I must see ads, then I rather see relevant ads. There is nothing bad in this.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the facebook&#x2F;google bashing here. It&#x27;s not as you could advertise on apple for something against apple.<p>It should also be clear to you what game Apple is playing here. Their end game is to do the tracking themselves and then they will slowly introduce and sell ads themselves. Their marketing department will then call it &quot;privacy ads&quot;, but it&#x27;s going to be the same as todays google&#x2F;fb ads.')
