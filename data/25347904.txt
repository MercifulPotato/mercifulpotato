It&#x27;s proof of the downsides to the IBM acquisition, which I think we all knew was coming.\nImagine if you were running a business, and deployed CentOS 8 based on the 10 year lifespan promise. You&#x27;re totally screwed now, and Red Hat knows it. Why on earth didn&#x27;t they make this switch starting with CentOS 9???? Let&#x27;s not sugar coat this. They&#x27;ve betrayed their users.<p>I personally run a CentOS 7 server (as do members of my family), and was planning on upgrading them all to 8. Luckily, I didn&#x27;t get round to it yet. I guess I&#x27;ll have to consider an alternative. For my server I want a boring, stable OS, so I&#x27;m definitely not using Streams. This is going to ripple throughout the whole industry, as CentOS is used all over the place, from regular home users to businesses (and things like CloudLinux).<p>It&#x27;s very disappointing that Red Hat can&#x27;t see the damage they&#x27;ll do not only to the community, but to themselves too. Someone will come along and take the CentOS user base, and it won&#x27;t be Red Hat :(.')
