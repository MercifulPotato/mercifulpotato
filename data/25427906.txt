For this scenario to make sense, you’d have to know things were really bad, but not know enough about how bad they are to only isolate the systems you need to.<p>If you don’t know what’s happened, I can’t imagine you’d know enough about the impact to justify turning the business off. The only scenario I can think of where this plan would make sense is if you find out somehow that you’ve already been the victim of a major breach that you failed to detect, so you think it would be worthwhile to just turn everything off while you figure out what happened (because how much worse can it get at that stage, really?...).<p>Nothing about this seems impressive to me. It sounds like a plan for people who don’t have a plan.<p>Also, as a side note, anything that needs executive approval to be done during an incident is (as a general rule of thumb) never going to be done during an incident.')
