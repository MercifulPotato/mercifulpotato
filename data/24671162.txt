Django is hugely more complex and I have considerably more experience with Hugo... And yet I run into far fewer problems and get stuff done faster with Django.<p>Hugo has exactly one thing going for it compared to other static site builders: it&#x27;s fast. I have about 100 pages now and they build in &lt;1second.<p>Aside from that, it&#x27;s a pain to work with. The documentation is sparse but serviceable, but the community on GitHub and Discourse leaves a lot to be desired. Grumpy and unresponsive and much more inclined to close your issue or tersely tell you to read the docs than provide help or admit you have a valid feature request&#x2F;bug report.')
