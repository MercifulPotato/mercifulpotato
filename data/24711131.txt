When you stand on the mirror the direction from your feet to your head is different than for the guy in the mirror. It shows that the mirror changes only one axe, orthogonal to its surface. It does not rotate anything nor change up&#x2F;down or left&#x2F;right. So when I look at the mirror en face only the direction of y axis is changed, x and z is not affected.')
