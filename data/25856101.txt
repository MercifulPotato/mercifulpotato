She finishes in an hour.<p>The physicist pulls out pencil and notepad, and after a few minutes of computation, determines that a novel circular fence design will enclose the maximum number of (spherical, frictionless) sheep, while remaining structurally sound.  He too completes the fence within an hour.<p>The mathematician sits for an hour under a tree in deep thought, suddenly jumps up, wraps herself in a short length of fence, and says, &quot;I declare myself to be outside the fence!&quot; [this is normally where the joke ends]<p>The programmer meanwhile is nowhere to be found, having run off excitedly with his laptop immediately after hearing the problem statement.  The shepherd congratulates the other three on a job well done, and they all part ways.<p>A week later, as the shepherd is tending to the flock, he is surprised to see the programmer sitting in the shade of a tree, furiously typing away at his laptop. &quot;Uh, how&#x27;s it coming?&quot; the shepherd asks.<p>The programmer replies, &quot;It&#x27;s going great!  I&#x27;ve almost finished coding the cross-platform terminal graphics library!&quot;')
