I learned English in school starting at 6. After that I learned German starting at around 22-23. Since 25 or so I am learning French - currently 31. The two difficulties I have is 1. time and 2. immersion. I think its correct that I will never speak like a native speaker but it will be close enough that it will take some minutes for a native speaker to figure out that I&#x27;m not a native speaker. Funny enough - I have developed an English accent in Russian because I don&#x27;t use it so often any more. Actually its hard to say - Russians have trouble identifying where I&#x27;m actually from based on the accent.')
