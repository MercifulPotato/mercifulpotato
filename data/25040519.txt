It is extremely easy to find those people. A simple search for &quot;Amazon Reviews&quot; on Facebook will take you to a few <i>open</i> Facebook Groups. Here are a few examples:<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;amazonrrc&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;amazonrrc&#x2F;</a>\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;AmReSe&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.facebook.com&#x2F;AmReSe&#x2F;</a><p>I was curious and contacted one of them. They sent proof screenshots that they indeed refund you if you buy a products and leave a good review. They instructed me to search for specific term to find the product instead of giving me a link to click on.<p>For Amazon, this is easy to prevent because it is so easy to find sellers that are engaging in that sort of activity.<p>As always, if you follow the money, Amazon has little interest in doing so...')
