But I somehow am not as optimistic as you are. People far underestimate the power of twitter&#x2F;fb&#x2F;youtube.<p>The power in those sites is that they are not siloed and at scale, meaning you can reach a much broader audience. Parler would never be able to influence the mass market because it was so specialized - making it ineffective at evangelization. WSB would never be what it is without the platform of reddit. Going to a small specific site will not have the same power, even though I think it is better to host your own hardware and do that.')
