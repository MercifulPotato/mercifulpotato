I&#x27;m looking forward to watching the whole thing later.<p>Jumping forward to the TLA+ section, I very much like the point about how TLA+ enabled precise communication between teams. Writing about distributed algorithms is really hard to do well, and the precision of TLA+ makes it much easier to communicate points in a clear way. This is true of math in general, of course, but my experience has been that many folks are more willing to work through TLA+ code than work through written formal math (and, once you learn it, it&#x27;s much more approachable in this domain).<p>We&#x27;ve been using TLA+ at Amazon for a long time (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cacm.acm.org&#x2F;magazines&#x2F;2015&#x2F;4&#x2F;184701-how-amazon-web-services-uses-formal-methods&#x2F;fulltext" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;cacm.acm.org&#x2F;magazines&#x2F;2015&#x2F;4&#x2F;184701-how-amazon-web-...</a>), and of course it was developed at Microsoft. Despite that, it&#x27;s still quite a small community, so I&#x27;m always excited when it comes up.')
