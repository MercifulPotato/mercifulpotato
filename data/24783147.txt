Item(by='heimatau', descendants=None, kids=[24784114], score=None, time=1602719616, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24783073, text='&gt; Would Google be happy if one of their employee made a statement...<p>Would the worker be happy if their boss tells them how to speak, what to speak, and what they can&#x27;t speak about?<p>Honestly, Googlers work very hard. This isn&#x27;t as big of an issue as people are making it out to be.<p>How do you want foster freedom and lessen control&#x2F;restrictions? Seriously.<p>The idea that we should limit speech...is a very dangerous path to even think about. All thoughtful points are moot compared to how those policies can be abused and destroy an entire civilization. Nazi Germany wasn&#x27;t too long ago. China restricted a doctor&#x27;s speech about sounding the alarm on Covid19 (so it&#x27;s more recent too).<p>If society (a collection of individuals) continue to think that it&#x27;s &quot;okay&quot; to restrict someone&#x27;s opinions (for any justification), they make society weaker. Truth wins out. Not authoritarianism.<p>But...back to my main point of responding to you. Googler (and other tech companies) aren&#x27;t a DC think tank. They&#x27;re building and shipping things. They work hard. And those that are highly skilled, want the autonomy in work. If you restrict that autonomy, you restrict your talent pool of workers. Maybe you think that&#x27;s a good choice (Coinbase would agree) but...in the long-term, IMHO, freedom is more powerful than control.')
