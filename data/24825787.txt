Sweden, which did not restrict healthcare access, and has one of the lowest ICU capacities in Europe, did not see hospital overload or healthcare rationing at any point.<p>Lockdowns have certainly created a death toll, that is by now mainstream consensus. The debate is about whether it&#x27;s most of the excess death or only a large chunk of it.<p>But it&#x27;s worth remembering that even then excess death numbers are low in absolute terms. A lot of people can&#x27;t see that because for some reason it&#x27;s standard for statistical agencies to only give a few years of data in convenient graphs on their websites, but older data is there, and it puts things in proportion. In the UK for example, which has one of the worst excess death rates in Europe, 2020 is so far a bit less deadly than 1999&#x2F;2000 and the gap is widening [1]. But nothing remarkable happened in the UK in 1999&#x2F;2000, nobody talks with sadness about those who were lost at the millennium. Nobody noticed anything at all. The idea that we&#x27;ve had some sort of terribly high or remarkable levels of excess death isn&#x27;t the case: it&#x27;s being noticed because people were told to expect enormous levels so started tracking the data with a microscope, and then it went up partly due to lockdowns.<p>In many other countries excess death is even less remarkable than that. Germany and Switzerland have seen years no different to the previous years for example. Cumulative death in Switzerland for 2020 is by now completely average, for example. There was no plague in Switzerland at any point.<p>[1] <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;inproportion2.talkigy.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;inproportion2.talkigy.com&#x2F;</a>')
