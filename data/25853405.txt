That it is unreasonable for a free project that is shutting down to continue to operate until all EOL&#x27;s are reached, especially til 2029.  It&#x27;s quite nice of them to keep things going for a full year in order that people can make other arrangements.<p>Once the unfortunate decision was made to shut down CentOS, it would be very nice if the public outrage was tempered with a little appreciation for the 6 years of support that Red Hat gave to it, and also an appreciation for the new options for free access to RHEL they are providing.<p>People seem awfully entitled in their outrage.')
