If fascism came to power tomorrow, they&#x27;d switch to questions like &quot;Do you fully and wholly support the opression of minorities?&quot; to hire you.<p>So, it&#x27;s just good business. And if they&#x27;re also ideologues that hate concervatives? To them that&#x27;s a win-win!<p>Oh, and the people in charge of &quot;company culture&quot; or some such shit non-job need to find something to do, don&#x27;t they?<p>Plus, it gives the company &quot;progressiveness&quot; points to use on some presentations, news articles, etc (&quot;Why, of course we have a employee sensitiveness education program&quot;).')
