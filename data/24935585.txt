So, we&#x27;ll definitely cancel some of them soon, just out of principal and a service to help would be useful.<p>I don&#x27;t even need it to activate&#x2F;deactivate my accounts. The real benefit to me would be tracking and notifying me when the shows I follow have a new season available. Then when I exhaust whichever platform I&#x27;m currently subscribed to, I&#x27;ll know which one to subscribe to next.<p>Also, tracking the Series and Movies that I want to watch would be helpful, especially the ones that can potentially appear&#x2F;disappear from different streaming services.')
