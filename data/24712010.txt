Prior to covid, one of my hobbies really took over and became all I wanted to do. I scaled back my ambitions at work and basically have taken steps to put myself in &#x27;auto-pilot&#x27; roles where I can meet&#x2F;barely exceed expectations while focusing on my hobby. Now I have a ton of flexibility to pursue my passion (at least for now) while still getting great feedback from my leads.<p>A key part of achieving that was \n1) Being honest with myself about what I wanted and the sacrifices it entailed, such as slower promotion or salary growth<p>2) Showing my employer that I am committed to doing well and performing - but with an expectation that they respect my priorities and accommodate them.<p>3) Demonstrating that allowing me to prioritize my passions actually makes me better at my job - I am happy, relaxed and focused when I come to work - and that 35 hours a week of happy me is better than 45 hours of cranky, unsatisfied me.')
