Or is it out of a moral interest in not being pawns of the bad actors who stand behind it?<p>This kind of disinformation is dangerous, and we are vulnerable to it precisely because we value freedom of speech. That doesn&#x27;t mean that we&#x27;re morally obligated to value all speech equally. Obviously false and dangerous speech should be suppressed. Twitter (and other sites) is taking a moral stand, not an expedient stand.')
