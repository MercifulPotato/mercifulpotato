There would still be enough economic activity in enough of the 500 companies to justify some price above zero.<p>So the scenario would literally be the apocalypse.  The kind of apocalypse where the US dollar has zero value.  The kind of apocalypse where the amount of money in a brokerage account would not even be on the top 100 list of things a human would be worried about.<p>Even losing 90% of value would be an event so unprecedented in magnitude that it would make anthropomorphic climate change seem like a footnote in history.')
