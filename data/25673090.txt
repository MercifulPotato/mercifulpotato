The entire establishment aggressively suppressed euroskepticism of any kind for decades to the level that it required a total outsider, who was himself frozen out completely, to create an entirely new political party <i>twice</i> and bring them to winning enough votes to ensure the Conservatives couldn&#x27;t ignore it anymore.<p>You say &quot;the Sun&quot; as if a single tabloid the vast majority of all powerful people and decision makers don&#x27;t even read was some decisive factor. Now consider the total and complete opposition of the BBC, the Guardian, the Economist, the Financial Times, the Times, the Civil Service, dominant factions in both political factions, etc.<p>To say Brexit wasn&#x27;t organic is to innuendo into existence some vast but vague conspiracy. &quot;Obviously&quot; it wasn&#x27;t Russia you say, but it had to be <i>someone</i> right? Isn&#x27;t this the same sort of rhetoric that has lead to the Capitol just being stormed? Isn&#x27;t it far more likely that parts of the British press reported bad stories about the EU for decades simply because there were bad stories to report, as you&#x27;d expect there to be? And reporting stories about governments is the sort of thing a free press is supposed to do?')
