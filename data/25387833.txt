Item(by='joshwoodcock', descendants=1, kids=[25388246], score=1, time=1607705706, title='Elasticsearch as Primary Database', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='Having gone through the product development lifecycle several times, I find that at some point in you almost always end up needing to search data in your database. In the cases where we started out with a traditional document store db like mongodb when we tried to start implementing search capabilities mongo performed very poorly. Innevitably we had to use a multi-database approach where via event sourcing we would store data in 2 databases and took a lot of time away from building new features.<p>I am  just starting a new product and wanted to know what you think about just using eleasticsearch as a document db from day 1, seeing as how it can perform just well for normal key&#x2F;value pair lookups and very well for the innevitable search features we&#x27;ll want later down the road. I&#x27;m interested to hear your thoughts overall on working with elasticsearch from a developer&#x27;s point of view, eg, ease of use, tooling, sdk support, etc.')
