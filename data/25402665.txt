I really like the idea of &quot;paid open-source&quot;, where someone creates a software product and you pay a small license fee to self-host it. This way you still have full control over the software, very low costs but the product is still externally maintained so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it breaking. The only thing you have to maintain are the servers, but with all the VPS and managed cloud platforms out there, running a server, backing it up or monitoring it is done in a few clicks.<p>The biggest selling points of such a distribution system should be:<p>1) It&#x27;s REALLY easy to set-up, no technical knowledge required.<p>2) It doesn&#x27;t require any type of maintenance (eg. can run perfectly at least one year without changing anything, this means that the software should allow for OTA updates).<p>3) It is a lot (10x) cheaper than a SaaS alternative.')
