Having interactions between a US company and UK citizen be beholden to EU law enforcement, when neither of those countries are part of the EU just complicates things for no good reason. There are likely other complications regarding movement of data between UK, EU and US that can be simplified by applying those equivalent UK-GDRP laws on movement of data, but now just between UK and US.')
