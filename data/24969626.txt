The DSL has consistent packet loss between 4 and 6%. The only video service that could handle this level of packet loss well was Amazon Prime. Netflix couldn&#x27;t even load its browse screen until the past two weeks, where something changed, and suddenly Netflix could handle the high packet loss as well as Amazon Prime.<p>Thank you to the engineers and developers!')
