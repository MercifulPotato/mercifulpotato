Employers tell us literally every day they want students who truly understand the development and release cycle, and work on teams. We created a mentor&#x2F;mentee program where every student has a chance to do that, and the result of that program so clearly creates better outcomes that employers ask specifically for students who have done that.<p>One thing that jumps out at me is that students who have only just gone through the course themselves may not make the best mentors. They top x% percent probably make excellent mentors, but they rest still don&#x27;t really know what they&#x27;re doing themselves. You may want to actually build in some kind of assessment here and have mentoring as a &quot;high performance track&quot; (ideally with this being something the high-performing students can put on their resumes). I&#x27;ve seen this done very successfully in traditional schools (for children).')
