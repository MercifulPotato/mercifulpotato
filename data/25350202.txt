It&#x27;s more that they exposed some new ideas at the time that, to the books credit, have been picked up and made mainstream or basic&#x2F;required knowledge for the working programmer<p>What books do you recommend though to get novice (or not so novice) programmers up to speed? IMO there is a lack of modern literature and general introductory material to the kind of wisdom you otherwise only get after decade(s) of software development (if at all, for quite a number of people).<p>A recent one I liked is “A Philosophy of Software Design”, but it only covers so much ground, and some of its advice requires further qualification.')
