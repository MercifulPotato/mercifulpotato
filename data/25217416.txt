Google&#x27;s privacy policy affects most of the internet, aka, most of the world. The NYT&#x27;s privacy policy affects the significantly smaller (and comparatively insignificant) number of people who read the NYT on its website.<p>#3 The adjustments (aka corrections) were not silent. They announced them, and the big corrections even got their own NYT articles, see e.g., <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;11&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;an-update-to-the-1619-project.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;11&#x2F;magazine&#x2F;an-update-to-the...</a>.<p>#4 NYT published the identities of Slate Star Codex because it was newsworthy. The identities of the Chapo House Guys was not, because they were, and this part is crucial: open about their identities. Both of these blogs spread ideological filth, but the CHG didn&#x27;t cower behind anonymity to do it like the SSC guy did.<p>#5 This is not submarine propaganda. CP exists on the dark web, and in fact the use of the dark web to spread CP is why so many Tor nodes chose to shut down. (This is also unrelated to putting mandatory backdoors in E2E messaging, which the NYT...opposes...)<p>#6 The federal government lied about the weapons...not the NYT...And WMDs did exist. Iraq still had a very large stockpile of chemical weapons when we invaded (during Bush II). They simply were intended for use against the local population, not the U.S. (See a non-NYT source: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;10&#x2F;twelve-years-later-u-s-media-still-cant-get-iraqi-wmd-story-right&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;theintercept.com&#x2F;2015&#x2F;04&#x2F;10&#x2F;twelve-years-later-u-s-m...</a>)')
