The problem is that the likelihood of being arrested&#x2F;convicted is a complex system whereby no one single factor can affect it.<p>Especially last year you had several huge sociological factors that likely played into this: social reactions to BLM, riots, domestic terrorism, record high unemployment, mental health contributions due to stay-home regulations, <i>AND</i> defunding of the police.<p>To pretend that one factor is the only contributing factor to a complex system is a fool&#x27;s errand.')
