I doubt it. OP still has a more valid point. Public trust in the vaccine and its apparent effectiveness ASAP after the vaccination campaign begins will be gigantic factors in its success.<p>We all know that a hard lockdown brings down the new-infection numbers WEEKS after beginning the lockdown, yet there are still a lot of people on Twitter, YT and at demonstrations (at least here in Germany) where folks are angry that the lockdown doesn&#x27;t work 2 DAYS after its beginning.<p>The amount of truly wary&#x2F;ignorant people out there is around 5-15% of the entire population in Germany and handing out a 63%-effective vaccine will be fuel to their bullshit stories.<p>I wish people would start taking this more seriously. We have a huge chunk of the population (5-15%) where discussions don&#x27;t work anymore because their arguments aren&#x27;t based in a common reality (e.g. &quot;viruses exist and may pose a threat&quot; is surprisingly often not a supported opinion).')
