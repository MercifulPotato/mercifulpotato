I also don&#x27;t mind when regulators say &quot;liquor stores are blocked from having one-day specials the day that welfare benefits are paid.&quot;<p>If Robinhood believes that their customers are better served by blocking certain transactions, I trust Robinhood to make that call (and suffer the goodwill or ill-will that results).')
