Those four states bypassed thier legislatures in order to change their election laws.<p>To anyone willing to invest a few hours of his time, he&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s quite obvious this election was rife with fraud.<p>What&#x27;s sad is that our officials refuse to audit the votes. What&#x27;s sad is the GOP officials in Wayne County who tried to say there was a problem were doxed and threatened. After that, no one was willing to stand up for the truth. Is there anything more important than making sure every legal vote was counted and illegal votes are discarded? They don&#x27;t want transparency. That&#x27;s the issue.')
