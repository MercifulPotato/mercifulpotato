We live in farm country and bare land loans have gone from 20% down to 25% down in the last couple of years.  You receive loans in chunks for building a custom home as the builder completes milestones.  There was a &quot;restoration&quot; loan that came with certified builders and a government mandated architect that signed off on payment to the builder as milestones were reached.  I am not sure if this type of loan is available any longer.  In my opinion it is very difficult to purchase a mini farm (less than 100 acres) and make a go of it in the south.  Some of our friends are building &quot;barn&quot; homes.  Buy the land cheaply 5-10 acres.  Have a metal barn built for less than $60k and then convert the interior to a home.  This is very popular currently in Carroll county GA (feeder to Atlanta for jobs).')
