Editing texts on a touch screen is quite miserable for me, and I get thumb cramp after sending a lot of texts. Speech-to-text is great, but I still have to edit a lot, especially when what I talk about isn&#x27;t pure English. I now carry a notepad and pen with me.<p>One thing that can be done effectively is recording. Whether it&#x27;s recording a video or audio, modern smart phone is better than cameras in terms of usability. I don&#x27;t edit on the phone though. It&#x27;s still too small a screen to be comfortable.<p>I also want to point out that not all consumption is unproductive. If you are reading&#x2F;watching videos critically, it&#x27;s a very enriching experience. You can learn a new recipe, analyze some music, etc.<p>Reading emails, sending important texts, making reservations, etc., especially if you are going to do it at some point anyway, are also productive.')
