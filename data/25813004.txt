It&#x27;s incredible to me that they are readily available in all the shader languages, for free. Your common gamer thinks that the game engine is responsible for the quality of graphics in a game. This is hugely untrue. The quality is largely down to how well the art assets have been authored to take advantage of PBR. And that tech is, for all practical purposes, free (in both senses of the word).<p>My only gripe with modern day graphics documentation is the huge gap in any guidance on building a well-performing rendering pipeline. There are hundreds of tutorial series that get you as far as rendering a single, lit, textured, normal mapped model. But managing multiple models, multiple lights, different types of materials, takes a very different design for resource management and is basically ignored.<p>The current situation is certainly better than it was 20, even 10, years ago. But that last, missing piece is pretty vital.')
