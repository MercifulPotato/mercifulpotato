It is similar in spirit to the quote (paraphrasing), &quot;If you&#x27;re the smartest person in the room, find another room&quot;, except substitute &quot;smartest&quot; with &quot;highest skilled&quot; perhaps.<p>Essentially, I see it as a meta-indicator, a way of making decisions in situations where I don&#x27;t have all of the information.<p>Another way to look at it would be through the lens of game theory. Game theory is absolutely a field of some consequence, and it&#x27;s all about relative positioning of agents in a system and their likely intentions after factoring in the likely intentions of their peers.<p>In a word, you might describe this type of analysis as simply, &quot;wisdom.&quot; I find it to be of particular value in entrepreneurship.')
