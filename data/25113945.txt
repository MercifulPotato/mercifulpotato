Rights not granted by the government, but recognized as inherent to being human.<p>Private parties can discriminate like this, and for better or worse air travel is essentially a private party allowing someone onto their private property, but no law can or should be enacted by the federal government allowing discrimination based off vaccination.<p>If such a state does enact a law (similar to some states prohibiting religious exemptions from school vaccination requirements), I would be surprised if it didnâ€™t end up being heard in front of the Supreme Court.
