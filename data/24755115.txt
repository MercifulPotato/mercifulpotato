Brilliant! &#x2F;&lt;sarc&gt;<p>&quot;Another study conducted in Kentucky found that detaining low- and moderate-risk defendants is strongly correlated with higher rates of new criminal activity both during the retrial period and years after case disposition. The same study found that as the length of pretrial detention increases up to 30 days, recidivism rates for low- and moderate-risk defendants also increases significantly. When held 2–3 days, for instance, low-risk defendants are almost 40 percent more likely to commit new crimes before trial than equivalent defendants held no more than 24 hours. When held 8–14 days, low-risk defendants are 51 percent more likely to commit another crime within two years after completion of their cases than equivalent defendants held no more than 24 hours.&quot;')
