There are many types of “freedom”. Is it freedom for Facebook to invade our privacy that you care about? Or do you care about allowing people to be free from privacy invasion?<p>Both freedoms cannot exist simultaneously. So are you saying that Apple should not be allowed to decide which freedom to prioritise? Despite the fact that every other comparable company is effectively on the side of Facebook?<p>Or is there some other kind of freedom you care about? You seem to say that “our freedom” is more important than our privacy, but privacy is a most fundamental type of freedom - literally, the freedom to think our own thoughts.<p>What other freedom could be more important than that?')
