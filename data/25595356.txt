Like ()s in Nim, Haskell also has a &quot;both brackets or whitespace&quot; kind of vibe.<p>But, yeah, choice lets different parts of code bases differ.  No two ways around that.  A ton of people had knee-jerk resistance to Python&#x27;s lexical style but &quot;got over it&quot; eventually.<p>There really is a lot more to Nim than just this (its generic&#x2F;template&#x2F;macro metaprogramming, user-defined operators, GC options, speed, etc.).  Many, many things can be done as libraries that would require direct compiler support in other languages.  I would encourage you to give it a try.')
