One topic became specifically heated, partly because one of the participants was the son of a notoriously corrupt politician. He hated his father, except when it came to enjoy luxuries that was paid for by the father.<p>The topic was - how to deter, scare the criminals? How to make it less viable for them to be corrupt and criminals?<p>They often commit crimes of various nature including corruption in the hope that if not them their children, family would get to reap the benefits and they make financial arrangements so that even if they are indicted and properties seized, at least a decent part of the proceeds indeed goes to the family.<p>We reached an impasse with loosely discussing that vigilante justice is the only way. But then the family, wife, kids didn&#x27;t really directly participate in the crime so how and when to punish them? For not denouncing the proceeds that was earned from the corrupt and criminal means? I mean there&#x27;s a law against aiding and abetting in crime. So would that not work here?<p>Besides, even if we proceed with the vigilante justice, where to draw the line? Is everyone supposed to be picking up arms. That would be total revolution, anarchy in other words. Part of the discussion also included how criminals, politicians intimidate and harm weaker adversaries and if society collectively starts hitting back and hard at them where it hurts - their business, family members - it could deter them. How long can they provide security to them? How often? All it needs one successful target among many. Yes, they can keep the family in a steel cage. Good for them!<p>But we did reach an agreement that they should not be left untouched. How exactly? That remained the question.')
