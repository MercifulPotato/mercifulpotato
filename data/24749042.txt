European cities don&#x27;t have the same parking space allocations that US cities have (thank god). Smaller electric cars like the Zoe are gaining ground but the vehicle market in Europe is not going to grow overall, and hasn&#x27;t grown in ages. Covid isn&#x27;t even changing it right now, and won&#x27;t be a permanent issue.<p>Also sweat never was an issue for me, when I bike to work I go at commute speed, not exercise levels.')
