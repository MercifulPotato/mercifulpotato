Smoke rises, so if there is smoke in the stairwell below me, it&#x27;s probably also in the stairwell on my floor as well, though there may be a small window where I get mislead.  Nevertheless, in America these stairwells are designed specifically to be used for evacuations, and in my city the official advice is to GTFO as quickly as you can using a stairwell the moment you hear the (building wide) alarm or if you see smoke.  So this is certainly what I would do.')
