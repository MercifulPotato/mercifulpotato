We ask the masses for their input not because we think mobs of people are particularly wise, but rather because the populace being consulted, and truly believing their votes were counted, facilities reliably peaceful transitions of power.  The social stability provided by elections perceived as legitimate is good for economic prosperity.  A legitimate election that 99% of the population doesn&#x27;t understand or trust loses this utility despite still being legitimate.  An illegitimate election which people mistakenly believe to be legitimate is actually better than a legitimate election which people don&#x27;t understand or believe.')
