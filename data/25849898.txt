The Fermi paradox relies on material (probes, colonies) and light (signals).<p>With the material explained away, the lack signals is much easier to explain in that we haven&#x27;t listened long and we can only hear very loud signals. (Or maybe advanced civs don&#x27;t use light and use gravity waves or tachyon beams or whatever, but you don&#x27;t even need to go that far.) The only way we hear a signal is if it&#x27;s:<p>1. loud (high energy) and aimed directly at us, like a tight beam<p>2. EXTREMELY LOUD and aimed everywhere, isotropically<p>1 is unlikely since they&#x27;d have to know where we are; 2 is unlikely since you&#x27;re talking about an <i>insane</i> level of energy. If it&#x27;s the case that civs don&#x27;t seem to be making Dyson spheres or harvesting whole galaxies for energy, being able to throw around that kind of power is prohibitively expensive. In both these cases, the inverse square law applies (for every unit x of distance, the light&#x27;s xÂ² less bright). Ironically, that means we&#x27;re more likely to detect signals from an improbably close civilization (like 4 light years next door, in Alpha Centuari), than from farther away -- and even then, by a chance sweep of an umodulated asteroid scanning beam[0] or something, if we happened to be paying attention at the time.<p>0: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BLC1" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;BLC1</a>')
