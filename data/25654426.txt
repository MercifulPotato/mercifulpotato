Server-side close should mostly be related to idle timeouts.<p>To achieve that, the client must have an extra thread listening for the close event, or a periodic check to purge the dead TCP connections.<p>But there&#x27;s a gotcha, some TCP connections without KEEPALIVE just timeout naturally, and FIN packets may never reach the client, you only know the connections is dead when you initiate a real request. This is when most connection pool fail apart.')
