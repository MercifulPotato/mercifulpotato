I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s their global policy, I hope it is, but they should be commended for that. That&#x27;s <i>not</i> what all suppliers of Covid vaccines do.<p>More generally regarding the Covid vaccines: I find quite extraordinary that less than 12 months after Covid-19 was first analysed we have <i>several</i> vaccines available and we also have the capacity to produce hundreds of millions of doses.\nScience + technology + capitalism is a hugely potent combination (ok, sorry that last sentence may seem political but this is what drove the development of these large scale production technologies).<p>Edit:<p>It looks like I may need to clarify my mentioning capitalism. I was referring to production capability.<p><i>Private</i> companies (not only in biotech, in every industry) have developed extremely effective and efficient ways to produce huge quantities of whatever they produce because driving down costs and increasing efficiency and quantities is how you increase profit. This is why we can now produce so many doses of Covid vaccines quickly and at relatively low cost.')
