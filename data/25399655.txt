And the overwhelmingly strong historical case for vaccines that exist doesn&#x27;t really apply that well here since it&#x27;s a pretty new approach of essentially doing gene therapy to get your own body to produce the protein that triggers the immune response. And as far as I know (and admittedly, my slightly more-than-average time spent researching this still rounds down to nothing) that technique has only been used in humans on a fairly rare disease so far. I&#x27;m definitely optimistic from the data so far. I&#x27;m more likely to get it since I know I&#x27;m done having children anyway. If I was high risk I would probably get it. But I&#x27;m not high risk. I&#x27;m also optimistic I could survive a COVID-19 infection. I&#x27;m not rushing out the door to get my hands on either to be honest.')
