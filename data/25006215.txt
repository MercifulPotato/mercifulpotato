Sounds like it might be the kind of problem that&#x27;s simple on paper but in practice requires jumping through all kinds of regulatory hoops for each new country. It does seem to be pretty common for registrars to be missing ccTLDs - .ai (for Anguilla), for example, is not supported by some registrars even though it&#x27;s popular and at a glance it&#x27;s just another ccTLD like the more widely supported .de or .ca.')
