You should already be prepared for the circumstances that your laptop gets stolen or that the actual flash chips or controllers break anyway, so if just the logic boards break you use the same recovery plan.<p>All IT professionals know that quickly restoreable external backups are really the good and proper way, but the reality is that we&#x27;re only human and most of us fall short of the ideal (just like with exercising, eating healthy, maintaining your teeth, etc).<p>Google&#x27;s approach with ChromeOS is to force you to treat the laptop storage as a cache by technical means, rather than as primary storage. iOS and Android also largely use that model. Windows and MacOS are clearly heading in the same direction, they&#x27;re just moving slower due to legacy.')
