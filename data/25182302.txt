They last on average three years. Three areas of failure:<p>(1) The black plastic hooks to the watch bands fracture. Superglue doesnt seem to last.<p>(2) The watch band tears. I duct-tape it sometimes. But that is temporary. If I have some bands left over from the other failures, I can replace it.<p>(3) In high humidity states moisture sometimes gets into the works and shorts the electronics for good.<p>Just buy another. If I see a clearance sale for $10 or less, I&#x27;ll keeps a spare. Targets doesnt seem to have casios anymore. But Walgreens and Walmarts does.')
