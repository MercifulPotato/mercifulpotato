It is an editor with plugins that give it IDE features. If that&#x27;s your goal, you can really customize vim to similar place.<p>VSCode is at the edge of an editor and an IDE though, or so is my feeling at least. I feel like the massive need for ease of use and speed clashes with the needs of power users (e.g. for Java EE or database developers), and that this push vs pull might to be the downfall of VSCode in the future (unless MS throws a pile of money and devs on the codebase).')
