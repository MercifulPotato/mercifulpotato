You can tell which people work at schools where citations count in their pay (and reviews are allowed in citation counts) by the ratio of reviews to original research papers they write.  Some schools&#x2F;govts really need to wise up.<p>I think of it as a kind of predatory or scavenger behavior. They basically steal the citations from the papers they are reviewing in return for a small effort in helping us with information retrieval. We might as well just cite google and elsevier. Ideally, citations should pass through them somehow and get applied to the original sources who did the hard work.')
