Oberg and Brousseau (3) demonstrated that surgical masks did not exhibit adequate filter performance against aerosols measuring 0.9, 2.0, and 3.1 μm in diameter. Lee and colleagues (4) showed that particles 0.04 to 0.2 μm can penetrate surgical masks. The size of the SARS–CoV particle from the 2002–2004 outbreak was estimated as 0.08 to 0.14 μm (5); assuming that SARS-CoV-2 has a similar size, surgical masks are unlikely to effectively filter this virus.<p>...and that&#x27;s the least problematic part of the study.<p>The study is done on a sample size of n=4 (!!), and tests the immediate effects of masks against coughing. It does not test the longer term effect of staying in a non-ventilated room (like a mall or a train) with non-coughing (normal breating) infected people.')
