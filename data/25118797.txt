That, however, is what I called niche technology in another post, most of the research so far had focused on dynamic binary translation.<p>Furthermore, SBT, even for user mode binaries, can rarely reach the performance levels that we see with Rosetta2. There are many issues in determining what is code, where are the branch destinations in case of indirect branches, etc. What we have here is certainly a feat of engineering on its own.')
