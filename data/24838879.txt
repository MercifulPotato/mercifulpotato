Emotions and instinct kept most of our ancestors and most of the currently living animals both alive and thriving.</i><p>It&#x27;s not just that they work; they matter in and of themselves. For example, it may literally be true that I&#x27;m more likely to die from falling furniture than from terrorism, but the fact that I fear terrorism more than falling furniture is relevant on its own terms. The emotions we feel about something like terrorism are <i>real</i>. They have a direct impact on quality of life. And you&#x27;re not just going to reason people out of them. You can read me the statistics every morning, but my relative fear levels aren&#x27;t likely to change.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean we shouldn&#x27;t be educated or that we shouldn&#x27;t make an effort to control our emotions; it&#x27;s just to say that the emotions are <i>real</i> and it&#x27;s ridiculous to dismiss them as irrelevant.')
