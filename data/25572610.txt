Maps has the potential to be integrated (or better integrated) everywhere in Google&#x27;s digital estate (search, GMail, Android, even YouTube).<p>Simarly, simplifying the creation, sharing, and most of all, <i>discovery</i> of user-made maps could boost it enormously.<p>Instead, it languishes. The UX is incredibly frustrating. Just sharing a location on a map can be non-trivial.<p>Making it more difficult to build on top of maps was an incredibly bone-headed move as well.')
