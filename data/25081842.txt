Item(by='Jugurtha', descendants=None, kids=[25082027, 25081939], score=None, time=1605273577, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25081711, text='This is a pretty established distribution model often called &quot;bottom up&quot; approach, and it&#x27;s particularly relevant to enterprise sales where you allow the users to start using the software without friction [something that was proper to &quot;consumer&quot; applications] and then allow management to pay for that software, or users to pull their corporate credit card and buy what their budget allows.<p>One turn-off for us for machine learning platforms was going to the website, wanting to try the software, and then finding a button that says &quot;Schedule a demo&quot; or &quot;Schedule a sales call&quot;. I want to try the software, not talk with your salespeople. I want to create an account, or request access to a demo account without speaking with someone. Then I want to be able to pay for it without speaking to someone. I have the proverbial, and sometimes literal, credit card in my hand: let me pay.<p>That weighed on our decision to make our own platform[0], because we simply don&#x27;t like to buy things this way.<p>Again, there are differences with low-touch and high-touch software, and situations where the regulatory context or contract amounts require that at some point, people sit down together, but that&#x27;s for particular cases and clients. We made custom machine learning products for large enterprise, so we sit a lot with clients, but the word &quot;custom&quot; is there.<p>- [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ao" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ao</a>')
