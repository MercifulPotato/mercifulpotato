He also addresses how raising $1B reassured many &#x27;traditional&#x27; and &#x27;sensitive&#x27; organizations into using Slack for internal communications.<p>- [0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;iko.ai</a><p>- [1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4NbXBGjUrA0" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=4NbXBGjUrA0</a><p>- [2]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TbM1iOi33NY" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=TbM1iOi33NY</a>')
