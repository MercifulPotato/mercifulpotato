I actually think zombie corporations like Oracle,&quot;<p>This sentiment is problematic. Oracle has 130 000 employees and $40B in revenue. That&#x27;s massive.<p>They are a <i>tech</i> company, not a media company like FB.<p>They are a lynchpin, just because &#x27;we don&#x27;t like them&#x27; doesn&#x27;t make them &#x27;not&#x27; that.<p>It&#x27;s like Burning Man: everyone has their view on &#x27;what it is&#x27; but really they mean to say &#x27;what it ought to be&#x27;. What it is ... is more objective.<p>Oracle and companies like them are a huge part of what the SV is, full stop.<p>It&#x27;s &#x27;mostly&#x27; bad for SV to be losing Oracle.<p>The &#x27;Bay Exit&#x27; story is probably overblown, but it&#x27;s also very real, and less to do with &#x27;leavers&#x27; than the fact it&#x27;s just easier to do things elsewhere in the first place, at least for some kind of companies.')
