There is no shortage of highly opinionated people making angry rants and throwing out patches. That&#x27;s not going to help with the ridiculous amount of edge cases it takes to keep a desktop working.<p>Using the Linux kernel as an example, there has been a meme there for quite a long time from overworked maintainers complaining about how the BDFL model scales poorly.
