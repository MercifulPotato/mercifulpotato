Item(by='eesmith', descendants=None, kids=[25607365], score=None, time=1609530894, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25598453, text='My comment gave the reasons for why not, so I don&#x27;t know what more you want.<p>And you didn&#x27;t answer my questions: Where should a YEC get to publish their papers? If the paper isn&#x27;t accepted (because it&#x27;s contrary to all evidence and has no strong evidence to support it), do you call that decision &quot;censorship&quot;? In 100 years do you expect that we might discover the YECs are right?<p>Experience with YECs, flat-earthers, and the like show that it&#x27;s far more than &quot;a smidgen of an expert&#x27;s time&quot;. As you yourself pointed out, it requires learning a different set of rhetorical skills than are needed for a scientific paper.<p>And that takes a <i>lot</i> of time. (And it seems you have no experience in dealing with crackpots to know this.)<p>A scientist who enters a &quot;debate&quot; with a creationist, but who is not trained in the specific rhetorical techniques (eg. &quot;Gish gallop&quot;, as another commenter pointed out) is going to get trounced - because scientists aren&#x27;t trained in dealing with charlatans, and rhetorical style can trump competence.<p>As a result, charlatans gain fame for being able to out-debate a scientist. I&#x27;ll stress this point, the point of these crackpot publications and &quot;debates&quot; is <i>NOT</i> to advance science but to establish credentials as being a viable alternative.<p>So, will you answer my questions now?')
