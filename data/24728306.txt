But I will opine that it&#x27;s getting a little ridiculous how every other story these days seems to fall back to the argument that everything you don&#x27;t like must be &quot;anticompetitive&quot;.<p>You don&#x27;t have to use Facebook.  You don&#x27;t have to use VR technology.  These are all voluntary activities that people actively choose to engage in, and are not public utilities.  Feel free to walk away from either or both.<p>It&#x27;s as if people are complaining that because they bought tickets to their favorite live sports event, they were forced to pay to park their car there too.  You don&#x27;t have to do any of those things.<p>And aside from that, on the actual anticompetitive argument, does this prevent anyone from coming in to offer their own version of these technologies?  Not to my outsider&#x27;s view.<p>Just switch it off.  Don&#x27;t let it so dominate your life that you rely on it becoming a federal court case.  It&#x27;s all voluntary.  The more we participate in things that others have the opportunity to exert control over, the more it materializes.')
