Which one you prefer for writing applications that will be used and maintained over a long period of time?<p>I know Python, Common Lisp and Scheme but I find myself reaching out for Python every time I have to write a quick and dirty hack. This is due to more familiarity with Python which makes me more comfortable with Python. What are your experiences? Maybe it will convince me to go all in and use Lisp all the time. :-)')
