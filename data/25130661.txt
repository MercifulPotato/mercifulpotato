But 4266 is within the range of overclocking on desktop systems and only a few percent faster than the fastest SODIMMs on the market, so it&#x27;s at least somewhat useful as a point of comparison.<p>LPDDR memories are developed with more of a focus on per-pin bandwidth than standard DDR because mobile devices are more constrained on pin count and power. But Apple&#x27;s now shipping an LPDDR interface that&#x27;s just as wide as the standard for desktops, and reaping the benefits of the extra bandwidth.')
