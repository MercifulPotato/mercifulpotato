I vote in hopes of improving the signal to noise ratio. My replies rarely overlap with my downvotes.<p>If I&#x27;m taking the time to post a counterpoint, I&#x27;m usually not going to downvote the comment I&#x27;m replying to. But if somebody is posting something that I&#x27;ve seen here a dozen times before, I&#x27;m not going to write the dozenth attempted refutation. That&#x27;s just more noise.<p>The rarest combination is when I flag a comment without downvoting it. That&#x27;s when I agree with much of the spirit of the comment but it also contains a personal attack against another poster.<p>Slightly less rare: I&#x27;m reading through a comment, about to upvote it, and then the final sentence turns out to be needlessly inflammatory. Or it starts out inflammatory and then makes some good points. I neither upvote nor downvote these. I don&#x27;t comment on the comment style when I see these cases, because writing about style instead of the substance of the original article under discussion also worsens the SNR.')
