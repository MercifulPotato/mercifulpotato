It shortcuts the messy dirty work of dealing with IP violations, to the benefit of large corporations and the detriment of individuals. The former engage in rampant abuse of their powers under the DMCA, apparently without any fear of significant consequences. It&#x27;s just another example of the degree to which large corporations own America.')
