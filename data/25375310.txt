The general rule is CICO works for everyone. Because it does.<p>There are some &quot;cheats&quot; that you can do with macro profiles, especially with no or low carb diets (carnivore&#x2F;keto), however these solutions rarely work long term, especially in athletic circles. For non-athletes it _might_ work a little longer term but if you look at those studies (with non-athletes) they are very short lived and typically on a very specific cohort. Hormonal levels adapt over time and the initial &quot;gainz&quot; you see are relatively short lived - this is most evident in the studies done on athletes.  That and you have to stay on top of your bloodwork. In my personal experience it&#x27;s about six months. I&#x27;ve tried keto, paleo, and carnivore for fairly long periods of time (paleo is much more forgiving long term for a variety of reasons). There are most certainly diminishing returns. Unfortunately, as I said, there&#x27;s no long term studies here with large cohorts so it&#x27;s all anecdotal.')
