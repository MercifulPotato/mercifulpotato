As chaotic as the scene has been for us moderators, I&#x27;m sure they have been under much more pressure. If you know a reddit engineer, please give them your thanks as they have done a phenomenal job.<p>For those curious, the surge in activity broke a number of things. Here are just a few:<p>&gt; modmail surpassing 80,000+ messages resulting in modmail going down<p>&gt; constant threads hitting 100,000 comments resulting in slow loading site-wide<p>&gt; automoderator getting backlogged and taking 30+ minutes to parse comments leading to terrible comments getting through.<p>All these issues are now resolved, so once again, big thanks to the Reddit engineering team!')
