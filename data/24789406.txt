If you have the chance give it a shot. I think Castro was really sympathetic to the Cuban&#x27;s plight and did more for the country than many others for their own countries. Cubans are calm, educated and friendly, but poor by our own standards. But guess what? They&#x27;re not unhappy at all, depression there is almost nonexistent and contrasting that to how widespread it is in the western world it clearly shows an unsettling trend. And FYI Castro lived a modest live, he didn&#x27;t seek to own a lot of material goods like a lot of other leaders.')
