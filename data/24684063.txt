Both can be true, but when markets fail, we risk failing basic human needs and all the associated costs to society.<p>&gt; Which means instead of an orderly market, rental units are transferred based on non-monetary consideration. I don&#x27;t see how this world is better for anybody.<p>I think you should consider economics courses from different schools. Absolute market normativity <i>cannot</i> solve every problem on earth, nor always form <i>orderly</i> markets by themselves. Governments are needed to intervene on these market failures and undertake other duties that cannot be properly market-ified. By your perspective non-monetary transfers or government intervention on basic medicine, food, water or law enforcement also wouldnâ€™t make the world better for anybody.<p>The answer to a socialist utopia is not a liberalist utopia, as neither can transcend the complexity of the problem at hand alone.')
