This ball is drawn last.<p>You get 14 possible draws if the order the balls are drawn in matters (14-20 being the highest, with 20 drawn last), and 20 permutations if it does not (since any straight above 20-25 is not possible). The math is much different for drawing if the order matters though. There also would probably be some funky stuff going on for the higher straights where order doesn’t matter, since for a 20-25 straight the 20 ball must be the special ball. For a 19-24 straight either 19 or 20 must be, etc. Really you’re looking at calculating “Chance that the first five balls can create a straight with a number between 1-20, and then a 1&#x2F;20 chance that straight actually happens.”')
