I’ll give it this: I haven’t seen this pitch before.</i><p>Huh. And I actually use it as a heuristic in observing the world. That&#x27;s exactly why I wasn&#x27;t surprised by Snowden revelations.<p>And I would think this realization would be somewhat obvious by now. Anything that is within technological possibility and that can be profited off will eventually be attempted by someone. Child labor, slavery and unethical medical experimentation aren&#x27;t exceptions - they still happen, usually where someone can make money from practicing it. We don&#x27;t live in a <i>laissez-faire</i> world <i>per se</i> - regulations can make some things unprofitable and thus prevent them from happening. But regulations aren&#x27;t immutable, and can be altered... with enough money.<p>I increasingly believe that trying to treat governance and market economy as completely different is a category error.')
