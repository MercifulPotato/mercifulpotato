The domain registration is concealed, just like that of the other dubious site, cplusplus.com.<p>I don&#x27;t see any such a claim about memcpy having magic powers in the N4659 C++ draft.<p>All it says is that the underlying bytes of an object can be copied to an array of char, unsigned char, or std::byte. Then if that array is copied back into the object, the object subsequently holds its original value.<p>Anything more about memcpy comes from C by reference, and that would be about the last document on Earth to grant definedness and portability to something like this.')
