Personally, I find it very difficult in this connected world to know where my community begins and ends anymore (and thus how to manage the various social contracts I undertake).<p>Is my community my favorite subreddit, or my physical neighbors who are actively voting my rights away? Should I support my country of birth and residence in a trade war that damages my partner&#x27;s family and her country of birth? We have a duty to protect the best parts of our communities - does that mean I should or shouldn&#x27;t accept that job to work on nuclear weapons? At what point is it just to emigrate to NZ rather than stay and try to work toward solutions? My family is literally divided on this point, with several members now enjoying a covid-free existence on the south island.<p>These questions didn&#x27;t really exist 2500 years ago. The boundaries of human communities were clearer, in my view, mostly because there were hard barriers to emigration and global communication. But to your point, that doesn&#x27;t mean the fundamental principles have changed, and maybe things aren&#x27;t all that different after all!
