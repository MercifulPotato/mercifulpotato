I&#x27;m not an expert, but:<p>&gt; They don&#x27;t even need to buy up 100%. They only need to buy up 20%. Then they&#x27;re back in the situation of being under 100% shorted, and problem no longer applies.<p>They&#x27;re still in a very tough position.  Buying 20% will raise the cost of the stock further, since they&#x27;re buying it at market price which would drive up the price.  And raising the price makes maintaining the rest of their shorts more expensive.  That&#x27;s ultimately the goal - make and maintain a higher share price, which would force shorts to buy instead of continue to pay to maintain their position, which in and of itself would make the stock price grow.<p>This is also why &#x2F;r&#x2F;wsb is interested in other large but not greater than 100% short interest stocks.  They might not get squeezed as much as GME but the pressure would still result in a similar situation with lesser gains.<p>This becomes much less possible as the short interest shrinks or the lower impact you have on the share price.')
