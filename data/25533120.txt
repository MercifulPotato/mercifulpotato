Clearly having Apple give you an SDK is convenient as a developer, but for a huge segment of the market, storing randomly on &quot;someone else&#x27;s computer&quot; just isn&#x27;t an option - professionals and others that Apple tends to target.<p>With the storage framework in recent iOS versions, maybe we&#x27;ll see more apps support it? It surely can&#x27;t be too much effort, but I guess the demand is limited.')
