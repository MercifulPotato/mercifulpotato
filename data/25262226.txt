I&#x27;m asking because if you&#x27;re using btrfs without any raid features (or with simple RAID modes like 1&#x2F;0) for the past several years and it breaks, if you dig deep enough into the problem, often the hardware is found to be at fault.<p>And ext4 or xfs either don&#x27;t find corruption at all (if it&#x27;s data corruption), or have better error recovery if the FS&#x27;s own metadata got trashed (which is a strong argument in favor of them, I agree, but I wouldn&#x27;t trust such a filesystem anyway and would restore from backups right away).<p>Edit: it&#x27;s a strong argument for storing data on them which is checksummed by some higher component in your software stack, like the database. Otherwise, you&#x27;re just asking for silent data bitrot.')
