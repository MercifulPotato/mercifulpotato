Or how Amazon is going to invest in their Elastic fork now. Or how Linux is funded by dozens of companies (IBM, RedHat, Oracle...)<p>Or pretty much any programming language: I haven&#x27;t seen a programming language that&#x27;s not truly Open Source (as in the compiler&#x2F;interpreter + API) for decades.<p>The kind of software where it&#x27;s not going to work is where it&#x27;s solving a business need for companies that are not software companies: but Open Source isn&#x27;t common in those fields anyway.')
