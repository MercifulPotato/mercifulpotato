Moved back last October due to the arrival a new child and desire to be close to family&#x2F;cheap housing.<p>Sold the house 10 months later and I’m already back in Seattle. Whatever idealized version of Michigan I had in my brain was not there when I got there. Couldn’t stand the culture, weather, or evangelicalism.<p>It is cheap though. Not so much if you want to live anywhere remotely desireable however. Homes in our neighborhood were going for over 400k. At that price I’m going to live where I want to live instead.')
