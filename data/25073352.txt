My scroll wheel regularly gets &quot;clogged up&quot; too, becoming unresponsive for 5-10 seconds, then dumping out all of my buffered scroll data at once in a furious explosion of scrolling. It&#x27;s quite frustrating, and I&#x27;ve been looking forward to a fresh install of Big Sur to hopefully flush out whatever gremlins have been gunking things up.')
