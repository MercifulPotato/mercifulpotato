Why would Fauci&#x27;s criticism of the Trump administration be relevant here? If this were just a fun anecdote about a newly widely-known government worker then it&#x27;d be one thing. But the other material in the article makes it... suspect.<p>417,000 hardly seems outrageous or compromising, especially after a <i>fifty year career</i> in government service across many different red and blue administrations. Compare that salary to a CEO of a major hospital network, for example.')
