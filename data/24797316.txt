But the last part &quot;<i>Communication: SPI, I2C, CAN-bus, ethernet should be sufficient. A ZigBee like protocol would also be highly useful.</i>&quot; made me think why?<p>Especially Ethernet. When you are bootstrapping, why emulate what became standard for arbitrary reasons which don&#x27;t necessarily apply for the situation requiring a reboot?<p>Maybe something like <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ARCNET" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;ARCNET</a> would be simpler to implement, while covering much of the needed&#x2F;wanted functionality?<p>Otherwise thumbs up for going along with CollapseOS and FORTH :)<p>One last nag: Why no GUI? There was GEOS, for instance.\nAnd I know of some others for 8-Bit machines, meanwhile created by retro-computing enthusiasts.<p>edit: couldn&#x27;t stop thinking... because I don&#x27;t get the obsession with VI-like&#x2F;Emacsen on such systems when I remembered QEdit on MS-DOS ( <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_SemWare_Editor" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;The_SemWare_Editor</a> )<p>Also, while I&#x27;m at it, and we are talking about low-end HW\nand FORTH, why not consider something like the <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Canon_Cat" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Canon_Cat</a><p>I mean, when the road ends, why not take the other roads not  taken? :)')
