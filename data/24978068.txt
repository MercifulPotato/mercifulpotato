Unfortunately, I think this is also what people would expect from Docker support - the ability to pull arbitrary images.<p>This is really an important point, MS failed to get WSL1 good enough so WSL2 was just a plain Linux kernel being virtualized. Maybe running a some partially virtualized linux kernel(Linux already has modes for this?) via bhyve relying on a host FreeBSD filesystem (using the already developed layering) might be an feasible approach that requires less Linux API chasing while retaining the &quot;native&quot; FS advantage at the expense of some extra memory (bhyve) ?')
