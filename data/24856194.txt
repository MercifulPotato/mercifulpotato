Take the UK:<p>UK unemployment &#x27;benefits&#x27; are around $100&#x2F;week regardless of previous salary (so low compared to housing costs in many areas that it is almost pointless). US state unemployment benefits tend to be a lot higher than that.<p>UK pensions are low - around $10,000&#x2F;yr, again regardless of salary. US Social Security pensions are vastly higher.')
