An example:<p>$Employer gives you a form to fill out with your disabilities and their Employer ID#.\nYou fill out the form (if you get hired) and send it to $GovernmentAgency yourself.\n$Employer lets $GovernmentAgency know that they hired you.\n$GovernmentAgency gives a quarterly statement to $Employer without any specific information tied to individuals.<p>Same thing with race, sex, age, and all the other affirmative action qualifiers. These are really things that employers should not know or care about in the hiring process.<p>As it is, don&#x27;t feel bad about lying on the forms with stuff like this. The system is rigged against you, don&#x27;t give them any more ground if you don&#x27;t have to.')
