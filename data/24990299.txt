It doesn&#x27;t come out of the profit margins, of which there are virtually none since the market is so competitive. It instead manifests as price increases.<p>&gt; Uber could either burn even more secondary-offering cash to pay for it, or charge to passengers what that ride costs. Only people who hire private drivers with Uber would pay those costs, not &quot;everyone&quot; in a flat way. People who ride Uber more would pay more.<p>Yes, and people who ride UberX aren&#x27;t billionaires. They&#x27;re white collar workers, families, even other Uber drivers. And it isn&#x27;t just Uber rides, it&#x27;s also UberEats. Food delivery isn&#x27;t just used by the uber-rich. If you&#x27;re in the middle tax bracket in America and don&#x27;t own a car, odds are that you&#x27;ve used ridesharing at least once. If you&#x27;re in that same cohort, odds are you&#x27;ve ordered food or groceries on one of these platforms, especially during the pandemic.')
