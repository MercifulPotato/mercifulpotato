Which gets worse when the majority actually assumes that. Its then enough to just assume that a majority opinion exists to actually create one. That leads to the &quot;first&quot; or the &quot;loudest&quot; opinion to become the majority opinion without even consider any evidences.\nYou realize that the majority is often wrong every time you really really know stuff about something.')
