Second thing to remember is that orwell worked as a propagandist for the british government. Though I&#x27;m a fan of orwell&#x27;s work, he isn&#x27;t above criticism and much of his works are propaganda.<p>&gt; Nearly all western thought since the last war, certainly all ‘progressive’ thought, has assumed tacitly that human beings desire nothing beyond ease, security and avoidance of pain.<p>Is that why nearly all of the west heavily militarized in between the world wars?<p>&gt; they also, at least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not to mention drums, flags and loyalty-parades.<p>Hitler didn&#x27;t invent this idea. It&#x27;s been around forever. It&#x27;s rather shocking coming from a brit when his nation was brutalizing much of the world. Where they were taught to worship and sacrifice for their queen, country, etc. Isn&#x27;t one of Churchill&#x27;s most famous speech about &quot;struggle and sacrifice&quot;.<p>&gt; However they may be as economic theories, Fascism and Nazism are psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of life.<p>Both fascism&#x2F;nazism were a hedonistic conception of life. It was the idea of stealing other people&#x27;s wealth and revel in the hedonistic lifestyle it would buy. As a brit, he of all people should know about stealing other people&#x27;s wealth and leading a hedonistic life.<p>&gt; The same is probably true of Stalin’s militarised version of Socialism.<p>More nonsense. Stalin&#x27;s russia couldn&#x27;t exist without militarization because it would have been invaded. Is it also true of britain&#x27;s militarized capitalism?<p>It seems like we attribute to hitler and the nazis everything we don&#x27;t like about ourselves or are embarrassed about. I know in america, it&#x27;s become our national pasttime in the past few decades. Everything he wrote applies just as much to britain and its empire as it does to hitler and the nazis.')
