(e.g. this is why california is so up tight about getting your car &quot;smogged&quot;)<p>There is a debate that needs to be had regarding how the power of big tech flies in the face of the 1st amendment when it comes to how internal bias can harm the public in the same sense that somebody yelling &quot;fire&quot; in a crowded theater can cause trouble.<p>But this doesn&#x27;t fall under antitrust and I think distracting the real issue with this kind of lawsuit is just another way for Washington to feint like they are &quot;actively&quot; trying to do something about the problem while in reality allowing for the problem to persist into the long term future.')
