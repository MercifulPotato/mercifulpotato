With everything-as-a-Service, minimalism being trendy (a form of consumerism as a lifestyle), ever shrinking buffers in supply chains, ever shrinking apartments - soon we won&#x27;t be collecting money on accounts, we&#x27;ll be paid in and paying with <i>securities</i>. Your position at ACME will entitle you to 100 units of payment, which you&#x27;ll allocate to different services.<p>(Note I said 100 units, not 100 units over time - since even now, people tend to get paid monthly, and subscriptions tend to bill monthly, it&#x27;s only natural to factor out time from the equation...)')
