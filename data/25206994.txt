Item(by='01100011', descendants=None, kids=[25209860], score=None, time=1606292071, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25206286, text='At my current company, as an employee, I have 4 people I could call &#x27;manager&#x27; and I&#x27;m not even talking about higher level managers and VPs.<p>I agree that being a 1099 hired gun can spare you from a lot of politics. It&#x27;s nice to have a list of tasks the customer wants, bang them out, and walk away with a satisfied customer and a pile of money.<p>That said, I spent over half my career at two companies which did everything from staff augmentation to full product development.  In my experience I did not detect a level of politics comparable to that at a large valley company.  Granted, those companies were outside the valley and owned&#x2F;run by a very smart, personable, experienced leader&#x2F;engineer&#x2F;salesman.  It helps to do the investigative work up front and define success criteria in the initial statement of work.  A lot of customers balk at paying for the upfront work, but it was a pretty firm requirement when you wanted us to take on a project.  I was lucky to get hired into a design services firm early on and benefitted from the wisdom of a building full of independent contractors working for an engineering for hire company.<p>But, like I was getting at originally, I think it varies.  There are some types of work that are hard to scope initially or where the customer exhibits child-like behavior.  If you can, you can learn to identify those situations and avoid them.  It helps when employment is tight and you can turn down work.')
