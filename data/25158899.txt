They&#x27;re writing for the people who will look at it and exclaim, &quot;oh, how beautiful deep and profound this Science is&quot;.<p>Myself, I look at science articles with questions that boil down to &quot;how can we make use of it to build something cool?&quot;. I look for explanations, even coarse, of what&#x27;s going on - what are the critical conditions that need to be preserved for the phenomenon to appear? What are the hard constraints? So yeah, I prefer less artistic but confusing analogies.')
