Had I actually watched cable TV latterly sufficient to justify what I was paying for it, I&#x27;d have had very little reason to switch to YouTube TV or whatever. The content is pretty comparable and the issue for me was that I just wasn&#x27;t watching it <i>nearly</i> as much as other services that cost a lot less. I still wish I had live TV now and then but not enough to pay for it.<p>I was actually pleasantly surprised that when I canceled cable TV and my landline from Comcast they didn&#x27;t even put up a mild fight. (I still have Internet from them.)')
