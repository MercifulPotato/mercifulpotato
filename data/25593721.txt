It is confusing to me that this isn&#x27;t the #1 goal of environmentalists right now.<p>When will those technologies be invented? How long will it take to get them to be used globally? It feels like every few years we&#x27;re given a new cutoff date for a serious course correction to prevent massive, irreparable climate change from occurring. Do we have enough time? Why do we seemingly prioritize the development of third world economies over climate action?')
