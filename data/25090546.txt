I don&#x27;t believe this has ever happened. I don&#x27;t think even the hardest-core anti-DRM people I&#x27;ve ever known would simply refuse to watch a movie they think they would like on these grounds.<p>For example, Firefox refusing to support DRM would have been completely ineffective because essentially all users, on encountering video they want to watch that requires such DRM, would simply switch to Chrome to view that video.')
