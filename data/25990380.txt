Item(by='peferron', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1612198379, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25987071, text='&gt; I find it quite telling that you are surprised Greeks might be considered anything but white, while not showing any surprise about Turks. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any difference in skin color, so that confirms my suspicion that &quot;whiteness&quot; isn&#x27;t just about looks.<p>There are many more people of Greek descent than of Turkish descent in the USA. It&#x27;s very possible that the person you replied to is simply not familiar enough with people of Turkish descent to express surprise at your claim.')
