Neuromancer was the dream of the future everyone had, once. But it&#x27;s just a &quot;what&quot; a manipulation if you will. Gernsback Continuum shows the depth of his insight it&#x27;s a &quot;why&quot; and &quot;how&quot; something way more timeless. No surprise it becomes more relevant than his other work as time goes by. It&#x27;s kind of sad, to me at least it shows he could have written something way more serious but chose fame and glory during his lifetime instead of shot at immortality so to speak. Really really effing sad...')
