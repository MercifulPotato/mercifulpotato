Item(by='tasty_freeze', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604448694, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24985339, text='I have a brother MFC-J6520DW scanner&#x2F;printer. It is inexpensive and I bought it mainly for its large format scanning capability.<p>Problem #1: I don&#x27;t use it much. But every night (or two?) it does a self cleaning cycle which uses up some ink apparently. Despite saying the ink cartridges saying &quot;500 prints&quot;, I might actually make 50 pages before it runs out of ink after a few months.<p>Problem #2: I only ever need it for black and white, yet I have to buy expensive color cartridge sets as it refuses to print B&amp;W pages if it is out of color. And it runs out of color despite my not using it because of problem #1 above.<p>Problem #3: After it gives the ink low warning, if I ignore it for a while until it actually starts making splotchy prints, when I put the new ink cartridges in, I have to literally print dozens of test pages before the quality is acceptable again. I have no idea what is going on there. By that time the B&amp;W cartridge will report it is at 60% capacity.<p>Once this set runs out in a few months, I&#x27;ve already decided to get a monochrome laser printer, and regret not doing it long ago.')
