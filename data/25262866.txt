ZFS isn&#x27;t just a filesystem, it was developed to be an entire storage system that&#x27;s vertically integrated, so ARC is a fundamental part of the filesystem design.<p>ZFS also has a huge legacy. Right now the license (probably) prevents you from legally shipping a compiled zfs module with the linux kernel, just solving that seems insurmountable. It&#x27;s also supported on Illumos and FreeBSD, trying to refactor it to use the linux page cache would have a chance of introducing bugs to these platforms.')
