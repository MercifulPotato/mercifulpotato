Modern TV shows are cool but take too much, I wish I could watch the compressed version. After the first series the tropes become quite unpredictable and things start taking turns just because they need filler.<p>I grew up in the 80s and this show brought back some memories and filled in some gaps. I&#x27;d definitely recommend the first series.')
