I have been out of the game for a while so not sure what is currently out there, but a search for &quot;permaculture network&quot; turns up 3-4 viable candidates.<p>I didn&#x27;t mean to rain on your parade, too much, but wanted to drive home that information sharing is nice, but creating permaculture businesses is more important. It&#x27;s the same thing as a CSA directory (I ran one for about 10 years). The CSA directory is nice and scalable and easy, and helpful to end users, but the crux of the economic system is the CSA farm, actually delivering value to others.<p>To make an analogy, permaculture has too many directories and not enough farms.<p>If you haven&#x27;t, I&#x27;d suggest listening to Scott Mann&#x2F;The Permaculture Podcast, as he has lots of inspiring stories about people making a living from permaculture: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thepermaculturepodcast.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thepermaculturepodcast.com&#x2F;</a>')
