They don&#x27;t seem to have any issue doing this, as there is usually enough space between sidewalk and car lanes to not have to walk into traffic.<p>edit - If you need to take a walk through downtown Los Angeles or somewhere where it is physically impossible to social distance, then yes wear a mask.')
