The authors take the position that, based on comparisons of large populations living in DST or ST or on western versus eastern edges of time zones, the advantages of permanent ST outweigh switching to DST annually or permanently.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.sagepub.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1177&#x2F;0748730419854197" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.sagepub.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;full&#x2F;10.1177&#x2F;07487304198541...</a><p>For a longer-read, referencing quite a bit of academic literature, but a conclusionary snippet:<p>&gt; <i>In summary, the scientific literature strongly argues against the switching between DST and Standard Time and even more so against adopting DST permanently. The latter would exaggerate all the effects described above &#x2F;beyond&#x2F; the simple extension of DST from approximately 8 months&#x2F;year to 12 months&#x2F;year (depending on country) since &#x2F;body clocks&#x2F; are generally even later during winter than during the long photoperiods of summer (with DST) (Kantermann et al., 2007; Hadlow et al., 2014, 2018; Hashizaki et al., 2018). Perennial DST increases SJL prevalence even more, as described above.</i><p>* <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.frontiersin.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;10.3389&#x2F;fphys.2019.00944&#x2F;full" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.frontiersin.org&#x2F;articles&#x2F;10.3389&#x2F;fphys.2019.0094...</a>')
