Item(by='FemmeAndroid', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607954483, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25417105, text='Yeah, that&#x27;s it.  &quot;Once you begin making at least $50,000 a year, you will owe Lambda 17% of your monthly income until you reach the cap or the terms of your ISA expire.&quot;<p>So if you go from $49,999 to $50,000 you now owe them $50,000 * 0.17, or $8,500.<p>&quot;Now wait just a minute, FemmeAndroid.  If you&#x27;re just getting a raise at your current job, that won&#x27;t be covered unless you&#x27;re a web dev.&quot;<p>Now I don&#x27;t know about you, but I like doing good work, and I&#x27;m a developer at heart, even if I don&#x27;t have a fancy CS degree or even a Bootcamp diploma.  But every desk job I&#x27;ve had has ended up involving development, since I can usually help automate parts of my job.  It&#x27;s worked out well for me, and I&#x27;d imagine anyone who comes out of a bootcamp like this without a new job will at least try and leverage their coding experience to improve their current job, get a raise, or get a promotion.  Your job might not be &#x27;web developer&#x27; but your job will start to involve the skills you learned at Lambda school.<p>&#x27;You will owe payments toward your ISA if your job requires skills you learned at Lambda School, even if your title isn&#x27;t &quot;Web Developer&quot; or &quot;Data Scientist.&quot;&#x27;<p>Heck, even if you start a business, and grow it from the ground up, as soon as you make $50,000 a year, you immediately drop back down $8,500.  (They explicitly call out &#x27;Self-employed&#x27; as an eligible job on the page linked.)  Even if you just get a second job that reasonably only makes a bit of money, you fall into this trap.  (They explicitly call out &#x27;Second Job&#x27; on the page linked.)<p>You will be stuck in this catch-22 of not having an incentive to make over $50,000 unless you can make the jump to a little over $60,000 or so for 60 months.  That&#x27;s point 3 on the linked website.  &quot;[You are bound by the terms of the ISA until you pay 17% for 24 months, you pay out $30k, or...] You did not make over $4,167&#x2F;month or did not have a qualifying job, and therefore &quot;deferred&quot; your monthly payments for a total of 60 months.&quot;<p>All the above quotes come from your linked page.  I was just simplifying the facts of that very page into a fairly big problem with how it&#x27;s structured.<p>Heck, you can even see what I&#x27;m talking about by using their own calculator.  Go to <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lambdaschool.com&#x2F;isa-calculator" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;lambdaschool.com&#x2F;isa-calculator</a> and jump between making $49,500 and $50,000 a year, and you&#x27;ll see you go from owing nothing to owing nothing a month to $715 a month while only making $4,208.  That&#x27;s a huge leap.')
