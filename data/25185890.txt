Your B cells don&#x27;t care how the RNA encoding the proteins got into your cells, just what the protein looks like.<p>A caveat here is that different vaccines might use different versions or modifications of the spike protein, in which case it&#x27;s possible they wouldn&#x27;t boost each other. This feels unlikely, though, because i think that would also reduce their effectiveness against the real virus.')
