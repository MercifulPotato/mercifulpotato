Thanks for the fast and detailed reply!<p>&gt; [definition of fascism]<p>Yeah, that works. Usually I just say it&#x27;s a method of obtaining and maintaining power through populist ultranationalism, palingenetic rhetoric with a certain aesthetics, etc.<p>&gt; To be clear what I mean is that if you cause damages and there are victims of the &quot;crime&quot; then you should be held accountable.<p>Do I correctly assume that this is very similar to the libertarian idea of using&#x2F;extending tort law for as many things a possible?<p>&gt; slippery slope<p>Um, just a nitpick, but a slippery slope argument is usually a fallacy.<p>So, what I&#x27;m trying to say is that we already have limits on it. And while I think continuously extending those limits - just as Hitchens&#x27;s fire fire fire speech from 2006 argues [0] - is a noble goal, but also as other comments said it&#x27;s Twitter&#x27;s or Jack Dorsey&#x27;s freedom to not be a mouthpiece of someone. Which is interestingly the same thing as your example. Just instead of the feds trying to force you to say something it&#x27;s Trump trying to force&#x2F;coerce&#x2F;pressure Twitter to host him. (Which is basically the &quot;free association&quot; part of liberties.)<p>&gt; [decentralized accountable media]<p>I wholeheartedly agree. I&#x27;m still bitter about how instead of evolving RSS, PubSubHubBub, PingBack and stuff to something more, we just got Facebook, Twitter, WordPress and Blog Fucking Spot.<p>Yet it&#x27;s hard to deny how powerful network effects are. This sort of means every niche will have its own &quot;natural monopoly&quot;. (For example despite all its money Google was not able to seriously contest FB, nor WhatsApp. And FB was only able to contain it and Instagram by buying them.)<p>Aaaand, while I very much like Signal, it&#x27;s yet another centralized thing.<p>... and yes, I know it&#x27;s hard to make a decentralized platform. Federation is hard, spam, sybil attacks, reputation accounting. Though maybe with Bitcoin Lightning (or similar) someone could put together the right microeconomics (incentives for cooperation).<p>[0] I like his argument about how the freedom of speech is also about having the freedom to hear other&#x27;s speech. Hear criticism about oneself, and so on. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=X3Hg-Y7MugU" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=X3Hg-Y7MugU</a>')
