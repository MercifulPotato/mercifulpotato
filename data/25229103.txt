On the other hand, pure ammonia will kill you straight away if you breathe it in. Diesel is not great, but short of drinking it it won&#x27;t kill you, and it doesn&#x27;t really like exploding either. I&#x27;m not really trying to make an argument against hydrogen&#x2F;ammonia, I just find this stuff interesting.')
