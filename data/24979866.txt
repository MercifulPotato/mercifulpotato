I crashed out of my first career (with student loans in a STEM field), then learned to program at age 27. I’ve been tremendously lucky and successful in the decade since then, lived in a tiny place in SF for years (with a growing family) while working big tech, and I’m only just now at a point I can get my family into a house.<p>I’m one of the lucky ones. Learning the skills is not enough, you have to get a very good job <i>and</i> work your ass off for a decade for it to amount to enough to comfortably afford the housing, education, and healthcare for a family.<p>A generation ago getting that kind of quality job was much easier and just having the job put you in the family-supporting income range.')
