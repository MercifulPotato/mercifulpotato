The automatics of library finding is super complex and can really get in the way of package&#x2F;repo maintainers. Today, it’s probably a better idea to optimise build systems to be used by people who understand how the relevant programming language finds libraries, and not to “help end users understand how to compile their code”.<p>Autoconf often does a good job in having some “—with-libX11=some-path” but sometimes people just do weird stuff with their packages.<p>But maybe I’m just butthurt from trying to package stuff to nixos and having too many “smart build tools” fail.')
