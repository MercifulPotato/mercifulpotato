His plain language has been analyzed by qualified legal scholars and they conclude it does not meet the very high threshold of “fighting words”. [1]<p>Second, as we can clearly see, the attacks on the capital were planned well in advance of Trump’s speech and therefore could not have been incited by that speech in the first place.<p>Third, the violent protesters had already started breaching the capital while Trump was still speaking a mile away.<p>So I think there are important facts on the ground that do not support the allegation that Trump’s speech on the 6th incited a spontaneous mob.<p>I think you could argue that denial of the election result and false claims of election fraud — over many weeks and by many people including Trump — led in part to certain people to plan for violence on the 6th.<p>The people that planned and executed the violence should be charged with crimes and face a jury of their peers.<p>My understanding is that the laws against inciteful speech require the speech to result in <i>imminent</i> lawless action. If I listen to a podcast on Monday and decide to violently protest next week, the podcast would not be illegal speech.<p>[1] - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;townhall.com&#x2F;tipsheet&#x2F;katiepavlich&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;11&#x2F;democrat-law-professor-no-trump-did-not-incite-the-capitol-mob-n2582935" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;townhall.com&#x2F;tipsheet&#x2F;katiepavlich&#x2F;2021&#x2F;01&#x2F;11&#x2F;democr...</a>')
