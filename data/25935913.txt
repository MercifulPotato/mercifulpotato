Crazy to see our little project at the top of Hacker News!<p>We&#x27;re planning to introduce a lot more drugs with transparent prices later this year, cutting out monopolistic middlemen in the supply chain and alleviating pharma drug shortages, particularly for rare and orphan disease conditions.<p>We are looking for a few devs (fullstack, frontend, and backend). If anybody is interested, drop me a line at alex@costplusdrugs.com<p>In the meantime, happy to answer questions if anyone is interested!')
