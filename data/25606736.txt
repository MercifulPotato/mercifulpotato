Hiring a lawyer is never as easy, cheap, or as quick as it sounds from internet comments.<p>It&#x27;s easy to armchair quarterback these situations and talk about hypothetically lawyering up, but what&#x27;s the endgame? Suing your company won&#x27;t suddenly convert a toxic job into a happy job, regardless of the outcome. Settlements, if they ever arrive, are rarely significant enough to make a financial difference unless someone has a truly home-run protected class harassment case with hard evidence (not just verbal conversations recited from memory).<p>Good lawyers won&#x27;t take cases that don&#x27;t appear winnable from the start. However, there are plenty of bad lawyers who will happily give people false hope about their chances and then bill as much as they can get away with before the client gives up.<p>&quot;Plan B&quot; should always be to find another job ASAP, if possible. (Not easy in the author&#x27;s case).')
