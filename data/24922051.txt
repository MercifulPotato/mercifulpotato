But it also doesn&#x27;t stop the new thing from replacing the old thing.<p>Particularly if the new things happens to be genuinely better in many respects.<p>And while I can certainly understand the pain point of missing features in Wayland, The way it gets user input and display output <i>right</i> are just delightful.<p>So delightful that I actually prefer it to my work macbook, which is not something I could <i>ever</i> say about X.')
