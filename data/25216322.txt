Every subsequently called method concatenates some new regex onto the receiver and thus builds a new regex (since regular expressions are closed under concatenation).<p>Builders are used in Java* when you have an object which is invalid without passing in a bunch of parameters, but you don&#x27;t want to have to remember the order of the parameters. But this is not one of these cases.<p>There is one drawback, however: you do have to compile the regex into a FSA at some point and it wouldn&#x27;t be good to do that for every intermediate regex. So I assume that the compilation happens in the &quot;build&quot; step. They could have just called it &quot;compile&quot;, though.<p>* named parameters in constructors seem a better alternative in every language that supports them, e.g. Kotlin')
