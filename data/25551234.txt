Fuel savings are 300 tons per year from the sail. It also uses LNG fuel. In best conditions the sail can provide 20% fuel savings. In reality much less than that, but it&#x27;s a small sail compared to the size of the ship. Viking Grace is a cruiseferry, so even in full capacity it&#x27;s almost empty compared to a cargo ship.<p>Maersk Pelican (tanker): 8.2% fuel saving during the first year of operation.<p>M&#x2F;V Estraden (ro-ro cargo): 6.1% fuel saving.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.norsepower.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.norsepower.com&#x2F;</a>')
