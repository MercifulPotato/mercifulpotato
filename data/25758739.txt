For example, abridging a company&#x27;s right to not &quot;associate&quot; with minorities&#x2F;gays&#x2F;etc, i.e. their right to not serve them, is not anti-liberty. If the goal is maximizing liberty, it takes targeted regulation to achieve the maximal state. Ensuring everyone can participate in the economic and social infrastructure is a feature of maximizing liberty.')
