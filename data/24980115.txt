What about an actress or a model ? Of even an interpreter.<p>Most regular jobs are just about building, &quot;moving fast and breaking things&quot; in a competitive environment. This is usually deemed &quot;masculine&quot; so no wonder using &quot;feminine&quot; terms is less rewarded.<p>Maybe the problem is that too many people think that women (including women themselves) cant be as &quot;competitive&quot; or &quot;masculine&quot; or whatever the term than men.
