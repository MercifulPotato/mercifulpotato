Many of them got a student loan, went to college, graduated in CS and then looked for a growing job market. Their own hometown offers maybe half the salary and some don&#x27;t have any jobs at all.<p>They became rich the moment they entered the bay area. So hating on the &quot;rich techies&quot; is really misguided and will only further increase inequality.<p>Pushed out is a misnomer, really. If you have a booming housing market you should invest into more housing. These &quot;rich&quot; people will take the luxury apartments in 3 story buildings and the existing residents can keep their housing.<p>These things are not mutually incompatible. You just need to give one side what they need and they will leave you alone.')
