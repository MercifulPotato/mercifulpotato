If you want to write an app that runs across different platforms, you have to put an abstraction layer in somewhere. If it&#x27;s inside your app, it&#x27;s a maintenance headache. If it&#x27;s outside, then that becomes the platform you&#x27;re targeting.<p>&gt; adopting the Linux ABI, or even running it virtualized, instead of caring for POSIX compatibility.<p>So what happens when you want to use a feature that&#x27;s not in pure POSIX?<p>I remember that quite a lot of the ugliness and insecurity of the original OpenSSL code was attributed to having #ifdefs all over the place to deal with weird and eventually dead systems.')
