Otherwise you get huge deflation.<p>Instead, Bitcoin was designed to have a very finite amount of supply. And - shockingly - anyone trying to use it as a medium of currency would find that viewing the world through the lens of Bitcoin has been massively, hugely deflationary (meaning: the cost of a Bag Mac has fallen dramatically in terms of Bitcoin, as has your paycheck).<p>That same &#x27;feature&#x27; is what made it the darling of speculators. It&#x27;s like the feature that makes it a dysfunctional currency is also what made it successful as a tool of speculation.<p>That&#x27;s not an indictment of crypto generally - hopefully other coins that were designed to more intelligently expand supply as the demand for them increased as a medium of exchange, and these other coins would exhibit more price stability, a core requirement of a functional currency.<p>Crypto brings some great decentralized features, and its creators deserve credit for it. But combining that innovation with some understanding of monetary economics would truly unleash its potential as an alternative to state-sponsored currency.')
