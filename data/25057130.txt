You have to be advanced enough at C# to know you can do that (i.e. not a junior or outsider)<p>It&#x27;s also not clear how the config works at first glance or the implications of using a POCO on the app lifecycle.<p>An experienced coder will have to ask themselves questions like, if I store the IOptions object, will it automatically update? If I assign the POCO in startup, will it be a single object, or does startup get called for every new request? Or maybe it will get called for every thread? Or maybe if there are no requests for 10 minutes it automatically shuts down?')
