Item(by='dundarious', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605761538, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25142392, text='TL;DR I pointed at the wrong link for the &quot;no safe level&quot; claim.<p>That quotation is from the first link, the meta-analysis &quot;Moderate Alcohol Use and Reduced Mortality Risk: Systematic Error in Prospective Studies and New Hypotheses&quot;. It&#x27;s a single piece of work focused on the &quot;sick quitter&quot; phenomenon, which only shows that light or &quot;moderate&quot; consumption is at best providing no benefit, as you say. This was the main thrust of my point -- it&#x27;s not health-promoting. I did make a mistake and say that this meta-analysis justified a stronger claim though. I should have justified it using the second link.<p>The second link is an editorial, &quot;Alcohol’s evaporating health benefits: Industry lobbying and promotion are rife and unchecked by governments&quot;. It&#x27;s more of an overview of many studies and meta-analyses, and is the reference I should have given for my claim of &quot;no safe level&quot;. Choice quotation and it&#x27;s reference.<p>&gt; A recent mendelian randomisation meta-analysis further concluded that “reductions of alcohol consumption, even for light to moderate drinkers, may be beneficial for cardiovascular health.” [16]<p>&gt; [16] Holmes MV, Dale CE, Zuccolo L, Silverwood RJ, Guo Y, Ye Z, et al.
