However, this appointment was ignored by US media, for reasons we can only speculate.  While much of the administration&#x27;s response to China issues has been characterized as &quot;heavy handed&quot; by the same media, that leadership is responsible for influencing the EU to take a similar approach.  There&#x27;s much of Trump I don&#x27;t like, but I wholly approve of that administration&#x27;s actions regarding the whole of China.')
