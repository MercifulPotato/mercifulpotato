We want to block entire artists who are simply awful.<p>We don&#x27;t want you to get the song wrong and be forced to yell &quot;stop!&quot; until you shut up. We want to make it clear that not only was that the wrong song, we also never want you to ever think it could possibly be the right song.<p>We want the magic of our kids being able to play their music on demand, but without the headaches that come from kids being total assholes most of the time.<p>We want you - our voice <i>assistant</i> - to assist us, not provoke us to rage.<p>You&#x27;ve made a useful tool. You&#x27;ve made a fun gimmick. But now it&#x27;s time to make it a <i>pleasant</i> experience, because right now it just plain isn&#x27;t.')
