Do NOT use photo backups that rotate out old versions. Mirrors are not backup. If deleting or corrupting a file means it&#x27;s eventually deleted or corrupted also in all backup copies, then it&#x27;s not a good strategy.<p>Pick an off site backup system where you have enough space to store every version of every file, with infinite retention.')
