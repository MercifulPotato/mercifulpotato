That HD mapping doesn&#x27;t scale is the biggest trope in autonomous driving that I see Tesla fans repeating everywhere. Google, for example, has large scale mapping experience and their street view cars have been carrying Lidar sensors for years now. They&#x27;ve already mapped a bunch of cities in the US.<p>Tesla itself uses HD maps for things like intersections, traffic lights and so on. It&#x27;s just not at the level of detail others use it for.')
