Steph Curry of course has won MVP twice and was drafted behind the 6 players you mention, but then he was drafted next out of every other eligible player.  I&#x27;d argue that through this lens, NBA teams are really good at &quot;hiring&quot;.<p>Some teams draft for current skill, others draft for absolutely maximum possible potential, others draft for some combination of both.  Some teams are willing to risk a &quot;bust&quot; if there is the potential of ultra-elite league-best skill.  And considering that no player who has reached the MVP level has fallen further than 15th, I&#x27;d say as a whole the NBA teams are doing very well.')
