You shouldn&#x27;t need rent control to feel secure in your housing.  Rent control is a band-aid that can be helpful in areas that are essentially broken when it comes to housing.<p>Ideally we want to set policy so the situation doesn&#x27;t get so bad that rent control is necessary.  Even without rent control, you shouldn&#x27;t need to worry every year, because the housing market should be sane and there&#x27;d be no reason to expect more than a token increase in your rent.<p>Obviously the ideal is far from reality in many places.  But rent control is not a solution; it&#x27;s just a useful mitigation that papers over problems (and unfortunately often creates new ones).')
