It has been partially mentioned with the degradation of the quality of stuffs or services bought.\nAnother way to cause inflation is the increasing number of law bited and applied that owners need to comply with. Bein up to date with the legislation,etc is clearly time consuming. \nThis always comes at yhe owner&#x27;s cost  and can&#x27;t hardly \npass  to their clients ( unless you&#x27;re Amazon or Apple).\nI would recommend to read Thomas Sowel&#x27;s book and an artcile that blow my mind called &quot;being poor is expensive&quot;.\nThis shocked me as I realised how true were his statements.')
