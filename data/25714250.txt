A cheapo virtual server $5&#x2F;month with Linux can have terabytes of storage while the Internet is on at home. If you put the laptop behind a router security is not an issue. Cant beat this price. With second hand pc hardware this is essentially free storage.\nI live in bcn where domestic Internet is gigabit&#x2F;fiber to the premises and never drops. yumv.')
