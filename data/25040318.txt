Or at least I assume it was the flash...since the bootloader failed screen would loop.<p>That prompted me to buy pixel 1.  My pixel 1 became non-functional because dust got in the microphone...and no replacement parts were available.  So I got a moto g7 as an interim.<p>The pixel 3 is my wife&#x27;s.<p>The pixel 4 is my current and replaced moto g7 because it&#x27;s slow as molasses with newer android.<p>So basically all my replacements were because of a HW failure or SW slowdown.<p>This compares to my mom&#x27;s iPhone 6s that still runs snappy.  My brother had a 6 that worked fine until he replaced it for the SE recently.<p>My kids have used our ipads as skateboards across the tile and they still work fine.   I drop them regularly... No problem.<p>My experience with Google HW is that it is sub par.')
