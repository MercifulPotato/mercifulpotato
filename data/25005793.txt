Finding friends to talk shop with requires active engagement.<p>- Every European country is trying to promote itself as startup friendly, and what you are seeing from a distance is being heavily curated by government funded marketing efforts. I recently declined to take part in an marketing video because I cannot in good faith suggest people leave SF&#x2F;US unless it is for ideological reasons. Expect your company L&#x27;s valuation to be 1&#x2F;10th of what the would be back in the US. Expect to make up the private investment shortfall with hugely distracting public funding, both in terms of wasted time applying&#x2F;reporting and tangental product development. Labour laws will require you to have a _at_least_ extra 3 months of runway on hand so that you can give the mandatory notice periods.<p>-Nordic work culture gets really old really quickly if you&#x27;re a high achiever type.<p>- Nightlife is just one of those things America does  bigger and better<p>- Finally, and this is admittedly tongue in cheek, expect to be taxed to hell and back on all things fun unless it involves making babies.<p>Anyone planning a move to Europe as an entrepreneur, please take time to talk to people and understand the downsides. It&#x27;s still okay to move for ideological reasons or if europe offers a better environment than your home country. But understand a lot of what you are seeing is being promoted by marketing departments, not entrepreneurs.')
