You do not need recursion to simulate a Turing machine and Turing machines can compute every total recursive function.<p>Generally, it is easy to turn a recursive algorithm into a loop and a stack. Simulating a CPU and running compiled code is one example of running recursive programs while only using a loop.<p>I wrote a version of the Ackermann function in Brainfuck (a language with only while loops), but sadly I don&#x27;t know where I left the program.')
