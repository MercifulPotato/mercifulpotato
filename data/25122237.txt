And then later stoked the &quot;outgroup&quot; against those who attempted to apply more significant shutdowns.<p>Inaction at the beginning of a pandemic leads to an inability to contain it later.  South Korea, Vietnam, etc. shows what happens when you take it seriously <i>early</i>.<p>So, yeah, I do lay a significant chunk of unnecessary deaths on the &quot;outgroup&quot; as you call them.<p>And I&#x27;m not going to allow people like you to get away with revisionist history.')
