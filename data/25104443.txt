But it doesn&#x27;t. Like if you assume zero percent chance of dying before age 80 and 10% every year after, then your average lifespan is around 85 years. If you eat chilis then it doesn&#x27;t affect your first 80 years at all and only gives you an extra year or two after 80, so maybe 87 on average. Obviously this is a simplification but shows that eating chilis won&#x27;t automatically make you live to 125. (Assuming the headline holds, which...)')
