Item(by='WorldMaker', descendants=None, kids=[25352157, 25353716], score=None, time=1607465363, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25351258, text='While adding the problem that the AGPL is worded so poorly that <i>no one</i> knows where its virality stops (or even if copyright possibly can be bent so far enough that that virality is enforceable) and everyone is rightfully afraid of it until such time a court of law actually manages to make heads or tails of it and set a precedent. No company I&#x27;m aware of wants to be the guinea pig subject to those court costs, much less trying to explain to a judge technical implications of the license. (That includes companies using the AGPL; I&#x27;ve yet to hear of a compny willing to stake their companies on answering that second question of whether or not the virality of the license is legally enforceable in the confines of current understandings of copyright law.)')
