It adds a bit of friction, but in return I never have any issue with external displays, sleep&#x2F;wake, OS upgrades, etc.<p>&gt; Also the next gen Carbons are supposed to have a 16:10 screen.<p>Yeah, a taller screen and Tiger Lake processors will probably be a significant improvement. However, I think they&#x27;ll probably sell for close to &quot;list price&quot; when they are released (so $1500+ for a decent configuration). The build quality is a bargain at $830, not so much at $1500.')
