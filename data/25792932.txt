MagSafe is neat, but I don&#x27;t miss the $80 proprietary charger with a cable that&#x27;s fixed to the brick and will probably fail if you do anything other than leave it sitting at a desk.<p>Could this be talking about an iPhone 12 style magsafe with a large pad? Not sure how that would work, you&#x27;d have to set your computer on top of it to have enough contact area. Couldn&#x27;t go on the back of the screen (too thick), so I&#x27;m not sure where else it would be. And can it do a high enough wattage? A thin connection like the pencil charging along the side of the computer perhaps, but I&#x27;m even more skeptical of wattage with that approach, and it&#x27;d mean yet another special cable.<p>It&#x27;s certainly true that Apple has been on a big magnets kick lately. MagSafe for iPhones, Pencil charging on the iPad, the Magic Keyboard mounting, and the Apple Watch charger all come to mind.')
