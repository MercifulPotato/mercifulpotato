And then the next changes.<p>In Magit you visit the file you changed, hit `C-x g&#x27; and see all diffs. Now you can review and select hunks by hitting „s“ (stage), go to the next relevant hunk and hit „s“ again to mark for staging. And when you‘re done selecting all changes that are relevant for one ticket, you hit „c“ twice to write a commit message. And off to the modifications&#x2F; hunks regarding second ticket.<p>So how‘d you do this in command line?')
