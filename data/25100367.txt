Yeah, elections should be all those things. The problem is the follow up questions of &quot;how?&quot;, &quot;what would the unintended consequences be?&quot; and &quot;can we enforce this objectively when the situation gets murky?&quot;.<p>It seems all but impossible to stop billionaires like Koch waging public relations campaigns. If nothing else they&#x27;ll just buy entire media companies (c.f. Bezos and the Washington Post) and jump in to the fray Fox News style.<p>It is pretty likely that no-money-in-politics rules would be weaponised against smaller donators. I&#x27;m sure there are a bunch of wealthy people who would love nothing more than legal tools to shut down donation-driven groups like the Black Lives Matter website.')
