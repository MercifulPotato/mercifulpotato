Item(by='jventura', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610912851, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25812634, text='&gt; In the past, you could get tenure at community or regional colleges just by teaching. (...) But nowadays, administration has taken over, and everyone gets to fulfill the publication metric, or there won&#x27;t be tenure.<p>Completely true! I&#x27;m an adjunct teacher (meaning I have no tenure) at a non-US state college. Here, if we want tenure, we must go through a public panel when there are open vacancies, and the jury will validate certain criteria.<p>At my last attempt (to get tenure), the criteria was 50% &quot;scientific&quot; (papers, journals, projects), 30% pedagogical (teaching experience, pedagogical materials) and 20% organizational.\nAlthough I fared well in the pedagogical components, I got behind in the &quot;scientific&quot; one, as I only published 4&#x2F;5 papers (in decent venues), 1 book (in a predatory publisher) and 1 chapter of a book (in another predatory publisher)..<p>The papers (which have almost no citations =&gt; no viewers) got more points than an ebook that I have about Python programming which has 3.1k stars on github (which got zero points).<p>Just to say that teaching scores less than number of papers..')
