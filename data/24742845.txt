Also, because on a couple of occasions, I&#x27;ve had a gas pump (or dispenser?) turn off immediately if I inserted it all the way, but it would work fine if I retracted it a little bit (which made me nervous, because will it still turn off automatically in time if I do that?).<p>So how is it possible that on some pumps, this trigger system immediately disables the main valve, even when the tank is empty? My best guess is that it&#x27;s not actually contact with gas in the tank that shuts it off, but air pressure. Air pressure stays constant if I don&#x27;t insert the handle all the way, but if I do, maybe the air pressure can build up a bit?<p>So despite Cecil&#x27;s answer, I still have questions.')
