Seriously.<p>I always liked the smell of coffee but never drank it since it made my heart race and it never tasted like it smelled.<p>Now with a cheap burr grinder, a French press, a scale, and coffee beans I make great coffee. I grind the beans coarse which is for the French press method. My formula is 30g ground coffee per 450g of water, brew for 5 minutes.<p>It&#x27;s amazing how cheap coffee beans can taste great. Hints of chocolate, caramel, a toasty note.<p>If it&#x27;s too bitter you brew too much or the grind was too fine. If it&#x27;s too sour or ashy tasting it wasn&#x27;t brewed long enough (seems counter intuitive I know!).<p>I&#x27;ve gone from sugary, milk or cream loaded coffee to just black. Anything in the coffee now ruins it for me.<p>edit: related to all this talk of coffee and insulin coffee guru James Hoffman did a test of coffee and insulin. He used a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device to measure his own metabolism.')
