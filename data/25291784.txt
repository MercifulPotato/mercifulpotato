Item(by='bradlys', descendants=None, kids=[25292928], score=None, time=1607017256, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25291645, text='&gt; Is that the reality?<p>Certainly is for me. The $170k&#x2F;yr startup salary I get is certainly not enough to afford jack shit around here. Even an extra $50k&#x2F;yr wouldn&#x27;t do anything to alter my lifestyle. I couldn&#x27;t get any kind of home around here with that and I&#x27;d still be very uncomfortable renting a home on that income - as it&#x27;d be more than a third of my take home pay (lose your job? You better have a very large emergency buffer - unemployment won&#x27;t even pay a third of your monthly rent).<p>The engineers I know who stay around here are A) wealthy (bought home long before average price was past $1m or inherited one), B) rent, dual engineer income, and enjoy the renter lifestyle, C) Work at FAANG and&#x2F;or have a spouse who does and make big fucking $$$$ D) Going to move away, no plans to stay permanently.<p>There are no young people (&lt;35) moving here, working for no-name companies, and buying homes after saving for a down payment after a few years. Almost all young people I know who do such things have A) had a startup IPO or B) work at FAANG.<p>Certainly can&#x27;t make it here on a single startup salary - not even in the faintest. I&#x27;m proof of that.<p>The reason people move here is because there&#x27;s a chance (insert dumb and dumber reference) to strike rich. There&#x27;s also way more jobs here than anywhere else in the country and that&#x27;s why I moved here. I couldn&#x27;t get a job anywhere else but I somehow managed to get one here four times in a row now.')
