Most people even if they have done it, would acknowledge that it was a bad, wreck-less, often youth driven decision.<p>With COVID the spectrum of agreement on how dangerous it is, is so much more vague.  Clearly some people do not believe they&#x27;re doing anything wrong by attending a maskless party.  They may recognize that others think its wrong, but themselves truly believe that we are wrong and this is all dumb.<p>That&#x27;s what&#x27;s so fucked up about this situation.  I really don&#x27;t feel like I could guilt my friends even if I wanted to.  Despite really believing they are making the &quot;wrong&quot; decision, I also recognize that they don&#x27;t share that opinion, and that they are part of a fairly large group that shares their viewpoint.  It&#x27;s not as cut and dry as I wish it was and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s so stressful about it.')
