Got a subscription for buying something from them, and after 7 months decided to give it a go and try something less dark and gloomy. This is such a lighthearted gem, the perfect thing to watch for me right now. Not too much drama, just pure feel good stuff, donâ€™t even know how to describe it, but I love that show.')
