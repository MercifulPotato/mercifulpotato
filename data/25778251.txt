Congrats on the release.<p>Still very disappointed that macOS has not been supported since Catalina (10.15) dropped 32-bit support - from my understanding, the 32-bit architecture is deeply integrated into Wine and removing it would be a significant effort. Understandably the focus has always been on Linux, but I would still appreciate at least an update from the team on potential macOS support in the future.')
