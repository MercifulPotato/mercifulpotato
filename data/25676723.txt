Does their ISP have to not cut them off if they do?  Under a narrow reading of &quot;free speech&quot; as &quot;stuff protected by the First Amendment&quot;, obviously not (unless the ISP is run by a government entity, of course).  Under a reading of &quot;free speech&quot; as &quot;the ability of society to not have entities with overwhelming power (governments, but not only them) suppress speech they don&#x27;t like&quot;, the situation becomes more complicated.<p>And I would argue that a narrow legalistic focus on the First Amendment is not the right way to approach the problem.  The First Amendment is a means to an end, not an end to itself.  For an 18th century analogy, if a private company has the power to go around destroying all printing presses that don&#x27;t belong to them and refuses to print views it disagrees with, that is just as much a problem for free speech as if the government were doing it.   This was just not a realistic scenario in 18th century North America (unlike, say, contemporaneous India), so wasn&#x27;t a big concern for the framers of the First Amendment.<p>Is this a scenario we have to worry about now?  It&#x27;s not clear to me that it&#x27;s an imminent problem right now, but I can easily see it becoming one in the next 10-15 years.  Might be worth thinking about norms (and laws, as needed) now so we&#x27;re not playing catch-up when it does.<p>None of that has anything to do with the factually inaccurate claim about the narrow constitutional right that was made in <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25673573" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=25673573</a>')
