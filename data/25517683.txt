It runs openSUSE with no issues and plays 60fps YouTube videos smoothly.<p>My desktop machine is 2011 vintage hardware (Phenom II X6 with 16GB RAM), upgraded piecemeal to an SSD and a Radeon RX560. It plays the games I like to play (currently GTA V and Mudrunner) in 1080p on max settings and it&#x27;s obviously plenty powerful for ordinary desktop applications.<p>If a PC does eventually become too slow to be practical in daily use, then I would say it&#x27;s no longer really fit for purpose. That happened with my old Chromebook, which couldn&#x27;t even play Youtube videos smoothly after they changed the codecs. It happened with my old P4-based PC, but the person I gave it to kept using it for years for basic desktop stuff.<p>I just don&#x27;t replace stuff for the sake of upgrading, so I buy very little new stuff and keep what I have for a <i>long</i> time. I prefer spending more up front for something I know will last, and based on how much use i expect out of it. I&#x27;m not going to buy a super fancy drill, since I only need to drill holes a couple of times per year, so a basic one is fine. On the other hand, I prefer walking to get around, so I buy good quality footwear that lasts and can be repaired.')
