It happens in every comment section without fail. The consensus world moved on from the paxos vs raft battle; the user learning study happened in 2013. Seven years ago! It&#x27;s time to update our comment sections to reflect that. Here&#x27;s an excerpt from a 2015 parody blogpost:<p><i>What’s etcd?<p>-It’s an implementation of RAFT.<p>OK, so what’s Raft?<p>-It’s like Paxos.<p>Christ, how deep down this fucking rabbit hole are we going? I just want to launch an app. Sigh. Fuck, OK, deep breaths. Jesus. OK, what’s Paxos?<p>-Paxos is like this really old distributed consensus protocol from the 70s that no-one understands or uses.<p>Great, thanks for telling me about it then. And Raft is what?<p>-Since no-one understands Paxos, this guy Diego…<p>Oh, you know him?<p>-No, he works at CoreOS. Anyway, Diego built Raft for his PhD thesis cause Paxos was too hard. Wicked smart dude. And then he wrote etcd as an implementation, and Aphyr said it wasn’t shit.</i><p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;circleci.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;its-the-future&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;circleci.com&#x2F;blog&#x2F;its-the-future&#x2F;</a><p>Anyway Paxos was published in 1998.')
