What I took from this is that if you want to have a rational reaction to the data, you need to have both numbers in mind while deciding how to feel about the situation.<p>That means 1% aka 70 million dead. Which I interpret as the Uncanny Valley. 70 million is more than enough for vigorous response. But 1% will mean friction from - and for - policy makers.<p>The problem is, as virologists have told us for decades, Ebola isn&#x27;t a very effective plague because it&#x27;s too deadly, too fast.  If we don&#x27;t react to 1% mortality rate, then the end game is we select for viruses that kill 1% of us, and if the mutation rate or family for that virus is large, we get a unique variant every 5-10 years for the rest of time. If the mortality isn&#x27;t selecting for the same genotype, then that&#x27;s almost 10% of us overall, death by a dozen cuts.<p>We have to have protocols in place for reducing R. We have to have the &#x27;pump&#x27; primed for putting out fast-track vaccines. We have to have &#x27;red phone&#x27; protocols for world leaders to move faster when these situations are developing.<p>When COVID-25 comes, we&#x27;ll be either repeating this experience or blaming all of our leaders for learning nothing.')
