If my phone’s screen was 640x480 and 8-bit colour, it would still be fantastically useful.<p>The fact that 4G cellular internet is higher bandwidth than the system bus on my first Mac (Performa 5200), the fact that every image the camera takes us too large to fit into that Performa’s RAM even when it was fully upgraded, the fact that a single Netflix film takes up more storage on my phone than my Performa had in total, is an impressive feat; but I use most of the impressive technical performance to share dumb photos of weird cooking experiments [0], for the purpose of social connection with distant friends, and I could manage those connections in other ways if the tech was not there.<p>In practical terms, what I care about is the instantaneous responsiveness — the fact that the screen lights up when I lift the device, the way the system unlocks with facial recognition so I don’t have to enter a passcode, the way most apps are about a second away from use, that they auto-save, that crashes are rarer.<p>And that is because, as you say, there is no need to boot up the phone whenever you want to use it.<p>[0] e.g. <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;travellingcurious.wordpress.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;05&#x2F;greenies-recipe&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;travellingcurious.wordpress.com&#x2F;2020&#x2F;12&#x2F;05&#x2F;greenies-...</a>')
