It attracts a lot of attention, and is often spoken of as if it&#x27;s the most refined and pure and important form of art, but most artists don&#x27;t see their art that way.<p>Don&#x27;t worry about the &quot;banana on the wall&quot;. It&#x27;s the art equivalent of a reality show.<p>If you want to be interested in art, go to some galleries, talk with the people there, and ask what the art means to them. There are lots of different kinds of art and poke around until you find one that interests you.<p>And if you don&#x27;t want to be interested in art, don&#x27;t. There&#x27;s absolutely nothing wrong with that, despite the implication from some circles that there&#x27;s some kind of taste you&#x27;re failing at. Just ignore them. It&#x27;s not really the &quot;circle jerk&quot; you imagine it is, but neither is it really that important that you&#x27;re not inside this particular circle, jerking or otherwise.')
