Sure, if you choose a bad starting point, your initial samples might not be representative of the overall distribution, but if a handful of non-representative points can massively impact your result, then I&#x27;m not sure how stable your result was to begin with (how do you know there isn&#x27;t some other set of low-probability high-impact points that your sampler just missed through luck?). People tend to have a cognitive bais towards distributions looking pretty (eg not having random chains off to the side as in the article), but I&#x27;m not sure it makes a real difference.<p>That said, I do think burn in is a pretty reasonable way to find a good starting point if you don&#x27;t have existing knowledge about the distribution. From a practical standpoint, has anyone actually seen a massive difference between runs with&#x2F;without burn in? kinda curious how often it really matters')
