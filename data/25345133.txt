Item(by='acqq', descendants=None, kids=[25352389], score=None, time=1607436023, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25344484, text='Possible &quot;reduced viral load&quot; by those who are vaccinated simply doesn&#x27;t mean that that load is below the threshold which makes somebody not infectious. In practice, it could, for example, mean that if such persons spend two hours in the room with you they can still transmit the virus to you, whereas the non vaccinated person with the virus would transmit to you in 15 minutes.  So you can&#x27;t just claim that a person is 100% safe because the load is just &quot;reduced.&quot;<p>Additionally, for the immune system to respond, the infection has to happen first -- the virus has to spread through the cells of your body. We already know that the people are indeed infectious before their immune system response makes the symptoms. The delay in response has to exist even among the vaccinated people.<p>So what is sought after is a proof of sterilizing immunity, and there&#x27;s no such still. I&#x27;ve read that the UK plans to evaluate the evidence for that in the following months by tracking the people who get the vaccine, which sounds good.')
