I think metamoderation on Slashdot was ultimately redundant. The metamoderators were also the moderators. So your moderation was being moderated by the moderators that moderated the posts. The metamoderation was not really of a higher quality than the moderation, so it didn&#x27;t really add much.<p>Metamoderation <i>was</i> good at flagging grossly incompetent moderation, such as somebody seeing an ASCII swastika and upvoting it. However, as long as the community as whole is relatively healthy, that sort of poor moderation would be rendered moot anyway; such a post on Reddit would receive perhaps 98% downvotes and 2% upvotes, it&#x27;s not clear to me that preventing that tiny 2% minority from voting in the future would be demonstrably better than simply drowning them out which is what happens by default anyway.<p>Metamoderation <i>could</i> perhaps be useful if the metamoderators were guaranteed to be trusted, high-quality users.<p>Slashdot tried to do something like that; IIRC you got the opportunity to meta-mod after you were up-modded yourself, so theoretically &quot;better&quot; posters were doing the meta-modding, but in practice I think this just added an extra layer of echoes to the echo chamber.')
