Private property does the same thing, it just chooses who has power using a different metric. Somebody with a lot of property can do the same stuff, except where laws prevent them, but it&#x27;s the laws doing the protecting, not your own property<p>What you really need to avoid these issues is ways to distribute power. Anti trust, democracy, checks and balances, etc where lots of people to agree')
