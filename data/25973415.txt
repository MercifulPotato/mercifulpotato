Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see it as being of much practical use for two reasons.<p>First, with internationalization, your carefully selected label widths will be destroyed anyways. Because translated strings frequently take up more space, you should <i>always</i> be designing your interfaces with plenty of extra room&#x2F;flexibility anyways.<p>And second, with the idea of bolding on hover -- that&#x27;s really not a great UI pattern to begin with.<p>From a fundamental design point, bolder strokes require more separation between them, which is why fonts are generally slightly wider as they go bolder. These &quot;uniwidth&quot; typefaces just look uncomfortably squeezed. It&#x27;s aesthetically not a great solution.<p>Rather than bold-on-hover, better hover effects include lightening&#x2F;darkening, underlining, outlining, highlighting, inverting, etc. But if for some reason you&#x27;re absolutely determined to bold on hover, then just use some layout magic to accomodate expanding the width of the label (likely centered rather than left-aligned, if in a horizontal list) without disturbing items around it.<p>I will note, however, that fonts often ensure their numerals and certain punctuation remain the same width -- Times New Roman&#x27;s <i>letters</i> change width if bolded, but its <i>numerals</i> do not -- as it&#x27;s common to have certain rows in a financial report be bold, and you don&#x27;t want the numerals to be misaligned with non-bold lines. So numeric tabular data seems like the main use case here, really, which fonts already help take care of. (If you have lots of tabular data with letters and need bold, then you should just be using a monospaced font.)')
