But it still uses gobs of cpu to play audio and has other idiosyncracies that I have no idea how to work around. For example, I have no volume control in the GUI for the headphone port on the front of my computer, but I can control it just fine using alsamixer.  After hours of trying various suggestions I&#x27;ve just decided to control my volume from the terminal and move on with my life.')
