I find the hackiness of it amazing, as it&#x27;s mostly just an X11 framebuffer, an instance of Firefox loading the webview for the meeting, and ffmpeg capturing the framebuffer and sending it as an RTMP stream to the configured endpoint.<p>Also, AWS IVS as a streaming platform is really impressive. It&#x27;s a fully managed service, and out of the box you get around 4-5s of latency between the source and the player, with an upper limit of 1080p60 @8.5Mbps. It will also downsample the stream to 720p, 480p, 360p &amp; 160p.<p>[0]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws-samples&#x2F;amazon-chime-meeting-broadcast-demo" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;aws-samples&#x2F;amazon-chime-meeting-broadcas...</a>')
