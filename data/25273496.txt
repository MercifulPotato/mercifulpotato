When doing online commerce, it is sometimes required for the merchant to charge different tax rates depending on the location of the buyer, and then remit that tax to the corresponding government tax authority. For some countries, a reverse charge mechanism is possible, where the merchant puts the relevant tax info on the invoices and the buyer is supposed to pay the tax to their own tax authority directly. In any case, the IP address is an important piece of due-diligence evidence, which supports the merchant’s claim that the buyer is from a particular location. So if a merchant detects a VPN address, it’s not a good piece of location evidence, and so they refuse to do business outright.')
