Item(by='znpy', descendants=None, kids=[24953598], score=None, time=1604155553, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24951736, text='&gt; just to clarify, I don&#x27;t agree with the original parent comment&#x27;s comparisons to sexuality etc.<p>I have second hand experience (one of my relatives) about being dismissed for being a woman. Anectodal example (this was in the late &#x27;70s &#x2F; early &#x27;80s iirc): she was taking an exam at the university (engineering faculty) and she was told that she taking exam was nice and everything but women are really supposed to stay at home and knit socks.<p>You see, that&#x27;s the point. Yeah you might have been considered &quot;lacking&quot; and by your own admisson being late wasn&#x27;t the only reason. It&#x27;s a bummer, okay.<p>But can you, in all honesty, compare that to seeing your studies, your work or your job application or your opinion being dismissed because of your biological sex? Really?')
