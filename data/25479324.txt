The way you&#x27;ve framed it, the question does not use the word &quot;jurisdiction&quot; in a consistent manner with its definition or practice and does not address operative elements of the international legal system. The framing of the question also is also not on topic: the question about the legal basis of the challenge (all the way at the top of the thread) is a general one, and your framing here hyperfocuses on non-operative concepts (&quot;juristiction&quot;) and a single country (&quot;China&quot;). Not only have you framed the wrong question in my opinion, but the question is rhetorical, and then you also bother to provide an answer.<p>In summary I&#x27;d say your comment is not relevant to discussion about legal basis of the challenge. It contributes to a different topic not being discussed: &quot;What is your personal feeling about China?&quot; to which you&#x27;ve contributed a thinly veiled &quot;Boo China.&quot;')
