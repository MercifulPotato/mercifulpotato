Most on-line youtube downloading sites were also deplatformed a day or two before the election.<p>I think that Youtube didn&#x27;t want users to have the ability to locally save videos that they have seen during the week of the election.<p>It seems to be a greater attempt to suppress information sharing than anything specific to the copyright.<p>Youtube just wanted immediate action to prevent people from using the code to get around the online download sites that were also taken down.')
