Those are images I used for past personal projects, or testing something quickly, demo projects, iterating quickly on something etc.\nAs soon as I am done with them, I forget about them and will never invest the time to maintain them, probably no one will ever pull them either (why would you pull an undocumented `randomuser&#x2F;test-ml-my-shitty-project:latest` image?) I suspect a huge share of the 4M docker images analysed fall in that category.')
