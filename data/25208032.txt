Computer programming pays good money and often requires no higher education to acquire a job (especially when, again, higher ed can put you in debt for literal decades). It&#x27;s not a mystery why people here want to do it even if they had no interest before. You don&#x27;t have to be a genius to put 2 and 2 together and figure it out.<p>Based on living in the US and seeing many reactions similar to yours over time, I would say your &quot;problem&quot; isn&#x27;t that new people are getting into an industry. Your problem is that you need to get over yourself and grow up. Sorry the normies make it hard for you to think of yourself as an elit3 uberhax0r anymore, but nobody really cares.')
