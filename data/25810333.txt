Everyone should consider the costs and benefits of testing to arrive at a system that works for them.<p>Early on in a system design, I prefer going overboard with integration tests.<p>The architecture is hard to predict early on, so I don&#x27;t want to get paralyzed on figuring it out. Just get the tests passing without overthinking.<p>Once I find a better way to do things, I can rip apart and restructure the internals with the safety net of end to end tests.<p>I rarely write unit tests at this stage because the effort of writing and rewriting them adds friction to getting the software working and restructuring the code.<p>If every time I redraw a boundary, I need to rewrite a bunch of unit tests, I&#x27;ll be less likely to improve the code quality.')
