I&#x27;ve had clients that I&#x27;m sure are still on Java 6, CentOS 5, maybe older, and will be for years to come.<p>But the Python communities I&#x27;ve interacted with seem to care deeply about the ecosystem, updated libraries, new features. Web apps, data science, etc. Is my experience here warped? Are there people here seeing Python get used for the kind of stuff that might live as long as Cobol without moving forward with the language?')
