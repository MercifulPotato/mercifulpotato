DNA is negatively charged. Proteins bind DNA by being positively charged. When you add a lot of salt, you add a lot of ions that compete for those ionic bonds. Proteins fall of the DNA, and will eventually be denatured.<p>3) The long initial incubation in some PCR protocols is mostly a relic from old times when there weren&#x27;t any commercial extraction kits and contamination with residual RNA was a potential issue. A modern setup doesn&#x27;t need it (but many keep the step anyway because why would you remove it when it doesn&#x27;t hurt to do it anyway).')
