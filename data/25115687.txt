To monetize (sell ads), they had to be the start and end point for every customer in their search for a local business. That&#x27;s why they started harassing you to download the app or set up an account if you opened a page on your phone; to build a base of users who&#x27;d open the app first, and not a search engine or something to look up a location.<p>Now that the restaurant and personal services industry is dependent on having a positive Yelp presence, Yelp appears to be pressing their advantage further by becoming a middleman, taking a cut of every deal made on &#x27;their&#x27; platform.')
