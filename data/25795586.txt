Shitty unions, shitty companies, these are all who is in charge and how they&#x27;re governed and the transparency available.<p>Better to admit we need better operating models for unions (and that unions need to work in partnership with management to create sustainable relationships and businesses), rigorous governance and oversight of them, and that that is likely superior to the current situation of labor&#x27;s collective power to continue to erode over the last four decades. Not only does labor need a seat at the table, employee ownership should be strongly encouraged through policy (this also financially aligns incentives between management and labor, which is a good thing imho).<p>&quot;Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.&quot;')
