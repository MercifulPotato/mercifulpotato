But it takes time to find the right material, and our time is valuable. [...] The authors of these books have spent time organizing the material in a helpful way that you would otherwise need to spend.<p>This is one of the best things about books.<p>Yes, I can find all the material on the web, sometimes even all at the same site. But web writers usually cannot resist the temptation into putting in a ton of links, turning the material into a directed graph.<p>There will usually be many ways to reach a given node, some that reach it before you have read all the prerequisites.<p>There is often no good way to know if you&#x27;ve actually visited all the nodes. You might have taken a fork 10 nodes ago, and the other branch goes to places that nothing in your branch links to. Unless you remember that you need to backtrack 10 nodes and try the other fork, you miss all that.<p>I want the author to figure out what order I should visit the nodes to get everything there in a good order for learning, and then provide a way for me to effortlessly follow that order.<p>With a book, that&#x27;s easy: start at chapter 1 and read to the end. A web site could do that, but for some reason most do not.')
