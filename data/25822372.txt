Its even weaker than the single-error-correction &#x2F; double-error detection Hamming Code (discovered back in 1950s).<p>XOR-trick is your &quot;basic parity bit&quot;, and is the stuff taught to undergrads to wet your appetite for error correction codes (well... erasure correction in this case. Since XOR isn&#x27;t strong enough to actually correct an error. Only an erasure).')
