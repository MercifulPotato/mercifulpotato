Off the top of my head, a few:<p>* Getting out of the Enterprise Contract, or waiting for the year to end.\n* Training people on new software.\n* Loss of productivity. (1) Learning a new UI, processes, workflows -- both individually and organizationally. A feature or concept in &quot;Tool A&quot; may exist in a completely different form in &quot;Tool B&quot;. Or not exist, and then people need to adapt to and work around the missing feature. (2) Missing out on needed information due to the above. Ultimately, software exists to move and transform data, and when you change the software people have to adjust. Sometimes that doesn&#x27;t go great. &quot;Oh, I didn&#x27;t realize I needed to check this checkbox&quot;.<p>Another way to say this is &quot;organizational inertia&quot;, which is a fancy term that means &quot;it&#x27;s hard for people to adjust to change&quot;.<p>And you might think developers and other technical people would have an easier time of it. They (we) do, but not to the extent you may expect. I&#x27;ve been on the front lines of a handful of migrations that affected only the IT staff, and it was a long and arduous process each time.')
