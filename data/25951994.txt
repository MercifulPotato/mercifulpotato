GameStop may be able to generate revenue for a while selling used last gen systems while the current new consoles launch, but there&#x27;s nothing about their position or business model that has a strong future. Plus, I&#x27;d say their long history of horrible customer satisfaction mean they don&#x27;t have the brand loyalty for a pivot&#x2F;reboot.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unethical to short that.')
