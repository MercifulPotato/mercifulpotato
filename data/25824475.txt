I have the feeling that a few GDPR fines later they take privacy more seriously, or at least a lot more seriously than the other evil AdTech (Facebook).<p>I don&#x27;t want to defend Google, but I noticed:<p>- Google Drive is now paid (soon even for &quot;low-quality&quot; storage) a clear move away from ad-only revenue.<p>- Google has auto-delete and a clear privacy dashboard, which clearly shows what Google know about you.<p>- They have the option of disabling &quot;creapy ads&quot;.<p>A few more GDPR fines, and I think Google will become as privacy-friendly as a SaaS can be. :)')
