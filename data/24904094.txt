To post your land you must display an official sign (available in hardware stores) every 120 meters and at every corner of your land. You also need to date every sign every year and register your land as posted with your town or city. Posted land may still be accessed with the permission of the land owner. We enjoy skiing and bird watching often on our neighbors lands in this way.')
