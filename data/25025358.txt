(I think it was $10 or $20.)<p>I have a book called &quot;Ideas Generation: Tools for Being Constantly Fresh, Creative and Original&quot; by Rosemary Herceg, Tim Flattery. (2000) I will never forget reading that Rosemary Herceg had been caught repeatedly plagiarising most of her monthly magazine column from a column in another country.<p>(Now years later when I google it, hardly a single mention! Huh? She&#x27;s now apparently some kind of business&#x2F;ad guru.. I can&#x27;t help thinking she had that story erased from google. It was outrageous. She seems to have blamed a photographic memory!<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mumbrella.com.au&#x2F;crazy-photographic-memory-rose-herceg-494202" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mumbrella.com.au&#x2F;crazy-photographic-memory-rose-herc...</a> - one of the sole remaining references. The pink highlighting in the image shows the extent of the plagiarism in her articles. I didn&#x27;t forget, Rosemary.)')
