So I can continue using the proprietary file format or change it to a open one with a different reader&#x2F;writer, but same hardware.<p>&quot;proprietary device using open file format&quot; would make me be stuck with whatever format they decided to use, and stuck with the same reader&#x2F;writer. This is less helpful to me than being able to change everything in the device.')
