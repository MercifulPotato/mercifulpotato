Item(by='tempestn', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1604818997, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25023611, text='Canada feels closer to what your parent described than to what I see in the US, for one. There are of course those at the extremes who are very partisan. Although most of those identify more with US politics than Canadian it seems. But for the vast majority it&#x27;s much less of an issue than it is in the US. For one thing, most people are not members of one of our federal political parties.  Local politicians don&#x27;t even align with federal parties, nor do provincial ones in all cases. Many people will shift their vote between ideologically similar parties, especially the Liberals and NDP.<p>Basically, for myself and most people I know, we vote for the party whose platform most closely matches our own priorities and beliefs, but it&#x27;s not part of our identities in the same way.  The parties themselves are also far less polarized than in the US.  And because it&#x27;s a multi-party system, you can have minority government that actually functions by garnering support of opposition parties.  (We also effectively don&#x27;t have multiple veto points though, so generally the governing party is able to govern; I think that also helps keep things from getting overheated.) Of course, the system isn&#x27;t perfect.  For instance by virtue of being both multi-party and first past the post, the winning party usually has the vote of a minority of the population, and still generally holds a majority of seats in parliament.  But I&#x27;ve really come to appreciate it in comparison over the past few years.')
