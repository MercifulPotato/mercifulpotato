I think it was deliberate.  Worked with someone who morphed in to that, and I think he thought it was either expected or somehow a requirement for &#x27;success&#x27;.  Being volatile and yelling and copying other aspects of Jobs (and that behavior in general) is ... not great, but it&#x27;s doubly so when you&#x27;re pulling that on people who you&#x27;re not even paying.<p>Getting berated or public raked over the coals from a jackass &#x27;founder&#x27;, but you&#x27;ve got decent $ coming in - some people can justify that to themselves, at least for a while.    Expecting people to take that shit when they&#x27;re working for &#x27;equity&#x27;?  Have seen that and it&#x27;s insane.  Good thing was&#x2F;is that I&#x27;ve not seen it much, and haven&#x27;t seen those situations play out successfully.  But... the Apple&#x2F;Jobs myth was powerful on that part for a long time (probably still is?).')
