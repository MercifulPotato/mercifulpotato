It&#x27;s the contacts list as a whole I&#x27;m not willing to share; the people I&#x27;m actually talking with on it would be fine.<p>But no, we can&#x27;t have sensible things like that.<p>Showing the numbers is very silly, because WhatsApp knows the name of every person I&#x27;m talking with.  It has their name from the person at other end!  But no, it has to use the Dark Pattern(tm) of showing numbers to pressure me into sharing all my contacts, which it doesn&#x27;t actually need.')
