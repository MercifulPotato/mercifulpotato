Sometimes when it&#x27;s pretty silent, I can hear mosquito like it was in a room (with pitch varied like real mosquitoes) but it&#x27;s entirely in my head (like tinnitus, I have it sometimes when air pressure changes), I found out when I&#x27;ve tried to cover my ears and sound didn&#x27;t stop. I&#x27;ve already already learned to distinguish between real ones, imaginary ones and TIR&#x27;s on nearby road (which simetimes sound similar).')
