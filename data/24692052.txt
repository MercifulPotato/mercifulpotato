I asked them if they specifically need XLS or if they just need something that can be read by Excel. It was the latter, but they didn&#x27;t know that there was a difference. To some people, XLS == Excel. Sort of like how TLS is still being referred to as SSL - somewhere in the world there is a developer being asked to use SSL for a new project because SSL == secure.')
