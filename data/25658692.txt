Everything has to be fun and cool. I&#x27;m wondering where is this trend coming from. Is this some sort of a social response to how terrible and bleak reality seems to be? Or maybe it&#x27;s because we actually treat majority of people like little children. If one looks how the current enterprises work, the person within them have very limited decision making power and access to information. In a way that reminds me of a quote from interview with Erich Fromm[1]: &quot;It is true that one has to think first and then to act -but it&#x27;s also true that if one has no possibility of acting, one&#x27;s thinking kind of becomes empty and stupid.&quot;.<p>Any other ideas? Or maybe it&#x27;s actually not happening at all, and it&#x27;s only me who&#x27;s not getting it.<p>[1]: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hrc.contentdm.oclc.org&#x2F;digital&#x2F;collection&#x2F;p15878coll90&#x2F;id&#x2F;64&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hrc.contentdm.oclc.org&#x2F;digital&#x2F;collection&#x2F;p15878coll...</a><p>PS: OP, I don&#x27;t mean that as criticism of your product, I think it correctly identifies and addresses the need. It&#x27;s the why is it even a need part I&#x27;m curious about.')
