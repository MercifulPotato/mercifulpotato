As computers get faster, programs get more resource-hungry.<p>Some of that has tangible benefits. Screens have higher resolution, icons are much larger, spell checkers get better, emojis are added, text anti-aliasing is improved, support for perceptual color spaces ais added, video codecs get better compression, but at the price of decompression speed, etc. (often, the law of diminishing returns is harsh, but there is progress)<p>Some of it is invisible; programs grow in resource usage in exchange for a shorter time to market. Growth comes from using more resource-hungry languages, from using large libraries, and from not spending (‘wasting’) time to find performance bottlenecks.')
