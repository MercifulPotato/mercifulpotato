In fact I find that site unprofessional.  You may be thinking of someone else.  I have found plenty of primary and secondary sources, both online and in real life, to shape my beliefs.  I&#x27;m open to any evidence to the contrary but having friends or acquaintances who have fallen into adopting pitbulls only to have had them euthanized or &quot;rehomed&quot; due to issues I am unlikely to change my opinion easily.')
