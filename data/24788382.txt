Earbuds are easy to lose for two reasons: they are not attached to your ear and they spend a lot of time in your pockets or messenger bag or purse. Our earrings are at your ears, and attached to your earlobes (albeit loosely!)\n2. Earbuds&#x2F;Airpods are a social faux pas in many situations: meetings for instance.  Earrings, even statement earrings, are usually acceptable everywhere.\n3. Earbuds&#x2F;Airpods, however cool they may be, would look wrong with a party outfit when you still want to be connected, and be handsfree. An extreme example would be the Met Gala or a Red Carpet event. For us non-celebs, a dance  party. \n4. Many of us don&#x27;t like the idea of putting anything inside the ear. It&#x27;s uncomfortable. And the &quot;lint&quot; that sticks to the bud is just gross. Our earrings solve that problem.\n5. Earbuds can be dangerous by blocking all sound. Transparent mode is a solution. Open-ear (like our earrings) is a more natural solution.<p>Ultimately, there are <i>specific</i> use cases for our earrings, but even though they are specific, they are not at all uncommon.')
