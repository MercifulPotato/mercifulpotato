Item(by='retsibsi', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1607644339, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25375566, text='In Udemy&#x27;s case, I don&#x27;t think the sales devalue the product, so much as the &#x27;regular&#x27; prices are an attempt to inflate it. Semantics perhaps, but if you frame it that way then their strategy makes sense: they&#x27;re not cheapening a premium-priced product, they&#x27;re giving a premium sheen to a low-priced product.<p>The downside (setting aside questions of morality and consumer law) is that it makes them look a bit dodgy, and also they presumably have some upset full-price customers who only belatedly realise they&#x27;ve been taken for suckers.<p>Sidenote: can you get every course for $12.99? I&#x27;ve recently started using Udemy, and I&#x27;ve cottoned on to the fact that if I&#x27;m not getting 80-90% off I&#x27;m doing it wrong, but it seems that the real prices range from about $13AUD - $30AUD or so. Is there a way to routinely get the (nominally) more expensive courses at the same price as the cheaper ones?')
