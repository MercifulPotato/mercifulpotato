It’s been a PR disaster which is significant when you’re talking about persuading people to take vaccines. But from what I see:<p>- a mistake was made on standardising measurements, but a decision was made that erred on the side of caution (diluting the batch that may have had too high a dose). I can appreciate these decisions being decided based on balancing what is needed to measure efficacy vs. the number of additional people who die due to delaying the trials. In hindsight it was wrong and something apparently simple was overlooked but the decision process seemed to have integrity and be based on what was known at the time.<p>- The accidentally modified dosing trial was just tested on younger people but the improvement was the same even if you only compare it against the same age range on the original dosage. This dosage I guess needs more data which will probably be forthcoming. However the original dose efficacy of ~60% is still useful given the affordability and practicalities of distribution.<p>- the validity of the pooling of the data was approved with the regulator well before anyone knew how it would affect results<p>- However a key thing looks to be that the reduced dosing increased the vaccine’s efficacy on Asymptomatic cases from ~4% to 60% - But at this stage more data is needed because to give a confident picture. This is big news as this is the only vaccine so far with an indication of efficacy against asymptomatic.<p>Please correct if I’m  wrong in the above?<p>The paper in the lancet: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6736(20)32661-1&#x2F;fulltext" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thelancet.com&#x2F;journals&#x2F;lancet&#x2F;article&#x2F;PIIS0140-6...</a>')
