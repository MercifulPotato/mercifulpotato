Item(by='tossmeout', descendants=None, kids=[25483546, 25484296], score=None, time=1608431645, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25482731, text='The variables here are:<p>* where your boundaries lie along the spectrum from self-serving to doormat<p>* your propensity to be generous to people on the good side of your boundaries<p>I myself trend close to what you&#x27;d call a stoic. Probably out of fear of being a doormat. My boundaries are healthyish, but I don&#x27;t quite trust them. So I don&#x27;t seek out help from others, and in return I hope they don&#x27;t ask for generosity from me. Being generous without crossing my boundaries is something I have to work on.<p>I know some narcissists who can actually be quite generous. This fools them into thinking, &quot;There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m a narcissist!&quot; because they can easily recall past instances of generosity. Yet they&#x27;re still regarded by others as selfish. Their boundaries are shifted so far in their favor that they feel taxed being generous to others who most would deem worthy of generosity. And they expect sympathy, attention, and generosity in situations where most would not have that expectation.<p>These abusers often do end up ostracized, but that doesn&#x27;t always look like solitude. They become victims, upset at their crummy relationships and unable to garner sympathy from others, yet unwilling to ever point the finger at themselves. Some end up alone, yes. Others befriend other victims who they can commiserate with, but those relationships don&#x27;t last long for obvious reasons. So it&#x27;s sort of a fleeting, on-again off-again ostracism.<p>Of course I&#x27;m speaking in generalities here. Plenty of victims aren&#x27;t narcissists, etc. And I do have sympathy. Nobody <i>chooses</i> to be a narcissist. I think some people are just wired that way, or perhaps set on that course by environmental factors early in life. Either way, it&#x27;s not a choice. So I think it&#x27;s somewhat of a tragic condition.<p>My advice would be that if you&#x27;re consistently getting negative feedback about your personality traits, take it seriously. It&#x27;ll be tempting to deny and seek disconfirmation, e.g. by changing the subject, blaming your accusers, deflecting to other causes (e.g. race or gender), or running away to find people who will say nice things about you. But for all our follies, human beings are naturally pretty decent judges of character. If you&#x27;re getting consistent character feedback from lots of different people, it&#x27;s probably accurate.')
