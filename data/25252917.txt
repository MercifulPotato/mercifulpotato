In America, European accents are seen very positively - even for ESL speakers such as the French or Germans. In contrast, Asian accents are perceived far more negatively. I&#x27;ve literally met Asian colleagues who have enrolled in &quot;accent elimination&quot; classes, for this reason. It&#x27;s unfortunate that anyone should feel belittled because of their accent.')
