To the degree that I self-regulate my use, it&#x27;s more about the environment than the dollar cost. I don&#x27;t think about it every time I take a shower or turn up my thermostat.<p>The amount of online stuff from for-profit institutions I read from month to month doesn&#x27;t vary that much, and if I knew from habit what the typical range was, I think I could learn to be ok with that. But the current experience, where whenever someone links to something in a _different_ paywall than the ones I&#x27;m already in, I do have to think &quot;would it be worth it to pay for this source?&quot; and often the answer is &quot;no&quot;.')
