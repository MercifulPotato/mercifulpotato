What you think you are seeing as a whole is your hallucination based on fragmentary sensory input. Same for everything else you think you see around you.<p>Doing it without corresponding sensory input requires practice, drugs, sleep, unusual brain development, or other techniques, because hallucinating things not there is suppressed for obvious reasons. When that suppression fails, we see things not there, such as Elvis on a piece of toast.')
