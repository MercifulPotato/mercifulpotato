Let alone in more informal contexts.<p>I don&#x27;t especially like it, but it&#x27;s OK because it&#x27;s not a lie. And I do think for people who just want the gist of the concept, like readers of this piece, it&#x27;s enough and it&#x27;s not worth being fussy about it.<p>What irks me is people who use the equal sign as in T(n)=O(n log n), though. Why would a function equal a class? Set membership notation does the job just fine.')
