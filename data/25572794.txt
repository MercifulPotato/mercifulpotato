I also genuinely believe that they treat all leaks as &quot;equal,&quot; in the sense that they believe in the absolute freedom of information and are liable to (eventually) release everything that they&#x27;re given.<p>The observation is tantamount to the tragedy of the commons: give malicious actors unlimited means under an ostensibly just principle, and your principle will be monopolized for malicious ends <i>or</i> used to subvert itself.<p>But that doesn&#x27;t mean that we shouldn&#x27;t have commons, or that I want to live in a world without Wikileaks. It&#x27;s just an admonishment to be aware of a risk inherent in &quot;neutral&quot; venues.')
