You can never 100% know [...], but at least you have the opportunity to self audit.</i><p>My comment was a reply to &quot;distributing only source code and building locally for apps is important&quot;, and I pointed that reproducible builds enabled an alternative method to achieve the same without requiring everyone to rebuild from scratch (which is arguably worse from the perspective of uncertainty). And that&#x27;s all. I didn&#x27;t have anything to say on the audit question.<p>But if you want to nitpick, yes, this reply is incomplete, and to defend my comment properly, I should&#x27;ve quoted the first (and only the first sentence) from the comment which I was replying to clarify my point. On the other hand, I think it would be painful to do a full-time proofreading of every single comment I&#x27;m going to make.')
