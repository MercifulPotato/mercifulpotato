Those drugs will lose their effect. Also, the same process may be part of the pathway that removes the precursor chemicals from the bloodstream, so those build up, potentially to toxic levels; you get the overdose without even the dose.<p>Once, in Switzerland, I found a Lindt chocolate bar with dried grapefruit in it. I have never been able to find another.\nI wonder now if there are regulations about grapefruit ingredients in some countries.<p>But I really love grapefruit. Haribo makes yellow and pink grapefruit gummi candy that is getting hard to find. I would really like to know if they have fouranocoumarins in them, but don&#x27;t know of any way to find out.')
