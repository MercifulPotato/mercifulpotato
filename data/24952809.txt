Some of the ones we tested were no better than a cloth mask.  When buying KN95s, please check that they&#x27;ve been validated by the CDC&#x27;s list.<p>If it&#x27;s legitimate KN95, it probably protects at least as good as a medical mask but probably not as good as a N95.  This is because KN95s are not designed to form a complete seal so many folks will have some leakage around the edges.  This is the reason that you see many systems 3d printing molded frames to improve the KN95 fit and decrease leakage.')
