These words confer explosions, gunfire, and mass loss of life. In using these words, you are conjuring extremely violent images within the minds of your listeners. When your listeners discover the truth of the event, that the images you&#x27;ve associated with the event do not match what actually happened, your listeners feel manipulated, they feel you&#x27;re trying to deceive them, and you lose credibility.<p>2. If enough people keep parroting these particular words to describe this event, the meanings of these words become diluted. For example, prior to this event at the capitol, if you said &quot;terrorist attack&quot;, my mind would imagine men wearing balaclavas, wielding AK&#x27;s, beheading people on video, gassing villages filled with innocent families, scattering them as refugees across the globe. But now, if we accept this event at the capitol as a &quot;terrorist attack&quot;, now I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re talking about a guy smiling and waving as he holds a podium, or if you mean a Wahabbi extremist raping a Yazidi woman after putting a bullet in her son&#x27;s head.<p>Imagine this woman recounting her rape and the murder of her family, &quot;I experienced a horrific terrorist attack.&quot; And then there&#x27;s you, in referring to some guy taking a selfie at a politician&#x27;s desk, &quot;I witnessed a horrific terrorist attack.&quot;<p>Please, choose more precise, more honest words.')
