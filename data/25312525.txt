They oft even don&#x27;t know exactly what a variable is. So I doubt they boot up and run C in about 2 minutes.\nAnd man page? Terminal? What is that?<p>And if they manage after a while, they still don&#x27;t understand printf, as it already uses pointers. They don&#x27;t understand types. Etc.<p>Those are the people, who are eventually able to make a website somewhat work, but they never learned the basics. Thats why there are lots of terrible js devs around.<p>Oh and like someone else has mentioned, of course because people coming to js and insist to write js code in C style or in java style. When js is a prototype based language, requiring different methods.\n(even today when there is finally class support)')
