Item(by='TMWNN', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608412418, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25480182, text='&gt;I was once a subscriber to the NYT and am within their ideological range to enjoy most of their reporting. I feel as if since 2016 they&#x27;ve lost a lot of credibility. Their reporting feels like editorials, and their internal issues often become public. It seems like a highly political newsroom (i.e., &quot;what facts ought we to report&quot; instead of &quot;what are the facts to report&quot;). I subscribe to a more local newspaper now instead.<p>The <i>Times</i> pointed out the day after Trump&#x27;s election stunned the press (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;09&#x2F;business&#x2F;media&#x2F;media-trump-clinton.html" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nytimes.com&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;09&#x2F;business&#x2F;media&#x2F;media-trump...</a>) that<p>&gt;Whatever the election result, you’re going to hear a lot from news executives about how they need to send their reporters out into the heart of the country, to better understand its citizenry.<p>&gt;But that will miss something fundamental. Flyover country isn’t a place, it’s a state of mind — it’s in parts of Long Island and Queens, much of Staten Island, certain neighborhoods of Miami or even Chicago. And, yes, it largely — but hardly exclusively — pertains to working-class white people.<p>In other words, it isn&#x27;t just a question of <i>The New York Times</i> (and the TV networks, and pretty much all of the rest of mass media) completely ignoring the rubes out in rural Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin (which all, strangely enough, unexpectedly voted for Trump in 2016), but their ignoring the residents of <i>their own city</i>, just across one bridge.<p>(This obviously didn&#x27;t last.)')
