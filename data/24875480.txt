Processing uranium ore into sufficiently enriched U235 creates a lot of waste. That waste needs to essentially be stored (at least I&#x27;m unaware of a better option). I&#x27;m talking about UF6 centrifuge byproducts here.<p>2. Depleted uranium fuel also needs to be stored.<p>3. While running the plant needs to be properly maintained and serviced.<p>So I&#x27;m not sure the true cost of (1) and (2) is represented by fission energy costs. Maybe it is but the infrastructure around this (the NRC for inspections, storage sites, etc) needs to be accounted for.<p>I don&#x27;t trust people to do any one of these things let alone all three. Not long term and at scale.')
