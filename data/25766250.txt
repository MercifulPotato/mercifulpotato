I also think that anyone who&#x27;s ever relied on sync knows that there is a lot of value in doing it well - especially in a B2B context. It&#x27;s true that &quot;just&quot; filesystem sync isn&#x27;t a full product. The product would probably be sync-as-a-service where you can manage distribution and deduplication of resources across your systems.<p>So we have a situation where it doesn&#x27;t make sense for Google to focus on the feature, but the fact that they have the feature at all trips up specialist companies.')
