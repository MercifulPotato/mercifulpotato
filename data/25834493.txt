Item(by='baron_harkonnen', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1611070848, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25833959, text='&gt; uncontrolled power of any kind has the right to exist in our time.<p>I honestly can&#x27;t tell if this is satire or not anymore. Where do we not see this type of uncontrolled power?<p>Residents of the US live in a vast oligarchy where the elite define freedom as &quot;the ability to change which feudal lord you work for&quot;, in a system where all lords serve the same master. Our &quot;democratic&quot; government is largely a spectacle which has little impact on the day to day lives of citizens despite how terrified they are of its collapse.<p>In the united states anyone who has too deeply radical thoughts will simply be unemployable, without a means of survival, healthcare or housing. The idea that employees of a company should have a say in the practices of the company is considered highest heresy. Even the times where some sort of worker union can emerge it&#x27;s only to provided limited benefit to the workers.<p>The US has evolved a more sophisticated form of &quot;uncontrolled power&quot;, one so powerful that even stating its existence is fought with controversy. At least in traditional monarchy you can find a way to life your live largely away these power structures, &quot;heaven is high and the emperor is far away&quot;. Whereas the power structures in our own society literally mesh themselves in our flesh and minds. The best part is you cannot even question them (there&#x27;s a 50&#x2F;50 chance this very comment will be downvoted into oblivion).')
