Item(by='draw_down', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1605292700, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25084506, text='&gt; Understand that there is no point in pretending you have not made a mistake; pretending you have not made a mistake will make you look bad.<p>Look bad to whom? The interests of the public and the person who made the mistake are not necessarily aligned. Fortunately or unfortunately, sometimes not saying anything may be the best move for the person who made the mistake. Is this guide written for the benefit of those who have made a mistake, or the people who seek maximum prostration after a mistake is made?<p>In other words, maybe you don&#x27;t like reading &quot;non-apology apologies&quot;, but if it&#x27;s the best move for someone in a given scenario, then it&#x27;s what they should do. Perhaps they need to say <i>something</i> to keep their job, or avoid triggering some unsavory clause in a contract somewhere, but they don&#x27;t care about &quot;looking bad&quot; (optics). It&#x27;s certainly an unforced error to admit to more than circumstances require you to- if &quot;mistakes were made&quot; gets you where you need to go, then no point in bringing out the whole song and dance, right?')
