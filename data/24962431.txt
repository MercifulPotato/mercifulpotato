Well, actually, it was, kind of, but it was not presented like that at the time.<p>A Russian-style revolution was not the best perspective for the bourgeoisie, who wanted to keep their properties and their heads. The influence of the catholic church on this people was also huge, and the opposition of the republic to the church quite extreme (even violent sometimes). On the other hand, the plan never was to start a military dictatorship, but to restore monarchy. At that time, nobody could predict what Franco would do. Even now, we have no idea what would have happened if there had been no war or the other side had won, so it obviously was not easy to foresee it in 1936.<p>Unamuno is a good example of this. He was a republican, but initially supported the revolt because he did not agree with some actions of the government, in particular their radical anti-clericalism. But when he saw what was really going on, he fought Franco&#x27;s side (with words, as was his style) and finished his days under arrest. Wikipedia tells the story, but if someone prefer to watch it, there is a recent film: While at War.')
