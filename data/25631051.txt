A famous recent case is Carles Puigdemont who was arrested in Germany by request on the Spanish government for &quot;rebellion&quot; but a German court decided that what he did (fight for Catalan independence) isn&#x27;t a criminal offence in Germany and that he only could be indighted for misuse of public funds.<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;On 12 July 2018 the higher court in Schleswig-Holstein [Germany] confirmed that Puigdemont could not be extradited by the crime of rebellion, but may still be extradited based on charges of misuse of public funds. Puigdemont&#x27;s legal team said they would appeal any decision to extradite him. Ultimately, though, Spain dropped its European arrest warrant, ending the extradition attempt. Puigdemont was once again free to travel, and chose to return to Belgium.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carles_Puigdemont" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.m.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carles_Puigdemont</a>')
