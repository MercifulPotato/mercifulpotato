Item(by='diob', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1602625507, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24770402, text='Parental leave, vacation, healthcare, retirement, are all typically better in other developed countries.  I, like you, get paid a heck of a lot more than my friends in those countries, but if something happens to me (say I get caught up in a mass shooting or get cancer like most do) I&#x27;m going to be on my own (gofundme?).  We&#x27;re ruggedly individualistic to a fault.<p>Ultimately, I think we agree though, since you&#x27;re saying it would be a net positive.  The options you mentioned (taking unpaid PTO) are possible, but there are many employers who would then see you as unreliable (unless you&#x27;re top level in terms of skill).<p>I also think it takes a great deal of privilege to say &quot;I can negotiate so who cares&quot;.  While I agree with you that negotiation is important (it&#x27;s how I got my current salary), you should think about those who come from poorer &#x2F; less secure backgrounds.  These people often don&#x27;t want to blow their chance, so they take whatever offer comes their way.  It&#x27;s kind of a &quot;rich get richer&quot; thing, where those with confidence (growing up with a well off family, hence a safety net) are the main ones negotiating.  Do not underestimate the importance of a safety net when it comes to negotiating, even for yourself.  One thing that keeps me at my 9-5 job is knowing I need healthcare and a place to sleep with electricity (I have a lifelong genetic condition, sleep apnea, which untreated will result in my untimely death).  My family is abusive, narcissistic, and unreliable.  Being so incredibly on my own, I&#x27;m extremely risk averse.  I imagine others, who might need insulin or some other thing would be the same.<p>So ultimately, I find the &quot;just negotiate&quot; line to be at best naive, at worst unempathetic.')
