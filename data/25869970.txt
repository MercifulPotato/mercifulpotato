When I looked up the name of a local therapist here, expecting to get a website of their practice, I found their Swedish personal number, private phone number and address <i>as the first search result</i>. Out of curiosity, I then tried looking up the names of the other therapists in her practice. Same issue. Apparently the government freely shares this kind of personal information unless you explicitly opt out! I emailed the them (through the practice website) that this surprised me and would never fly in my home country. Obviously, those therapists did not want me after that.')
