Item(by='ycombobreaker', descendants=None, kids=[25978542, 25977649, 25974547], score=None, time=1612051856, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25973185, text='Everything I can find online about this &quot;ladder short attack&quot; points to the GME activity.  Does anybody have any explanation for this that predates the last week?  This is not the first short squeeze, nor the first outage for retail traders during a volatile period.  The only explanation I see on reddit refers to hedge funds lowering their bids, which isn&#x27;t sufficient to explain the market actually dropping (there were other buyers out there, and market makers).  Anyone can put in a lowball bid but it doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s far off-book.<p>What does make sense to me is that cutting off a substantial amount of retail flow would reduce buying pressure, causing <i>all</i> market participants to regain at least a little confidence in a reversion to the mean.  It just seems pretty tinfoil-hatty to me to view this as some sort of elite cabal, as if RH and Citadel were somehow the only participants who could effect price changes.')
