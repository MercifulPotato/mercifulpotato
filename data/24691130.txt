Producer&#x2F;consumer type pattern, all in software. I have one or more threads waiting to process data, and they use the WaitForSingleObject function to wait for the producer to set the event. I have tested this and found I can effectively send &gt; 100k events&#x2F;&quot;wakeups&quot; per second through this mechanism. I tested this by having two threads sequentially wake each other up in ping-pong fashion. I use this to process data coming in off SDRs, usually at rates &gt; 30MS&#x2F;s. This code runs on 10&#x27;s of thousands of PCs, I would have heard about issues by now if these worked at 1ms or greater resolution.')
