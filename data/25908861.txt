Sure, Uber was operating illegally in many places, but millions of people used these illegal services and saw nothing wrong with it. They didn’t see using an unlicensed cab company as anything bad.</i><p>People baited into purchasing new cars and screwed over car insurance sure did. But more importantly, everyone saw that the legal system in cities around the world isn&#x27;t powerful enough to deal with direct offense. We saw you can build a multi-billion dollar megacorp not on just regulatory arbitrage, but plainly illegal business - and nobody got hold accountable (except for an off driver caught without proper insurance). All of this fundamentally erodes the trust in the rule of law - the trust on which modern society stands.<p>&gt; <i>Just because something is illegal doesn’t make it morally wrong</i><p>It doesn&#x27;t, but it was illegal <i>and</i> greedy <i>and</i> exploitative, and dragged people into gig economy which arguably is itself morally questionable.<p>&gt; <i>If you want to argue that Uber destroyed trust, you can’t simply say it broke the law and call it a day, you need also to argue that the law they broke was good and desirable.</i><p>Taxi laws differ by the city. &quot;Taxi mafia&quot; was mostly a phenomenon of some places in the US; in many cities, taxis worked just well. Uber violated law almost everywhere they got, without any care for whether the law was useful or justifiable. It wasn&#x27;t some act of civil disobedience - they did it for pure profit, to undercut competition and dominate the local markets they entered.<p>&gt; <i>So, what was the evil and socially destructive thing that Uber actually did?</i><p>Now, that&#x27;s actually a topic much bigger than what I outlined above. The mischief of Uber&#x27;s sociopathic management has been well publicized and well documented over the past 5+ years. It was a recurring topic on HN for a long time, too.
