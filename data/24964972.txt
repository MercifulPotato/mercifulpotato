(in my not very frequent experience)<p>I suppose if you go inside (and that is open when you are there) - then it&#x27;s more inspiring.<p>There might be a permission slip needed to take pro photos in that area of the park - pretty sure I saw a blurb about that somewhere over the years.<p>The article says full scale replica, but I was under the impression it&#x27;s like a 1&#x2F;3 replica... to scale, but not 1:1. I could be wrong, not an expert.')
