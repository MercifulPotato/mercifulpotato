When someone consistently shows up in the bottom of the chart because they work regular hours instead of overtime, it will be demotivating, cause your employees to resent those at the bottom for not working hard enough, and will creep into performance reviews.<p>I&#x27;m in the same boat as other posters, I am a hard no on this idea and would never subject my employees to it. When you build employee-facing metrics like this, you end up judging your employees by those metrics. Build smarter metrics.<p>ETA: &quot;your company culture&quot; is dictated by things like this. So the incentive it creates in your culture is to work longer hours so you can get to the top. This is literally building company culture, and trying to say you can avoid the negative incentive by having a better culture is missing the point.')
