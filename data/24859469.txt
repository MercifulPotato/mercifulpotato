You already have an actual kernel running which you can use it to administer the machine. Why pay the performance price of a full kernel in your vm if you are only going to run one application ?<p>On bare metal however, you will probably need to bundle a ton of things if you don&#x27;t want to end up with an unmanageable device. That leaves the performance gain of compiling everything together or actually disposable devices (maybe for embedded?) as potential use cases I can envision. Is there more ?')
