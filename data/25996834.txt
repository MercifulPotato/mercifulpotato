Like if it was in my Steam library, I could play it.  Early editions just basically launched a slimmed down RDP session with Steam being started.  It was awesome.<p>Now, they put you in a weird virtual zone where your library is restricted to only the game you are currently playing.  And if that game is not allowed by the publisher, you can&#x27;t play it.  So I can&#x27;t play Slime Rancher.  I can&#x27;t play Shadows of Mordor.  And it seems like over time there is less and less there.<p>It sucks, because it was basically my dream gaming service.  Kind of like Google Play Music was my dream music service. :(')
