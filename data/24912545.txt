You never write code on a whiteboard in the course of your day job. The obsession with whiteboard interviews is absolutely idiotic IMO, as is the obsession with asking deep algorithmic questions which the candidate will definitely not be able to answer convincingly if they didn&#x27;t encounter them before.<p>It&#x27;s idiotic that someone has to prepare for a month to do a 5-7 hour whiteboard interview loop that has no relation whatsoever to the job duties. You don&#x27;t quiz a barbecue chef on Michelin star molecular cuisine, yet this is considered totally normal in our profession.<p>At a minimum, ask questions that one could figure out without knowing the answer beforehand, and at a minimum let them use their text editor. Better yet, don&#x27;t do this shit at all, and ask people to solve a _practical_ problem similar to ones they&#x27;re likely to encounter if they take the job. It still provides a good filter, arguably better even.<p>As things are now, interviews test for academic credentials, memory, and lack of flight response from candidate&#x27;s amygdala, not practical technical skill per se.')
