This makes it enjoyable as you find yourself rooting against them and laughing at their failures.<p>We also found it annoying in a way similar to the recent Oceans movie. Rather than the protaganist defeating the antagonist, the protagonist wins them over with their revealed inner and outer beauty, and all-tagonists become cute, unlikely friends.')
