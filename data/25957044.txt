I once worked in an environment where we were maintaining software that natively ran on a 16 bit machine.  The CPU did have separate Instruction &#x2F; Data space.  The addressable memory was broken up into 8K chunks.  To reference an 8K chunck that was not already mapped, you had to call a special routine to change one of your 8K chunks.  So you put your main routines in one 8K chunck, your common subroutines in another, then you managed the rest in the 6 levels in between.  You would have several overlays, typically.  The overlays could get very messy trying to sort out what can call what.')
