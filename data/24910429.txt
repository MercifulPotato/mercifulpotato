They have specialized drivers that take the loads into NYC, Boston, etc. He drops the trailer at a yard outside the city and a <i>city truck</i> and driver take it in.<p>It just works out better for the company since these drivers know their city and that is all they do. It keeps the company from having accident insurance claims.<p>I doubt there will ever be self driving Tractor Trailer type vehicles in any city. It requires some serious skill and intuition about your rig and roads, like where to take the truck wide to complete a right turn without taking down the street light or pedestrian waiting to cross would be a good example.')
