If the law sets the limit at 30 days, there is no reason to do it sooner than 30 days.  It is obviously a money-losing proposition to do it quickly, and the only reason it&#x27;s an option at all is because of the law.  I guess that makes it a reasonable compromise -- everyone is equally unhappy, but the world is a slightly better place.<p>The reality is that &quot;30 days&quot; translates to &quot;someone will run a script manually once a month&quot; whereas something like &quot;100 milliseconds&quot; would force you to have automation.  It&#x27;s a reasonable tradeoff for rare events.  There is a lot less engineering effort required, and that makes it cheaper.')
