The main complaints seem to be that the library is big and that nested serialization is tricky because of design decisions.<p>In regards to binary size, using whatever serializing you&#x27;re already doing for your main data seems like a win for telemetry. Including telemetry with your main data has pluses and minuses, but using the same serialization is generally fine, unless your serialization can fail, in which case it&#x27;s hard to report on how many times telemetry serialization fails, because you might not be able to serialize it.')
