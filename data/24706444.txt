I either don&#x27;t buy stuff you can&#x27;t wash in the dishwasher, or wash it in the dishwasher anyway because I have better things to do than pamper some random crockery.<p>Except my chefs knives which never get put in there, but they are the exception.<p>&gt; you have to pre-rinse some things<p>For me (and we cook every meal) it&#x27;s the minority. It&#x27;s a rarity that we ever pre-rinse.<p>If I lived alone it might feel differently about having a dishwasher, but it was life changing when we got one after our second child was born. However, I wouldn&#x27;t not get one for the reasons you listed.')
