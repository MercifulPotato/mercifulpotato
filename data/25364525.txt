It was the &quot;significant&quot; quality of life for children statement struck me as a red flag. It&#x27;s a form of WASP signaling I&#x27;ve seen many times before (I may be a WASP too...)<p>It&#x27;s a particularly egregious statement given that people the world over (myself included) would love to retire in California some day due to the wonderful weather, the abundance of high-quality food and the lovely ocean next door, not to mention the world-class in-state universities, and the abundant employment opportunities. Yes, SF is expensive, and perhaps it makes sense to move out, but leaving California altogether is a whole other kettle of fish. Resorting to Texas as being significantly better given its poor social safety net, open-carry laws, wide variation in schooling based on neighbourhood wealth, well &quot;significantly better&quot; starts to look downright fishy.')
