Grabbed a random bottle we got as a gift to drink with our pizza.  It was a cab sauv which is a wine we usually donâ€™t care for.  We both were surprised at how much we did like it and how smooth it was.  The next day we were shopping at target and saw it was an $85 bottle of wine.<p>Not sure if we could have told it from a $40 bottle, but it certainly stood head and shoulders above the $20 bottles we typically buy.')
