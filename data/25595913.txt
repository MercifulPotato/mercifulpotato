This becomes an issue when you decide to use a nice mic&#x2F;audio interface for higher quality audio but then you can have sync issues with the video. To mitigate audio sync issues, it&#x27;s best to have the audio going into the camera&#x27;s input. You can pass audio from a nice mic&#x2F;preamp into the camera but it&#x27;s less ideal than going into the computer via a decent audio interface. Afaik, OBS can fix those sync issues but it&#x27;s quite a lot of effort to do all of this properly vs. buying a better webcam.')
