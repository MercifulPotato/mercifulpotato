I know someone whose Facebook is mostly helpful tips, cooking, and family photos without any politics. Another person in the same household has a very different Facebook experience with lots of politics and religion and toxicity. This is coming from an extremely rural part of Ohio with people who have a very conservative social circle.<p>The difference is that the one person doesn’t care about politics very much and thus doesn’t interact with political content if it shows up, whereas the other person gets very invested into political content. I myself deleted Facebook because I was getting far too invested into political content.<p>The overall point being that Facebook’s machine learning algorithm is going to increase your engagement with the platform by showing you posts with content you’re more likely to interact with.<p>So I guess the question is: OP, do you have a tendency to interact and comment on political posts if they ever come up, or do you just ignore them?')
