There are tons of new jobs, but for those impacted by this stuff very few of them are <i>good</i> jobs that pay a middle-class income (I know, I don&#x27;t have a cite, but I&#x27;m explaining a <i>sentiment</i>, not a fact - so iono I don&#x27;t got it).<p>A contractor in a town where the jobs dried up might work at Lowe&#x27;s now for example, where they would be kept under 20 hours a week so Lowe&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have to pay benefits, and they could look forward to living in a van off of social security when they retire (source - this is my brother in law at 55 y&#x2F;o - he has no idea how computers work, and desperately just wants to go back to laying tile like he did for most of his life - lost work - got a job at Lowes a few years back - just laid off actually, due to the virus - he&#x27;s 100% screwed). There are a <i>lot</i> of these folks floating around, and what has happened to them is absolutely tragic.<p>Ideally he should re-train in something, but what often winds up happening is that they get sucked into for-profit colleges that encourage them to take out predatory high-interest loans for training that lead to job markets that are either oversaturated, or misrepresented. Then come the payday loans, then come the repossessions.<p>Ideally those people would just buy a bunch of NoStarch books and become fullstack developers or something, but that&#x27;s not how people work, unfortunately and we just haven&#x27;t figured out a good mechanism to help keep those folks on their feet.<p>The person you&#x27;re responding to is waaaaaay too angry, and I don&#x27;t believe you deserve to be on the receiving-end of that, but they may be going through some really rough stuff right now. There&#x27;s a lot of people who have suddenly found themselves unemployed and homeless and they may very well be in that situation.')
