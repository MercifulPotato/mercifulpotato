I may be an outlier but I prefer the &quot;polish&quot; and user experience of ubuntu to apple - I find the unity gui to be easier to navigate and understand than mac, and I find the OS way less intrusive.<p>But what caused me to switch to a mac was the constant CPU and memory problems I was having with ubuntu.<p>Chrome and zoom both seemed to kill the machine when used for too long or in the wrong combination. That is the kind of problem I dont want to spend time debugging, and switching to Mac, it is gone, and my productivity is way higher, even accounting for the new annoyances.<p>But now between the new architecture and the moves for greater control over how I use my machine, I really dont know how to think about what I want my next computer to be. While I dismissed WSL in the past, I&#x27;d say it is becoming a contender again.')
