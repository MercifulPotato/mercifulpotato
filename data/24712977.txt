The US left pushes hard against right to work, meaning everyone will be forced to join workplace unions when&#x2F;if they are formed. This includes basically all tech hotspots including California and New York, if your colleagues organizes a union there you will be forced to join. This include this Kickstarter union btw, likely a lot of its members don&#x27;t actually want to be a part of the union.')
