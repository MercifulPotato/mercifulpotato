Kids mostly don&#x27;t need specialized facilities -- just more of the same kind of buildings. If you took a college and turned one of its buildings into an elementary school and one of its quads into a playground, you&#x27;re most of the way to being &quot;child-friendly.&quot; Or so I would think? Don&#x27;t have kids, in case that wasn&#x27;t obvious.<p>Hopefully this doesn&#x27;t sound rude -- I just mean to say that a college campus&#x27;s child-unfriendliness isn&#x27;t a reason not to copy the model, since it&#x27;s easily fixed.')
