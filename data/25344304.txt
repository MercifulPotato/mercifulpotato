The Swiss army is a bottomless barrel when it comes to funding; always requiring &amp; demanding money, while preparing for scenarios that were maybe somewhat plausible during the height of the cold war but are nowadays obviously antiquated, plain for anyone to see who doesn&#x27;t wear the nostalgia-tinged glasses.<p>It provides cool pictures such as the ones posted here and some nice stories, but apart from that - the billions currently going to the army could be used so much better.')
