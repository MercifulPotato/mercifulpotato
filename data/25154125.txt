Then it seems like a complete mess.&quot;</i><p>Same. This year, with the coverage of Covid (an area where I have a certain level of expertise), I&#x27;ve been bombarded with the extremely low quality level of essentially all of the major news providers. They are more than willing to amplify the most speculative voices, credulously, without even basic fact-checking. The ones that depend on advertising are the worst, overall. Writers with no subject-matter expertise will take a scary quote from a single source, won&#x27;t bother to make even the simplest of efforts to verify the claim, and will publish it just to get the scoop.<p>I won&#x27;t mention names because I&#x27;ll only be downvoted, but there are some <i>extremely</i> high-profile &quot;scientific&quot; media figures who are constantly broadcasting utter nonsense. And because they heard it from a &quot;scientist&quot; on the news, people will attack you if you rebut it. I am old enough to remember when journalists were <i>skeptical</i> of the people they interviewed, and the rule was that no fact was published without independent verification (read &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot; for example).<p>2020 is the year where the news media fell apart for me -- it is all simply entertainment now, which is unfortunate.')
