What I do know however is that it brings out the worst in me and in many others with whom I&#x27;ve played the game.<p>I haven&#x27;t played it for years after deciding that it was too divisive and caused too much acrimony among players.  For example, deception was often the order of the dayâ€”I and other family members would hide assets like surreptitiously sitting on a $500 note only to suddenly produce it to pounce-purchase some property after other players had failed to keep tally of one&#x27;s earnings&#x2F;assets and so on.<p>Fights and arguments would often ensue with people not talking one another for hours, sometimes days.  Frankly, it&#x27;s a horrible game that one could easily argue was designed specifically to bring out the worst in human nature.')
