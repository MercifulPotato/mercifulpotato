Rather than the DPRK, take the US election. A toss-up before the 3rd of November, with massive ramifications on fiscal policy and therefore GDP growth and currency strength.<p>I truly shake my head at the software developers who expect economists to give an accurate point forecast of a binary coin-toss, and then deride their expertise as a sham when they describe the scenarios that follow the two outcomes instead.<p>(And also shake my head at voters who believe &quot;economists&quot; hand-picked by politicians to affirm their policies. In a profession of a million people you can find one to support any policy even if 99% of the profession don&#x27;t agree -- just like you can find a &quot;computer scientist&quot; who will promise you self-driving cars on the street within three years if you just pay him a million dollar consulting fee.)')
