Speed contributes in two major ways when it comes to accidents, which this is all about: reaction time and energy.<p>Going faster means you have less time to react and handle the situation.<p>If you&#x27;re going 100 km&#x2F;h instead of 80 km&#x2F;h, and something happens 100m in front of you, you have only 3.6 seconds instead of 4.5 seconds to react and deal with it. This scales with distance.<p>If you&#x27;re going at 100 km&#x2F;h instead of 80 km&#x2F;h, your car has 50% more kinetic energy. This translates fairly directly into increased breaking distance.<p>So as speed increases you have less time to react and <i>in addition</i> you require more time to slow down.')
