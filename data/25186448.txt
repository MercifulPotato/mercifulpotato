Tough to tell right now, given the process deficit.<p>And anyways, is this transition entirely about performance? Apple is obviously selling it like that, but it seems like they really want the ability to fine-tune the architecture and SoC to their needs. And they’re not the only company with the desire and capital to make that happen; Microsoft, Amazon, Google, they all must desire on some level to finesse systems to meet their specific needs, and Intel isn’t in that business.')
