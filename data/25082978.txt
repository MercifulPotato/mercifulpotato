I meant it to imply that there&#x27;s a market&#x2F;economy effect that dominates, but it was sloppy&#x2F;possibly ambiguous. I&#x27;m going to leave my comment unedited, but I wish I&#x27;d used &quot;would&quot; instead of &quot;should&quot; there to suggest that it&#x27;s an outcome of economic inputs rather than a personal value judgment.')
