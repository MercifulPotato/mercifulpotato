It went prototype-based (inspired by Self, the common ancestor of NewtonScript and JavaScript) and because of this, many &quot;classes&quot; could have default data and functions point back into the ROM, meaning it was possible to have hand-held GUI apps and OS with 128KB of RAM.\nDoes Espruino take advantage of this technique to save on RAM, and does using JavaScript&#x27;s prototype-based OOP make it more suitable than Python for low-memory situations?')
