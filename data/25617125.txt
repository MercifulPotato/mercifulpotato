Short flight time. Crap wing loading. Not good at any of it&#x27;s multi-roles.<p>We could build 5-10 F-16s for each F-35, and many more A-10s, and they&#x27;d be better despite being ancient designs.<p>They&#x27;re so expensive we can&#x27;t even do proper flight training in them, it&#x27;d cost too much if we break one.')
