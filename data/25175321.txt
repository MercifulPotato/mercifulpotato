(Not by choice, by necessity.)<p>We have a subsystem that is currently emitted millions of logs per hour, It&#x27;s eating up most of the available compute. In a separate incident, it racked up a few thousand dollar bill by making millions of API calls that all failed.<p>It clearly has issues. But I&#x27;m not the primary dev: I have no familiarity with the code base, I have little idea what it is <i>doing</i> (and yes, I&#x27;ve asked). As I&#x27;m not a dev of the code (and have no time to become one — our agile sprint planning will never allow time for that, and, since I&#x27;m not one of the devs) I&#x27;m not able to add the information I need to the code to get the insights into answering &quot;why is it eating up most of the compute?&quot;.<p>&gt; <i>The people who designed your car don’t have to change the oil in it.</i><p>No, but when the car fails to operate as designed, those people need to figure out the why. Also, a mechanic has an understanding of how the car is built, and how it functions. In software, the only people that have that are the <i>devs</i>.')
