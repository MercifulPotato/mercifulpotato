I understand there are some instances where this might be the case, but generally people go to those places because they want to, or because it offers them a favorable outcome that they&#x27;re willing to temporarily trade some autonomy for.<p>You can deconstruct the whole of society and make an argument that all labor exchanged for capital is oppression, that all regular chronologies favored by the dominant culture is oppression, that all authority figures are oppressive etc... But it&#x27;s difficult to imagine a thriving, post-industrial society not featuring some of those things.<p>Even looking back in history, people have self-organized into hierarchical, regimented systems. I think a lot of this is just a natural reaction to our environment, which is also dictated by regular chronologies (days, lunar cycle, seasons), necessary labor (biological need for food and shelter) and implicit authority figures (parents).')
