If we have the ability to survive elsewhere than earth and we have brought earth to the point that it is 99% uninhabitable then going someone else is probably the best choice.<p>One could easily argue that our ability to consider our environment and make changes to our behavior accordingly is unnatural. Avoiding the above scenario is something we should be using our unnatural gifts to avoid.<p>Arguments based on how natural something is is highly subjective and not really worthwhile imo. Replace natural with what we&#x27;re actually trying to discuss: As a species we want a stable environment that requires the least effort to survive in. Individuals have additional traits they want from the environment but that&#x27;s all subjective. Things that most people consider natural are usually things that have a large data set to demonstrate their stability.')
