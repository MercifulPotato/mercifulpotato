You can&#x27;t become a billionaire by yourself.  You have to have some mechanism of leverage to magnify your impact.  Hiring employees is a form of leverage.  Using a computer is a form of leverage.  Putting your software on a large number of cloud computers is yet an additional form  of leverage.  The question of whether one is exploiting their employees is a worthwhile question to ask, but it is a  completely separate (and much more polarizing) question.  I think that leverage is the core kernel of truth lurking within this question.')
