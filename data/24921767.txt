Having come from the design world, pretty much most design critiques are bike sheds.  Should the shed be red? no lets make it google colors instead.  Make all sheds google colored because it will improve KPI&#x27;s! (answer: it wont)<p>There is no subjectivity to when anyone says new logos are bad.  I remember people were saying Airbnb&#x27;s logo looks like a dong, thats pretty much the worst you could do as a designer, and now no one even cares.  In fact its recognizable and unique.  Its like telling someone they have a bad face.  Ok what if the face has a crooked nose? its not symmetrical? Does that even matter?  If its distinguishable and recognizable that&#x27;s all you need.<p>At the end of the day its just branding.  As long as you can get it to stick inside people&#x27;s neurons then its doing its job.')
