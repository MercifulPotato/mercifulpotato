But don&#x27;t forget AMD successfully sued Intel under antitrust laws for giving discounts to major vendors like Dell in exchange for preferential use of Intel chips over other competing chip makers.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Advanced_Micro_Devices,_Inc._v._Intel_Corp" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Advanced_Micro_Devices,_Inc._v...</a>.<p>This deal between Google and Facebook is strikingly similar. Google is giving preferential treatment to Facebook that it doesn&#x27;t currently offer to other ad buyers and access to analytical data it also doesn&#x27;t provide to other ad buyers in exchange for Facebook committing to spend a certain amount of money on Google ads. But more damning, according the article, &quot;<i>the two companies had predetermined that Facebook would win a fixed percentage of auctions that it bid on.</i>&quot; This clearly gives Facebook an unfair competitive edge over other advertisers and amounts to quid pro quo, which is illegal, just like the Intel antitrust suit.')
