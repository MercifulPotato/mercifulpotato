My cousins had travelled to the UK where they picked up lots of games, but unfortunately most were on cassette. Being desperate to enjoy the wonderful new worlds contained within, I had to come up with a solution. In my case, I cracked open my sisters ghetto blaster and wired it in to the port on the side of the Machine. Worked like a charm, and I too got to enjoy the gruelling wait on every game change.')
