I used to be in charge of part a product and lead a small team for a formely state-owned large industrial company in the suburb of Paris and was making less than 50k when I left (given the other advantages I was actually making more). I could probably have been paid four times more in the USA (admitedly I could have been paid more in France too but the job was interesting).')
