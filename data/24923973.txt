I couldn&#x27;t get ibus to work, but I used to use fcitx under X as well so I didn&#x27;t try too hard to get ibus to work.<p>That said, the way fcitx works is to use toolkit integration directly, rather than work with the compositor via the input-methods protocol. So it only works for programs using those toolkits. Thus gtk2, gtk3, qt programs will work, but not something like alacritty. (This is good enough for my use case.)')
