Right now. No one knows if this is the top of the market and tomorrow everything will come crashing down, or if this is the very bottom of a 10 year bull market. On average you do better not trying to time the market and just contribute on an automated schedule. Set up monthly contributions and buy regardless of whatever is happening in the market and then try to forget about it for most of the year.')
