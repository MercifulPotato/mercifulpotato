Item(by='hansvm', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1608773839, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25521602, text='I&#x27;m still early in my career, but the last two rounds of interviews I&#x27;ve done have yielded initial offers with a spread of $100k+&#x2F;yr in total comp and $60k+&#x2F;yr in base salary.<p>Just to have concrete numbers to work with, suppose initial offers exactly correspond to final pay and that you&#x27;re currently making toward the lower end of that range (e.g. because raises haven&#x27;t kept up with your increased skill and increased market demand).<p>If you&#x27;re currently making $X&#x2F;yr (total comp), you think you _might_ be worth $X+$50k to somebody, and you spit out $X+$50k as your target range, a prospective employer could generously offer $X+$60k and you&#x27;d be happy as a clam and none the wiser while missing out on a new Tesla per year in extra pay.<p>There&#x27;s a separate argument that if you&#x27;d be happy with $X+$60k then you shouldn&#x27;t try to squeeze your employer for more, but I&#x27;ll let somebody else make it if they&#x27;d like. Regardless, that big of a spread really does exist, and I imagine it grows further into one&#x27;s career.')
