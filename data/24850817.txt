Item(by='jjoonathan', descendants=None, kids=[24850959], score=None, time=1603306145, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=24850728, text='Yes, that was somewhat unfair of me -- but only somewhat. Economists generally espouse a notion of value that is weighted by wealth (for a company, &quot;purchasing power&quot; might be more appropriate), and it adds a rather severe unstated bias to nearly every claim they make. By this special, biased metric of theirs I&#x27;d expect spectrum ownership to be wildly successful as it is effectively one mechanism for extracting rent that supports another mechanism for extracting rent.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s unfair again, because rent itself is an economic concept and economics brings us the tools to identify it and, if we so choose, look to minimize, but that&#x27;s not exactly a route towards getting paid to evangelize a particular opinion. Promoting new opportunities to extract rent <i>is</i> a route towards getting paid to evangelize an opinion, so many economists do it, and that&#x27;s the source of the animosity you saw in my previous post.')
