If they provide a way to get to various destinations around town or a fast way to travel between towns, then they&#x27;ll be used and prove useful.<p>Protected bicycle lanes is a misnomer.  Protected, in traffic engineering terms, refers to something like a protected traffic light phase where one stream of traffic has exclusive access to the intersection (e.g., a protected left turn arrow).<p>The barrier separated lanes reduce the visibility of cyclists from the motorists&#x27; point of view and vice versa.  When both get to an intersecton and the motorist needs to turn right, it&#x27;s not possible for them to see the cyclist well enough in advance to actually yield to them.  The same thing happens to cyclists because they can&#x27;t easily see approaching traffic due to visual obstructions.<p>The safest solution is to have cyclists follow the same rules of the road that all other vehicle operators follow and allow cyclists full use of the lane they&#x27;re in.  That is, get rid of laws that require cyclists to ride as far right as practicable regardless of the presence of marked lanes or use a bike lane (e.g., <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nysenate.gov&#x2F;legislation&#x2F;laws&#x2F;VAT&#x2F;1234" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nysenate.gov&#x2F;legislation&#x2F;laws&#x2F;VAT&#x2F;1234</a>).')
