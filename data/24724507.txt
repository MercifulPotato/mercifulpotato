I first used it to change icons, add keyboard shortcuts to menu items, and so on. This taught me that the internals of software applications weren&#x27;t just magic but actually were reducible to the 1&#x27;s and 0&#x27;s they were made of.<p>I didn&#x27;t know how to extend this discovery to the actual behavior of applications until I encountered an upgrade named &quot;Super ResEdit&quot; which provided a disassembly tool.<p>That showed a mysterious pair of columns with words like &quot;ADD&quot; and &quot;MUL&quot; and &quot;BRA&quot; and &quot;BEQ&quot; and so on in the first column, with some hex in the second column. What do those things mean? Hmm, if I hover over &quot;BRA&quot; and &quot;BEQ&quot; I get a little arrow pointing to a different line, and &quot;BEQ&quot; always follows a line like &quot;CMP&quot;... aha, &quot;BRA&quot; means &quot;branch&quot; and &quot;CMP&quot; means &quot;compare&quot; and &quot;BEQ&quot; means &quot;branch if equal&quot;.<p>And the second column is some hex numbers which are always corresponding in the same way to the first column. If I change the second column, the first column changes to match!<p>And that&#x27;s how child-me learned to search for &quot;check_registration_code&quot; and change the &quot;BEQ&quot; at the end to &quot;BRA&quot;.')
