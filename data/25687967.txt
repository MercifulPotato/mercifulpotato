If you refuse to accept the results of the election, you are promoting treason. If you want to play second-grade word games to explain why President Trump isnt responsible for the attempted coup, you are promoting treason. And deep down you know you are wrong and feel shame, which is why you get so angry. You are not supported by the majority of Americans. Your cause has lost and ultimately will always lose, because it is fundamentally hateful. You still can reflect and change your beliefs and attitudes towards other people.]')
