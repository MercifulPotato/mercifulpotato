Actuals vary wildly by location, purposes, and sector; but if everyone can get their heads out of the hobbyist-tinkerer mindset for a moment and consider that lifetime TCO is a real and meaningful consideration for businesses, then the component that isn&#x27;t buying&#x2F;leasing the server itself is typically several hundred dollars, per physical unit, per annum.  Public clouds don&#x27;t nullify all of it, but they swing the needle dramatically.<p>Since my duty cycle for a Mac Mini is rather less than 20%, the economics even of on-demand instances immediately make sense, and having it inside the VPC boundary without hybridising is gravy on the meat since I&#x27;m consuming several other AWS services besides.<p>These two factors (lifetime TCO and scale-down) are the economic foundation of the value proposition of utility computing.  The &quot;I can build that in my garage for cheaper&quot; crew aren&#x27;t wrong, but they&#x27;re missing the point.<p>Putting on my sometime cloud infrastructure product manager&#x27;s hat, long-term observers of service pricing may also observe the common enough pattern of starting a new product with a relatively high price, one that selects for early adopters and other price-insensitive (and, you hope, glitch&#x2F;MVP-tolerant) customer segments, then gradually ratcheting prices down in order to estimate (amongst other things) the price elasticity of demand.  It&#x27;s naturally easier to get cheaper over time, than go the other way.  In this AWS&#x27;s position on compute is congruent to any other commodity merchant⁽¹⁾ with the luxury of being able to withstand potential losses on a single product line. For most EC2 instance types I&#x27;d expect they have a very good model of the price sensitivities, but mac1 is undoubtedly a unique platform with elevated uncertainty in the price parameters.<p>Which is my long-winded way of saying, it&#x27;ll likely be cheaper in a few months.<p>-----------------------<p>⁽¹⁾ yes, yes, just like a <i>fruit shop</i>, very droll.')
