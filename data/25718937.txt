Item(by='jeffbee', descendants=None, kids=None, score=None, time=1610308558, title=None, item_type='comment', url=None, parent=25718767, text='It&#x27;s clear that you don&#x27;t have enough experience with computers other than that one to support the statements you are making. I&#x27;m glad it is adequate for your purposes but to say that &quot;it flies&quot; is absurd. The Chromebook Duet scores 27 in the javascript benchmark Speedometer 2, while the MacBook Air scores 234. It is <i>nine times</i> faster. Looking at the single-thread geekbench 5 score, the Duet gets a score of 263, about half the performance of the dual-core Pentium CPU from 2008, a part which AnandTech once reviewed as part of a joke article. There&#x27;s a supportable argument that the Chromebook Duet is the slowest laptop on the market today, without exception.')
