He didn&#x27;t like that ublock.org was soliciting donations. uBlock isn&#x27;t literally malware or much different from many other ad blockers out there.<p>To be clear though, gorhill didn&#x27;t &quot;sell out&quot;. He got tired of answering support requests, so he turned the repository over to someone else. To be sure, his trust in that other person was misplaced. But in response, gorhill didn&#x27;t sit idly by, he forked uBlock into uBlock Origin. All of this was done for free, with no compensation for work.')
