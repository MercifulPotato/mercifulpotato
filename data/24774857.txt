Each individual has a certain level as well as organizations. Those aware of their skill level tend to hoard their resources while those not aware tend to waste it. A good example will be people who win the lottery. Their income &amp; networth usually defaults back to where ever their skill was.<p>On the other hand some notable companies such as Google, Facebook, Apple tend to be aware of their resource management skill thus they hoard the extra resources instead of wasting it.<p>Other notable people could be Asian grandparents. But too much hoarding is also not a good way to manage resources.<p>## How To Increase?<p>I&#x27;m working on a web game called colonist.io. We have gotten pretty far on the web and it&#x27;s time to create a mobile version. Some people tell us that if we get an outsourcing firm to make the mobile it&#x27;ll speed us up. We know that an outsourcing firm will make the wrong product and on average will make it 3.8 star and best case scenario 4.4, not 4.9. That is our standard as can be seen from our [previous game](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;apps.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;dawn-of-crafting&#x2F;id1067104191) and we don&#x27;t want to lower our standard just to be able to spend more money.<p>There are some amazing people who can just deploy the resources to create all of this. There are also other people who raise millions multiple times throughout the years and waste all of them.<p>&quot;just do it and you&#x27;ll learn it&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to be working for everyone. I am sure that a right sort of training(practice) will help us increase this skill.<p>I view all of these skills like going to the gym. With enough right practice we can achieve our goal. With the wrong practice we will injure ourselves.<p>So what are some methods we can use in order to increase this skill? If you were to give us a practice session what would it look like?<p>Thank you')
