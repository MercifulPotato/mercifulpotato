But there are also specialized electronics that work at 450C (or even 500C). NASA Glenn Research Center has developed them. Transistors and such using Silicon Carbide (instead of regular silicon). A simple computer could as easily be made with such transistors and passive elements. Itâ€™d be much faster and lighter than a relay computer.<p>The issue with all such computers is developing significant storage. Enough RAM for scientific data and images is probably too energy intensive (electrical energy is hard to get if you have to dump heat at 450C for your RTG). So you either transmit constantly as described here: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ntrs.nasa.gov&#x2F;citations&#x2F;20150002090" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ntrs.nasa.gov&#x2F;citations&#x2F;20150002090</a><p>or you store it using maybe a magnetic tape with high curie temperature.')
