But not when the platforms do it by force. If you want to pay McAfee, or some other service to force your computer to only run trusted code, then that&#x27;s your choice. I might even be fine if Apple or Microsoft offered it as a service you have to pay extra for.<p>The problem is when one entity can lock down a platform entirely. Its a problem when its not a choice the user have. Its also a problem that even when the user wants all code to be verified, they cant choose who it gets verified by.<p>If yesterdays disaster had happen to a third party trust company, and not Apple, a lot of people would be looking for a new trust vendor today. Thats what should happen in a non-monopolistic market.')
