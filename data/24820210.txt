I knew he was politically opposite from me so I kept politics out of our conversations... do you know how hard that is? It&#x27;s hard enough that it requires effort, effort that he noted. He accused me of being closed off and never saying what I really wanted to. I made it clear we should not go there.<p>He told me that several years ago watching the news made him physically ill and his GP told him to avoid news. His health improved. In 2016 he admitted to me he does not watch any news, read any news, but he believes in voting. I asked him how he could vote if he hasn&#x27;t educated himself on the candidates. How a person like me who thinks you either eat politics or it eats you, sees an uninformed voter, proudly ignorant of the candidates, but voting with his gut, what am I supposed to say? This deeply offended him. He then accused me of living in a bubble despite the fact I read news from all over and he reads none.<p>I asked him how should educated voters feel about gut-feeling voters with uneducated opinions? I think his response was &quot;Fuck off&quot;. We do not talk anymore because any subject he brought up that had any hint of politics to it was an empty conversation. I would bring up things related to the subject and he would default to making jokes. Serious conversation was beyond him.<p>Tone deaf, dumb, and blind. He eventually said he found all women of my wife&#x27;s race &quot;unattractive&quot; and then could not understand why I was upset at him. Ex-Navy man, ex-Nuclear Engineer, ex-friend.')
