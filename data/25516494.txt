But I would be OK with a plugin that lets me click on a store on OSM to open it in a Google Maps page in a webview.<p>I&#x27;d be letting Google know that I am interested in that place - no way around it - but I could keep the information of whether I actually went there and how long I stayed within OSM, without sharing my location with Google.<p>Another, probably easier plugin would be one that lets OSMAnd recognize the location provided by Google Maps when I use the share button. Then I could look up places I want to go on GMaps and send them to OSMAnd+ for navigation.')
