RHEL X keeps getting work done on it which eventually lead to another fork which creates RHEL X.1 Beta and RHEL X.1.<p>- After each RHEL X.y is released CentOS starts the process of rebuilding it from the sources and tracking upstream changes.<p>The new model puts CentOS where RHEL X is and so RHEL X.y are actually forks of CentOS.<p>This change matters a lot to you if you care a lot about the difference between the minor releases of RHEL because there won&#x27;t be CentOS 7.1 CentOS 7.3 but just CentOS 7. If you just yum update on CentOS then you probably don&#x27;t care since by default it will move you up minor versions. You have to try to stay on a specific minor version.<p>What&#x27;s nice about this change is that anyone can peel off releases from CentOS the same way Red Hat will do to make RHEL and new features become available when they&#x27;re ready instead of being batched.')
