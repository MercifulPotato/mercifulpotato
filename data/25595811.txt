We&#x27;d sometimes get the customers who would ask, how is this bike worth $X more than a bike I can get at Walmart? All you&#x27;d have to do is get them on the bike for a test ride. The difference is night and day. Given that, I feel like the goal of the Coast project wasn&#x27;t necessarily to increase ridership, but to increase profits margins with a clever doo-dad.<p>There&#x27;s always been a lot of hand wringing by cycling enthusiasts in the US about increasing ridership, and being more approachable, better group rides may be one way to do it. There are a lot of obstacles here; road conditions (potholes), hilly in a lot of areas (it does not take a steep or long grade to flummux a introductory or casual rider!), but at the end of the day, cycling is just dangerous. American car culture is not friendly to anything else being on the road (talk to motorcyclists for example!). When I think back on some of the close calls I had, and accidents my friends had simply riding around, I&#x27;m kind of amazed I was ever that fearless.')
