One of the referees flagged that I was making a claim without proving it, and asked for me to revise it.  I submitted a revised version <i>which still had a mistake in the same step</i> and it was accepted.<p>(Three years later, my doctoral supervisor pointed out the mistake to me, and we published another paper -- in the same journal -- filling the gap.)')
