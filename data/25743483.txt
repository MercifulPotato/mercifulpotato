That&#x27;s news to me.<p>I too find it unlikely that there is such a discontinuity.  Quite a large number of physicists (and quantum computing people) seem to speak as if there is one.<p>&gt; Finally, decoherence has seen plenty of study<p>I get the impression that decoherence is treated as merely a problem for technicians working on experimental apparatus, or an engineering issue to be dealt with on the road to quantum computation.  Are there any results on fundamental limits to the degree of entanglement in a system?  We&#x27;ve been trying to get that damn cat into superposition for ~85 years now, with no luck.')
