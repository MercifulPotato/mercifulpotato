This is one of the arguments made by Trump supporters how unpatriotic BLM&#x2F;Antifa movement is. Why not embrace the flag and create discord? It&#x27;s like taking away one of their key branding tools.<p>If you think about the US flag as a brand, its tarnished by the &quot;patriots&quot;. I&#x27;d love to see a counter movement to this. It&#x27;s not just US, but extreme right wing movements in Germany, France, UK - all embrace the flag. Thoughts?')
