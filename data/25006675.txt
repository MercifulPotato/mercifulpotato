People accept the evidence of how to make a better society, in which valuable people who could contribute are actually enabled to do so and ultimately the required tax take to keep everyone alive actually goes down, but they&#x27;d literally rather not do that because helping other people offends their sense of self.<p>Like the nonsense of many prison systems. Overwhelming evidence that it&#x27;s an expensive way to get worse outcomes, but people just can&#x27;t bring themselves to pay less for a better world if it means prisons are less hellscape.')
