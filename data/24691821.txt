It&#x27;s not complicated. There is no way you are tired enough to be actually falling asleep without realising you&#x27;re far too tired to be driving safely. It&#x27;s not as if it&#x27;s a close thing where one minute you&#x27;re alert and driving responsibly and the next minute you&#x27;re out. Anyone who can&#x27;t make that determination reliably is demonstrably unfit to be in charge of a vehicle and should hand in their licence.')
