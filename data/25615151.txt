Milk, newspapers, magazines etc. This business model makes refuelling stations a viable business since the margins on fuel costs are so slim.<p>One of the challenges with the crude political attempts to force EV usage (carrot&#x2F;subsidies, Stick&#x2F;fines) is the lack of coherent planning behind it. What happens when&#x2F;if there are huge numbers of EV&#x27;s?<p>It&#x27;s a similar issue with public transport. My sister, a keen cyclist in London, now has two knee replacements and can&#x27;t really cycle anymore. Public transport is a huge challenge (stairs etc) and driving in London is made ever harder with more and more bicycle lanes, concrete blocks dumped on roads and massive charges for attempting to use her car.<p>None of this is thought through. I&#x27;d really like to see some sort of vision democratically presented for comment by citizens before these autocratic decrees and changes are introduced, we seem to have more and more ill considered plans that are not joined up imposed on us, making life harder and harder...')
