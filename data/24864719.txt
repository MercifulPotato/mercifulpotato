Indeed, Twitch was spun off its predecessor site precisely because the gaming section was overwhelmingly popular.<p>&gt; Why would I trust a stranger enough to get into their car?<p>It wasn&#x27;t until I went to college that I discovered that slugging <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> a common thing. What&#x27;s slugging? It&#x27;s the commuting practice of a driver rolling up to a line of people, saying &quot;I&#x27;m going to the Pentagon, I&#x27;ve got three seats; who wants to come with?&quot; and three people peel off the line into the car.<p>&gt; The Wright brothers sound a bit wonky in the head, trying to get something that heavy to fly.<p>The Wright brothers were the first to succeed of a large group of people attempting to build working airplanes. It was a technological race going on, and the main difficulty was actually in getting a compact engine working that could provide sufficient forward speed to produce lift. Glider technology was already decently accomplished by the time of the first <i>powered</i> flight, which is the milestone the Wright brothers achieved.')
