And eventually I started the jogging at the time. To me, it&#x27;s like sort of hedge, if I got my job later, I got a heathier body due to more work out. In other words, the destiny is not going to screw me up on both sides :)<p>Actually, I kept on jogging even after I got the job later, I don&#x27;t know why but that does make you feel a bit better about life.')
