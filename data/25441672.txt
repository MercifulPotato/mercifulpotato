I find it strange somehow, through the wind, someone always posts a project that relates to me in my current hobbies here on hn. I&#x27;ve just started scanning my 35mm negatives with my dslr (with macro lens) and a film holder on a lightbox. It&#x27;s easy and much quicker than a dedicated flatbed, but more work post process.<p>For anyone wanting to do this, you will need to invert your b&amp;w or colour negatives with software capable of processing RAW files (lightroom, darktable, rawtherapee) white balance the negative, invert and then colour&#x2F;exposure correct the final image. I use darktable for this and the latest version has a real nice plugin called negadoctor that can give you a great starting point. For lightroom, NegativeLabPro is the goto tool and works in a similar way to negadoctor but is better at producing the initial image.')
