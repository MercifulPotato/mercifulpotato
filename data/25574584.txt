Using controversial metrics because they are easily available is counter-productive in the long run, because once people realize you were misrepresenting your credibility is lost.  At best it&#x27;s lazy.<p>Right now I&#x27;m obese.  In high school according to the BMI I was almost half-way through overweight edging towards obese, and that was with very little fat, a very active lifestyle, and a visible six-pack.  How do I consider studies that make claims about percentages of people that fit into those categories?  As extremely ambiguous in what they are actually indicating.<p>Do Americans have a problem with weight?  I think so.  Does using false numbers to overestimate the problem help?  I don&#x27;t think so, especially when people realize the metrics  leave a lot to be desired.')
