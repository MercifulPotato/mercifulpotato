Outside of a few critical incidents when I happened to be on-call, I&#x27;ve not had to step into the world of actually configuring and deploying our applications and services, and then maintaining the live instances and servers they live on.<p>What general-purpose resources (e.g. books, wikis, guides, etc) would you recommend to learn what actually goes into releasing and maintaining server-based applications and services? I know there&#x27;s a ton of software and solutions in this space that probably vary wildly in terms of usage, so I&#x27;m less looking for a &quot;How to Kubernetes with AWS&quot; and more &quot;What are Kubernetes and AWS even for and why would I need them&quot;, for example.')
