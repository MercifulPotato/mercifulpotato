Rarely is the value a decision, inasmuch as the path to the decision.  By first declaring a solution to a problem, you&#x27;re priming the other individual. Depending on their personality you&#x27;re priming them to be for, or against your decision.<p>By articulating the reasons, methods, and considerations that went into a decision, you&#x27;re slowly and softly building an argument.
