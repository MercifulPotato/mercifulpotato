It will 1) allow you to have a &quot;global&quot; state that doesn&#x27;t require context [1], and 2) allow you let you set state imperatively [2].<p>The links below are the two separate parts that I want to combine together so that you can have that imperative state setting apply to all components depending on the generated hooks. That&#x27;s the easy part.<p>`useStructure` allows you to have a class that your component uses for state (and be able to use any methods on that class). The hard part will be having async functions on those classes that update your state correctly. Not sure if it&#x27;s even possible.<p>[1] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;baron816&#x2F;Galactic-State" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;baron816&#x2F;Galactic-State</a>\n[2] <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;baron816&#x2F;use-structure" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;baron816&#x2F;use-structure</a>')
