Claiming that the Good (meaning the metaethical object) is <i>objective</i> is also a substantial claim, but observe that it&#x27;s not necessary to be a moral realist to think that things can be, for all practical purposes, <i>bad</i>: in an intersubjective sense, a thing is <i>bad</i> if everybody around you agrees that it&#x27;s bad.<p>They can all be wrong (and they frequently are!), but I&#x27;m going to go ahead and wager that they&#x27;re not wrong about civil rights, not drone-striking civilians in other countries, indefinite detention of undocumented migrants, &amp;c &amp;c.')
