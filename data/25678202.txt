A static site generator beats both. Just have a listener that will re-generate the site live when you write new content, then just ssh&#x2F;ftp the generated content to the server when you are done, or if you are fancy you can use version control and push to a repo with a CI toolchain that will regenerate and ssh&#x2F;ftp it for you.')
