Item(by='farias0', descendants=0, kids=None, score=1, time=1602714679, title='Ask HN: How to hands-on learn Data Science', item_type='story', url=None, parent=None, text='I&#x27;m a software developer wanting to learn data science and hopefully get a job in the field in a year&#x27;s time. From my research I&#x27;m not far from having the needed skills, but I still need some study so I can verify this, fill the gaps and gain confidence for interviews.<p>With development I realized I learned very quickly by working on projects instead of reading full books or taking classes, so I started looking for something like a list of DS projects that, if I managed to solve them on my own, I would know I was ready to apply for jobs as a junior scientist. Can someone point me to something like this, if such thing even exists? Are my expectations realistic? Is there any advice you think I need?<p>Thank you!')
