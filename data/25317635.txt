If you have a lot of users, and you can&#x27;t dither the downloads[1], you may have a huge download peak.<p>If you have native libraries, off store downloads need to contain all the versions, but on store only downloads the arch appropriate ones.<p>If you make apks for download, people will archive them and make them available to others, even after they&#x27;re obsolete. This happens with play store too, of course.<p>People who download your apk directly are also likely not to have play libraries or access to google etc. If your app depends on those things anyway, you&#x27;re going to be missing functionality, or have to implement fallbacks for say, maps and push, etc.<p>People are still going to look for your app in the play store, so you probably want it there too; at least if it&#x27;s not something that Google will disallow.<p>[1] Android really likes grouping background timers, so you will probably experience peaks at local X:00 for all of your users. And local X:00:08 for your users on networks with slightly off clocks')
