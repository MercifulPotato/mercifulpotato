And that&#x27;s a full mail service, with mailboxes&#x2F;POP&#x2F;IMAP&#x2F;SMTP etc, but it could also certainly be used simply as a forwarding service for custom domains. And they have many years in business, high credibility (well, higher than a brand new service). That&#x27;s just one alternative.<p>Obviously if you have limited needs, just 1 or 2 domains, and can get by on the $1 plan, that is price competitive even with free services (like many domain registrars offering free mail forwarding). But the jump to $10 month is far too much, IMO.')
