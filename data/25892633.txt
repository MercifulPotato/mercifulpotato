Where is the problem?<p>Without government funding to spur research quickly then fewer companies would risk it and those that did find an effective vaccine would sell them for whatever the market would pay - which is a lot more than what they are going for now. By funding the research the governments at least have a claim of hoarding the vaccine rather than letting market participants bid on it. And this would mean millions of not-rich people wouldn’t get it for a long time. At least now it’s based on need and not ability to pay to protect your life and is actually available.')
